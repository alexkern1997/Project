That is the grim message from doctors and psychologists who last week warned that even after lockdown measures had been lifted thousands of individuals would still be suffering.</p> \n  <p>Some of these problems will be due directly to the impact that the virus has had on those it has infected, especially those who went through life-saving interventions in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospital. In addition there will be a considerable impact on vulnerable people affected by the lockdown and isolation.</p> \n  <p>As a result, there is a danger our society could become more anxious and risk-averse, say scientists who have called for a range of research programmes to be launched to understand the issues and to allow society to prepare itself for the physiological and psychological problems that lie ahead.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis has been a national trauma like no other that we have experienced,\u201d said psychologist Professor Dame Til Wykes, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cConsider the terrible flooding we had earlier this year. People watched river levels rise and listened to weather forecasts to find out if they might be inundated the next day or the day after. That was stressful.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut it was nothing compared to this threat which has hung over us for weeks already and is likely to go on for much longer. Spending months looking over your shoulder all the time is going to cause considerable, lasting anxiety for many people. In addition, if you look at other natural disasters, you can usually find help or comfort from people around you. However, it is the people around you that are the threat in this case. So there is no consolation there.\u201d</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/coronavirus-britons-health-problems-covid-19\">Britons will suffer health problems from Covid-19 for years, warn doctors</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead84a58f082b32fdd6c13c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:47:30.560Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Migrants allowed off Italy's quarantine ferry</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>About 180 migrants rescued at sea and held in isolation on an Italian ferry off the coast of Sicily will be disembarked in Palermo on Monday, AFP reports, citing the Avvenire daily.</p> \n  <p>The migrants had been pulled to safety in two separate operations by NGO rescue vessels and placed on the Rubattino ferry after Italy closed its ports due to the coronavirus epidemic.</p> \n  <p>All had tested negative for the virus.</p> \n  <p> Far-right politician Matteo Salvini is to stand trial after he blocked migrants from disembarking from a coastguard boat while he was interior minister last year.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>He had insisted they not be allowed off until a deal was made with the EU over who had duty of care for them.</p> \n  <p>It was not yet known whether the 183 people disembarking on Monday, including two women and 44 unaccompanied minors, would be sent to other EU countries.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:53:57.800Z\">at 3.53pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead841f8f087d47c77881ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:30:57.561Z\">3.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/afghanistan-in-new-battle-against-ravages-of-covid-19\">Civil war, poverty and now the virus: Afghanistan stands on the brink</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:31:05.676Z\">at 3.31pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead81bf8f082b32fdd6c11a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:20:58.734Z\">3.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/scotgov/status/1256589349514285066\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As of 2pm today, 58,833 people in Scotland have been tested for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a><br><br>46,906 confirmed negative<br>11,927 positive<br><br>1,559 patients who tested positive have sadly died.<br><br>Latest update \u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/kZjGNz2EDe\">https://t.co/kZjGNz2EDe</a><br>Health advice \u27a1\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/l7rqArB6Qu\">https://t.co/l7rqArB6Qu</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID%E3%83%BC19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID\u30fc19</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/jJU0Sp8xGL\">pic.twitter.com/jJU0Sp8xGL</a></p>\u2014 Scottish Government (@scotgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotgov/status/1256589349514285066?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ead80128f0806a479811ec5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T14:19:04.212Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters reports on the conservative groups advising the US government that have issued an array of coronavirus economic reopening plans.

They were met with quite an intense response from police, who used pepper spray to disperse more than 100 protesters singing and chanting pro-democracy slogans at a shopping mall in the New Territories.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/galileocheng/status/1256185596873043969\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Police PTUF &amp; QRF1 crushed into New Town Plaza and deployed pepper spray to disperse shoppers and protestors inside the mall <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HongKongProtests?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#HongKongProtests</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NYblHd1r9q\">pic.twitter.com/NYblHd1r9q</a></p>\u2014 Galileo Cheng (@galileocheng) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/galileocheng/status/1256185596873043969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaceb948f0806a479811baf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T03:40:12.742Z\">4.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ABecenti/status/1256424178749550598\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There is a total of 2,307 positive cases and 73 deaths on the Navajo Nation.

But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic, with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health.</p> \n  <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision, announced on 31 January, to stop entry into the US of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. That took effect on 2 February. </p> \n  <p>China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier, and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically.</p> \n  <p>But in her article, Schuchat noted that nearly 2 million travellers arrived in the US from Italy and other European countries during February. The US government didn\u2019t block travel from there until 11 March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S. and tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time.</p> \n  <p>Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings, including a scientific meeting in Boston, the Mardis Gras celebration in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany, Georgia. The gatherings spawned many cases, and led to decisions in mid-March to restrict crowds.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think in retrospect, taking action earlier could have delayed further amplification (of the US outbreak), or delayed the speed of it.\u201d<br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eacbb578f082b32fdd6bd4e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T00:17:42.217Z\">1.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday, Beijing correspondent Lily Kuo published this piece on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/chinas-dining-table-revolution-takes-aim-at-shared-chopsticks\">\u201cdining table revolution\u201d in China</a>, seeking to end, or at least change, the tradition of all-in communal meals, and reduce physical contact and shared utensils.</p> \n  <p>Today Zoe Williams looks at how European cuisine may also struggle to adjust. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/will-coronavirus-spell-an-end-to-the-great-chinese-buffet\">Will coronavirus spell an end to the great Chinese buffet?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eacb8298f087d47c7787d99\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/lois-beckett\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-02T00:01:07.432Z\">1.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as protesters gathered in the capital of Sacramento and in Orange county\u2019s Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after Newsom ordered beaches there to close following a busy weekend.</p> \n  <p>In Sacramento, the state\u2019s capital, a packed crowd of protesters faced off with lines of riot cops in a tense and chaotic protest on Friday afternoon.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTraitors!\u201d the protesters screamed at police, according to a livestream of the protest produced by reporters from the Sacramento Bee.</p> \n  <p>Some protesters held signs questioning whether the coronavirus is real or promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies, while others protested the closure of businesses during the pandemic, arguing that all jobs are essential.

European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an \u201cinternational alliance\u201d fighting the disease.An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. YouTube has deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. Primary schools in England and Wales could reopen for all in June. Children aged five to 11 could return to school from Monday 1 June as part of government plans to gradually ease lockdown measures, the Sunday Telegraph has reported. Italy reports surge in deaths but figure is misleading. Reported coronavirus deaths in Italy rose by 474, after 269 new fatalities were recorded on Friday, but the figures were distorted by late registrations of 282 hospital deaths which had occurred in April, according to La Repubblica newspaper. The daily tally of new infections nationwide was broadly stable for a third day running at 1,900 against 1,965 on Friday. Malaysian authorities have rounded up and detained hundreds of undocumented migrants, including Rohingya refugees, as part of efforts to contain coronavirus, officials said. The UN said the move could push vulnerable groups into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment. Migrants allowed off Italy\u2019s quarantine ferry. About 180 migrants rescued at sea and held in isolation on an Italian ferry off the coast of Sicily will be disembarked in Palermo on Monday, AFP reports, citing the Avvenire daily. UK death toll rises further. Another 621 people are confirmed to have died from the virus in the UK, bringing the total to 28,131 \u2013 just short of Italy which has so far had the world\u2019s second most deadly outbreak after the US \u2013 as criticism mounts over the government in London\u2019s handling of the crisis in the early stages. Spain eases lockdown as people emerge to exercise. As of first thing Saturday, adults across Spain are allowed to exercise between 6am and 10am and then 8pm til 11pm, while the children\u2019s slot is midday til 7pm. The streets are reserved for older people and those who need assistance from 10am til midday and then 7pm til 8pm. Hairdressers in Austria reopen. Austrians visited newly reopened hairdressers, beauticians and electronics shops on Saturday after the further relaxation of its seven-week lockdown. Protective measures remain in place, while bars are set to reopen within a fortnight. Thousands protest in California against lockdown. Amid demonstrations across the state in defiance of the lockdown, California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom promised meaningful adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days which would affect how businesses, including restaurants, can operate. Controversial Chinese virologist dismisses defection rumours. Shi Zhengli, a researcher of bat coronaviruses whose work has been at the centre of an extremely controversial claim about the origin of coronavirus, has reportedly dismissed rumours that she has defected from China. Mick Jagger and Will Smith to perform in India Covid-19 concert. Dozens of international and Indian celebrities including cricket captain Virat Kohli and actor Priyanka Chopra will appear and perform from their homes on Sunday as part of a four-hour concert to raise funds for the battle against coronavirus in India, where the number of cases is surging. Hello, Helen Sullivan with you now and for the next few hours. You can get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan with questions, comments and news from your part of the world. European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an \u201cinternational alliance\u201d fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in \u00a36.6bn in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. The leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Norway and senior EU officials told of how the outbreak had \u201ccaused devastation and pain in all corners of the world\u201d. They wrote in the Independent: This poses a unique and truly global challenge. And it makes it imperative that we give ourselves the best chance to defeat it. This means bringing together the world\u2019s best \u2013 and most prepared \u2013 minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again, while strengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa. The politicians declared their support for the World Health Organisation and backed the recent launch of the \u201cAccess to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator\u201d. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust were also said to be joining forces with the leaders. Funding will be directed to health organisations such as CEPI, Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, the Global Fund and Unitaid. There have been 421 new deaths 4,970 further confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil over the last 24 hours, the health ministry has announced. The nation now has 95,559 confirmed cases of the virus and 6,750 deaths. New cases increased roughly 5.4% on Saturday from the previous day, while deaths rose by roughly 6.7%. On Tuesday, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro shrugged off news that the country had recorded a record number of deaths within 24 hours. \u201cSo what?\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What do you want me to do?\u201d Since Brazil confirmed its first coronavirus case on 26 February, Bolsonaro has continually minimised the pandemic and purposefully undermined physical distancing guidelines. Families in a city just outside Mexico\u2019s capital have protested to demand news about their relatives who have coronavirus and urge for the return of the bodies of the dead after videos showed corpses inside a hospital. One video of the Las Americas general hospital in Ecatepec that was posted to social media showed several bagged bodies on stretchers, some in a small room and others outside lined against a courtyard wall. \u201cThe only thing I demand is that they give me the full body of my son,\u201d Maria Dolores Carrillo told television program Imagen on Friday evening after her son died at the hospital. Ecatepec, a working class city of more than 1.7 million inhabitants outside Mexico City, has registered 407 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 28 deaths, according to data from Mexico\u2019s health ministry. It is among the Mexican municipalities worst affected by the coronavirus. State of Mexico authorities said in a statement that the Las Americas hospital, which is run by the state health ministry, would try to hasten deliveries of bodies to families. YouTube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old former footballer violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. The video service, owned by Google, told the BBC: YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS. Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke\u2019s YouTube channel. The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, who removed Icke\u2019s page from their site on Friday. The Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) claimed Icke\u2019s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30m times and welcomed the move. CCDH\u2019s chief executive Imran Ahmed said: We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke\u2019s channel. However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke\u2019s content (and) need to be removed. It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms. Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk. Icke, the self-described ground breaking author and public speaker, tweeted: \u201cYouTube delete David Icke - the man the Elite are terrified of - after complaint from CCDH. The reason is made-up. Where are you gutless media? Silent or cheering.\u201d Businessman Warren Buffett has given an upbeat assessment of the US\u2019 ability to withstand crises. The 89-year-old Buffett spoke at Berkshire Hathaway Inc\u2019s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which was held virtually for the first time, without shareholders, because of the pandemic. The meeting was streamed by Yahoo Finance. Buffett said the potential impact of the pandemic, which has already had a serious impact on the global economy, had a \u201cextraordinarily wide\u201d range. But he remained optimistic that the US would weather it successfully and cited its emergence from crises such as World War Two and the influenza pandemic a century ago. \u201cThis is quite an experiment,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cI remain convinced ... that nothing can basically stop America.\u201d The annual meeting came hours after Berkshire reported a record almost $50bn billion first-quarter net loss following the market meltdown. Saudi Arabia is to isolate an industrial area of the eastern city of Dammam from Sunday, preventing entry and exit until further notice, to curb the spread of coronavirus, the state news agency has said. Freight shipments will be able to come and go from the area, Dammam Second Industrial City, SPA said, citing an interior ministry official. The decision allows vital factories to operate at a third of their capacity, SPA added. A number of Gulf states have implemented lockdowns in parts of cities where large numbers of low-paid mostly foreign workers live and work in close proximity. Boris Johnson has said that doctors were considering intubating him while he was in intensive care with coronavirus. The prime minister told the Sun On Sunday: It was a tough old moment, I won\u2019t deny it. They had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario. I was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. They gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie. Johnson told the paper \u201cthe bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction\u201d and that he kept asking himself: \u201cHow am I going to get out of this?\u201d He said: It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent. I remember feeling frustrated. I couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t getting better. But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally. Johnson said he was \u201cin denial\u201d initially about how serious his illness was, and that doctors were right to \u201cforce\u201d him to go to St Thomas\u2019s where he spent three nights in intensive care. Here is our inside story of his illness from a fortnight ago. Children aged five to 11 could return to school from Monday 1 June as part of government plans to gradually ease lockdown measures, the Sunday Telegraph has reported. Boris Johnson is to reveal the UK government\u2019s plans to edge the country back to normal in an address next Sunday, according to the paper. It cited plans to ask companies to routinely test asymptomatic staff to isolate those who are infected and allow workplaces to reopen. Whitehall sources told the newspaper that pupils from Year\u2019s 10 and 12 would form the first wave of secondary school children returning to school at a later date, so long as the current reduced infection rate holds. The earmarked date for return of primary schoolchildren \u2013 which will undoubtedly face questions \u2013 is said to be intended to minimise the threat to early development and help parents swiftly return to work. Schools have been closed for the vast majority of children since 23 March, but the children of key workers were allowed to continue going in. Schools in Ireland, which shares a land border with the UK, are to remain closed until September. The Sunday Times reports that the government will only tweak the lockdown this week, encouraging building sites to reopen, relaxing rules on outdoor activities and urging people to cover their faces on public transport. On Wednesday, the education secretary Gavin Williamson said schools across England would reopen in phases, with headteachers given as much notice as possible. The news comes as a new poll suggests that fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The prime minister\u2019s former business adviser Andrew Griffith wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that \u201cevery additional day the phone rings unanswered in \u2018lockdown\u2019 Britain is an order lost to an overseas competitor whose own economy is open for business\u201d, as opposed to the world\u2019s fifth largest economy. Coronavirus deaths in Canada have risen from 3,223 to 3,446, as confirmed cases increased by about 2,000 to 55,572, official data released earlier today shows. Inmates at a prison in Manaus, a Brazilian city deep in the Amazon that has been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak, briefly took seven prison guards hostage earlier today in protest against conditions and the suspension of visits, authorities said. The rebellion came as the coronavirus outbreak overwhelms public services in Manaus, with authorities burying victims in mass graves and warning residents of an imminent shortage of coffins after 357 died from the disease. The inmates rioted to create a distraction as others built a tunnel underneath the prison walls, but police foiled the scheme after raiding the prison and freeing the guards. Dozens of family members had gathered outside the prison complaining of conditions inside the jail, including insufficient food, cells without electricity, and lack of proper medical attention for inmates. Some told Reuters that the spread of the coronavirus throughout the city was making their concerns more urgent. There were no reported deaths. However, 10 prison guards, two police officers and five inmates were said to have been not seriously injured. The UK government is facing renewed criticism after being forced to admit that \u201ca small number\u201d of coronavirus tests sent to homes cannot be processed due to absences of return labels, which include tracking codes. \u201cWe are urgently seeking to resolve this so anyone affected can either be provided with a new label or order a replacement kit online, which won\u2019t be counted in the daily figures,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care told Sky. Earlier today, the British health secretary, Matt Hancock, was accused of changing the criteria for counting Covid-19 tests after he claimed victory in reaching the target of 100,000 a day. Critics said that a large proportion of the 122,000 tests counted on Friday had been mailed to addresses but not yet carried out. Now, however, it appears that some of those tests are useless. Some more cheer! From the former soldier canoeing in his garden pond to a distanced dance to Whigfield\u2019s Saturday Night in Dublin (here\u2019s the original). The exposed, austere islands of the Outer Hebrides, off the west coast of Scotland, carry the beautiful Gaelic name of Innse Gall, or \u201cislands of the strangers\u201d. Against a backdrop of big skies, lonely farmhouses and sandy beaches, physical distancing comes easily here. In small communities, such as those on Uist, isolation and the vast open spaces have preserved the local population from the devastation wrought elsewhere by the Covid-19 pandemic. Like everywhere else, lockdown has been strictly enforced and observed. Travel has been highly restricted \u2013 only lorry drivers and essential workers have been allowed on to the ferries since 16 March. And, as of last week, this archipelago of six principal islands linked by causeways has had no confirmed cases so far. It is this very particular geographic and social profile that has led ministers to see islands such as Uist as the perfect location in which to test strategies to end the lockdown. The notion has been floated by several scientists and endorsed by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, who said last week there was \u201cscientific justification\u201d for piloting measures such as contact tracing to \u201crelax measures at a progressively greater rate\u201d on some island communities before the rest of the UK. So are islanders rushing to volunteer to throw off the shackles of lockdown? Not a bit. In fact some want it to go on even longer. The flamingos which flocked to a lake in Mumbai, India \u2013 seemingly due to a marked decrease in pollution \u2013 have been pictured wading in huddles. Saudi Arabia will take strict and painful measures to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan has said in an interview adding that \u201call options for dealing with the crisis are open\u201d. \u201cWe must reduce budget expenditures sharply,\u201d Jadaan said in comments released ahead of the interview\u2019s broadcast by Al Arabiya TV. No details of possible measures were disclosed. The world\u2019s largest oil exporter is suffering from historically low oil prices, while measures to fight the new coronavirus are likely to curb the pace and scale of economic reform. Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank foreign exchange reserves fell in March at their fastest rate in at least 20 years, hitting their lowest since 2011, while the kingdom slipped to a $9bn budget deficit in the first quarter as oil revenues collapsed. It comes after reports suggested that the scale of the coronavirus outbreak in the kingdom \u2013 which has been under strict lockdown since 25 March \u2013 could be larger than official estimates. The White House has blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying to Congress, saying it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d for the senior member of the White House coronavirus task force to talk about the government\u2019s response to the pandemic in a House committee hearing. Donald Trump, meanwhile, welcomed Mitch McConnell\u2019s move to recall the Senate to Washington despite the office of the Congress doctor reportedly telling Republicans they will not be able to screen all 100 senators for Covid-19 on Monday. The president also called the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, \u201ccrazy\u201d for not recalling the House and moved to remove a health department watchdog who wrote a critical report on the government\u2019s pandemic response. Yemen has reported three new coronavirus cases, two in Aden and one in Taiz province, the national emergency committee has announced, raising the number of diagnosed infections in the war-torn country to 10 with two deaths. The news led the governor of Taiz to announce that he was closing the province\u2019s borders for two weeks, with the exception of supplies of food and other essential goods, in order to prevent the virus from spreading. The deaths were announced on Thursday and the victims were reportedly brothers who died at a hospital in the southern port city of Aden. The virus has now been diagnosed in three provinces in the vulnerable country, in which five years of war has devastated large swathes. The new case in Taiz had been in contact with the southwestern province\u2019s first infection which was announced on Friday, the emergency coronavirus committee said. The United Nations has said it fears the coronavirus could be spreading undetected among an acutely malnourished population with inadequate testing capabilities. An estimated 10m Yemenis are on the brink of famine and many millions more are without access to healthcare. Fighting in Yemen between the Houthi rebels and forces loyal to the exiled government escalated last month despite a ceasefire designed to help the war-torn country focus on containing the coronavirus pandemic. The World Health Organization has said it fears that Covid will impact Yemen severely as the population has some of the lowest levels of immunity to disease compared with other countries. Yemen is also split into rival power centres. On Wednesday the Aden-based government\u2019s emergency coronavirus committee voiced concern that Houthi officials were not admitting a coronavirus outbreak in Sanaa. The group\u2019s health authorities said all suspected cases there had tested negative. The number of people who have died from coronavirus in France has risen by 166 to 24,760, while hospitalisations for the disease and the number of those in intensive care units with the illness continued to decline, the French health ministry announced. It comes after there were 218 new deaths recorded on Friday. Dozens of Rohingya believed to be from one of several boats stuck at sea due to coronavirus restrictions have landed on the coast of Bangladesh, according to a government official. Some of the 43 people who arrived were sent to Bhasan Char, a remote island where authorities had previously planned to house Rohingya, the official told Reuters. Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project monitoring group, said the group that landed on Saturday had likely come on a small boat from one the larger vessels still at sea, believed to be carrying hundreds of people. Hundreds of Rohingya are stranded on at least two trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia, rights groups say. The United Nations has urged authorities to let the boats land, but anti-refugee sentiment is surging in Malaysia. Another boat, carrying hundreds of Rohingya who were starving after weeks at sea, landed in Bangladesh in mid-April. Survivors said several dozen died on board. For years, Rohingya from Myanmar and Bangladesh have fled by boat for Thailand and Malaysia when the seas are calm between October and April. France is proposing to impose a minimum 14-day quarantine on anyone arriving in the country from abroad after the end of lockdown on 11 May. The measure is included in a new law extending the state of \u201chealth emergency\u201d until June 24 to be presented to the French parliament from Monday. The plans mark a serious blow to the country\u2019s tourism industry. The law contains seven articles describing what will happen when the lockdown ends. The quarantine can be extended to a maximum of 30 days. In what marks a deepening of state support for the embattled aviation sector, Germany, Italy and Spain have joined a call by 12 EU governments for the bloc\u2019s executive body to suspend rules forcing airlines to offer full cash refunds for cancelled flights, France has announced in a statement. The dozen EU governments, including Paris, urged the European Commission on Wednesday to suspend rules forcing the crisis-hit airlines to offer cash refunds instead of vouchers for future travel because of the pandemic. French transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said: I\u2019m glad a very large majority of member states are supporting my request to authorise airlines and maritime groups to temporarily use vouchers when trips are cancelled, so as to relieve their cash reserves while protecting passengers\u2019 rights to a refund. An animated musical extravaganza about a group of pop-loving trolls may turn out to be the most important film in recent Hollywood history. Trolls World Tour, which has become a lockdown hit \u2013 notching up digital sales of \u00a380m in three weeks \u2013 has become the focal point of a battle that could forever change moviegoing habits in the Netflix era. With cinemas closed, Hollywood studios are challenging the sacrosanct tradition that multiplexes air films first for up to three months, before their release on other platforms such as pay-TV, DVD and streaming. Instead, they are pushing new films straight to fans at home. One of the UK government\u2019s top medical advisers has said officials \u201cdon\u2019t have enough information yet\u201d to know whether people can catch coronavirus more than once. Deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries said: The WHO (World Health Organisation) position is very similar to the one we would have, which basically says we actually don\u2019t have enough information yet to be very clear on the immune status. We know that some people will have different status. We would normally expect to see some sign of immunity about 10-12 days after an infection, and then a very consistent pattern about 28 days. Her comments come a day after the UK\u2019s testing coordinator said it was encouraging that evidence from South Korea suggested people were developing immunity to the disease. More than 70% of critical care patients with Covid-19 in the UK are men, a new report has found. It showed that men were more likely to die in critical care, with 51% dying in care compared with around 43% of women. Earlier, it was confirmed that the UK death toll from the virus had risen by 621 to 28,131 Something to lighten the mood: how not to put on a mask. In Turkey, the number of people who have died from the virus has risen by 78 in the last 24 hours to 3,336, with 1,983 new cases of the virus, authorities have announced. The total number of cases rose to 124,375, data showed, the highest total outside western Europe or the US, and slightly more than Russia. A total of 58,259 people have so far recovered from the respiratory disease. The number of tests conducted in Turkey in the past 24 hours stood at 36,318, raising the total number of tests during the outbreak to more than 1.1m. Thousands of people in a South African township stood in line for hours on Saturday waiting for handouts of food with physical distancing measures collapsing in parts of the sprawling queue, the Associated Press reports. A five-week lockdown, one of the world\u2019s strictest, eased slightly on Friday, allowing more businesses in South Africa to resume. At least 46 people are reported to have died and 60 have been injured during a prison riot in Venezuela which was said to have been sparked by anger at a ban on inmates\u2019 family bringing them food due to coronavirus transmission fears. Beatriz Giron, director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons, said 46 bodies had been identified after the incident on Friday at the Los Llanos penitentiary in the western Venezuelan state of Portuguesa. However, the country\u2019s prisons minister, Iris Varela, told local media that the incident resulted from an escape attempt and that the prison director had been shot and wounded. Reported coronavirus deaths in Italy have risen by 474, after 269 new deaths were recorded on Friday, but the apparent figures are misleading. Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported that 282 of the new hospital deaths had occurred in April but were only registered today. It follows a gradual declining trend and the new deaths were driven largely by Lombardy, the country\u2019s worst affected region, where there were 329 recorded deaths in the last 24 hours compared with 88 the day before. The daily tally of new infections nationwide was broadly stable for a third day running at 1,900 against 1,965 on Friday. It brings the total death toll in the Mediterranean country to 28,710, the second highest in the world after the US. The UK government will support the aviation industry in \u201cany way it can\u201d, a minister has pledged. \u201cThe aviation industry is both an extremely important one strategically for us as a country and one which employs a great deal of people,\u201d British housing minister Robert Jenrick said in a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s one we want to support in any way we can ... We are very conscious of the challenges it faces.\u201d Jenrick said the global industry was \u201cgrappling with what the longer term demand for its services might be in an age in which social distancing will be important and in which business travel, for example, might be different\u201d. He added: \u201cIf there is more that we can do to help support them through a very difficult period, we will do so,\u201d he said. It comes after it emerged the budget airline EasyJet was promised that green taxes would not be introduced, six months before the company was given a \u00a3600m coronavirus crisis loan with no environmental conditions attached after carriers sought government support amidst the lockdown and travel restrictions. However, there have been calls for governments to use this moment to encourage the aviation industry to be more mindful of its effect on the planet. The organisation that runs the Auschwitz memorial has condemned the appearance at a US anti-lockdown rally of a picket sign bearing a Nazi slogan displayed above the entrance of the concentration camp. A demonstrator attending a rally in Illinois, where hundreds of people protested against the state\u2019s lockdown and social distancing measures, was photographed carrying a sign bearing the words \u201cArbeit macht frei, JB\u201d. The German phrase translates as \u201cwork sets you free\u201d, with JB referring to the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, who is of Jewish descent. Austrians have today visited newly-reopened hairdressers, beauticians and electronics shops after the further relaxation of its seven-week lockdown. The country acted relatively early in its outbreak and closed restaurants, bars, theatres, schools, non-essential shops and other gathering places. It helped reduce the daily increase in infections to less than 1%, and Austria has reported about 15,500 cases and 589 deaths so far. Now, members of the public no longer require a reason, such as shopping or exercise, to justify being outside although bars remain closed till 15 May. \u201cAfter seven weeks in which no appointments were possible, I have the great fortune of having got the first appointment at my hairdresser,\u201d Gertraud Schubert told Reuters as she had her hair cut and coloured at Hair Concept, a Vienna salon which is fully booked for the next three weeks. Switzerland and Denmark have already let hairdressers reopen, but there are fears it could cause infections to resurge \u2013 though protective measures are in place (as pictured below). The New York City police department has dispatched 1,000 officers this weekend to enforce physical distancing and a ban on congregating in public spaces, after 299 new deaths across the state were confirmed on Friday. The NYPD has made 60 arrests and issued 343 summonses related to distancing measures since 16 March. Police commissioner Dermot Shea said violations would not be tolerated after officers clashed with members of Orthodox Jewish communities who had taken to the streets for funeral possessions. \u201cYou are putting my cops\u2019 lives at risk and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, in what suggests that the state has passed the peak of the virus, Mount Sinai hospital health system said it would stop taking new patients from Monday at the small field hospital it helped erect in Central Park. Only eight patients remained at the makeshift hospital on Saturday. Malaysian authorities have rounded up and detained hundreds of undocumented migrants, including Rohingya refugees, as part of efforts to contain coronavirus, officials said. Authorities said 586 undocumented migrants were arrested in a raid in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, on Friday. Armed police walked people through the city in a single file to a detention building, according to activists. The UN said the move could push vulnerable groups into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment. Those detained included young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. Social media posts, including some by Malaysian politicians, have recently blamed Rohingya for committing crimes and accused them of dominating areas of the capital. The xenophobic campaigns have included activists having their names and photos circulated alongside inflammatory accusations, and have injected further fear into a community struggling for food and shelter through the pandemic lockdown. Police said the operation was aimed at preventing undocumented migrants from travelling to other areas amid movement curbs imposed to contain the spread of the virus outbreak, the state news agency Bernama reported. The UN urged Malaysia to avoid detaining migrants and release all children, warning that overcrowded detention centres carried a high risk of increasing the virus\u2019s spread. Florida\u2019s governor, Ron de Santis, announced on Friday that state parks will soon reopen, even as the coronavirus pandemic continued and Death himself stalked the beaches of the sunshine state. The Grim Reaper in question was actually Daniel Uhlfelder, a lawyer and campaigner for public beach access who put on a cowl and wielded a scythe in an attempt to alert Floridians to the dangers of reopening their economy too soon. As footage of a socially distanced interview with a TV reporter at Miramar Beach in Walton county went viral, Uhlfelder told CNN: \u201cWe aren\u2019t at the point now where we have enough testing, enough data, enough preparation for what\u2019s going to be coming to our state from all over the world from this pandemic. \u201cI know how beautiful and attractive our beaches are. But if we don\u2019t take measures to control things, this virus is going to get really, really out of control.\u201d Many people in Britain are likely to suffer from physical and mental problems for several years after the Covid-19 epidemic has subsided. That is the grim message from doctors and psychologists who last week warned that even after lockdown measures had been lifted thousands of individuals would still be suffering. Some of these problems will be due directly to the impact that the virus has had on those it has infected, especially those who went through life-saving interventions in intensive care units (ICUs) in hospital. In addition there will be a considerable impact on vulnerable people affected by the lockdown and isolation. As a result, there is a danger our society could become more anxious and risk-averse, say scientists who have called for a range of research programmes to be launched to understand the issues and to allow society to prepare itself for the physiological and psychological problems that lie ahead. \u201cThis has been a national trauma like no other that we have experienced,\u201d said psychologist Professor Dame Til Wykes, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cConsider the terrible flooding we had earlier this year. People watched river levels rise and listened to weather forecasts to find out if they might be inundated the next day or the day after. That was stressful. \u201cBut it was nothing compared to this threat which has hung over us for weeks already and is likely to go on for much longer. Spending months looking over your shoulder all the time is going to cause considerable, lasting anxiety for many people. In addition, if you look at other natural disasters, you can usually find help or comfort from people around you. However, it is the people around you that are the threat in this case. So there is no consolation there.\u201d About 180 migrants rescued at sea and held in isolation on an Italian ferry off the coast of Sicily will be disembarked in Palermo on Monday, AFP reports, citing the Avvenire daily. The migrants had been pulled to safety in two separate operations by NGO rescue vessels and placed on the Rubattino ferry after Italy closed its ports due to the coronavirus epidemic. All had tested negative for the virus. Far-right politician Matteo Salvini is to stand trial after he blocked migrants from disembarking from a coastguard boat while he was interior minister last year. He had insisted they not be allowed off until a deal was made with the EU over who had duty of care for them. It was not yet known whether the 183 people disembarking on Monday, including two women and 44 unaccompanied minors, would be sent to other EU countries. Reuters reports on the conservative groups advising the US government that have issued an array of coronavirus economic reopening plans. They all have a common theme: Americans should go back to work immediately to halt the economic and societal damage from prolonged lockdowns. The Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus has focused in recent days around the same message \u2013 the need to reopen quickly. The White House did not renew federal guidelines on social distancing that expired on 30 April, and Donald Trump is expected to go to Arizona next week, after a month without travel. Some state and local governments are opening malls, movie theatres, and hairdressers. There have also been small protests against stay-at-home orders across the country. JK Rowling is donating \u00a31m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the coronavirus pandemic. Announcing the financial contribution, which will be split between the Crisis and Refuge charities, the Harry Potter author said the money would go towards helping some of those hit hardest by the outbreak and the impact of the lockdown. The author told of her mixed emotions at having three key workers in her immediate family during the crisis. In a tweet announcing the donation on Saturday, she wrote: \u201cToday\u2019s the 22nd anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, but I\u2019m going to be honest and say that it feels inappropriate to talk about fictional deaths today. Too many people are losing loved ones in the real world. \u201cSo on this anniversary of a great wizarding victory, I\u2019m thinking of the people who\u2019re out there doing their jobs to protect us and our way of life. I have three key workers in my immediate family, and like all such relatives, I\u2019m torn between pride and anxiety. \u201cAs ever in a crisis of this sort, the poorest and most vulnerable are hit hardest, so in honour of the Battle of Hogwarts, I\u2019ll be making a donation of \u00a31m, half of which will go to Crisis, who\u2019re helping the homeless during the pandemic, and half of which will go to Refuge, because we know that domestic abuse has, sadly, increased hugely during the lockdown.\u201d People in Spain will have to wear face masks when using public transport from Monday, the country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced. Speaking on Saturday, as adults in Spain were allowed out to exercise for the first time since the strict lockdown was imposed on 14 March, the prime minister said the use of masks would be compulsory on buses, tubes and trains. S\u00e1nchez said 6m masks would be handed out at transport hubs, 7m would be issued by councils, and 1.5m would be distributed by the Red Cross and other NGOs. He also announced that the government would seek MPs\u2019 approval next week for another two-week extension of the state of emergency, which is currently due to end on 10 May. He said that the success of Spain\u2019s phased emergence from lockdown would depend on \u201csocial and personal responsibility\u201d, adding: \u201cThe key to the de-escalation isn\u2019t just about personal decisions. The key will be tens of thousands of decisions taken at home, on public transport, at work, and in free time.\u201d According to the latest health ministry figures, there have been 216,582 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Spain, and 25,100 deaths. Japan will fasttrack a review of the antiviral drug remdesivir so that it can hopefully be approved for domestic Covid-19 patients a week after Gilead Sciences filing for such approval, the health minister said on Saturday, according to a report by Reuters. The health minister Katsunobu Kato\u2019s comment comes after remdesivir was granted emergency use authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration for Covid-19 on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Gilead Sciences will file for approval [in Japan] within days,\u201d Kato said. \u201cI issued an instruction so that we will be ready to approve it within a week or so.\u201d The Chinese virologist whose work has been at the centre of the controversial claim that coronavirus came from a laboratory has dismissed rumours that she has defected from China, South China Morning Post reports. Shi Zhengli, a researcher of bat coronaviruses, wrote on WeChat on Saturday that she and her family had not fled the country, despite coming under heavy scrutiny amid conspiracy theories that the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in central China where she works. \u201cNo matter how difficult things are, there will not be a \u2018defector\u2019 situation as the rumours have said,\u201d Shi wrote. Chinese state newspaper Global Times said it had confirmed the post had been written by Shi. \u201cWe have not done anything wrong and we continue to have strong faith in science. There must be a day when the clouds part and the sun comes out,\u201d she added. Malta reported just one new Covid-19 infection on Saturday, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases up to 468, according to the Times of Malta. The R number, which is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread, is below 1 according to a health official. \u201cThe R-factor is below 1 and we want to keep it that way,\u201d said Charmaine Gauci, superintendent of public health. \u201cWe have now started easing measures, including the opening of non-essential retail outlets. These will be allowed to open provided they adhere to some conditions.\u201d The single infected patient is reported to be a Sudanese man aged 27. The son of a care home nurse who died in the UK after contracting Covid-19 has said a lack of personal protective equipment is what killed his mother, as the family were forced to say goodbye via an iPad. In an online tribute, Ian O\u2019Neal described Suzanne Loverseed, 63, as a \u201clioness\u201d who gave everything for her children. He wrote: \u201cAt the end, she worked in a care home, with patients dying of this virus. She had no PPE [protective personal equipment] but fearlessly she carried on. That\u2019s what killed her.\u201d It comes amid growing concern about the risks faced by those in the UK\u2019s care homes, with the sector believed to be at the centre of crisis. On Wednesday, the government released figures that revealed coronavirus deaths for both in hospitals and the community, including care homes, for the first time. It added an additional 3,811 deaths for those who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the community since the start of the outbreak, bringing the total number of deaths to more than 26,000. Mick Jagger and Will Smith will be among dozens of international celebrities performing from their homes in a four-hour concert to raise funds for the battle against coronavirus in India, where the number of cases is surging. The country\u2019s cricket captain Virat Kohli, Bollywood actors Priyanka Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan are some of the top domestic names billed to perform or read messages during the event on Sunday. The performances will be livestreamed by Facebook and will pay tribute to workers fighting the pandemic. A trial has begun in the UK to test if blood plasma from coronavirus survivors could help treat those critically ill with the disease. Plasma is a clear liquid that makes up about half of people\u2019s blood volume and carries red and white blood cells and platelets around the body. More than 6,500 people registered their interest for the plasma donation programme, which is being led by NHS Blood and Transplant on behalf of the government. The organisation is recruiting people with the help of NHS data and inviting suitable candidates who have recovered from a confirmed case of coronavirus or had symptoms to donate plasma at its 23 main blood centres. \u201cRecovered patients\u2019 plasma may contain antibodies that their immune systems have produced in fighting the virus,\u201d NHS Blood and Transplant said in a statement. \u201cIt is hoped that plasma taken no sooner than 28 days after recovery from Covid-19 will contain a high level of this neutralising antibody.\u201d Blood had started being collected from 148 people in England so far, the BBC reported, and researchers hope antibodies found in it could become a significant solution in the fight against the virus. Malaysian authorities have defended plans to ease coronavirus lockdown measures next week even as the number of new infections jumped to a two-week high, Reuters reports. Most businesses will reopen on Monday following a six-week shutdown ordered to fight the Covid-19 outbreak, though schools, cinemas and nightclubs will remain closed, along with the country\u2019s borders, and mass gatherings will still be banned. The decision to allow businesses to resume trading has sparked criticism including from members of the ruling coalition that restrictions were being eased too soon. The number of new coronavirus infections as reported by the health ministry rose by 105 on Saturday, the highest daily increase since 16 April. The number of known infections totalled 6,176 and fatalities were at 103. Ireland has extended its lockdown for another two weeks to 18 May, when it will introduce a phased, five-stage exit over three months. The country\u2019s lockdown regime has been much stricter than the UK\u2019s, but Friday night\u2019s announcement offers a clear, step-by-step map out of the lockdown for schools, shops, businesses as well as the global Irish diaspora including more than 300,000 in the UK, many of whom would normally make visits home in the summer. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said while the rise in the death rate from coronavirus had flattened it was still too dangerous to ease the lockdown. While thousands of lives had been saved, \u201cwe have not yet won this fight\u201d, he said, adding that two more weeks of tight restrictions to weaken the virus further were necessary to ensure it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the strength to make a comeback\u201d. Coronavirus was initially described as the \u201cgreat leveller\u201d, but as the virus has spread across the UK and the world, it\u2019s the poorest that have borne the brunt. The Guardian\u2019s front page leads on what it calls the UK\u2019s \u201ccorona divide\u201d, as official data shows people in the poorest parts of Britain are dying from the illness at twice the rate of those in the wealthiest. The new data analysis, which revealed the devastating scale of the death toll in the poorest parts of England and Wales, led to calls for the government to prioritise health funding for the most deprived regions in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis. London\u2019s poorest boroughs have the highest Covid-19 death rates in England and Wales. Nearly a decade after hosting the Olympics, the spotlight was back on the London borough of Newham, which recorded the worst mortality rate in England and Wales with 144.3 deaths per 100,000 population. Here\u2019s my dispatch on the area, where residents say the pandemic has become a stark reminder that the better jobs, housing and quality of life that were promised have failed to materialise. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will hold a news conference on Monday at 9am GMT about the coronavirus, the ministry of foreign affairs said on Saturday, according to Reuters. Abe is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency which runs until 6 May under which his government has asked restaurants and stores to close, and for people to stay at home in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Russia has posted another record jump in coronavirus cases, as the disease continues to overwhelm the country\u2019s hospitals and infect top members of government. Russia posted a record increase of 9,623 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Saturday, indicating the country has still not reached a plateau, with the national tally growing to 124,054. Russia is showing the second-highest rate of spread of the disease in the world behind the US, and the surge has vaulted Russia past Turkey to give it the seventh-largest caseload in the world. Officials say that the actual number of infected may be far higher than government statistics show. Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, estimated on Saturday that 2% of the Russian capital\u2019s population was infected, meaning that more than 240,000 people may have the virus in a city of more than 12 million. That exceeds the confirmed 62,658 cases by nearly four times. Hospitals in the capital are at capacity, with television footage showing ambulances forced to wait for hours or even overnight in order to deliver the infected to emergency rooms. Sobyanin last week also ordered medical students to be mobilised in the fight against disease, with some telling the Moscow Times and other news outlets that they had been coerced into serving at local hospitals. Officially, Russia has posted close to 1,200 deaths from coronavirus, but the numbers are likely higher. In St Petersburg, eight refrigerator trailers used as mobile morgues appeared outside of hospitals this week to handle the overflow, according to the Fontanka news agency. Birds\u2019 seven-week reign in Madrid is coming to an end. By 9.30am on Saturday, the musings of blackbirds, the cooings of pigeons and the hooligan shrieks of parakeets had begun to mix with the rhythmic fall of foot on pavement and the whizzing of bikes. Spain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, one of the toughest in Europe, is slowly being eased, and people are twitchy for the newly-restored privilege of exercise. As of first thing Saturday, adults are allowed to exercise between 6am and 10am and then from 8pm to 11pm. The children\u2019s slot is midday to 7pm, while the streets belong to older people and those who need assistance from 10am to midday and then 7pm until 8pm. Juan Badiola, a 28-year-old teacher, was relishing his freedom as he walked along the streets of Hortaleza in north-east Madrid. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty tough and I\u2019ve been working really hard for weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cMy family is all healthy and OK, but I\u2019ve really missed being able to go out and make plans.\u201d His sister, Ana, was also thrilled to be out even if she can\u2019t yet resume her hobby of climbing \u2013 or see her friends. \u201cBeing able to get out again is a big deal,\u201d said the 21-year-old student. \u201cBut people need to be responsible.\u201d China\u2019s most populous cities saw an increase in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on the long holiday weekend, according Reuters. The increase in the number of people travelling was led by residents of Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. Reuters reports the number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped 40% on 1 May, the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the tomb sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China\u2019s internet giant Baidu Inc. The increase in tourism was led by increases in travellers from Wuhan, Beijing, Dalian, Tianjin and Jinan, with China having eased curbs on travel and relaxed rules on quarantine amid dwindling cases of the coronavirus. Iran\u2019s death toll from coronavirus increased by 65 in the past 24 hours to 6,156 people on Saturday, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV. Reuters reports the total number of diagnosed cases in Iran, one of the hardest-hit Middle Eastern countries, has reached 96,448, he said, adding that 2,787 were in critical condition. Guardian reporters Joan E Greve and Julia Carrie Wong have written the following story on the use of the experimental drug remdesivir. US regulators have allowed the emergency use of the experimental drug remdesivir, which appears to help some coronavirus patients recover faster. It is the first drug shown to help fight Covid-19, which has killed more than 230,000 people worldwide. Donald Trump announced the news on Friday at the White House alongside Stephen Hahn, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, who said the drug would be available for patients hospitalized with Covid-19. The president said the approval represented a \u201cvery promising situation\u201d in the country\u2019s fight against coronavirus, and Dr Deborah Birx added, \u201cI think this really illustrates what can happen in such a short time.\u201d The emergency approval comes days after Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, expressed cautious optimism about the results of a remdesivir drug trial. \u201cThe data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\u201d Fauci said earlier this week. \u201cWhat it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\u201d Spain\u2019s coronavirus death toll reached 25,100 on Saturday after 276 people died overnight, the health ministry said. Reuters reports the total cases rose to 216,582 from 215,216 on Friday. Spain has had one of the worst outbreaks in the world, but is past its peak and gradually easing lockdown restrictions. The lockdown in Lagos, which accounts for more than half of Nigeria\u2019s 2,000 confirmed infections, is due to gradually ease from Monday. Yet the impact on millions, particularly those living on the edge of the city and working in daily informal, labour has been acute. Amid limited government support, an outpouring of hundreds of initiatives has emerged across Lagos, providing food and essential goods. A range of food and aid distribution has been set up by NGOs, private businesses, community groups and local people. Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, officials said, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital Kuala Lumpur, according to Reuters. Authorities said 586 undocumented migrants were arrested during a Friday raid in a downtown area where many foreigners live, a move theUN said could push vulnerable groups into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment. Those detained included young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, rights groups had said. Police said the operation was aimed at preventing undocumented migrants from travelling to other areas amid movement curbs imposed to contain the spread of the virus outbreak, the state news agency Bernama reported. The UN urged Malaysia to avoid detaining migrants and release all children and their caregivers, warning that overcrowded detention centres carried a high risk of increasing the virus\u2019s spread. \u201cThe fear of arrest and detention may push these vulnerable population groups further into hiding and prevent them from seeking treatment, with negative consequences for their own health and creating further risks to the spreading of Covid-19 to others,\u201d the UN said in a statement. Undocumented African migrants, who even before the coronavirus outbreak plunged Italy into crisis, barely scraped, but the lockdown for past two months has made their existence even more precarious. Italy is preparing to reopen some businesses and industry on Monday in a preliminary easing of its virus shutdown. But there is no indication that migrants in Castel Volturno will get back to work anytime soon, and no evidence that the government\u2019s social nets will ease their misery. Rohingya refugees whose relatives, including children, have been stranded for weeks on cramped boats have urged international governments to act before they perish at sea. Two boats carrying about 500 people were last spotted off Bangladesh about a week ago, but are believed to have returned to the high seas. The refugees on board, who were fleeing desperate conditions in camps in Bangladesh, had attempted to reach Malaysia but appear to have been turned away. Bangladesh has also said it will not allow the boats to dock. Mohammed, a father who has lived in the camps in Bangladesh since 2017, when more than 700,000 Rohingya fled a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar, believes his 13-year-old son is among those stranded. His son went missing 51 days ago, but later phoned to say that he would be taking a boat with friends to Malaysia. Mohammed has since seen a video, shared on Facebook, in which he recognised his son onboard a packed boat. \u201cHe looked hungry and he had become very thin,\u201d Mohammed said. \u201cThere is no way to get information about the boat. Whether he is alive or not is totally unknown.\u201d After two and a half years living in the sprawling camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where about 1 million Rohingya refugees are sheltering, Mohammed said he believes his son had become desperate. \u201cHe cannot access education here in the camp. There are no jobs, there\u2019s no available income here for our boys,\u201d he said. He had not known that his son planned to make the journey, he added. Russia has seen another record daily increase with 9,623 new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the total to 124,054. Reuters reports the nationwide death toll rose to 1,222 after 57 people died in the last 24 hours, Russia\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said, after revising the previous day\u2019s tally. About two million Afghans have lost their jobs due to lockdown as the war-torn country confirmed 179 new coronavirus cases, triggered by continued surges of transmission in Kandahar and the biggest one-day rise of infections in Kabul. According to the National Union of Workers and Employees, the political crisis has compounded unemployment in the country. \u201cThe political crisis, security threats, the lockdown of cities and the reduction in international aid strongly concerns us. We want all to pay attention to the situation and the problems,\u201d said Marouf Qadiri, the head of the National Workers Union. The country\u2019s health ministry has confirmed 179 new coronavirus cases and four deaths over the past 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 2,514 and total deaths to 72. Kabul has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new infections as 75 new patients tested positive for Covid-19. The total number of infections in Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area is 692. The city of six million is under lockdown in a bid to contain spread of coronavirus. The western province of Herat, which borders Iran and had the first coronavirus case confirmed there, has recorded 23 new infections. Thousands of Afghan migrants poured back in February and March from Iran. At least 41 suspected patients were tested in Kandahar in past 24 hours, of which 15 were positive. Meanwhile, war continued to rage on Saturday as three civilians were killed in an explosion in Laghman province. United Nations Mission in Afghanistan has said that more than 533 civilians including 152 children were killed in first quarter of 2020. Health ministry spokesman, Wahidullah Mayar has said that the ministry is concerned about spread of coronavirus in war zones. He said the country was fighting with both terror and coronavirus. \u201dYou won\u2019t find any country like us, war is our biggest challenge in order to fight with coronavirus.\u201d Coronavirus has upended life for Morocco\u2019s medical workers. They enjoy better medical facilities than in much of Africa but are often short of the equipment available in European hospitals, which also found themselves overwhelmed, according to a report by AP. Read this brilliant, in-depth report from Guardian US writers Oliver Laughland and Amanda Holpuch on alleged negligence at plants run by some of America\u2019s largest food manufacturers. A north-eastern Chinese city of 10 million people struggling with currently the country\u2019s biggest coronavirus cluster shut dine-in services on Saturday, reports Reuters, as the rest of China eases restrictions designed to hamper the spread of the disease. Harbin, the provincial capital of Heilongjiang and its biggest city, said it temporarily suspended dine-in services for all eateries, reported the official CCTV, citing an emergency epidemic prevention notice. Catering services operating in the city, such as barbecue eateries and those selling skewers, shabu shabu, and stew, must suspend dine-in meals until further notice and in accordance with changes in the epidemic situation, the notice said. While mainland China reported only one case on Saturday and crowds returned to some of its most famous tourist attractions for the five-day May holiday, the northern province of Heilongjiang is hunkering down to prevent further clusters from forming. Of the 140 local transmissions in mainland China, over half have been reported as from Heilongjiang, according to a Reuters tally. Heilongjiang province borders Russia and has become the frontline in the fight against a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic, with many new infections from citizens entering from Russia. The province has already banned entry to residential zones by non-locals and vehicles registered elsewhere. It had also ordered isolation for those arriving from outside China or key epidemic areas. On the back of the outbreak, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, Wang Wentao, said at meeting on Friday that \u201cwe deeply blame ourselves\u201d, according to local media. \u201cWe had an inadequate understanding of epidemic prevention and control,\u201d said Wang, adding that the failure to carry out testing in a timely manner contributed to the clusters. New polling shows pretty extraordinarily high support for the Scottish National party government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the YouGov survey for the Times Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has the confidence of 71% of Scots when it comes to her ability to make the correct decisions in dealing with the virus, with only 23% saying they do not have faith in her judgments. That gives the Scottish first minister a +48 rating overall. There was a high level of cross-party consensus in support of the government\u2019s performance \u2013 three quarters of Scots, including the vast majority of Tory and Labour voters, believe the SNP government is handling the crisis well. As well as 85% of SNP voters, 84% of Liberal Democrats and 70% of both Conservative and Labour supporters are happy with the approach taken by the Scottish government. Just 19% said the virus was being handled badly. This consensus falls apart when assessing the UK government\u2019s performance. Scots are split, with 47% of those surveyed agreeing Conservative ministers have handled the outbreak well and 48% disagreeing. Boris Johnson himself has a net rating of -15. Singapore\u2019s health ministry confirmed 447 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, the smallest daily rise in two weeks, according to a report by Reuters. The increase takes the city state\u2019s tally of cases to 17,548, with 16 virus-related deaths. The ministry said most of the new cases were among migrant workers living in dormitories. The mayor of Moscow says about 2% of the city\u2019s population, more than 250,000 people, have the virus. \u201cAccording to screening tests of various population groups, the real number of the infected is around 2% of Moscow\u2019s total population,\u201d Sergei Sobyanin wrote on his blog, Agence France-Presse reported. Russia has so far reported more than 114,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 57,300 cases in Moscow, which is the centre of the country\u2019s contagion. According to official statistics, Moscow has a population of 12.7 million people but the real figure is believed to be higher. Sobyanin said Moscow has significantly increased testing capacity over the past few weeks, adding the city has managed to \u201ccontain the spread of the infection\u201d due to the enforcement of stay-at-home rules and other measures. But he reiterated that the city was not yet past the peak of the outbreak. \u201cThe threat is apparently on the rise,\u201d he said. Hello, I\u2019m taking over the live blog from my colleague Helen. If you want to get in touch with any tips or comments, you can email me on aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or tweet me @aamnamohdin. A nursing home in New York has reported a \u201chorrifying\u201d death toll of 98 people from the coronavirus as residential facilities continued to emerge as a deadly source of outbreaks across the world. The death toll at the Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan is one of the worst such outbreaks in the United States and caused a shock even in hard-hit New York after an official state tally of nursing home deaths listed only 13 at the home as of Friday. But officials at the 705-bed centre later confirmed that up to 46 residents who tested positive for Covid-19 had died, as well as an additional 52 people suspected to have the virus, Associated Press reported. Some died at the nursing home and some died after being treated at hospitals. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely horrifying,\u201d mayor Bill de Blasio said. \u201cIt\u2019s just impossible to imagine so many people lost in one place.\u201d India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the Covid-19 illness, but allow \u201cconsiderable relaxations\u201d in lower-risk districts. As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country\u2019s National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk. \u201cUse of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,\u201d India\u2019s Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday. It will the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations \u201cto ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees,\u201d the ministry said. Officials at India\u2019s technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people. The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India\u2019s smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google Play Store data. The app\u2019s compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app. \u201cSuch a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,\u201d said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla. New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously. New Zealand has been under a strict lockdown and has seen extraordinary results in containing the virus outbreak. As those restrictions were downgraded to level three, we asked Guardian readers about their experiences. \u201cI was nearly skipping when I got to work,\u201d said Kylie Toka, a fencer from Marton, Rangetikei. I went back to work on Tuesday. It was exciting to start the day with a sense of purpose after five weeks of time melting into itself. It was a little discombobulating to dust off my clothes, boots and tool belt, and hunt out my bag and lunch box. It was so nice to be in my car, music turned up and travelling fast. I was nearly skipping when I got to work. It was exciting to see my work colleagues \u2013 we are a small team of three and we spend long hours working together, arguing and laughing. The first day was very physical \u2013 ripping out a wire fence, moving a cut-down tree \u2013 it\u2019s going to take at least two weeks for my body to get used to the work again. Australian health authorities are investigating possible breaches of infection control at a Sydney aged care facility at the centre of a coronavirus cluster. Of the five new Covid-19 cases in the state over the last 24 hours, two were recorded at Newmarch House, where 13 residents have died. Anglicare Sydney, which runs the aged care facility, confirmed the positive tests but said it had \u201cstrict procedures and enforced infection control practices\u201d in place. More than 60 people \u2013 24 staff and 37 residents \u2013 have tested positive to Covid-19 since the outbreak at the Penrith nursing home on 11 April. Read more here: Medics, funeral workers and gravediggers in Somalia have reported an unprecedented surge of deaths in recent days amid growing fears that official counts of Covid-19 deaths reflect only a fraction of the virus\u2019s toll in Africa . So far Somalia, one of the poorest and most vulnerable countries on the continent, has announced an official total of 601 confirmed cases and 28 deaths. But evidence from medics and burial workers in Mogadishu, the capital of the unstable east African country, suggest the number of deaths could be many times higher. Read more here: The Jakarta Post has reported that a hamlet on the island of Bali has been put under lockdown after rapid testing showed hundreds of residents were probably infected. Out of 1,200 tests, 400 returned a reactive result. \u201cStarting Thursday, Serokadan hamlet in Abuan village is isolated, closed. No one is allowed to enter or leave the hamlet,\u201d said the Bali provincial Covid-19 taskforce\u2019s executive chairman, Dewa Made Indra. \u201cWe have followed up the rapid test results by taking swab samples for further PCR [polymerase chain reaction] tests to get accurate results on whether they are positive for Covid-19 or not. Of course, we will use the swab test results as the final results.\u201d Associated Press: Gun-carrying protesters have been a common sight at some demonstrations calling for coronavirus-related restrictions to be lifted. But an armed militia\u2019s involvement in an angry protest in the Michigan statehouse on Thursday marked an escalation that drew condemnation and shone a spotlight on the practice of bringing weapons to protest. The American Patriot rally started on the statehouse steps, where members of the Michigan Liberty Militia stood guard with weapons and tactical gear, their faces partially covered. They later moved inside the capitol along with several hundred protesters, who demanded to be let on to the House floor, which is prohibited. Some protesters with guns which are allowed in the statehouse went to the Senate gallery, where a senator said some armed men shouted at her, and some senators wore bulletproof vests. For some observers, the images of armed men in tactical gear at a state capitol were an unsettling symbol of rising tensions in a nation grappling with crisis. Others saw evidence of racial bias in the way the protesters were treated by police. For some politicians, there was fresh evidence of the risk of aligning with a movement with clear ties to far-right groups. Prominent Michigan Republicans on Friday criticised the showing, with the GOP leader of the state senate referring to some protesters as \u201ca bunch of jackasses\u201d who used intimidation and the threat of physical harm to \u201cstir up fear and feed rancor\u201d. President Donald Trump, who has been criticized in the past for condoning extremist views, called the protesters very good people and urged Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer to make a deal. Michigan has been the centre of the political showdown over how to contain the spread of the deadly virus without decimating the economy. About a quarter of the state\u2019s workforce has filed for unemployment and nearly 4,000 people have died. Parts of Australia have started easing their restrictions on social activity. In the state of NSW for example, two people could visit another house for the first time from yesterday. In the Northern Territory, some national parks have opened and there is a date for pub\u2019s reopening. Queensland is allowing people to travel up to 50km for recreation. Naaman Zhou has spoken to a few people about what they planned to do with the new (relative) freedom. For Lisa Villani, Friday\u2019s relaxation of restrictions means she can see her friend Deb Mansfield, who is recovering from surgery. Mansfield, 43, is a visual artist and former university lecturer, who now works in the disability sector. The pair met seven years ago and, until the shutdown, worked together at a pottery workshop. \u201cIn some of my toughest times, Deb has been the family in Sydney I didn\u2019t have. She checks in. She delivers baked goods. She sends gifts,\u201d Villani says. Singapore\u2019s health minister says the city state will relax some anti-coronavirus measures after a fall in the number of cases in the broader community. Some businesses will be allowed to open again after 12 May while some schools will reopen from 19 May. Singapore saw cases flare up recently in a second wave as infections rose sharply in its crowded migrant worker dormitories. The postponed Tokyo Olympics are unlikely to go ahead in 2021, infectious disease experts have warned, in a Bloomberg article. \u201cJapan may be able to contain the virus by next year\u2019s games\u201d but other regions like the U.S., Africa or Brazil may not, creating an uneven playing field for athletes, said Norio Sugaya, a visiting professor at Keio University\u2019s School of Medicine in Tokyo and a member of a World Health Organization panel advising on pandemic influenza. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to hold the Olympics.\u201d AFP: Ten years after sinking into its worst economic crisis in living memory, Greece once again faces the spectre of a grave recession in the midst of a global coronavirus lockdown. Though the country has so far been spared the death toll of other European nations at fewer than 150 fatalities from Covid-19, it will not escape the resulting economic downturn, prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis warned this week. \u201cThe consequences of this coronavirus attack will undoubtedly be dramatic,\u201d he told parliament on Thursday. \u201cWe know with certainty that (the recession) will be deep... we don\u2019t know how long the health crisis will last, we don\u2019t yet know if we\u2019ll have tourism.\u201d Tourism is one of Greece\u2019s most important sources of revenue, along with shipping. The Greek state alone could lose 8-10 billion euros ($8.8-11 billion) in income this year, the prime minister said. There were attempts at May Day rallies in some countries yesterday. In Hong Kong, where pro-democracy protests have been a massive presence since mid last year, authorities banned any May Day marches, citing public health regulations. 3,000 riot police were reportedly sent out on the street in anticipation of people ignoring the ban. Lab or organisers appealed the ban, but lost, and so instead went out in two small groups that were 1.5m apart. They were, however, fined by police, according to activist leader Lee Cheuk-Yan. Lee told the Guardian yesterday police stopped them and said because the two groups had \u201cthe same objective\u201d they would all be fined. He accused police of abusing the social distancing laws to stop protest actions. Elsewhere some protesters took to shopping malls to hold small rallies or to sing. They were met with quite an intense response from police, who used pepper spray to disperse more than 100 protesters singing and chanting pro-democracy slogans at a shopping mall in the New Territories. The International Monetary Fund has approved a request from Ecuador for emergency financing to fight the coronavirus pandemic, granting a $643 million loan, the Andean country\u2019s economy ministry said on Friday. Ecuador has been among the hardest-hit countries in Latin America by the coronavirus, with 24,675 confirmed cases and 883 deaths, plus a further 1,357 deaths that were likely caused by the virus. \u201cThis financing will allow us to have the necessary liquidity to support the reactivation of the economy, and protect jobs,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. The outbreak there is boosting pressure on President Lenin Moreno to default on $17 billion in debt and devote more resources toward fighting a pandemic that has left bodies in the streets of the country\u2019s largest city, Guayaquil. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose by 945 to 161,703, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. The death toll rose by 94 to 6,575. Malaysian authorities are rounding up undocumented migrants as part of efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, the country\u2019s police chief said late on Friday, after hundreds of migrants and refugees were detained in the capital Kuala Lumpur. Over 700 migrants were taken into custody, including young children and ethnic Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, during Friday\u2019s raid in a downtown area where thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers live, rights groups had said. The operation was aimed at preventing undocumented migrants from travelling to other areas amid movement curbs imposed to contain the spread of the outbreak, Inspector-General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador told state news agency Bernama. \u201cWe cannot allow them to move freely... as it will be difficult for us to track them down if they leave identified locations,\u201d Abdul Hamid was quoted as saying. Those detained would be placed at a single location for monitoring until the movement curbs were lifted, he said according to Bernama. The arrests followed public anger in recent days over the presence of migrant foreigners, particularly Rohingya refugees, with some in Malaysia accusing them of spreading the coronavirus and being a burden on state resources. Malaysia has around 2 million registered foreign workers but authorities estimate many more are living in the Southeast Asian country without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants. The Australian government has urged any citizens or residents currently in Africa to get a flight out as soon as possible, if they can. \u201cWe have no plans to provide evacuation [flights],\u201d it said. \u201cThe government cannot guarantee you access to medical services if the situation gets worse.\u201d World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment. Most African nations are hoping they can slow the spread of the disease to protect their very limited health facilities, which aren\u2019t able to treat large numbers of sick people. US congress has launched an investigation into the conduct of Carnival Cruise Line over its response to the coronavirus pandemic, questioning why the company did not act sooner to protect passengers and staff. Dozens of people have died and more than 1,500 confirmed Covid-19 infections have been recorded in connection with Carnival\u2019s ships, which saw major outbreaks at least nine ships including, the Diamond Princess, the Zaandam and the Ruby Princess. In a letter to Carnival, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure chair Peter DeFazio said the company is \u201cstill trying to sell this cruise line fantasy and ignoring the public health threat posed by coronavirus to potential future passengers and crew.\u201d Referring to an investigation by Bloomberg into the company, DeFazio said the reports suggested \u201cCarnival were aware of the threats to some of its ships and did not take appropriate actions, which may have led to greater infections and the spread of the disease.\u201d In response to the allegations, the company told the Guardian in a statement: \u201cOur goal is the same as the committee\u2019s goal: to protect the health, safety and well-being of our guests and crew, along with compliance and environmental protection. We are reviewing the letter and will fully cooperate with the committee.\u201d The House investigation comes as more than 100,000 crew members remain stranded at sea, some with Covid-19 outbreaks on board. At least 18 people have died. This is a beautiful read from my colleague Alyx Gorman about her very real wedding last weekend, attended by hundreds of family and friends from around the world - all virtually. Covid-19 had already robbed the world of thousands of lives, jobs and freedoms \u2013 but could it give us our dream wedding? No complex travel arrangements, no savings drained. When most people\u2019s realities have been completely upended, getting married on the internet just didn\u2019t seem that weird any more. We could skip the most painful gut churn of wedding planning \u2013 weighing up our love for our friends against the cost of feeding them \u2013 and invite anyone who wanted to come. We just had to act fast. China reported one new coronavirus case for May 1, down from 12 a day earlier, data from the country*s health authority showed on Saturday. The new case was imported, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, down from six imported cases a day earlier. China reported no domestic transmission cases down from six the day before. The NHC also reported 20 new asymptomatic cases for 1 May, down from 25 a day earlier. The total number of confirmed cases in the country has reached 82,875. With no new deaths on Friday, the toll remained at 4,633. Nearly 3,000 crew of a cruise ship belonging to German tourism giant TUI have been quarantined on board after one person tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the company said on Friday. Fifteen crew members of the Mein Schiff 3 were tested after showing mild flu symptoms, with one of them testing positive for COVID-19. All 2,899 crew members would remain in quarantine on board in the ship\u2019s home port of Cuxhaven on Germany\u2019s North Sea coast until further notice, TUI said in a statement. The cruise ship had no passengers on board, TUI added. TUI, the leader in global tourism, has agreed a 1.8 billion euros ($1.9 billion) bridging loan from the German government to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on one of the hardest-hit sectors. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported on Friday 1,515 new known coronavirus cases and 113 deaths, bringing the country\u2019s total to 20,739 cases and 1,972 deaths. The U.S. government was slow to understand how much coronavirus was spreading from Europe, which helped drive the acceleration of outbreaks across the nation, a top health official has said. Limited testing and delayed travel alerts for areas outside China contributed to the jump in U.S. cases starting in late February, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the No. 2 official at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cWe clearly didn\u2019t recognise the full importations that were happening,\u201d Schuchat told The Associated Press. In an article published by the CDC looking back on the US response, Schuchat suggested the nation\u2019s top public health agency missed opportunities to slow the spread. The CDC is responsible for the recognition, tracking and prevention of just such a disease. But the agency has had a low profile during this pandemic, with White House officials controlling communications and leading most press briefings. \u201cThis report seems to challenge the idea that the China travel ban in late January was instrumental in changing the trajectory of this pandemic in the United States,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, assistant professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health. President Donald Trump has repeatedly celebrated a federal decision, announced on 31 January, to stop entry into the US of any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days. That took effect on 2 February. China had imposed its own travel restrictions earlier, and travel out of its outbreak areas did indeed drop dramatically. But in her article, Schuchat noted that nearly 2 million travellers arrived in the US from Italy and other European countries during February. The US government didn\u2019t block travel from there until 11 March. \u201cThe extensive travel from Europe, once Europe was having outbreaks, really accelerated our importations and the rapid spread,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI think the timing of our travel alerts should have been earlier.\u201d She also noted in the article that more than 100 people who had been on nine separate Nile River cruises during February and early March had come to the U.S. and tested positive for the virus, nearly doubling the number of known U.S. cases at that time. Schuchat also noted the explosive effect of some late February mass gatherings, including a scientific meeting in Boston, the Mardis Gras celebration in New Orleans and a funeral in Albany, Georgia. The gatherings spawned many cases, and led to decisions in mid-March to restrict crowds. \u201cI think in retrospect, taking action earlier could have delayed further amplification (of the US outbreak), or delayed the speed of it.\u201d Yesterday, Beijing correspondent Lily Kuo published this piece on the \u201cdining table revolution\u201d in China, seeking to end, or at least change, the tradition of all-in communal meals, and reduce physical contact and shared utensils. Today Zoe Williams looks at how European cuisine may also struggle to adjust. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, promised \u201cmeaningful\u201d adjustments to stay-at-home orders in the coming days as protesters gathered in the capital of Sacramento and in Orange county\u2019s Huntington Beach, a recent flashpoint after Newsom ordered beaches there to close following a busy weekend. In Sacramento, the state\u2019s capital, a packed crowd of protesters faced off with lines of riot cops in a tense and chaotic protest on Friday afternoon. \u201cTraitors!\u201d the protesters screamed at police, according to a livestream of the protest produced by reporters from the Sacramento Bee. Some protesters held signs questioning whether the coronavirus is real or promoting anti-vaccine conspiracies, while others protested the closure of businesses during the pandemic, arguing that all jobs are essential. Almost none of the protesters were wearing masks, according to reporters and photographers at the scene. Top U.S. health official Anthony Fauci will not testify next week to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, the White House said on Friday, calling it \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to have individuals involved in the response testify. The White House issued an emailed statement after a spokesman for the House of Representatives committee holding the hearing said the panel had been informed by Trump administration officials that Fauci had been blocked from testifying. \u201cWhile the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to COVID-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings,\u201d White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. \u201cWe are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.\u201d Fauci\u2019s testimony was being sought for a 6 May hearing by a House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees health programs, said spokesman Evan Hollander. The Washington Post first reported that Fauci would not testify. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been one of the leading medical experts helping to guide the U.S. response to the highly contagious virus that has swept across the United States. Hello and welcome to our continuing global coverage of the pandemic. Global number of infections passes 3.33m and at least 237,943 have died around the world since the pandemic began, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. Top US health official Dr Anthony Fauci will be prevented from testifying to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic next week, the White House has said. The Trump administration claimed it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to have individuals involved in the response testify. Donald Trump is offering an increasingly bleak picture, telling a White House event: \u201cHopefully, we\u2019re going to come in below that 100,000 lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless.\u201d In the US the drug remdesivir has been approved for emergency use to treat virus patients. The FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn clarifies that the drug has specifically been cleared for emergency use on those in hospital. Trump\u2019s threats to reignite the US-China trade war in reaction to the pandemic trigger a sell-off in global financial markets, as the economic costs of the pandemic continue to mount. Against a backdrop of rising tension between the world\u2019s two biggest economic superpowers, share prices resume a downward slide, with the FTSE 100 falling by 144 points, or 2.5%, in London. Restrictions on movement are to continue for several more weeks in Ireland, although over-70s may now leave their homes to exercise. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, says most restrictions will remain until 18 May to \u201cweaken the virus further so it doesn\u2019t make a comeback\u201d. The UK reports 739 more deaths, bringing the total death toll in the country to 27,510. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says 177,454 people have tested positive: an increase of 6,201 since Thursday\u2019s update. Of those, 15,111 patients are in hospital, Hancock says. India has extended its lockdown \u2013 the world\u2019s broadest by population \u2013 for two more weeks, but with some easing of restrictions in areas with few cases. The home ministry says that in view of \u201csignificant gains in the Covid-19 situation\u201d, there will be \u201cconsiderable relaxations\u201d in areas with few or no cases. In South Africa some industries are allowed to reopen after five weeks of restrictions in Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation, which was already struggling with low growth and high debts when the lockdown began on 27 March.Its easing comes after the ratings agency S&amp;P downgraded the country\u2019s credit rating to junk on Wednesday.",

But critics warn this is code for \u201cpicking winners\u201d and a new wave of protectionism.</p> \n<p>It is certainly a very different approach to that of the last two decades, when industry policy has tended to focus on non-sectoral support such as R&amp;D incentives.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You need all the support you can get to get a project up</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Vikas Rambal</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>On Sky News Business, Power said during the immediate post-Covid period Australia needed to embrace high-tech, flexible manufacturing that \u201cattracts a sort of investment we need\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn the early days, post-pandemic, we will have a low dollar, disrupted supply chains which create opportunities for local manufacturing and we will have ample supply of labour from people that have been displaced from industries that will take longer to start up,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Andrew Liveris makes no bones about the need to foster domestic manufacturing: he served on President Donald Trump\u2019s manufacturing council, set up to drive Trump\u2019s agenda of \u201cmaking America great again\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cAustralia drank the free-trade juice and decided that off-shoring was OK.

Rambal, then 33, was the technical expertise behind the Oswals\u2019 new project.</p> \n<p>Together they set up Burrup Fertilisers. Norwegian company Yara took a 30% share as it was to be the main customer of the output of the plant.</p> \n<p>But within days of the ribbon cutting, attended by the Western Australian premier in May 2006, the partnership began unravelling in spectacular fashion. Rambal accused Oswal of diverting funds via the offshore structures, and Oswal locked him out of the offices.</p> \n<p>Rambal sued in the WA supreme court but settled six months later, giving up his 15% share in Burrup for an undisclosed sum, reported variously to have been $70m or $85m.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/politics/oswals-fled-aust-when-game-was-up-court-told-20160711-gq3drk\">drama reached a climax in 2010</a> when Oswal and his glamorous wife, Radhika, suddenly left Australia, three days after the ANZ bank and Yara accused him of misusing $150m of company funds for personal expenses and sought to put the company into receivership.</p> \n<p>Some of those funds are said to have been poured into a $70m mansion in Peppermint Grove, dubbed the Taj Mahal on the Swan, that the Oswals were midway through building when they fled.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3fc0b8d8e1f9a9c5e724eb5b54c08cd44dead2b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3fc0b8d8e1f9a9c5e724eb5b54c08cd44dead2b/0_144_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Oswals\u2019 unfinished $70m Perth mansion, dubbed the Taj Mahal on the Swan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Oswals\u2019 unfinished $70m Perth mansion, dubbed the Taj Mahal on the Swan, was eventually demolished.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lloyd Jones/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The rest, the ANZ alleged in court, had gone into the family trust ($60m), luxury yachts, private plane charters, a chain of vegetarian restaurants in London and other luxuries.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion that Rambal was implicated in the events after he left the company.</p> \n<p>Yara emerged as the owner of the plant, which exports much of its production.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Australia drank the free-trade juice and decided that off-shoring was OK.

Rambal argued he owed less than $10m. The case was settled out of court in 2016.</p> \n<p>The Collie project faltered after Griffin Coal sold its mine to Lanco Infratech which reneged on the 25-year coal supply contract.</p> \n<p>Rambal headed to the WA supreme court, claiming damages of $3.5bn. It was settled in April 2013 for $7.5m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/21/about-800000-australians-lost-their-job-in-the-first-three-weeks-of-coronavirus-restrictions\">Australia likely to experience largest economic downturn since the Great Depression</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But a fertiliser plant remained an ambition and by 2018 Rambal was again talking up a new $4.5bn mega-project, known as Project Destiny, back at the Burrup peninsula near Karratha, where he and Oswal had built the first plant.</p> \n<p>In November 2018 Perdaman announced it had signed <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/companies/energy/west-australia-set-for-43b-urea-plant-after-woodside-gas-deal-20181121-h185dn\">a 25-year binding gas deal with Woodside</a> and the environmental impact statement is now on exhibition.</p> \n<p>The project will almost certainly meet some objections. There have been growing concerns about the impact of emissions from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/06/western-australia-chemical-plants-threaten-40000-year-old-rock-art\">Yara\u2019s ammonium nitrate production on the world heritage-listed rock art at Burrup</a>, thought to be 50,000 years old.</p> \n<p>Whether Perdaman has the financial clout to build not one but two fertiliser plants \u2013 Project Destiny and the Narrabri project \u2013 is difficult to gauge.</p> \n<p>Back at the Covid commission, a spokesman insists the body has an advisory role only, and won\u2019t be deciding on projects.</p> \n<p>Under planning norms, the fate of Perdaman\u2019s Project Destiny rests with the WA government. The Narrabri project depends on whether the NSW government approves the Santos gas project and then the Perdaman project.</p> \n<p>But these are extraordinary times. A full court press can be expected from the federal government and its ministers who continue to champion gas as the answer to Australia\u2019s energy needs.</p> \n<p>In their sights will be the east coast states that have balked at expanding coal seam gas because of its environmental impacts and resistance from farming communities.</p> \n<p>The question those concerned at the direction of a post-coronavirus recovery may ask is whether a commission set up by the Coalition will, while delivering the objectives of ensuring the state health systems have the supplies they need and the supermarkets are properly stocked, also pander to the government\u2019s plan.</p> \n<p>The early signs are the commission intends to pursue a much wider and contentious agenda of opening up the onshore gas industry, fast tracking an expansion of the petrochemical industry and building pipelines across the nation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the Daily Telegraph reported last week that a fertiliser plant in Narrabri being advanced by a West Australian businessman had topped the list of the projects being promoted by the National Covid Coordination Commission, there was some surprise. Vikas Rambal and Perdaman Chemicals and Fertilisers are not exactly household names, and the controversial Narrabri coal seam gas project \u2013 which would provide the cheap gas that the fertiliser project depends on \u2013 is yet to be approved by the New South Wales government. The commission considered fertilisers to be one of the biggest opportunities, along with petrochemicals and methanol, the executive chairman of the Covid commission, Nev Power, the former Fortescue Metals chief executive, told the Telegraph. \u201cA cracking idea,\u201d the energy minister, Angus Taylor, told the Telegraph in response to Power\u2019s touting of the Perdaman project. \u201cI like to think of the other side of Covid-19 as being a gas-fired recovery,\u201d Taylor said. Just why Power has chosen to promote this project in his quest to rebuild the nation is unclear. Rambal has not yet sought planning approval of the $1.9bn project and the only tangible signs are press releases promising 700 jobs and a non-binding agreement with the coal seam gas project\u2019s owner, Santos. Santos is still months away from learning if it has approval \u2013 and that\u2019s a big if. The NSW planning department is yet to make a recommendation. After that it goes to the independent planning commission which has 12 weeks to seek submissions, hold public hearings and make a decision. The Covid commission is also said to have dusted off plans for a west-east pipeline from the North West Shelf that was first mooted in 2018 but rejected by the federal government after a study by consultants ACIL Economics found it was feasible but not the most economical way to increase gas supply on the east coast. The Covid commission\u2019s strong promotion of gas has the potential to give rise to the perception of conflicts of interest. Power, a prominent West Australian businessman, was until February 2018 the chief executive of Fortescue Metals Group, which is heavily involved in a major gas and solar project in the Pilbara in WA. FMG is also building NSW\u2019s gas import terminal at Port Kembla and Forrest has interests in junior gas producer Squadron Energy. Since leaving Fortescue, Power has joined the board of Strike Energy, chaired by his close friend and fellow WA businessman, John Poynton. It is seeking to develop coal seam gas fields around Perth. The company signed a deal to provide gas to a fertiliser manufacturer, CSBP, in 2019. The coordination committee also includes people with links to the energy industry. Catherine Tanna is the chief executive of Energy Australia, a retail electricity and gas supplier, and the former Labor industry minister, Greg Combet, worked as a consultant for the gas industry after leaving parliament, though these days he has returned to his industry roots as the chair of Industry Super. Other members of the associated manufacturing taskforce also have close ties to the gas and petrochemical industry: Andrew Liveris, the former chief executive of Dow Dupont, is also a director of Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco and listed energy and chemical industry service company Worley. James Fazzino is the chairman of the private sector body the Australian Manufacturing Council and a director of APA , one of the largest pipeline infrastructure companies in Australia. Prior to that he was the chief executive of Incitec Pivot, an explosives and fertiliser manufacturer \u2013 which uses gas as one of its major inputs. The task force also includes representatives of the major employer lobby groups, including Innes Willox from Australian Industry Group and Ben Eades from Manufacturing Australia, who have been advocates of expanding gas production, as well as Paul Bastian, the national president of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, which covers workers in the mining and energy sector. Choosing the way out of a crisis Manufacturing now constitutes just 6% of Australia\u2019s GDP while services account for 60%. Other parts of the economy arguably offer a quicker path to returning to economic strength and pose more immediate challenges. And if boosting manufacturing capacity is the key, where is the expertise in renewables, the digital economy or other high-tech areas? Only one commission member, David Thodey, the former chief executive of Telstra, has direct experience in the digital world, while Jane Halton, a former public servant who now serves on the Crown Resorts board, could perhaps offer insights into the tourism sector \u2013 or a portion of it. Paul Little, the former head of transport company Toll Holdings, clearly has experience in transport and supply lines, which will be an important part of the committee\u2019s work. Power did not respond to questions sent by Guardian Australia via the Covid commission. However, a spokeswoman for the commission said it was not the role of the commission to promote individual projects and that the Daily Telegraph had misunderstood Power\u2019s reference to the Perdaman fertiliser plant. \u201cThe National Covid-19 Coordination Commission is providing advice to the Australian government from a business perspective on areas of focus to drive our economic recovery. The commission is not endorsing specific projects. Rambal told the Guardian he knew Power through Perth business circles and because of their common interests in developing businesses in the Pilbara region. \u201cOnce this commission was set up I wrote a letter with a presentation on the manufacturing capacities Australia has. So I approached PMO office as well to make sure we have all the support we need. Because manufacturing is not easy in this country. You need all the support you can get to get a project up,\u201d he said. Rambal said Power wanted projects and people \u201cwith runs on the board and people who know how to do it\u201d. \u201cI will say to everyone they should approach him if they have the capacity. Why not, let\u2019s help each other here,\u201d Rambal said. \u201cHe\u2019s an approachable guy and he\u2019s been mandated with his team to get some projects going,\u201d he said. Recovery mission or de facto industry policy? The National Covid Co-ordination Commission was announced by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, less than a month ago. It does not have any formal terms of reference on its website other than two dot points that say its mission is to \u201cminimise the impact of Covid-19 on jobs and businesses\u201d and \u201cfacilitate the fastest recovery possible once the virus has passed\u201d. According to releases on its website it\u2019s been involved in facilitating the supply of critical medical supplies and ensuring that disrupted supply chains are restored. But in a few short weeks it appears to have morphed into a de facto industry policy department. Insiders told the Guardian members have been talking up the idea of \u201cbuilding national capacity\u201d and \u201creclaiming sovereignty\u201d through domestic manufacturing. But critics warn this is code for \u201cpicking winners\u201d and a new wave of protectionism. It is certainly a very different approach to that of the last two decades, when industry policy has tended to focus on non-sectoral support such as R&amp;D incentives. On Sky News Business, Power said during the immediate post-Covid period Australia needed to embrace high-tech, flexible manufacturing that \u201cattracts a sort of investment we need\u201d. \u201cIn the early days, post-pandemic, we will have a low dollar, disrupted supply chains which create opportunities for local manufacturing and we will have ample supply of labour from people that have been displaced from industries that will take longer to start up,\u201d he said. Andrew Liveris makes no bones about the need to foster domestic manufacturing: he served on President Donald Trump\u2019s manufacturing council, set up to drive Trump\u2019s agenda of \u201cmaking America great again\u201d. \u201cAustralia drank the free-trade juice and decided that off-shoring was OK. Well, that era is gone,\u201d Liveris told the Australian Financial Review after he was appointed last week. \u201cYou need some balance in there that lessens the reliance [on foreign suppliers], and safeguards your basics and essentials.\u201d While all members are well qualified, their very expertise and experience means that there is a potential for conflicts of interest or at least a skewing toward the sectors they know intimately. The spokeswoman for the commission said the NCCC was following \u201cbest-practice arrangements for managing the integrity of its advice\u201d. \u201cRecognising that their expertise and affiliations may expose them to perceptions of potential conflicts of interests, the NCCC is following strict government practice, as applies to ministers and senior public servants, in managing potential conflict of interest in relation to each of the members of the NCCC. \u201cThat includes recusal from discussions where there may be a conflict of interest and written declarations to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet recording their interests and those of their family members.\u201d She said the NCCC had also put in place additional processes to manage potential conflicts of interest, such as commencing each meeting of the NCCC with a declaration of any relevant conflicts. \u201cThese additional processes have been communicated to government. Mr Power is confident that robust processes are in place to avoid conflicts of interest and any potential conflicts are well managed.\u201d \u201cMr Power is confident that robust processes are in place to avoid conflicts of interest and any potential conflicts are well managed, she said. But that may not address the inherent bias in favour of fossil fuels and gas, in particular. Which brings us back to the fertiliser plant. The Oswal link and a long litigation Vikas Rambal is not a household name, though he\u2019s gained some notoriety in Perth over the years, partly due to the activities of his former business partner, Pankaj Oswal, and the messy litigation that has followed in the wake of the two men\u2019s ill-fated Burrup Fertilisers venture. An engineer, Rambal began his career in Delhi working for Oswal\u2019s father in the fertiliser business, but moved to Perth in 2000 to help the son, Pankaj, expand the company\u2019s business. The Oswals arrived on the Perth scene with a bang, cutting a swathe through the Perth social scene, in a city where glitz and ostentatious spending are synonymous with success. Pankaj Oswal was the frontman, the talker, the schmoozer of politicians. Rambal, then 33, was the technical expertise behind the Oswals\u2019 new project. Together they set up Burrup Fertilisers. Norwegian company Yara took a 30% share as it was to be the main customer of the output of the plant. But within days of the ribbon cutting, attended by the Western Australian premier in May 2006, the partnership began unravelling in spectacular fashion. Rambal accused Oswal of diverting funds via the offshore structures, and Oswal locked him out of the offices. Rambal sued in the WA supreme court but settled six months later, giving up his 15% share in Burrup for an undisclosed sum, reported variously to have been $70m or $85m. The drama reached a climax in 2010 when Oswal and his glamorous wife, Radhika, suddenly left Australia, three days after the ANZ bank and Yara accused him of misusing $150m of company funds for personal expenses and sought to put the company into receivership. Some of those funds are said to have been poured into a $70m mansion in Peppermint Grove, dubbed the Taj Mahal on the Swan, that the Oswals were midway through building when they fled. The rest, the ANZ alleged in court, had gone into the family trust ($60m), luxury yachts, private plane charters, a chain of vegetarian restaurants in London and other luxuries. There is no suggestion that Rambal was implicated in the events after he left the company. Yara emerged as the owner of the plant, which exports much of its production. Armed with his $70m-plus payout, Rambal set up Perdaman and began work on his next big project: a $3.5bn fertiliser plant near Collie in south-west WA, announced in 2009. But there were more problems and litigation along the way too. The Australian Taxation office pursued Rambal over more than $20m in unpaid taxes. Rambal argued he owed less than $10m. The case was settled out of court in 2016. The Collie project faltered after Griffin Coal sold its mine to Lanco Infratech which reneged on the 25-year coal supply contract. Rambal headed to the WA supreme court, claiming damages of $3.5bn. It was settled in April 2013 for $7.5m. But a fertiliser plant remained an ambition and by 2018 Rambal was again talking up a new $4.5bn mega-project, known as Project Destiny, back at the Burrup peninsula near Karratha, where he and Oswal had built the first plant. In November 2018 Perdaman announced it had signed a 25-year binding gas deal with Woodside and the environmental impact statement is now on exhibition. The project will almost certainly meet some objections. There have been growing concerns about the impact of emissions from Yara\u2019s ammonium nitrate production on the world heritage-listed rock art at Burrup, thought to be 50,000 years old. Whether Perdaman has the financial clout to build not one but two fertiliser plants \u2013 Project Destiny and the Narrabri project \u2013 is difficult to gauge. Back at the Covid commission, a spokesman insists the body has an advisory role only, and won\u2019t be deciding on projects. Under planning norms, the fate of Perdaman\u2019s Project Destiny rests with the WA government. The Narrabri project depends on whether the NSW government approves the Santos gas project and then the Perdaman project. But these are extraordinary times. A full court press can be expected from the federal government and its ministers who continue to champion gas as the answer to Australia\u2019s energy needs. In their sights will be the east coast states that have balked at expanding coal seam gas because of its environmental impacts and resistance from farming communities. The question those concerned at the direction of a post-coronavirus recovery may ask is whether a commission set up by the Coalition will, while delivering the objectives of ensuring the state health systems have the supplies they need and the supermarkets are properly stocked, also pander to the government\u2019s plan. The early signs are the commission intends to pursue a much wider and contentious agenda of opening up the onshore gas industry, fast tracking an expansion of the petrochemical industry and building pipelines across the nation.",

      "bodyText": "The consumer watchdog was preparing to launch court action against Flight Centre for charging $300 fees to process Covid-19 refunds before the company agreed to end to the practice. Flight Centre angered many of its customers by charging the $300 fee to each person for each element of their trip that was cancelled due to the pandemic and associated travel restrictions. The policy led to absurd situations. In one case, a Gold Coast family were asked to pay $2,100 in cancellation fees to process a hotel refund of $1,600 for their seven-person Disneyland trip. Flight Centre on Saturday announced it will no longer charge the fee if the travel provider cancels its service. In other words, if an airline or tour operator cancels a trip, a customer who booked through Flight Centre will no longer be charged the $300 fee. Flight Centre is applying the waiver retrospectively to any bookings on or after 13 March, according to Flight Centre executive general manager, Allisa O\u2019Connell. \u201cThe decision to waive fees will impact our business, nevertheless we have heard your feedback and we believe this step is the right one for the current economic conditions where stand downs and job losses are a daily occurrence for many Australians,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. On Sunday, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission revealed the change was made in the face of looming court action. ACCC chair Rod Sims said the regulator\u2019s next step would have been to take Flight Centre to court, if it did not change its position. Sims said the company\u2019s decision would allow the issue to be dealt with more quickly than legal proceedings. \u201cThis is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre for thousands of customers impacted by Covid-19 travel cancellations,\u201d Sims said on Sunday. \u201cWe are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.\u201d The sector has been thrown into crisis by travel restrictions. The industry\u2019s peak body has lobbied government for additional support and made representations to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission that stressed the sector\u2019s reliance on giving credit notes, rather than refunds, in the case of cancelled travel. In some cases, the crisis has prompted questionable behaviour from tour operators. Topdeck, the youth travel operator, altered its refund policy and applied it retrospectively in a way that denied customers refunds. Intrepid also altered its refund policy and applied it to past bookings, and told some customers who still wanted a refund to wait three months before asking again. The company says it is not denying refunds and is still working with individuals to resolve their concerns. The ACCC has received more than 6,000 complaints from consumers about the travel sector more broadly, and said thousands more had contacted their local state or territory fair trading agencies. But Sims called for consumers to remain patient, given the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the sector. \u201cWe ask consumers to remain patient and be mindful of the significant pressures on businesses at this time and, where possible, contact the business by email or website, rather than by phone,\u201d Sims said. \u201cThese are very complex issues and may take smaller businesses more time to respond.\u201d The ACCC has previously issued guidance warning the travel sector against changing their refund policies and applying them to old bookings. \u201cTravel providers must honour the terms and conditions agreed to at the time the consumer purchased their flights, cruises, tours or accommodation,\u201d a spokesman told the Guardian last month. \u201cInforming consumers that they have no right to a refund when in fact they do is likely to constitute misleading conduct in breach of the Australian Consumer Law.\u201d",

I can work from home. But the hotels?

The US Travel Association <a href=\"https://www.ustravel.org/toolkit/covid-19-travel-industry-research\">estimates</a> that the industry has lost $99bn since shutdowns started at the beginning of March.</p> <p>Even if states begin to relax their stay-at-home orders, it is unclear what travel will look like before a vaccine is created, which could take up to 18 months to roll out. While there are many people who are eager to leave the homes they have been quarantining for a nice vacation on the beach, there are also many who are worried about what traveling could mean for contracting or further spreading the virus.</p> <p>The US travel industry is closely watching China, where reports of infection have dropped dramatically over the last weeks, but <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-06/travel-demand-is-rebounding-in-china-as-virus-worry-recedes\">demand for flights</a> is at about 45% of what it was before the crisis, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Most of the flights can be attributed to people going back to work and to visit friends and family; the tourism market in the country has not seen as much of a resurgence.</p> <p>The situation looks even more stark for the US, where there has been no increase in demand for air travel \u2013 despite the number of infections decreasing \u2013 because of health concerns and an overall downturn in the economy.</p> <p>\u201cThe [aviation] industry is in freefall and we have not hit rock bottom,\u201d said Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s CEO, in a <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-04-29-01/\">statement</a>.</p> <p>While the airline industry\u2019s numbers may be a canary in the coal mine for how the rest of the travel industry is doing, Maine and the rest of New England are holding on to hope that the economy will reopen by the peak of the season, in late June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cb077f70ca72ef7bf91e319d8fd25d999ac418e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cb077f70ca72ef7bf91e319d8fd25d999ac418e/0_0_3500_2334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A girl sketches on a deserted beach in Old Orchard Beach.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A girl sketches on a deserted beach in Old Orchard Beach.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Snyder/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Massachusetts, communities on the southeastern coast have already seen cancellations or the postponing of major summer events such as county fairs, food and wine festivals and annual concerts.</p> <p>In Nantucket, the former whaling island that is the summer home of some of the US\u2019s wealthiest people, local shops, museums and restaurants are all closed down right as they are supposed to be kicking into gear. The annual Daffodil festival, an event that usually provides an early kick-off to the start of the season, was cancelled as stay-at-home orders continue until 18 May.</p> <p>\u201cIf this lingers on into the summer, that will severely impact tourism.

Both islands, and Maine, are popular with New Yorkers, the state that has the most coronavirus cases in the country.</p> <p>Reopening would have to be a balancing act that prioritizes keeping local residents healthy while making sure tourists can come in to fuel the local economy. \u201cThere\u2019s really no other industry,\u201d DeSousa-Mauk said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 May 2020 to correct a reference to \u201cthe southwestern coast\u201d of Massachusetts, when southeastern was meant.</p>",

Lincolnville Beach has one of the few sandy beaches along midcoast Maine. During the summer, holidaymakers can dine out at McLaughlin\u2019s Lobster Shack or down oysters and cocktails at the Wheel House Beach Bar, housed in the converted wheelhouse of an old sardine carrier boat. \u201cIf I look out the window at the beautiful bay, and if I hadn\u2019t read the news, I wouldn\u2019t know there was anything wrong,\u201d said Irrera. Airbnb had asked renters to cancel bookings until May and while Maine has been less affected by coronavirus and is now beginning the process of opening back up, Irrera is worried about making future reservations and the impact of the shutdown on her community. \u201cI\u2019m OK. I can work from home. But the hotels? They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s losing so much money.\u201d The travel industry in the US as a whole is feeling the severe effects of stay-at-home orders. The US Travel Association estimates that the industry has lost $99bn since shutdowns started at the beginning of March. Even if states begin to relax their stay-at-home orders, it is unclear what travel will look like before a vaccine is created, which could take up to 18 months to roll out. While there are many people who are eager to leave the homes they have been quarantining for a nice vacation on the beach, there are also many who are worried about what traveling could mean for contracting or further spreading the virus. The US travel industry is closely watching China, where reports of infection have dropped dramatically over the last weeks, but demand for flights is at about 45% of what it was before the crisis, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Most of the flights can be attributed to people going back to work and to visit friends and family; the tourism market in the country has not seen as much of a resurgence. The situation looks even more stark for the US, where there has been no increase in demand for air travel \u2013 despite the number of infections decreasing \u2013 because of health concerns and an overall downturn in the economy. \u201cThe [aviation] industry is in freefall and we have not hit rock bottom,\u201d said Alexandre de Juniac, Iata\u2019s CEO, in a statement. While the airline industry\u2019s numbers may be a canary in the coal mine for how the rest of the travel industry is doing, Maine and the rest of New England are holding on to hope that the economy will reopen by the peak of the season, in late June. In Massachusetts, communities on the southeastern coast have already seen cancellations or the postponing of major summer events such as county fairs, food and wine festivals and annual concerts. In Nantucket, the former whaling island that is the summer home of some of the US\u2019s wealthiest people, local shops, museums and restaurants are all closed down right as they are supposed to be kicking into gear. The annual Daffodil festival, an event that usually provides an early kick-off to the start of the season, was cancelled as stay-at-home orders continue until 18 May. \u201cIf this lingers on into the summer, that will severely impact tourism. In Nantucket, it\u2019s basically the primary income source,\u201d said William DeSousa-Mauk, spokesperson for the Nantucket Chamber of Commerce. \u201cOur economy would collapse.\u201d Mark Snyder, owner of The Nantucket Hotel and the Winnetu Oceanside Resort on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, said he has not had to layoff any of his employees, even though his hotel on Nantucket is open only for essential travel and resort on Martha\u2019s Vineyard is closed completely. \u201cWe need to be open late and June and on, otherwise we will have problems,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cIf we couldn\u2019t open this summer, that would be painful.\u201d But money isn\u2019t everything. Compared to Maine, Massachusetts is a coronavirus hotspot: the state of nearly 7 million people has had more than 62,200 cases of coronavirus and 3,500 deaths, many concentrated in Boston. Nantucket and its neighbor island, the even more posh Martha\u2019s Vineyard, have been successful in keeping the virus off their shores, having about 30 positive cases altogether out of its populations of 11,000 and 16,000, respectively. Both islands, and Maine, are popular with New Yorkers, the state that has the most coronavirus cases in the country. Reopening would have to be a balancing act that prioritizes keeping local residents healthy while making sure tourists can come in to fuel the local economy. \u201cThere\u2019s really no other industry,\u201d DeSousa-Mauk said. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 May 2020 to correct a reference to \u201cthe southwestern coast\u201d of Massachusetts, when southeastern was meant.",

In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an \u201cextraordinarily wide\u201d range of possible outcomes. Shares around the world are poised for another torrid week as worldwide cases of the virus creep towards 3.5 million and deaths near 250,000. Despite massive central bank and government intervention, stock markets have been rocked by the continued spread of Covid-19, the plunge in oil prices and Donald Trump\u2019s threats to reignite his trade war with China. Buffett, 89, who has become known as the Sage of Omaha for his investment skill over the decades, indicated that he believed stock markets had not reached the bottom of the current dip. Speaking at the virtual annual meeting of his company Berkshire Hathaway from Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said he had not provided financial support to companies as he did buying Goldman Sachs shares during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing \u201cattractive\u201d enough, even after the recent plunge in the markets.

      "body": "<p>The federal education minister Dan Tehan has capitulated after picking a public fight with the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews about school closures, issuing a statement apologising for overstepping the mark.</p> <p>Tehan provoked fury from the Victorian government early on Sunday after an interview on the ABC where he accused Andrews of taking a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education by digging in his heels about school reopenings.</p> <p>The Victorian government hit back almost immediately. The health minister Jenny Mikakos queried whether Tehan was freelancing, given the prime minister had recently counselled Australians to take the advice of their premier or chief minister about timetables for school reopenings.</p> <p>Mikakos also announced Victoria intended to close a primary school in Melbourne because a teacher had become infected with coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "The federal education minister Dan Tehan has capitulated after picking a public fight with the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews about school closures, issuing a statement apologising for overstepping the mark. Tehan provoked fury from the Victorian government early on Sunday after an interview on the ABC where he accused Andrews of taking a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education by digging in his heels about school reopenings. The Victorian government hit back almost immediately. The health minister Jenny Mikakos queried whether Tehan was freelancing, given the prime minister had recently counselled Australians to take the advice of their premier or chief minister about timetables for school reopenings. Mikakos also announced Victoria intended to close a primary school in Melbourne because a teacher had become infected with coronavirus. She said the Meadowglen primary school in Epping would be closed for three days at the start of the week to allow the school to be cleaned and to facilitate contact tracing. Mikakos told reporters Victoria was very confident about its public health strategy. \u201cWe look forward to the prime minister coming out today and explaining whether Dan Tehan\u2019s comments reflect the position of his government,\u201d Mikakos said. \u201cI think Victorians understand who\u2019s been leading the effort in Victoria, how to keep them safe, to suppress the number of cases that we\u2019re seeing in Victoria, and that\u2019s certainly not been Dan Tehan.\u201d The eruption began when Tehan used the ABC interview on Sunday morning to try and ratchet up public pressure on Victoria to reopen schools, declaring the national cabinet was failing to deliver progress \u201cbecause we have one premier in particular who is jeopardising the national consensus on this\u201d. Sunday\u2019s public stand-off was the most significant argument inside the national cabinet since disputes in late March, when the premiers of New South Wales and Victoria moved to accelerate the pace of lockdowns of non-essential services. Morrison has been frustrated for several weeks about persistent school closures, believing that education unions are behind the resistance. Opening schools is important to transitioning Australia past the economic shock of the coronavirus, because parents are struggling to work because of having to supervise their children\u2019s distance learning. Tehan said initially on Sunday: \u201cOur national medical advice has been consistent right throughout this: it\u2019s safe for schools to open and it\u2019s safe for teachers to be in the classroom when the right protocols are in place.\u201d Tehan said other state leaders had flagged plans to reopen schools over the coming few weeks, so it was \u201ctime that we seriously call Dan Andrews out on this\u201d. He said two other Labor leaders, Michael Gunner in the Northern Territory and Mark McGowan in Western Australia, were acting in line with the national medical advice. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer Brett Sutton said on 24 April his medical advice was \u201cit should be a mix of learning, that kids should learn at home to the extent feasible\u201d.

As well as Sunday\u2019s jawboning, Tehan has also used other levers at the disposal of the commonwealth to try and force the schools issue. Late last month he wrote to non-government schools offering to bring forward one quarter of their funding if they reopen in term two and half their students return to classrooms by 1 June. But by the middle of Sunday afternoon, Tehan staged a tactical retreat, issuing a statement saying all premiers and chief ministers were seeking to make balanced judgements, in the best interests of their state or territory, on the basis of the advice they have available to them. \u201cNo one wants a situation where students are missing out on their education based on where they live or what school they go to,\u201d Tehan said. \u201cThe academic research tells us that the remote learning arrangements have the potential to result in poorer educational outcomes for up to half of Australian primary and secondary students if continued for an extended period, in particular the vulnerable, poor, remote and Indigenous students who suffer the most\u201d. \u201cIt was those examples I was thinking of this morning during my interview on Insiders when I expressed my personal frustration that more schools weren\u2019t starting more in-class learning in my home state\u201d. \u201cIt was this frustration that led me to overstep the mark in questioning premier Andrew\u2019s leadership on this matter and I withdraw\u201d.

In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an \u201cextraordinarily wide\u201d range of possible economic outcomes.</p> <h2>Global cases near 3.5 million as death toll approaches 250,000</h2> <p>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker there were 3,428,422 confirmed cases worldwide on Sunday, with 243,831 people losing their lives to the disease. The US continues to be the most affected country, with more than 1.3 million cases and 66,385 deaths.</p> <h2>Only 17% of Brits want schools, pubs and restaurants reopened</h2> <p>Fewer than one in five Britons believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the <em>Observer</em>, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-easing-uk-lockdown-require-tough-enforcement-rules\">ease the lockdown</a> soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed.</p> <h2>Half of UK doctors say they have had to source their own PPE</h2> <p>Almost half of Britain\u2019s doctors<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/nearly-half-of-british-doctors-forced-to-find-their-own-ppe-new-data-shows\"> have sourced their own personal protective equipment</a> or relied on a donation when none was available through normal NHS channels, according to a survey.

An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>YouTube deletes conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account</h2> <p>The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old conspiracy theorist David Icke had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/02/youtube-deletes-coronavirus-conspiracy-theorist-david-ickes-channel\">violated its policies</a> on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.</p> <h2>India imposes jail lockdowns as virus spreads in overcrowded prisons</h2> <p>The spread of the coronavirus in India\u2019s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, India\u2019s correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors.</p> <h2>Boris Johnson\u2019s doctors had plan to announce his death</h2> <p>Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he spent three nights in intensive care last month. Britain\u2019s PM told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cThey had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.\u201d Johnson, 55, said: \u201cThe bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.\u201d</p> <h2>Travel within China surges</h2> <p>China\u2019s most populous cities saw a leap in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China\u2019s internet giant Baidu Inc.</p>",

European leaders join forces to combat Covid-19 European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an \u201cinternational alliance\u201d fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. YouTube deletes conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old conspiracy theorist David Icke had violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. India imposes jail lockdowns as virus spreads in overcrowded prisons The spread of the coronavirus in India\u2019s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, India\u2019s correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors. Boris Johnson\u2019s doctors had plan to announce his death Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he spent three nights in intensive care last month. Britain\u2019s PM told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cThey had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.\u201d Johnson, 55, said: \u201cThe bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.\u201d Travel within China surges China\u2019s most populous cities saw a leap in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China\u2019s internet giant Baidu Inc.",

However, 31% of children entitled to free school meals are still not getting any substitute, leaving more than 500,000 children going without.</p> <p>Writing in the<em> Observer </em>on Sunday, Emma Thompson urged the government to prioritise children. Last year, Thompson joined young food ambassadors and the Children\u2019s Right2Food campaign at Downing Street to call for an independent children\u2019s food watchdog to help alleviate food poverty and monitor childhood nutrition. A year later, the government has yet to provide an official response.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to accept, and for some even difficult to believe that there are still children going hungry in this rich and largely competent nation.

      "bodyText": "The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food. New data from the Food Foundation shared exclusively with the Observer has revealed that almost a fifth of households with children have been unable to access enough food in the past five weeks, with meals being skipped and children not getting enough to eat as already vulnerable families battle isolation and a loss of income. The strain on larger families, single parent homes and those with disabled children has been immense. A reported 30% of lone parents and 46% of parents with a disabled child are facing food insecurity and finding it difficult to manage basic nutritional needs at home. With schools no longer providing a reprieve for children reliant on free breakfast clubs and school lunches, poorer families are at crisis point. A government scheme to give pupils food vouchers worth \u00a315 a week until schools reopen has been beset with problems, with many parents unable to download the vouchers or redeem them in supermarkets. According to the Food Foundation, of the 621,000 children who were accessing free breakfast clubs before the pandemic, only 136,000 are being provided with an alternative. However, 31% of children entitled to free school meals are still not getting any substitute, leaving more than 500,000 children going without. Writing in the Observer on Sunday, Emma Thompson urged the government to prioritise children. Last year, Thompson joined young food ambassadors and the Children\u2019s Right2Food campaign at Downing Street to call for an independent children\u2019s food watchdog to help alleviate food poverty and monitor childhood nutrition. A year later, the government has yet to provide an official response. \u201cIt is difficult to accept, and for some even difficult to believe that there are still children going hungry in this rich and largely competent nation. But there are millions,\u201d writes Thompson. \u201cWhat is undeniable is that our government has yet to extend real lifelines to those who cannot afford food. We need emergency income support to put money in the pockets of families who are suffering.\u201d Food banks have been overwhelmed with demand during the lockdown. Last Friday, the Trussell Trust reported an 81% increase in people needing support from its food banks at the end of March compared with the same period last year. Demand from children for food-bank services had also increased by 121%.

Official data next week is expected to show well over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/uk-records-4343-care-home-coronavirus-deaths-in-a-fortnight\">5,000 care home deaths</a> in total. However, unions are also warning that money has been stripped out of the care home sector for years in profits, leaving it underfunded and ill-prepared.</p> <p>Senior figures are now calling for more spare NHS equipment to be deployed to care homes where possible. \u201cWe needed the capacity in the NHS, but we also needed the NHS to reach into care homes. We needed homes to be able to do things like ventilator care,\u201d said Martin Green, chief executive of Care England.</p> <p>\u201cThere are these new Nightingale hospitals and that\u2019s fine, but one of the things I would have expected them to do was to say, \u2018the NHS is going to have a really big role in supporting homes. We will have to put ventilators into care homes. In effect, we will have to turn some beds in care homes into mobile ICUs for the duration of the pandemic\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe secretary of state said care homes had been a top priority since the start of the pandemic, all I can say to him is, it didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Having access to the right medical expertise would have been enormously helpful. It would still be helpful now.</p> <footer> <cite>Vic Rayner, National Care Forum</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, said there should have been more medical expertise available to homes earlier on in the pandemic. \u201cIt would have helped to learn about the trajectory and early signs,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is evidence that the virus manifests in a different way in older people, such as drops in oxygen levels, so having the right equipment in homes to monitor those things and having access to the right medical expertise, either on a call or getting someone to come out to help, would probably have been enormously helpful. It would absolutely still be helpful now.</p> <p>\u201cHealth and care is supposed to be an integrated partnership, and this has not felt that way. Let\u2019s make sure, whatever has happened, that we\u2019ve learned and move on at pace. The depressing thing is that it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve managed to get the right support at scale.\u201d</p> <p>Pavan Dhaliwal, from one of the biggest care providers, MHA, said regular mass-testing must now be the aim. \u201cStaff members with symptoms are not coming to work, so any new outbreaks must be coming from staff who are asymptomatic,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to test them is absurd. We also need to be given saliva tests for residents with dementia. Administering swab tests for people living with the condition is not easy. There must be a different way.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, unions have raised concerns about the way that money has been squeezed out of the social care system by corporate owners, leaving it ill-equipped for the pandemic. \u201cCare shouldn\u2019t be about profit, but that\u2019s sadly the model that\u2019s developed in the UK,\u201d said Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea.</p> <p>\u201cOften financed by shadowy private equity or inscrutable hedge funds, care home companies have precariously high levels of debt. Too often, millions that should be spent on care are being squirrelled away into offshore tax havens.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/total-of-care-home-deaths-likely-to-go-up-says-top-health-official\">Care home death toll likely to go up, says top health official</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen the pandemic passes, this must all change.

It\u2019s very easy to make a swipe at investors, but there has been no government investment in new services for the last 30 years in the social care sector.\u201d</p> <h2>Case studies</h2> <h2> <br></h2> <p><strong>Robert Ford, 80, Plymouth</strong></p> <p>My wife\u2019s been in a home since August and I\u2019m so worried. I\u2019ve been desperately trying to get her home, she cries on the phone now I can\u2019t see her every other day, begging me to get her out. If she gets coronavirus, I\u2019ll never see her again. We just want to be together at home so we can have some happiness again and have these few years left we have together. </p> <p>My wife, who\u2019s 87, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 2016. She has a very short-term memory and is quite OCD, but we could manage. She has a temper and kicked off with carers coming to the home before, but she has mellowed now and I\u2019ve got neighbours and people who said they could help.</p> <p>This situation is dragging us both down. I have no one to talk to but these four walls and a little dog. The care staff at the home are wonderful, but we need each other. If one of us gets it, we\u2019ll die together.</p> <p><strong>Katie Foxcroft, 19, care home worker, Burnley</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve been working at a private, family-run care home in Accrington for about a year and a half now. I do evening shifts and go to college in the day to study for my health and social work degree.</p> <p>It\u2019s really upsetting for the residents right now. They can\u2019t see their families and a lot of them don\u2019t understand why. You just have to do your best to calm them down and look after them. </p> <p>I was really worried at the beginning of the outbreak, but the public have been donating PPE to us so we have that covered. Luckily we haven\u2019t had any cases of coronavirus, but we\u2019re vigilant. It\u2019s a hard job. I do love it, but I\u2019m paid just under \u00a37 an hour and it feels that we carers are so unappreciated by the government. I don\u2019t feel valued, no.</p> <p>We see what others don\u2019t \u2013 we are there for your mum, grandma or relative when they need us the most. We lift their spirits, we bath them, help them with supper and bed and check in on them or give them space when they need it.</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, care home owner</strong></p> <p>I own and run a dementia care home with 20 residential beds in the south of England. After seeing what happened elsewhere, we went into early lockdown at the end of February, more than three weeks before the government instructed us to do so. We kept two beds free to facilitate full quarantine if needed and decided not to admit additional residents unless it was 100% safe. I also sourced PPE independently.

      "bodyText": "A failure to provide care homes with enough NHS expertise and hospital equipment has exacerbated the growing coronavirus crisis among their residents, senior care figures have warned. Thousands of deaths within homes have come alongside spare intensive care capacity in hospitals, raising concerns in the social care sector that resources have been misallocated. It has also prompted scepticism within the sector over claims from Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, that the threat to care homes had been \u201cflagged\u201d since the start of the pandemic. Care home owners are now warning that the sector is still some way off a peak in cases, unlike the country as a whole. Official data next week is expected to show well over 5,000 care home deaths in total. However, unions are also warning that money has been stripped out of the care home sector for years in profits, leaving it underfunded and ill-prepared. Senior figures are now calling for more spare NHS equipment to be deployed to care homes where possible. \u201cWe needed the capacity in the NHS, but we also needed the NHS to reach into care homes. We needed homes to be able to do things like ventilator care,\u201d said Martin Green, chief executive of Care England. \u201cThere are these new Nightingale hospitals and that\u2019s fine, but one of the things I would have expected them to do was to say, \u2018the NHS is going to have a really big role in supporting homes. We will have to put ventilators into care homes. In effect, we will have to turn some beds in care homes into mobile ICUs for the duration of the pandemic\u2019. \u201cThe secretary of state said care homes had been a top priority since the start of the pandemic, all I can say to him is, it didn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, said there should have been more medical expertise available to homes earlier on in the pandemic. \u201cIt would have helped to learn about the trajectory and early signs,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is evidence that the virus manifests in a different way in older people, such as drops in oxygen levels, so having the right equipment in homes to monitor those things and having access to the right medical expertise, either on a call or getting someone to come out to help, would probably have been enormously helpful. It would absolutely still be helpful now. \u201cHealth and care is supposed to be an integrated partnership, and this has not felt that way. Let\u2019s make sure, whatever has happened, that we\u2019ve learned and move on at pace. The depressing thing is that it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve managed to get the right support at scale.\u201d Pavan Dhaliwal, from one of the biggest care providers, MHA, said regular mass-testing must now be the aim. \u201cStaff members with symptoms are not coming to work, so any new outbreaks must be coming from staff who are asymptomatic,\u201d she said. \u201cNot to test them is absurd. We also need to be given saliva tests for residents with dementia. Administering swab tests for people living with the condition is not easy. There must be a different way.\u201d Meanwhile, unions have raised concerns about the way that money has been squeezed out of the social care system by corporate owners, leaving it ill-equipped for the pandemic. \u201cCare shouldn\u2019t be about profit, but that\u2019s sadly the model that\u2019s developed in the UK,\u201d said Unison assistant general secretary Christina McAnea. \u201cOften financed by shadowy private equity or inscrutable hedge funds, care home companies have precariously high levels of debt. Too often, millions that should be spent on care are being squirrelled away into offshore tax havens. \u201cWhen the pandemic passes, this must all change. We have to ditch the idea that care can be run for profit, fund the sector properly and give its dedicated staff a long overdue and handsome pay rise.\u201d A report last year by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest suggested that as much as \u00a31.5bn a year was \u201cleaking\u201d from the care sector in the form of rent, profit, directors\u2019 fees and debt repayments, rather than being spent on the care of residents. Green defended the industry against accusations of profiteering last week, saying that corporate providers had spent huge amounts on personal protective equipment. \u201cThese businesses have been putting money in. It\u2019s very easy to make a swipe at investors, but there has been no government investment in new services for the last 30 years in the social care sector.\u201d Case studies Robert Ford, 80, Plymouth My wife\u2019s been in a home since August and I\u2019m so worried. I\u2019ve been desperately trying to get her home, she cries on the phone now I can\u2019t see her every other day, begging me to get her out. If she gets coronavirus, I\u2019ll never see her again. We just want to be together at home so we can have some happiness again and have these few years left we have together. My wife, who\u2019s 87, was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s in 2016. She has a very short-term memory and is quite OCD, but we could manage. She has a temper and kicked off with carers coming to the home before, but she has mellowed now and I\u2019ve got neighbours and people who said they could help. This situation is dragging us both down. I have no one to talk to but these four walls and a little dog. The care staff at the home are wonderful, but we need each other. If one of us gets it, we\u2019ll die together. Katie Foxcroft, 19, care home worker, Burnley I\u2019ve been working at a private, family-run care home in Accrington for about a year and a half now. I do evening shifts and go to college in the day to study for my health and social work degree. It\u2019s really upsetting for the residents right now. They can\u2019t see their families and a lot of them don\u2019t understand why. You just have to do your best to calm them down and look after them. I was really worried at the beginning of the outbreak, but the public have been donating PPE to us so we have that covered. Luckily we haven\u2019t had any cases of coronavirus, but we\u2019re vigilant. It\u2019s a hard job. I do love it, but I\u2019m paid just under \u00a37 an hour and it feels that we carers are so unappreciated by the government. I don\u2019t feel valued, no. We see what others don\u2019t \u2013 we are there for your mum, grandma or relative when they need us the most. We lift their spirits, we bath them, help them with supper and bed and check in on them or give them space when they need it. Anonymous, care home owner I own and run a dementia care home with 20 residential beds in the south of England. After seeing what happened elsewhere, we went into early lockdown at the end of February, more than three weeks before the government instructed us to do so. We kept two beds free to facilitate full quarantine if needed and decided not to admit additional residents unless it was 100% safe. I also sourced PPE independently. Government support in terms of PPE has been woefully inadequate: we have been provided with 300 masks, but we are getting through 50 a day, and we\u2019re directed to suppliers without stock. We have, thus far, remained free of coronavirus, thanks to the diligence of my brilliant team, and the fact that we have made the difficult decision to stop all visitors. We care for residents as if they were in our own family home. We have worked really hard to keep residents engaged and happy with all sorts of social interaction, including virtual group activities with their families, bingo, singing and quizzes. I\u2019ve also started a blog and share photos with families every few days. Regular testing for all my staff \u2013 we don\u2019t use agency workers \u2013 and residents is key to ensure we don\u2019t have any asymptomatic cases. However, we haven\u2019t yet been able to access any testing, despite statements from government that they are available for all key workers.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s once bustling high streets are now eerily quiet, with all non-essential shops closed and thousands of staff furloughed. Many may never reopen as the lockdown accelerates shifts to online shopping, while others will have to find ways to adapt to a radically different retail world of long-term social distancing rules and nervous customers afraid of catching the virus.</p> <p>The British Independent Retailers Association warned last week that one fifth of their members might close for good if footfall is low. Yet some of the big non-food retailers such as Homebase and B&amp;Q are starting to reopen stores, and the British Retail Consortium has issued guidance on how non-essential shops could trade while keeping customers and staff safe.</p> <p>The <em>Observer </em>spoke to five shop owners on one British high street to find out how they are faring and what the future holds for their businesses.</p> <h2>The hairdresser</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681ea2bafb6208729a1aa45f92a97db4b580a79e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681ea2bafb6208729a1aa45f92a97db4b580a79e/0_303_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anne Murray, owner of Mint hairdressers and salon on Ware High Street, which has shut for the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anne Murray, owner of Mint hairdressers and salon on Ware High Street, which has shut for the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hairdresser Anne Murray misses her regulars and the small intimacies that are shared during haircuts at her usually busy salon on Ware\u2019s High Street. \u201cPeople really open up to you,\u201d she says from her home in the Hertfordshire commuter-belt town. \u201cWe\u2019re like secondary counsellors.\u201d</p> <p>Her salon, Mint, has been closed since the lockdown was announced at the end of March. She has been able to furlough the other hairdresser she employs and is planning to use a \u00a310,000 cash grant to pay her bills. But she worries she might be one of the last shops to reopen as hairdressers will struggle to comply with social distancing rules, which are likely to stay in place until at least the end of the year. \u201cWhen you cut someone\u2019s hair, you are rarely face to face,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the physical proximity makes it hard. It is impossible to stay two metres away.\u201d</p> <p>Murray, 37, would consider wearing PPE if it was made available to shop workers. \u201cI would definitely do that in order to protect other people and myself,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut hairdressing is quite a personal service and so it would be very odd.\u201d</p> <p>However, an extended closure could potentially put the salon at risk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of many businesses that could survive for that long unless they are online,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me feel sad and anxious. In my household, it is a major source of income. My salon brings in more than my husband\u2019s business.\u201d</p> <p>She sometimes walks down the High Street during her exercise and wonders how it will look after the coronavirus crisis is over: \u201cIt\u2019s eerie and so quiet. I go past the other shops and can\u2019t help thinking which ones will and won\u2019t survive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/bq-homebase-and-pret-reopen-more-stores-with-safety-measures\">B&amp;Q, Homebase and Pret reopen more stores with safety measures</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The restaurant</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1df582be46ff9dfa6200ba17529aaf59f572f988\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1df582be46ff9dfa6200ba17529aaf59f572f988/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brett Cahill-Moreno, left, and Al Bramley, owners of the Mexican restaurant on Ware High Street, have managed to remain trading by offering takeaways.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brett Cahill-Moreno, left, and Al Bramley, owners of the Mexican restaurant on Ware High Street, have managed to remain trading by offering takeaways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Al Bramley is getting ready for the phone to start ringing with takeaway orders in the Mexican restaurant he launched with his business partner, Brett Cahill-Moreno, in September.</p> <p>\u201cPeople tend to do their own stuff at the start of the week and then treat themselves at weekend. There\u2019s a lot of Zoom parties and quizzes and they tend to buy takeaways for those occasions,\u201d he says taking a quick break, while two chefs prep food in the kitchen.</p> <p>Before the lockdown, the restaurant was packed with diners. Now the tables and chairs are stacked up against the walls. Bramley, 50, and Cahill-Moreno, 47, closed completely for two weeks, with all 10 staff furloughed. But last month they brought back two chefs and two front-of-house staff to provide takeaway meals. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to adapt and change the way we do things,\u201d says Bramley.</p> <p>Last weekend, they had 140 orders and they are hoping to expand beyond Ware. They have even launched an app to speed up ordering: \u201cIt went live last week and we\u2019ve had 650 downloads already.\u201d</p> <p>However, their turnover has halved and they will only be able to keep going if they can secure a long-term rent reduction. \u201cWe are going to have to renegotiate our rent with our landlord,\u201d Bramley says. \u201cI haven\u2019t had that conversation yet, but it\u2019s coming.\u201d</p> <p>Bramley has been thinking hard about how he could lay out the tables in the restaurant to keep diners and staff two metres apart. \u201cWe could do about 25 covers inside. And if the sun is shining, we could do another 30 covers outside,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the takeaway market and a rent reduction, we could just about survive.\u201d</p> <h2>The bookshop</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da114cb66f865f0d31500710e74951c7c78e6c0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da114cb66f865f0d31500710e74951c7c78e6c0a/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Chesterman, owner of the Book Nook bookshop, which has shut due to the coronavirus lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Chesterman, owner of the Book Nook bookshop, which has shut due to the coronavirus lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The tiny Book Nook on Ware\u2019s High Street had not even been open a year before it was forced to shut. The owner Julia Chesterman, 49, had to mark the anniversary with a cup of tea and slice of cake in an empty shop. \u201cI sat down with the bookshop cat and I had a tear in my eye,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a year we have become a little community hub and achieved so much.\u201d</p> <p>Chesterman initially tried delivering books but it wasn\u2019t practical. \u201cI was taking telephone orders and leaving books on people\u2019s doorsteps but to be honest I wasn\u2019t getting enough orders,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s once bustling high streets are now eerily quiet, with all non-essential shops closed and thousands of staff furloughed. Many may never reopen as the lockdown accelerates shifts to online shopping, while others will have to find ways to adapt to a radically different retail world of long-term social distancing rules and nervous customers afraid of catching the virus. The British Independent Retailers Association warned last week that one fifth of their members might close for good if footfall is low. Yet some of the big non-food retailers such as Homebase and B&amp;Q are starting to reopen stores, and the British Retail Consortium has issued guidance on how non-essential shops could trade while keeping customers and staff safe. The Observer spoke to five shop owners on one British high street to find out how they are faring and what the future holds for their businesses. The hairdresser Hairdresser Anne Murray misses her regulars and the small intimacies that are shared during haircuts at her usually busy salon on Ware\u2019s High Street. \u201cPeople really open up to you,\u201d she says from her home in the Hertfordshire commuter-belt town. \u201cWe\u2019re like secondary counsellors.\u201d Her salon, Mint, has been closed since the lockdown was announced at the end of March. She has been able to furlough the other hairdresser she employs and is planning to use a \u00a310,000 cash grant to pay her bills. But she worries she might be one of the last shops to reopen as hairdressers will struggle to comply with social distancing rules, which are likely to stay in place until at least the end of the year. \u201cWhen you cut someone\u2019s hair, you are rarely face to face,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the physical proximity makes it hard. It is impossible to stay two metres away.\u201d Murray, 37, would consider wearing PPE if it was made available to shop workers. \u201cI would definitely do that in order to protect other people and myself,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut hairdressing is quite a personal service and so it would be very odd.\u201d However, an extended closure could potentially put the salon at risk. \u201cI can\u2019t think of many businesses that could survive for that long unless they are online,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me feel sad and anxious. In my household, it is a major source of income. My salon brings in more than my husband\u2019s business.\u201d She sometimes walks down the High Street during her exercise and wonders how it will look after the coronavirus crisis is over: \u201cIt\u2019s eerie and so quiet. I go past the other shops and can\u2019t help thinking which ones will and won\u2019t survive.\u201d The restaurant Al Bramley is getting ready for the phone to start ringing with takeaway orders in the Mexican restaurant he launched with his business partner, Brett Cahill-Moreno, in September. \u201cPeople tend to do their own stuff at the start of the week and then treat themselves at weekend. There\u2019s a lot of Zoom parties and quizzes and they tend to buy takeaways for those occasions,\u201d he says taking a quick break, while two chefs prep food in the kitchen. Before the lockdown, the restaurant was packed with diners. Now the tables and chairs are stacked up against the walls. Bramley, 50, and Cahill-Moreno, 47, closed completely for two weeks, with all 10 staff furloughed. But last month they brought back two chefs and two front-of-house staff to provide takeaway meals. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to adapt and change the way we do things,\u201d says Bramley. Last weekend, they had 140 orders and they are hoping to expand beyond Ware. They have even launched an app to speed up ordering: \u201cIt went live last week and we\u2019ve had 650 downloads already.\u201d However, their turnover has halved and they will only be able to keep going if they can secure a long-term rent reduction. \u201cWe are going to have to renegotiate our rent with our landlord,\u201d Bramley says. \u201cI haven\u2019t had that conversation yet, but it\u2019s coming.\u201d Bramley has been thinking hard about how he could lay out the tables in the restaurant to keep diners and staff two metres apart. \u201cWe could do about 25 covers inside. And if the sun is shining, we could do another 30 covers outside,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the takeaway market and a rent reduction, we could just about survive.\u201d The bookshop The tiny Book Nook on Ware\u2019s High Street had not even been open a year before it was forced to shut. The owner Julia Chesterman, 49, had to mark the anniversary with a cup of tea and slice of cake in an empty shop. \u201cI sat down with the bookshop cat and I had a tear in my eye,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a year we have become a little community hub and achieved so much.\u201d Chesterman initially tried delivering books but it wasn\u2019t practical. \u201cI was taking telephone orders and leaving books on people\u2019s doorsteps but to be honest I wasn\u2019t getting enough orders,\u201d she says. In the end she closed completely and furloughed herself. Even though the shop is quite narrow, Chesterman is confident she could reopen safely. She would probably only need to limit the number of customers on a Saturday morning, when lots of people come in for tea and cake. \u201cWe never really get overwhelmed,\u201d she adds. Chesterman, who used to work for the library service, is not especially worried about reduced footfall. \u201cBookselling can be quite challenging,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not in this business to make a massive profit. I just want to do something that I love and be part of the community.\u201d The estate agent The last time estate agent Jake Shropshire, 49, was in Ware\u2019s branch of Jonathan Hunt was in March. \u201cI was able to rescue my telephone and computer,\u201d he says. Since then the usual buying and selling of property has almost ground to a halt. \u201cThere\u2019s been no property viewings,\u201d he says. \u201cIt has all stopped.\u201d Shropshire is trying to keep existing house sales on track. \u201cWe are nursing along sales as best we can, but 60% of the lawyers we deal with have been furloughed so there are challenges.\u201d There are buyers stuck in property chains containing vulnerable individuals. \u201cWe have one where a person is shielding so everyone else in that chain will have to wait,\u201d says Shropshire. A few are moving, however. He is giving the keys to the buyers of a derelict Grade II-listed house this weekend. \u201cThere is no crossover of people. There is no danger of contamination,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m just going to leave the keys on their doorstep, ring the bell and run off.\u201d While he can ride out rest of the lockdown, Shropshire has some concerns about reopening. Staff will need to be paid but it will take a while for new houses to be marketed and sold. \u201cOur income is not instantaneous. It\u2019s going to be three months at best before any money comes in,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the tough part.\u201d The card shop Cathy Emmerson, 53, decided to close her card shop the day before Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown. \u201cWe closed at the end of Mother\u2019s Day,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got four members of staff and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking them to come to work.\u201d It might be difficult to maintain social distancing when the shop eventually reopens as it is not much bigger than a living room. \u201cWe deal with people directly.

      "body": "<p>If ever a crisis proved that our fates are bound together, it has been the last six weeks. The state has asked many businesses to stand idle to save lives, firms have turned to the state as their guarantor of survival and workers have risked their lives for us all. When we have faced our toughest test for decades as a nation, it has been essential to pull together.</p> <p>Yet we are only at the beginning of the need to recognise the mutual dependence between public and private sectors and our collective solidarity.</p> <p>The effects of this pandemic are arbitrary and catastrophic and no business or worker should have to face them alone. This spirit must carry us through not just the continuing \u201crescue\u201d part of the emergency but into recovery and renewal to build a different economy.</p> <p>The chancellor says he cannot \u201csave every business\u201d, but that should not hide the fact that every business that goes bust because of necessary public health measures represents not just a failure of that business but risks deepening the recession \u2014 and impeding recovery.</p> <p>The lesson of past crises is that at the time governments believe that the danger is doing too much, too quickly \u2013 but the bigger danger is that they do too little, too slowly. Doing everything we can to protect businesses and workers makes sense for the taxpayer because the fiscal cost of lost businesses, unemployed workers and lost tax revenue outweighs the cost of acting.</p> <p>That is why, for example, Labour has led the argument for reform of the government\u2019s loan system to make it work not just for 25,000 SMEs out of nearly six million as it has so far, but for many, many more. It is good that change is now coming. We have also argued for and welcomed the furlough scheme, though there remain significant gaps for some of the self-employed.</p> <p>This week the government will start to provide a sense of our likely emergence from lockdown.

      "bodyText": "If ever a crisis proved that our fates are bound together, it has been the last six weeks. The state has asked many businesses to stand idle to save lives, firms have turned to the state as their guarantor of survival and workers have risked their lives for us all. When we have faced our toughest test for decades as a nation, it has been essential to pull together. Yet we are only at the beginning of the need to recognise the mutual dependence between public and private sectors and our collective solidarity. The effects of this pandemic are arbitrary and catastrophic and no business or worker should have to face them alone. This spirit must carry us through not just the continuing \u201crescue\u201d part of the emergency but into recovery and renewal to build a different economy. The chancellor says he cannot \u201csave every business\u201d, but that should not hide the fact that every business that goes bust because of necessary public health measures represents not just a failure of that business but risks deepening the recession \u2014 and impeding recovery. The lesson of past crises is that at the time governments believe that the danger is doing too much, too quickly \u2013 but the bigger danger is that they do too little, too slowly. Doing everything we can to protect businesses and workers makes sense for the taxpayer because the fiscal cost of lost businesses, unemployed workers and lost tax revenue outweighs the cost of acting. That is why, for example, Labour has led the argument for reform of the government\u2019s loan system to make it work not just for 25,000 SMEs out of nearly six million as it has so far, but for many, many more. It is good that change is now coming. We have also argued for and welcomed the furlough scheme, though there remain significant gaps for some of the self-employed. This week the government will start to provide a sense of our likely emergence from lockdown. There will be sectors that cannot reopen for months. Take the hospitality sector, with over three million jobs. Twenty-five thousand outlets, including pubs and restaurants, are missing out on the targeted grants to cover their costs. Thousands of businesses face an existential threat, with risks to hundreds of thousands of workers. Essential public health measures must be accompanied by economic help. The government must act urgently with a second wave of support, including where necessary an extension of the furlough scheme \u2014 with greater flexibility to enable part-time working \u2014 and it must look again at the gaps in current schemes. There are also parts of our economy which warrant particular attention. One lesson from this crisis is that our domestic manufacturing base matters far more than has previously been acknowledged. This is an issue of national and economic security, and the government should be willing to step in on the right terms. Yet just as our mutual dependence means the state owes responsibilities to support the private sector, so those who get state support owe obligations to the taxpayer. If you\u2019re registered in a tax haven and you want support, you should come onshore. If you\u2019re a multinational and plan to pay dividends to shareholders while claiming government resources, you clearly don\u2019t need them. The public should look back on the support it has given business over this period with pride. That also means ensuring the gains from public support accrue to all of us, and not just the losses. The government should be willing to consider an equity stake in firms \u2014 particularly when there is a compelling economic or environmental rationale. The need for public and private to work together with imagination will also be essential as we seek to emerge from what could be the deepest recession for 300 years. During this crisis we have seen thousands of workers redeployed from sectors that have closed. Let\u2019s learn the lesson of what is possible. We know that the climate emergency is a challenge we can simply no longer afford to ignore. Let\u2019s create an army of zero carbon workers, retraining and redeploying those who can\u2019t work into different industries, from home insulation to wind turbine manufacture to tree planting.

She said cutting transmissions of Covid-19 to health and social care workers had now emerged as a major priority. \u201cHalf of all new infections reported last week were among healthcare workers,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cThis has now become the leading edge of the spread of the disease.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/inquests-nhs-staff-deaths-ppe-shortages\">Lack of protective equipment</a> and clothing may have worsened the situation, she added. \u201cHowever, what is certain is that care workers are still at risk from their patients from whom they can pick up the virus and, in turn, pass it on to their colleagues, to their own families and possibly to other patients. We need to focus on limiting the spread of Covid-19 among health and social care workers as an absolute priority if we want to have a chance of bringing this epidemic to a halt.\u201d</p> <p>This view was backed by infectious diseases expert Tom Wingfield of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cThe numbers show that the rate of decline of new cases is slower in the UK than other European countries and that is likely to be down to transmission occurring within health and social care settings, transmission in the community despite social distancing and, to a lesser extent, chains of transmission that are still occurring within households, especially in larger households or shared accommodation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02d72d7b5ae083697d63e8edf20915cfa7631d36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02d72d7b5ae083697d63e8edf20915cfa7631d36/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A healthcare worker wearing gloves and an apron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Half of all new infections reported last week were among healthcare workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week, researchers at Bristol University launched a major study aimed at finding out precisely how health workers are being infected by the Covid-19 virus. \u201cWe have taken a group of 130 health workers and we are going to test them intensively over the next three months,\u201d said Professor Adam Finn, the leader of the project.</p> <p>\u201cWe will take swabs from them twice a week, take blood samples regularly, and catalogue their symptoms \u2013 in the expectation that some of them will become infected. Then we will be able to find out when they became infected; how that relates to their symptoms at the time; and how it relates to their immune response. We are going to uncover details of the disease\u2019s natural history because none of this information is known in detail. On the other hand, it is vitally important if we are to understand how this disease behaves.\u201d</p> <p>Finn said current modelling of the disease \u2013 although superb \u2013 was based on assumptions. \u201cEssentially, the models are guesswork about the way the virus behaves. To get rid of the guesswork we need to supply evidence about how the virus actually behaves.\u201d</p> <p>A different approach is being taken by another Bristol University group, led by chemist, Professor Jonathan Reid. His team is studying the way the Covid-19 virus is passed from one person to another. This happens when fairly large droplets are coughed up or sneezed out by infected people. However, it is also possible viruses may be spread by much smaller aerosol particles \u2013 although it is unclear if they can carry enough virus to be infectious.</p> <p>\u201cIt is clearly important to find out because aerosols can travel much further than heavier droplets,\u201d said Reid. His team has just constructed a high-containment, automated laboratory containing a device in which clouds of virus-laden aerosol particles can be suspended while researchers alter temperature, humidity, ozone, levels of sunlight and other variables.</p> <p>\u201cIn this way we can study how the virus\u2019s infectivity changes,\u201d added Reid. \u201cThat might tell us if it is affected by heat. If it is there might be some seasonality to this epidemic. We could also get a better idea of how to run air conditioning in hospitals, care homes and public spaces \u2013 in terms of temperature or humidity \u2013 in order to reduce the lifetime of the virus so that exposure to it is reduced.\u201d<br></p>",

This point was stressed by epidemiologist Anne Johnson at University College London. She said cutting transmissions of Covid-19 to health and social care workers had now emerged as a major priority. \u201cHalf of all new infections reported last week were among healthcare workers,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cThis has now become the leading edge of the spread of the disease.\u201d Lack of protective equipment and clothing may have worsened the situation, she added. \u201cHowever, what is certain is that care workers are still at risk from their patients from whom they can pick up the virus and, in turn, pass it on to their colleagues, to their own families and possibly to other patients. We need to focus on limiting the spread of Covid-19 among health and social care workers as an absolute priority if we want to have a chance of bringing this epidemic to a halt.\u201d This view was backed by infectious diseases expert Tom Wingfield of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cThe numbers show that the rate of decline of new cases is slower in the UK than other European countries and that is likely to be down to transmission occurring within health and social care settings, transmission in the community despite social distancing and, to a lesser extent, chains of transmission that are still occurring within households, especially in larger households or shared accommodation.\u201d Last week, researchers at Bristol University launched a major study aimed at finding out precisely how health workers are being infected by the Covid-19 virus. \u201cWe have taken a group of 130 health workers and we are going to test them intensively over the next three months,\u201d said Professor Adam Finn, the leader of the project. \u201cWe will take swabs from them twice a week, take blood samples regularly, and catalogue their symptoms \u2013 in the expectation that some of them will become infected. Then we will be able to find out when they became infected; how that relates to their symptoms at the time; and how it relates to their immune response. We are going to uncover details of the disease\u2019s natural history because none of this information is known in detail. On the other hand, it is vitally important if we are to understand how this disease behaves.\u201d Finn said current modelling of the disease \u2013 although superb \u2013 was based on assumptions. \u201cEssentially, the models are guesswork about the way the virus behaves. To get rid of the guesswork we need to supply evidence about how the virus actually behaves.\u201d A different approach is being taken by another Bristol University group, led by chemist, Professor Jonathan Reid. His team is studying the way the Covid-19 virus is passed from one person to another. This happens when fairly large droplets are coughed up or sneezed out by infected people. However, it is also possible viruses may be spread by much smaller aerosol particles \u2013 although it is unclear if they can carry enough virus to be infectious. \u201cIt is clearly important to find out because aerosols can travel much further than heavier droplets,\u201d said Reid. His team has just constructed a high-containment, automated laboratory containing a device in which clouds of virus-laden aerosol particles can be suspended while researchers alter temperature, humidity, ozone, levels of sunlight and other variables. \u201cIn this way we can study how the virus\u2019s infectivity changes,\u201d added Reid. \u201cThat might tell us if it is affected by heat. If it is there might be some seasonality to this epidemic. We could also get a better idea of how to run air conditioning in hospitals, care homes and public spaces \u2013 in terms of temperature or humidity \u2013 in order to reduce the lifetime of the virus so that exposure to it is reduced.\u201d",

With the same ruthlessly short-term shareholders owning them as those prepared to sell AstraZeneca to the highest bidder, banks know that they must deploy their capital to where profits are high and reliable \u2013 real estate lending. This means that the piping through which emergency credit must flow is atrophied and weak. The chancellor should chair an emergency financial task force with the purpose of driving lending up by the day, to be monitored with the same intensity as we monitor Covid testing. The British Business Bank, embarrassingly minuscule compared with its foreign counterparts, needs immediately to be given the mandate and capital to increase its own lending 10 times \u2013 across the country. Bank shareholders need to declare much more publicly and vocally than they have that they understand the demands being made. Nor can the insurance industry, with funds under management of \u00a31.9tn, stand on the sidelines. The loans the banks make, some with government guarantees, could be packaged in \u201ccover bonds\u201d that the insurance industry commits to buying \u2013 relieving pressure on bank balance sheets and recycling vital cash. Some companies will not need loans but equity investment: the venture capital and private equity industries must transmute themselves from their default role as predators and asset-sweaters to long-term, patient investors \u2013 working with the newly created Future Fund to take generous equity stakes in companies in need. Supporting intellectual capital rather than seeking property collateral should become the new north star of British finance. If there is not to be a terrifying slump, the British financial and ownership system needs a revolution \u2013 and it has to take place in mere weeks. Good people abound, marginalised until now by the predominant culture of wealth extraction. They need to be unleashed. And once we get to the other side, the new systems of engagement and support need to be retained. Good, perhaps, might yet come from all this pain. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>I remember my first experience of boredom as vividly as my first kiss. The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum\u2019s friend\u2019s house, into which she had disappeared. \u201cWon\u2019t be long,\u201d she\u2019d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it.</p> <p>Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag \u2013 minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam.</p> <p>I was in trouble, of course \u2013 but I was not convinced that I\u2019d done anything wrong. Instead it was as though, in putting an end to that desperate boredom, I had narrowly escaped falling off some kind of precipice \u2013 and I knew I would do whatever it took to avoid going over the edge in future.</p> <p>I did not understand then \u2013 two decades before my first conference call or doctor\u2019s waiting room \u2013 that boredom was a fact of life no more avoidable than any other mental state, good or bad. At times, it may even be a dominant experience. Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline, hitting the floor in one\u2019s 50s. But though boredom may be less prominent in middle life, it is still present \u2013 evidence suggests it comes creeping back in your 60s, especially among women.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/480_5600_3782_2270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"illustration of a man lying on his back, one leg bent, a pensive finger at his chin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline again.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a familiar feeling and very common. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a \u201cboom time for boredom\u201d. Most of us are poorly equipped to cope with being shut in our homes indefinitely, even with the internet to distract us.</p> <p>But we should not fear being bored, say psychologists James Danckert and John D Eastwood, the authors of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/out-of-my-skull-9780674984677.html\" title=\"\">Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom</a></em>. Their research has revealed boredom to be widely misunderstood, perhaps even unfairly maligned. Boredom evolved to help us, says Danckert. It signals that we are unengaged, in need of an activity to satisfy us. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing, in a lot of ways. How we respond to it is up to us. I think you can minimise it. But do you want to totally eliminate it? I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d</p> <p>Danckert and Eastwood contend that boredom can steer us towards realising our potential and living full, meaningful lives. They say it communicates an important message that \u2013 in trying to outrun it my entire life \u2013 I had been refusing to heed.</p> <p>What if I stopped and listened?</p> <p><em><strong>Danckert is an Australian</strong></em> cognitive neuroscientist now based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He began studying boredom 15 years ago, a case of \u201cphysician, heal thyself,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a kid, and still into my adult years, I experience boredom, and whenever I do, I hate it. I find it a very frustrating, agitating experience.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. To quote from <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/26/boredom-lively-history-toohey-review\" title=\"\">Boredom: A Lively History</a></em>, by the classicist Peter Toohey, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote in disgust: \u201cHow long the same things? Surely I will yawn, I will sleep, I will eat, I will be thirsty, I will be cold, I will be hot. Is there no end?\u201d In the Middle Ages monks complained of \u201cthe noonday demon\u201d: the personification of acedia \u2013 torpor, alongside agitation \u2013 provoked by the constraints and repetition of their daily lives. And though one could already be \u201ca bore\u201d, it was Dickens who was the first to term it \u201cboredom\u201d \u2013 in <em>Bleak House</em> in 1852. Lady Dedlock complains of being \u201cbored to death\u201d of herself, more than a century before Bruce Springsteen would express the same restless dissatisfaction in Dancing in the Dark. His characterisation of boredom as a frustrated hunger (\u201cI\u2019m just about starving tonight\u201d) evokes Tolstoy\u2019s definition in <em>Anna Karenina</em> of the feeling as \u201cthe desire for desires\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/6331_3977_5348_3210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Couple sitting on a sofa both engaged on their phones\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Boredom is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBoredom is such a fascinating topic, with tentacles that spread into philosophy, anthropology, literature, religion, theology,\u201d says Eastwood, who is head of the <a href=\"http://boredomlab.org/\" title=\"\">Boredom Lab </a>at York University in Toronto. There researchers study boredom from social, clinical and cognitive perspectives \u2013 from shoring up the link with creativity and improving outcomes in education, to better understanding the subjective experience of mental exertion and attention \u2013 with a view to applying their findings in the real world. \u201cBut as a scientist, I wasn\u2019t convinced that everybody was using the term in the same way.\u201d</p> <p>Eastwood became interested in boredom 20 years ago, after observing a seeming \u201ccrisis of agency\u201d among young men he saw in his private psychotherapy practice. They were disengaged, under-achieving, perhaps abusing marijuana or struggling with depression, he says. Eastwood characterises their circumstance as a \u201cfailure to launch into life\u201d, which these men told him they experienced as \u201cbeing chronically bored\u201d. But what was being bored, exactly? \u201cI thought: what is this?\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, he and Danckert define boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of \u201cwanting to do something, but not wanting to do anything\u201d. It is not an emotion, as such, but an ongoing cognitive process where we wish to engage our minds, but nothing seems to satisfy. It is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa.</p> <p>It is this particular combination of lethargy and restlessness that distinguishes boredom from frustration (where a specific desire has been thwarted) and apathy (where there is no desire at all). And though boredom seems to be a risk factor for depression, it is not the same. To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity. \u201cOnly boring people get bored,\u201d goes the aphorism. \u201cI\u2019m highly motivated to prove it\u2019s not true,\u201d jokes Danckert.</p> <p>It is when we fail to act on the signal, or succumb to distractions, that the feeling of boredom becomes protracted and causes us misery. As the Booker prize winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/anne-enright\" title=\"\">Anne Enright</a> wrote recently: \u201cBoredom is a productive state, so long as you don\u2019t let it go sour on you.\u201d It is striking that the predisposition to it is negatively perceived in a way that other personality traits aren\u2019t. Complaints of \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d are often seen as uniquely provoking, Eastwood notes. \u201cThere is this impulse in us to say, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with you, you should not be bored.\u2019 But to simply judge them, I think, misses the point. They know there\u2019s things to do \u2013 but they can\u2019t bring their desires in the moment in line with what\u2019s there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/521_3244_3357_2015/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a girl sitting on the ground looking bored\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some people are better equipped to cope than others. In <em>Out of My Skull</em>, the psychologists compare two astronauts who responded very differently to the constraints and monotony of space exploration. Russia\u2019s Valentin Lebedev, who spent 211 days in space in the early 1980s, failed to be satisfied by the busy work dictated by ground control and, after five months, did not \u201ceven want to look out of a porthole\u201d. As commander of the International Space Station in 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield found purpose even in plumbing repairs.

Hadfield claims to never be bored \u2013 but, Danckert says, it\u2019s more that \u201che just deals with it really very well\u201d.</p> <p><em><strong>In the years after</strong></em> I tore apart Mum\u2019s car, I got better at not being bored, even in testing conditions.

I spent long periods listening to the same music. At a push, I could be alone with my thoughts, observing them with slight indifference, as though they were a TV show that had not yet hooked me.</p> <p>I considered this evidence of my extreme aversion to boredom. In fact, according to Danckert and Eastwood, I may just have developed a good response to it. Though it has not been substantiated by research, they suggest that boredom has been the push for much creativity, innovation and growth \u2013 while simultaneously a source of distress for many.</p> <p>The mistake many people make is seeking to escape the uncomfortable feeling, instead of interrogating what it is trying to tell them, says Eastwood. They may distract themselves with social media, or worse: boredom has also been shown to be a factor in unhealthy eating, as well as use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbd9a117431319dc162b251b6229d211a62d4ce2/4733_3204_2031_3321/612.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of a man twiddling his thumbs\" width=\"612\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Boredom is a call to action, but many of us choose not to hear it.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Serge Seidlitz/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In relying on external solutions, we undermine our sense of ourselves as the authors of our own lives, and the problem may become chronic.

Don\u2019t fight the feeling.</strong> Boredom is uncomfortable, but you make it worse by layering suffering on top. Think of when you twist your ankle \u2013 you feel pain without berating yourself for being clumsy, or fretting about a chronic injury. Feeling bored is unavoidable, but it is not a judgment on your character or ability.</p> <p><strong>2. Create a new routine.</strong> Boredom flourishes within constraints. In the absence of ordinary routines and busyness, it may feel like you are stagnating. Try to find another gear \u2013 one that may not be as high-energy, or productive, but is full at the same time.</p> <p><strong>3. Find purpose.</strong> Boredom is not an absence of things to do, it is the struggle to find value in any of the options available to you. Being able to connect with a reason \u201cwhy\u201d for doing something (including quarantine) can make it less boring. Instead of agitating for anything to do, try to determine what\u2019s really important \u2013 whether right now, or for the future.</p> <p><strong>4. Avoid passive consumption.</strong> It is all too easy to binge Netflix or scroll social media. If you\u2019re enjoying yourself, there\u2019s no problem, but treating yourself as a passive consumer may mean you are more likely to feel bored. You need to feel engaged.</p> <p><em>Out of My Skull (Harvard University Press, \u00a322.95) is </em><em>out in June</em><em>.

      "bodyText": "I remember my first experience of boredom as vividly as my first kiss. The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum\u2019s friend\u2019s house, into which she had disappeared. \u201cWon\u2019t be long,\u201d she\u2019d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it. Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag \u2013 minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam. I was in trouble, of course \u2013 but I was not convinced that I\u2019d done anything wrong. Instead it was as though, in putting an end to that desperate boredom, I had narrowly escaped falling off some kind of precipice \u2013 and I knew I would do whatever it took to avoid going over the edge in future. I did not understand then \u2013 two decades before my first conference call or doctor\u2019s waiting room \u2013 that boredom was a fact of life no more avoidable than any other mental state, good or bad. At times, it may even be a dominant experience. Studies show boredom levels rise through childhood, peak in early adulthood, and then decline, hitting the floor in one\u2019s 50s. But though boredom may be less prominent in middle life, it is still present \u2013 evidence suggests it comes creeping back in your 60s, especially among women. It is a familiar feeling and very common. Indeed, the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a \u201cboom time for boredom\u201d. Most of us are poorly equipped to cope with being shut in our homes indefinitely, even with the internet to distract us. But we should not fear being bored, say psychologists James Danckert and John D Eastwood, the authors of Out of My Skull: The Psychology of Boredom. Their research has revealed boredom to be widely misunderstood, perhaps even unfairly maligned. Boredom evolved to help us, says Danckert. It signals that we are unengaged, in need of an activity to satisfy us. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing, in a lot of ways. How we respond to it is up to us. I think you can minimise it. But do you want to totally eliminate it? I don\u2019t think you do.\u201d Danckert and Eastwood contend that boredom can steer us towards realising our potential and living full, meaningful lives. They say it communicates an important message that \u2013 in trying to outrun it my entire life \u2013 I had been refusing to heed. What if I stopped and listened? Danckert is an Australian cognitive neuroscientist now based at the University of Waterloo in Ontario. He began studying boredom 15 years ago, a case of \u201cphysician, heal thyself,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a kid, and still into my adult years, I experience boredom, and whenever I do, I hate it. I find it a very frustrating, agitating experience.\u201d This isn\u2019t a new phenomenon. To quote from Boredom: A Lively History, by the classicist Peter Toohey, the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote in disgust: \u201cHow long the same things? Surely I will yawn, I will sleep, I will eat, I will be thirsty, I will be cold, I will be hot. Is there no end?\u201d In the Middle Ages monks complained of \u201cthe noonday demon\u201d: the personification of acedia \u2013 torpor, alongside agitation \u2013 provoked by the constraints and repetition of their daily lives. And though one could already be \u201ca bore\u201d, it was Dickens who was the first to term it \u201cboredom\u201d \u2013 in Bleak House in 1852. Lady Dedlock complains of being \u201cbored to death\u201d of herself, more than a century before Bruce Springsteen would express the same restless dissatisfaction in Dancing in the Dark. His characterisation of boredom as a frustrated hunger (\u201cI\u2019m just about starving tonight\u201d) evokes Tolstoy\u2019s definition in Anna Karenina of the feeling as \u201cthe desire for desires\u201d. \u201cBoredom is such a fascinating topic, with tentacles that spread into philosophy, anthropology, literature, religion, theology,\u201d says Eastwood, who is head of the Boredom Lab at York University in Toronto. There researchers study boredom from social, clinical and cognitive perspectives \u2013 from shoring up the link with creativity and improving outcomes in education, to better understanding the subjective experience of mental exertion and attention \u2013 with a view to applying their findings in the real world. \u201cBut as a scientist, I wasn\u2019t convinced that everybody was using the term in the same way.\u201d Eastwood became interested in boredom 20 years ago, after observing a seeming \u201ccrisis of agency\u201d among young men he saw in his private psychotherapy practice. They were disengaged, under-achieving, perhaps abusing marijuana or struggling with depression, he says. Eastwood characterises their circumstance as a \u201cfailure to launch into life\u201d, which these men told him they experienced as \u201cbeing chronically bored\u201d. But what was being bored, exactly? \u201cI thought: what is this?\u201d In Out of My Skull, he and Danckert define boredom as the uncomfortable feeling of \u201cwanting to do something, but not wanting to do anything\u201d. It is not an emotion, as such, but an ongoing cognitive process where we wish to engage our minds, but nothing seems to satisfy. It is neither daydreaming, which we might find highly absorbing, nor, necessarily, vegging out on the sofa. It is this particular combination of lethargy and restlessness that distinguishes boredom from frustration (where a specific desire has been thwarted) and apathy (where there is no desire at all). And though boredom seems to be a risk factor for depression, it is not the same. To be bored is often thought of as a character flaw, reflecting laziness or lack of curiosity. \u201cOnly boring people get bored,\u201d goes the aphorism. \u201cI\u2019m highly motivated to prove it\u2019s not true,\u201d jokes Danckert. It is when we fail to act on the signal, or succumb to distractions, that the feeling of boredom becomes protracted and causes us misery. As the Booker prize winner Anne Enright wrote recently: \u201cBoredom is a productive state, so long as you don\u2019t let it go sour on you.\u201d It is striking that the predisposition to it is negatively perceived in a way that other personality traits aren\u2019t. Complaints of \u201cI\u2019m bored\u201d are often seen as uniquely provoking, Eastwood notes. \u201cThere is this impulse in us to say, \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with you, you should not be bored.\u2019 But to simply judge them, I think, misses the point. They know there\u2019s things to do \u2013 but they can\u2019t bring their desires in the moment in line with what\u2019s there.\u201d Some people are better equipped to cope than others. In Out of My Skull, the psychologists compare two astronauts who responded very differently to the constraints and monotony of space exploration. Russia\u2019s Valentin Lebedev, who spent 211 days in space in the early 1980s, failed to be satisfied by the busy work dictated by ground control and, after five months, did not \u201ceven want to look out of a porthole\u201d. As commander of the International Space Station in 2013, Canadian Chris Hadfield found purpose even in plumbing repairs. The psychologists suggest it was Hadfield\u2019s intrinsic motivation to find meaning in what he was doing, and to occupy and challenge himself within the confines of his environment, that set the two astronauts apart. Hadfield claims to never be bored \u2013 but, Danckert says, it\u2019s more that \u201che just deals with it really very well\u201d. In the years after I tore apart Mum\u2019s car, I got better at not being bored, even in testing conditions. My parents are enthusiastic sailors and most of my school holidays were spent in the close confines of their yacht, without television or internet, during sometimes long passages at sea. On those trips I read every book on board, regardless of interest (a dictionary; a medical encyclopaedia) or age appropriateness (pulpy Dick Francis thrillers, replete with rumpy-pumpy); and when I ran out of other people\u2019s stories, I wrote my own. I spent long periods listening to the same music. At a push, I could be alone with my thoughts, observing them with slight indifference, as though they were a TV show that had not yet hooked me. I considered this evidence of my extreme aversion to boredom. In fact, according to Danckert and Eastwood, I may just have developed a good response to it. Though it has not been substantiated by research, they suggest that boredom has been the push for much creativity, innovation and growth \u2013 while simultaneously a source of distress for many. The mistake many people make is seeking to escape the uncomfortable feeling, instead of interrogating what it is trying to tell them, says Eastwood. They may distract themselves with social media, or worse: boredom has also been shown to be a factor in unhealthy eating, as well as use of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. In relying on external solutions, we undermine our sense of ourselves as the authors of our own lives, and the problem may become chronic. In young people, boredom is associated with higher than average risk-taking; in the elderly, it can speed up the degenerative process of ageing. Both groups are at particular risk of depression, for which boredom is a precursor. Boredom-prone people also experience higher levels of anger, aggression and hostility and may be driven to look for meaning in extreme political views, or tribalism.

A 2014 study found that many people chose to administer painful electric shocks to themselves rather than being left alone with their thoughts. One man shocked himself 190 times in 15 minutes. \u201cAll too often when we\u2019re bored, we see ourselves as passive, empty vessels to fill \u2013 we look for stimuli that will get rid of the bad feeling in the short term,\u201d says Eastwood. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t foster and grow our capacity for agency \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what we need to be free from boredom and its negative consequences.\u201d Danckert and Eastwood are reluctant to blame the present problem on our preoccupation with technology alone.

      "body": "<p>It has endured Europe\u2019s longest lockdown, but when Italy enters its much-anticipated phase two tomorrow, few will find reason to celebrate.</p> \n<p>Last week, after Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, outlined plans to slowly ease the country\u2019s quarantine, millions of people were overcome with feelings of anger and disappointment as their hopes were dashed by what many described as a \u201cfalse reopening\u201d.</p> \n<p>Italians will now be able to travel within regions to visit relatives, provided they wear masks, but schools, hairdressers, gyms and many other commercial activities will stay closed; cafes and restaurants will offer takeaways only; and all travel between regions will be banned except for work, health or emergency situations. Restrictions on funerals have been relaxed, with a maximum of 15 mourners allowed to attend, but masses and weddings will have to wait.</p> \n<p>For this reason, last Friday, Pietro Demita, a stylist in Lecce whose company is a leading wedding dress designer, set fire to his entire collection in protest against the lockdown, which has brought the wedding industry to near-collapse.</p> \n<p>\u2018\u2018I set my creations alight, the fruits of my talent and my artistry, to send a strong message,\u201d Demita told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cBecause, even if I hadn\u2019t, the economic and political decisions imposed during the coronavirus crisis would have sent them up in smoke anyway.\u201d</p> \n<p>Expectations had been high for a quick return to normality, especially in the south, where there have been fewer Covid-19 cases than in the north. The mood is sombre, not only because the virus, despite its slackening, continues to claim lives, but also because people are on edge after having been forced to stay at home for more than 50 days.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt seems they\u2019re having a good laugh at our expense,\u201d says Costantino Montalbano, 31, a hair stylist in Palermo. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they\u2019re telling us to go out, but to stay at home. All this time locked up has affected our mental health, but it\u2019s also hit us hard in the wallet. If we don\u2019t return to normality soon, coronavirus will have killed not only thousands of people, but the entire economy as well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Like bars and restaurants, hairdressers should fully reopen on 1 June; museums and retailers from 18 May. Factories already geared towards exports and public construction projects resumed activity last Monday, while the majority of Italy\u2019s industry will restart tomorrow. However, as the country plunges into recession, many business people and shopkeepers are complaining about the lack of financial support.</p> \n<p>With summer around the corner, experts predict that the impact of Covid-19 on tourism, one of the country\u2019s most important sectors, will be devastating. According to Italy\u2019s National Confederation for Artisans and Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses (CNA), there will be 25 million fewer foreign tourists between July and September. The risk is that thousands of hotels, resorts and B&amp;Bs will be forced to close their doors for the foreseeable future.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e615bfa2-aa87-489c-a10f-397c5757094d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yKKajQTTHcM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bars and restaurants are the lifeblood of the economy of so many Italian cities and towns, but thousands have come together in protest against reopening, feeling that the restrictions of post-lockdown social distancing could spell the end for many.</p> \n<p>As part of a series of symbolic gestures organised by a movement called Movimento Imprese Ospitalit\u00e0 (MIO), the owners of 75,000 bars and restaurants switched on the lights of their premises to mark the last day of business last Tuesday night before handing over the keys to their respective mayors the following morning. On Friday night, they switched off the lights in their homes for an hour.</p> \n<p>Paolo Bianchini, a restaurant owner in Viterbo, Lazio, and spokesperson for MIO, said the peaceful protest was to show how much the hospitality sector was struggling. \u201cWe only want to open when we know we\u2019ll be able to work efficiently,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, my restaurant has 100 covers \u2013 with social distancing this will be reduced to 30. If I do so little business, my restaurant will close, as I won\u2019t be able to cover my costs. Paradoxically, we will fail if we open. We need liquidity \u2013 how is it that serious countries like England are managing to help business owners, but Italy isn\u2019t lending a hand?\u201d</p> \n<p>During the debate in the Senate on Thursday, the opposition parties grilled Conte. Ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi, who has called for less restraint in the reopening, remarked, \u201cThe people in Bergamo and Brescia who are gone, those who died of the virus, if they could speak, they\u2019d tell us to relaunch the country for them, in their honour.\u201d</p> \n<p>Renzi\u2019s controversial statement was harshly criticised by doctors who warned that the spread of the disease, which, as of Thursday, had killed almost 30,000 people in the country and infected more than 205,000, was not over and that a misstep could take the entire country back to mid-March coronavirus levels.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe risk a new wave of infections and outbreaks if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d said Tullio Prestileo, an infectious diseases specialist at Palermo\u2019s Benefratelli Hospital. \u201cIf we don\u2019t realise this, we could easily find ourselves back where we started. In that case, we may not have the strength to get back up again.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e67a6454-abd4-4d6d-9302-dede8e2ad56b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JVF5648emWE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2020 because an earlier version referred to \u201cmany businessmen\u201d when, according to our style guidelines, the appropriate reference is to \u201cbusiness people\u201d.</p>",

If we don\u2019t return to normality soon, coronavirus will have killed not only thousands of people, but the entire economy as well.\u201d Like bars and restaurants, hairdressers should fully reopen on 1 June; museums and retailers from 18 May. Factories already geared towards exports and public construction projects resumed activity last Monday, while the majority of Italy\u2019s industry will restart tomorrow. However, as the country plunges into recession, many business people and shopkeepers are complaining about the lack of financial support. With summer around the corner, experts predict that the impact of Covid-19 on tourism, one of the country\u2019s most important sectors, will be devastating. According to Italy\u2019s National Confederation for Artisans and Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses (CNA), there will be 25 million fewer foreign tourists between July and September. The risk is that thousands of hotels, resorts and B&amp;Bs will be forced to close their doors for the foreseeable future. Bars and restaurants are the lifeblood of the economy of so many Italian cities and towns, but thousands have come together in protest against reopening, feeling that the restrictions of post-lockdown social distancing could spell the end for many. As part of a series of symbolic gestures organised by a movement called Movimento Imprese Ospitalit\u00e0 (MIO), the owners of 75,000 bars and restaurants switched on the lights of their premises to mark the last day of business last Tuesday night before handing over the keys to their respective mayors the following morning. On Friday night, they switched off the lights in their homes for an hour. Paolo Bianchini, a restaurant owner in Viterbo, Lazio, and spokesperson for MIO, said the peaceful protest was to show how much the hospitality sector was struggling. \u201cWe only want to open when we know we\u2019ll be able to work efficiently,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, my restaurant has 100 covers \u2013 with social distancing this will be reduced to 30. If I do so little business, my restaurant will close, as I won\u2019t be able to cover my costs. Paradoxically, we will fail if we open. We need liquidity \u2013 how is it that serious countries like England are managing to help business owners, but Italy isn\u2019t lending a hand?\u201d During the debate in the Senate on Thursday, the opposition parties grilled Conte. Ex-prime minister Matteo Renzi, who has called for less restraint in the reopening, remarked, \u201cThe people in Bergamo and Brescia who are gone, those who died of the virus, if they could speak, they\u2019d tell us to relaunch the country for them, in their honour.\u201d Renzi\u2019s controversial statement was harshly criticised by doctors who warned that the spread of the disease, which, as of Thursday, had killed almost 30,000 people in the country and infected more than 205,000, was not over and that a misstep could take the entire country back to mid-March coronavirus levels. \u201cWe risk a new wave of infections and outbreaks if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d said Tullio Prestileo, an infectious diseases specialist at Palermo\u2019s Benefratelli Hospital. \u201cIf we don\u2019t realise this, we could easily find ourselves back where we started. In that case, we may not have the strength to get back up again.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2020 because an earlier version referred to \u201cmany businessmen\u201d when, according to our style guidelines, the appropriate reference is to \u201cbusiness people\u201d.",

The findings of the poll reinforce indications of an increase in the numbers of people turning to faith for succour amid uncertainty and despair. The Church of England has said that unexpectedly high numbers of people are tuning into online or broadcast services, and 6,000 people phoned a prayer hotline in its first 48 hours of operation. Other faiths have also reported surges in people engaging with online religious activities as places of worship have been closed during the lockdown. The survey of more than 2,000 people, commissioned by the Christian aid agency Tearfund and carried out last weekend, found that a third of young adults aged between 18 and 34 had watched or listened to an online or broadcast religious service, compared with one in five adults over the age of 55. One in five of those who have tuned into services in the past few weeks say they have never gone to church. The most frequent subjects of prayers since the lockdown has been family (53%), friends (34%), thanking God (24%), the person praying (28%), frontline services (27%), someone unwell with Covid-19 (20%), and other countries with Covid-19 (15%). A separate poll, commissioned by Christian Aid, found that The Vicar of Dibley, the Rev Geraldine Granger, the BBC TV character played by Dawn French, would be the public\u2019s choice of screen priest to lead the UK through the coronavirus crisis.

He didn\u2019t mention an \u201cexit strategy\u201d, a phrase that Number 10 has banned ministers from using. There won\u2019t be a full exit for a long time and there isn\u2019t yet anything worthy of the description strategy.

One person at the heart of decision-making puts it like this: \u201cWhat you can\u2019t do is release loads of measures all at once, only to find that there is a resurgence and you have to put them all back on again. You can\u2019t go too fast and you\u2019ve got to monitor and measure as you go.\u201d This points to a very gradual easing of lockdown with the government retaining the option of reimposing restrictions if infection levels flare up. Franklin D Roosevelt addressed the Great Depression of the 1930s with what he called \u201cbold experimentation\u201d. What we will see from the government over the days ahead is tremulous experimentation.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Tory leader has encountered an enemy that confounds his have-your-cake-and-eat-it philosophy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The choices confronting the prime minister are not ones he would willingly make.

A revival of respect for expertise has been a beneficial consequence of this crisis, but it doesn\u2019t relieve politicians from the responsibility to make the toughest calls. Scientific advisers advise; ministers decide. This is even more the case because opinion among scientists has never been homogenous and there is still much that they don\u2019t fully understand. Immunity is one of those unknowns. There has been some optimistic news from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/south-korea-records-no-new-domestic-cases-of-covid-19-for-first-time-since-february\">South Korea</a> in the past few days, but there is not yet certainty about whether infection leads to immunity, how long immunity might last and how strongly, and whether people can be immune and at the same time be carriers of the disease. Another big question mark hangs over the role of children in transmission. If they can be as infectious as adults, that is very bad news, with major implications for when schools can be reopened. If children are not as infectious as adults, that is much more encouraging.</p> <p>The swiftness with which restrictions can be eased is hugely contingent on the rate at which the virus is spreading. Sir <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19-nhs\">Patrick Vallance</a>, the chief scientific adviser, says it is believed that the average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify\">reproduction rate</a> \u2013 R \u2013 in Britain is now somewhere between 0.6 and 0.9. In decimal points, that is a small difference. In terms of the options it offers the government, that is a vast range. The closer R is to 1, the greater the hazard that a lifting of restrictions will trigger an explosion of infections. The closer R is to 0.5, the more rapidly the epidemic will reduce in strength and the more easing ministers can dare risk.</p> <p>The government will improve its chances of acting safely if it can put together a reliable system for testing, tracking and tracing infection.

The required number of tests greatly depends on how prevalent the disease is among the population \u2013 and the government doesn\u2019t know that either. They hope to start solving that mystery through the recently launched mass survey programme.

At the same time, majorities of respondents tell pollsters that <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/majority-britons-uncomfortable-sport-music-bars-coronavirus\">they are wary</a> of leaving their homes and nervous about using public transport again. Over the coming weeks, millions of Britons will be weighing the risks posed by the disease against the fear of losing livelihoods.

I am a furloughed manager and this will require me to continue providing employee support, plus researching appropriate online training for them. Is an employer allowed to require their employees to take on training and, if I do as requested, would I be jeopardising furlough pay by doing work?</strong></p> <p>Your employer is, indeed, risking disqualification from the government grant since it\u2019s asking you to perform regular services while on furlough. This is not permitted. Training is allowed, but only if it does not provide services to, or generate revenue for, the employer. It must also be directly relevant to an employee\u2019s role and must be first agreed between the employer and the employee.</p> <p>The approach being taken by your employer doesn\u2019t appear consistent to this. Your employer\u2019s requests are probably well-intentioned to keep staff morale and motivation going, but if their actions disqualify them from a grant under the CJRS, you should still be entitled to furlough pay as it\u2019s one of the conditions of the scheme.</p> <p><strong>My partner has been furloughed from his job as a delivery driver at a builder\u2019s merchant, but staff may be asked to return on rota after the minimum three-week furlough period is up. Can he be forced to return? We are concerned that the company is overstepping the guidelines by delivering non-essential supplies to customers which will put him at risk.</strong></p> <p>The simple answer here is that the employer is allowed to ask your partner to return to work, and he will not normally have the right to choose or refuse. Employees can be rotated on furlough (three weeks on, three weeks off) or brought back to work as normal if the demand for work is there. Your partner should think carefully before refusing to return to work, as that could be treated as unauthorised absence. If he has serious health and safety concerns then he could refuse to work whilst the concerns are addressed - he should raise those so that his employer can respond. </p> <p>However, the fact that an employer has decided to stay open for business is not likely, by itself, to create the sort of health and safety concerns that would allow your partner to refuse to work. The government has published detailed guidance on social distance, shift-working and staggering processes that will support businesses to remain open for business safely. That includes specific guidance for delivery drivers.</p> <p><strong>My partner started his new retail job on the 1 March and worked there full time for three weeks until the shop closed due to the pandemic.

To qualify, the employee must have been on the PAYE payroll on or before 19 March so if your partner had been paid by that date he would certainly be eligible. If not, it\u2019s less clear cut. However, new guidance permits employees who had left jobs to work elsewhere after the cut-off date, to be rehired and furloughed by their former employers.<br><br><strong>The decorating company I work for is now re-opening all stores and staff, who had been furloughed until the end of June, have to decide whether to return to work for a non-essential service or take unpaid leave.

Your employer is acting reasonably in seeking to safeguard those at risk while trying to keep the business going. The issue seems to be that the person you live with has not received a letter confirming that they are at risk. This is an issue you need to raise with your local authority or their GP. If you have concerns about health and safety you should raise these with your employer, and if you believe there is a serious and imminent danger where you work you can remain at home until it is resolved.

      "bodyText": "People in low-income and conflict-affected countries have so far largely escaped the high levels of Covid-19 infection seen in western Europe and the US, although this may be changing. The pandemic is killing them in different ways: lost jobs, ruined businesses, increased poverty, rising malnutrition and risk of famine, and a prospective increase in untreated, non-Covid preventable illnesses. For many of the most vulnerable, the developed world\u2019s cures are proving worse than the disease. At the extreme, families must choose between going hungry and getting ill. And their plight is exacerbated by Covid-style \u201cunderlying conditions\u201d \u2013 chronic, pre-existing political, security, economic, and climate problems that grow ever more unsustainable. A Covid tidal wave may be about to hit sub-Saharan Africa and other less resilient regions, the International Rescue Committee warned last week. Without urgent international action, the virus could cause 1bn infections and 3.2m deaths in 34 fragile states, including Afghanistan and Syria, it said. The World Health Organization has issued similar alerts. Yet even if these worst-case outcomes are somehow avoided, poorer countries already face enormous collateral damage. According to UN estimates, half a billion people, or 8% of the world\u2019s population, could be pushed into destitution by the year\u2019s end, largely due to the pandemic. The fight against poverty would be set back 30 years. The crisis could produce famines of \u201cbiblical proportions\u201d, with the number of people facing hunger almost doubling to more than 250 million, the World Food Programme (WFP) said. Shortfalls in donor funding and food aid meant 30 million people could die within a matter of months, it added. Vanishing demand, collapsed distribution chains, and disrupted export markets are pushing people to the brink, affecting groups as diverse as Ethiopian and Kenyan flower producers, Sri Lankan tea-growers, and Bangladeshi garment workers whose contracts have reportedly been cancelled by UK supermarkets. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, Nigeria, Venezuela and Haiti are among the countries most at risk, the WFP said: \u201cMillions can only eat if they earn a wage.\u201d War-torn Yemen is worse off than most. About 12 million Yemenis rely on food aid that is threatened by renewed fighting. A repeat cholera outbreak is under way. The detection last week of a Covid-19 cluster in Aden may be the least of its worries. South Sudan is another conflict-scarred country with little or no capacity to handle a Covid-19 emergency. In 2019, 61% of the population faced food insecurity. Drought and locust infestations were contributory factors. Yet with only 34 confirmed Covid cases so far, and no deaths, South Sudan\u2019s main worry at present is the pandemic\u2019s indirect impact on humanitarian aid, food supply and livelihoods. This perspective is shared by many in South Africa, the continent\u2019s second largest economy. The official death toll is just over 100, yet the government\u2019s lockdown is said to be costing \u00a3570m a day.

The WHO announced last week that polio vaccinations for up to 12 million children in Africa will be delayed as resources are switched to fighting Covid-19. It admitted the move would inevitably lead to more child polio cases. Disrupted vaccination programmes have frequently led to \u201cexplosive\u201d outbreaks of life-threatening diseases previously held in abeyance, warned vaccine specialist Edward Parker. \u201cWithout systematic efforts to maintain immunisation programmes, the virus\u2019s legacy could include a disastrous surge in childhood deaths.\u201d The pandemic is providing cover for malign governments to pursue or accelerate policies that place lives at risk, regardless of Covid-19.

Only 9% believe it would be correct to consider reopening pubs, while 81% are against; 7% say it would be right to allow mass gatherings at sports events or concerts to resume, with 84% against.</p> <p>Johnson, meanwhile, has given his first interview since he was released from hospital and disclosed that doctors had a plan to announce his death. He told <em>Sun on Sunday</em> that it was 50-50 that he would have to be put on a ventilator. \u201cThey gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Once in intensive care he told how \u201cthe bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction\u201d and he realised there was no cure for Covid-19 and asked himself, \u201cHow am I going to get out of this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe,\u201d he said. He went on to praise the \u201cwonderful nursing\u201d that saved him and said: \u201cThey really did it and made a huge difference. I can\u2019t explain how it happened. I don\u2019t know\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it was just wonderful to see them\u2009...I get emotional about it\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it was an extraordinary thing.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, the psychologist Prof Dame Til Wykes of King\u2019s College London said the public\u2019s reactions to easing the lockdown were likely to reveal high levels of anxiety. \u201cIt is likely that most people will feel anxious and risk averse.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been given strict behavioural advice for more than five weeks, and when that is removed people will feel pressured, and individuals who had pre-existing anxiety, particularly about their health, will be worst hit. It will take quite a lot of psychological treatment to get over this.</p> <p>\u201cDifferent groups will be more affected than others, in particular the elderly and also parents, who will worry about their children bringing home the virus from schools.\u201d</p> <p>The poll figures, and warnings from experts, will fuel an increasingly tense debate inside Whitehall over how best to strike a balance between keeping the public safe and minimising damage to the economy in the next phase of the crisis.</p> <p>Johnson said on Thursday that the UK had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">passed the peak of the virus </a>but that people had to expect restrictions on their freedoms to remain in place for the foreseeable future. The prime minister will spell out his thinking later this week on how the lockdown could be eased when infection rates have come down.</p> <p>The total number of deaths from Covid-19 in all settings rose on Saturday by 621 to 28,131.

      "bodyText": "Fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed. Opposition to reopening restaurants and pubs \u2013 and allowing mass gatherings in sports and other stadiums to resume \u2013 is even higher. Just 11% of people think the time is right to consider reopening restaurants, while 78% are against. Only 9% believe it would be correct to consider reopening pubs, while 81% are against; 7% say it would be right to allow mass gatherings at sports events or concerts to resume, with 84% against. Johnson, meanwhile, has given his first interview since he was released from hospital and disclosed that doctors had a plan to announce his death. He told Sun on Sunday that it was 50-50 that he would have to be put on a ventilator. \u201cThey gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie,\u201d he said. Once in intensive care he told how \u201cthe bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction\u201d and he realised there was no cure for Covid-19 and asked himself, \u201cHow am I going to get out of this?\u201d \u201cBut the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe,\u201d he said. He went on to praise the \u201cwonderful nursing\u201d that saved him and said: \u201cThey really did it and made a huge difference. I can\u2019t explain how it happened. I don\u2019t know\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it was just wonderful to see them\u2009...I get emotional about it\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it was an extraordinary thing.\u201d On Saturday, the psychologist Prof Dame Til Wykes of King\u2019s College London said the public\u2019s reactions to easing the lockdown were likely to reveal high levels of anxiety. \u201cIt is likely that most people will feel anxious and risk averse. \u201cWe have been given strict behavioural advice for more than five weeks, and when that is removed people will feel pressured, and individuals who had pre-existing anxiety, particularly about their health, will be worst hit. It will take quite a lot of psychological treatment to get over this. \u201cDifferent groups will be more affected than others, in particular the elderly and also parents, who will worry about their children bringing home the virus from schools.\u201d The poll figures, and warnings from experts, will fuel an increasingly tense debate inside Whitehall over how best to strike a balance between keeping the public safe and minimising damage to the economy in the next phase of the crisis. Johnson said on Thursday that the UK had passed the peak of the virus but that people had to expect restrictions on their freedoms to remain in place for the foreseeable future. The prime minister will spell out his thinking later this week on how the lockdown could be eased when infection rates have come down. The total number of deaths from Covid-19 in all settings rose on Saturday by 621 to 28,131. In total, 182,260 people had tested positive, an increase of 4,806 cases on the previous day. At the Downing Street briefing, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, suggested that rules on what people could do outdoors would be relaxed earlier than those on behaviour inside, in places such as in pubs, clubs and restaurants. \u201cThe rate of transmission is significantly less outdoors than indoors, so when it is right to ease lockdown measures that will be a factor,\u201d he said. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, said that \u201cgenerally, outdoor environments are safer\u201d in terms of infection rates for Covid-19. But she said it depended how people travelled to an outdoor event and venue, and whom they went with. Divisions within the cabinet and the Conservative party remain over how to proceed. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is determined to take a tough line to protect the public, while the Treasury and many Tory MPs want to move to allow more people back to work to \u201cfire up\u201d the economy before many businesses go bankrupt.

The net approval rate has fallen therefore from plus 39% to plus 13%. Given the fragile state of support, ministers will be determined not to misread the public mood over easing the lockdown.

In Spain, meanwhile, where adults were allowed out to exercise on Saturday for the first time since restrictions were put in place in mid-March, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that anyone using public transport from Monday would have to wear a face mask. He also said that the government would seek MPs\u2019 approval next week for another two-week extension of the lockdown, which is due to end on 10 May. In Austria, people flocked to newly reopened hairdressers, beauticians and electronics shops, as they relished the loosening of a seven-week lockdown.

He is continuing to work normally, except for one day a week which he is taking as holiday. \u201cHe\u2019s doing everything to help with the children, but I feel lucky he still has a job,\u201d says Bosworth. \u201cThe priority for us is to keep our house and pay our bills, and his job is the most straightforward route to that.\u201d</p> <p>They have an eight-month-old baby and a five-year-old girl, and normally get help from grandparents and a childminder so that they can both work. \u201cI\u2019m a feminist and believe in choice,\u201d she says. \u201cBut because of the pandemic, my choices have been taken away. I feel like a 1950s housewife.\u201d</p> <p>She is not alone. During the lockdown, mothers in the UK are typically providing at least 50% more childcare as well as spending around 10% to 30% more time than fathers home schooling their children, figures analysed by the <em>Observer</em> show.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t matter whether a woman is working from home, working outside the home or not working at all: the research reveals she is typically spending at least an extra hour-and-a-half on childcare and home schooling every day, compared to the average man in the same circumstances.</p> <p>The research, carried out by economists from the universities of Cambridge, Oxford and Zurich between 9 and 14 April, indicates that a woman who is at home \u2013 whether or not she is formally working \u2013 is affected by this gender divide. Both employed and unemployed mothers are typically spending around six hours providing childcare and home schooling every working day. By contrast, the average father at home is only spending a little over four hours on childcare and homeschooling each working day, regardless of his employment status.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever situation you have, on average it\u2019s the woman doing more, and it\u2019s not because she\u2019s working less\u201d says Dr Christopher Rauh, an economist at Cambridge University.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Men seem to be able to lock themselves away in a study, while women are working at the kitchen table \u2013 and also trying to home educate</p> <footer> <cite>Mary-Ann Stephenson, Women's Budget Group</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The gender divide is even larger in high-income households. A mother who earns over \u00a380,000 and is working from home is typically doing 3.3 hours of home schooling and 3.8 hours of childcare each day \u2013 over seven hours in total. A typical father who earns over \u00a380,000 only spends 2.1 hours home schooling his children and 2.3 hours on childcare each working day \u2013 less than 4.5 hours in total.</p> <p>\u201cThe higher the household income, the more time women are spending home schooling compared to men,\u201d says Rauh. \u201cPeople come up with explanations \u2013 like women are better at taking care of their children due to evolution \u2013 but if that were true, it shouldn\u2019t apply to home schooling. Yet we also see those differences here.\u201d</p> <p>The amount of home schooling children are receiving in lockdown appears to be particularly affected by the income of their mothers, with the lowest-paid women spending 2.1 hours a day educating their children each day (over an hour less than the highest-paid women). Fathers earning \u00a30 to \u00a320,000 are doing even less homeschooling (1.9 hours), but that\u2019s still roughly the same as the higher-paid men.</p> <p>The starkest gender divide among low-paid parents, however, is around childcare. Like the highest-paid women, those women earning \u00a30 to \u00a320,000 are doing 3.9 hours of childcare each day. By contrast, the lowest-paid men are carrying out just 2.4 hours of childcare each day.</p> <p>In other words, a woman earning over \u00a380,000 and working from home is typically spending 60% more time (an extra 1.4 hours) on childcare each working day than the average man earning \u00a30 to \u00a320,000.</p> <p>Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the <a href=\"https://wbg.org.uk/\">Women\u2019s Budget Group</a>, thinks this may be because women are more used to having to juggle looking after children and work than men. \u201cIt may be that in an emergency the woman takes on more of the childcare work,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Children may also be more inclined to go to their mothers than their fathers, she says. Similarly, if their father is paid more, it might be seen as more important that he doesn\u2019t lose his job.</p> <p>The home-learning platform <a href=\"https://atomlearning.co.uk/\">Atom Learning</a> says that since the lockdown began, more than three-quarters of parents who have registered their children for free online lessons and set them schoolwork were female.</p> <p>At the same time, there is evidence that women\u2019s contributions outside the home are decreasing. There has been a drop in the number of <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/04/21/early-journal-submission-data-suggest-covid-19-tanking-womens-research-productivity\">solo-authored academic papers submitted by women</a>, while submissions by male academics have increased. Similarly, at the <a href=\"https://www.philosophy-foundation.org/\">Philosophy Foundation</a>, the majority of the organisation\u2019s work is now being carried out by men. \u201cThis is because most of our female philosophers are having to focus on childcare and home education\u201d says co-CEO Emma Worley.</p> <p><a href=\"https://workingfamilies.org.uk/\">Working Families,</a> which runs a legal advice service for parents and carers, has seen a sixfold increase in inquiries since the lockdown began, 80% of which have come from women. \u201cWe have seen evidence from mothers that they\u2019re being penalised and not being supported to work from home because they have children. We\u2019ve also seen mothers having to take unpaid leave or being dismissed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There are concerns about the impact of all this on women\u2019s mental health. Research from King\u2019s College London shows that, since the lockdown began, 57% of women say they are feeling more anxious and depressed, compared to only 40% of men. More women than men also report that they are getting less sleep, and eating less healthily, than usual.</p> <p>\u201cIn a large number of cases, women are doing the vast majority of the caring for small children and the home educating work,\u201d says Stephenson. \u201cThe men seem to be able to lock themselves away in a study, while the women are working at the kitchen table \u2013 and also trying to home-educate\u201d</p> <p>Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, says the wider implications of the lockdown gender divide are clear. \u201cThis shows that the default assumptions about who does the caring for children fundamentally haven\u2019t shifted. It defaults to women. There\u2019s still an expectation that women will make their jobs fit around the caring, whereas a man\u2019s job will come first.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re performing 100%\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5203092de0c28c6021e4f87d7e98708de7ec86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5203092de0c28c6021e4f87d7e98708de7ec86/0_126_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lizzie Harrop and her son, Barnaby, aged 5.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lizzie Harrop and her son, Barnaby, aged 5.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In lockdown, Lizzie Harrop had been experiencing the same anxiety levels she felt when she was suffering from postnatal depression five years ago. \u201cIn the beginning, my child was making me feel like a prisoner again.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following along today, readers. We\u2019re going to wind up the blog shortly. But first, let\u2019s summarise the events of the day. Australia\u2019s death toll has risen to 95 following another death in NSW at the Newmarch House aged care home, and the death of an 83-year-old woman in WA. Australia\u2019s progress otherwise remains positive. Only 18 new cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours, remaining within the target of 20 new cases. Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, continued to urge caution, saying \u201cthere are still small outbreaks detected in Victoria and New South Wales, there is still evidence of some low level community transmission\u201d He flagged a potential restart of face-to-face university activities and said the medical advice on schools remains clear: children are not high level transmitters and are at extremely low risk. About one in four adults with access to a smartphone have now downloaded the COVIDSafe App. Murphy said the more it is used, the more likely it is that authorities will be able to take bold steps to lift restrictions. In Victoria, a teacher tested positive for Covid-19 at the Meadowglen primary school in Epping. The school is to be closed for three days for deep cleaning. Victoria has otherwise recorded 13 new cases. Dan Tehan, the education minister, was forced to withdraw an attack on Daniel Andrews after accusing him of a failure of leadership on schools on Sunday morning. Tehan said he had overstepped the mark and withdrew his comments. The NRL team, the New Zealand Warriors, has arrived in Tamworth ahead of a planned resumption of the competition later this month. One player stayed home after feeling unwell. South Australia is hopeful of being completely free of Covid-19 after its 11th consecutive day without a new case. It only has seven active cases. They\u2019ve barely touched down, but Tamworth has already claimed the NRL\u2019s New Zealand Warriors as its own. Tasmania has recorded its second consecutive day with no new Covid-19 cases. Sarah Courtney, the state\u2019s health minister, said the results were positive, but said Tasmanians must remain vigilant to avoid any second wave. \u201cWe know in other jurisdictions, we know in other countries we have seen second waves which have had devastating consequences,\u201d she said. Only NSW, Victoria and Queensland have recorded new cases today. The New Zealand Warriors have just touched down in Tamworth. They are planning to base themselves from the NSW town for the upcoming resumption of the NRL season and were given an exemption from travel restriction by the Australian Border Force. NSW police say they have charged three people for breaching Covid-19 laws in the past 24 hours, including two alleged teenage trespassers in Edgeworth, a 63-year-old man in Redfern who was allegedly drinking alcohol in an alcohol-free zone, and a 37-year-old woman in Dulwich Hill who police say was driving erratically. Police allege that none could provide a reasonable excuse for being outside. We heard a brief update on the number of COVIDSafe App downloads a little earlier. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said about one in four adults with a smartphone had downloaded the app. He said the degree of confidence he could give to national cabinet about easing restrictions would be influenced by use of the app. \u201cThe more confidence they can have, the more bold they might be,\u201d Murphy said. Meanwhile, in news neither related to Covid-19 or a looming by-election in Eden-Monaro, new \u201ctemporary accommodation pods\u201d have just arrived in Cobargo for bushfire victims. Remarkable timing. Let\u2019s take a moment to recap the day\u2019s events. Australia recorded just 18 new cases in the past 24 hours, remaining within its target of 20 new cases. Education minister Dan Tehan was forced to withdraw remarkable comments he made this morning, accusing the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews of a failure of leadership on his approach to the state\u2019s schools. Tehan later said he had \u201coverstepped\u201d. South Australia has expressed hope of becoming Covid-19 free. It has just seven active cases and has had no new cases for the past 11 days. In New South Wales, another death has been recorded at the Newmarch House aged care home, the site of an outbreak. The 76-year-old woman who died became the 14th resident to die at the facility after testing positive to Covid-19. Four new cases were recorded in NSW, two of which were connected to Newmarch House. In Victoria, a teacher tested positive for Covid-19 at the Meadowglen primary school in Epping. The school is to be closed for three days for deep cleaning. Victoria has otherwise recorded 13 new cases. An 83-year-old woman who contracted Covid-19 from close contact is the latest confirmed death in WA. She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April. The state otherwise recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. They now have only 19 active cases across the state. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said universities were likely to begin resuming some face-to-face activities this week. The New Zealand Warriors are flying to Australia today to begin preparations for a resumption of the NRL later this month. One of their players reportedly had to stay behind due to illness. The team were given a special exemption from travel restrictions. The ACCC says it was preparing to take Flight Centre to court over its policy of charging a cancellation fee of $300 to every per person that requests a refund for Covid-19 related cancellations. The legal action was avoided when Flight Centre said on Saturday it would waive the fee. States including Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory enjoyed their first weekend with loosened physical distancing restrictions. South Australia has now registered 11 consecutive days of zero new coronavirus cases. That\u2019s a pretty remarkable run. As I mentioned, Nicola Spurrier is hopeful the state could soon be free of Covid-19, with only seven active cases. The South Australia chief medical officer Nicola Spurrier is speaking now. She says the state now only has seven active cases, with 427 people now recovered from Covid-19. The state has a 98% recovery rate, she says. If we don\u2019t have any more cases, soon we will be able to say that we have no one with Covid-19 in the state, which will certainly be something to celebrate. Spurrier is also announcing that playgrounds and skate parks will be reopened. Looking at the risks involved, and also because we now have our schools back, I thought it was time that we should lift some of the restrictions on playgrounds. A quick note that comments on this blog will close in about five minutes. Murphy is asked about a report that one member of the New Zealand NRL team, the Warriors, had to stay behind for a Covid-19 test as the rest of the team travelled to Australia. He says he would be surprised if the test was positive, given New Zealand\u2019s current low rates of Covid-19. He\u2019s asked whether more members of the team should be tested. Murphy says it is pointless testing people who are well. There\u2019s not a lot of value in testing well people, because you could be incubating the virus, we don\u2019t know what that means. Murphy warns anyone with any sign of illness, no matter how small, to stay away from aged care facilities. Even so much as a sniffle should be enough to prevent aged care visits, he says. You have to be perfectly well to walk into the door of an aged care facility, that\u2019s my message. Murphy says a \u201ccautious\u201d restart of some university face-to-face activities will be discussed in national cabinet this week. He says it is likely that some face-to-face activities will resume. I think universities are clearly in the mix of things that we\u2019re talking about with national cabinet this week. It is likely that they will start to re-commence some activities, without pre-empting the decision of national cabinet. The advice has not changed on schools and school-aged children, Murphy says. Children are not high transmitters, he says. There is little risk to children. We think that children are not high transmitters of this virus in the school environment. We have always said there is a potential risk for adults, in the staff room, adult interactions at the school, pick ups and drop off. Murphy is asked how that squares with the Victorian government\u2019s position. He says the Victorian decision is based on the state\u2019s desire to stop movement, rather than any concern about the safety of children. Murphy is asked what permanent personal hygiene changes we will need to make as a result of Covid-19. He\u2019s asked, for example, whether cricketers will have to stop using saliva to shine cricket balls. Murphy says many aspects of our society will have to change permanently, including our hygiene practices. We as a first world very wealthy country have become a bit relaxed about hygiene and I think it\u2019s time we focussed on those things. For the record, Murphy doesn\u2019t think using saliva on cricket balls is a good idea. Murphy says the monitoring of Australians shows there has be an increase in movement in recent days since restrictions were relaxed in some state. This virus is still in our community, it\u2019s still with us, we are... in a much better position than just about any other country in the world, but we have to be careful as we chart the next couple of months. The chief medical officer Brendan Murphy is speaking now. He says there are currently 6,801 cases, increase of 18 cases in last 24 hours. He says the number of new cases is still below the target of 20, and says the government is continuing to look at what measures can be relaxed. But he warns against complacency. There are still new cases and there are still small outbreaks detected in Victoria and New South Wales, there is still evidence of some low level community transmission. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been saying for some time we cannot be complacent. While we wait for Brendan Murphy, there was some news this morning that large volumes of PPE had been seized at the border by the Australian government. The Daily Telegraph reported this morning that Australian Border Force officers have stopped 1,500 shipments of personal protective equipment (PPE) using new export controls designed to prevent profiteering during the crisis. The newspaper reported that about 29,800 pairs of gloves, 120 consignments of sanitiser products, 234,090 face masks, and 104 mask filters have been seized int he past two weeks, as part of what the ABF dubbed \u201coperation hangfire\u201d. Jason Wood, the assistant customs minister, said the ABF was working to ensure \u201cdodgy\u201d medical equipment didn\u2019t enter the country. The chief medical officer Brendan Murphy is expected to hold a press conference shortly. I\u2019ll bring you updates as soon as they happen. We\u2019ve learned today that the consumer watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, was preparing to take Flight Centre to court over its policy of charging customers a $300 fee per person, per booking for Covid-19 related travel cancellations. Flight Centre said yesterday it would now waive the fee, which had provoked widespread customer anger. But the ACCC says its next step to deal with Flight Centre was legal action. ACCC chair Rod Sims said the company\u2019s decision would allow the issue to be dealt with more quickly than legal proceedings. \u201cThis is a very welcome move made by Flight Centre for thousands of customers impacted by Covid-19 travel cancellations,\u201d Sims said on Sunday. \u201cWe are continuing to discuss issues in relation to refunds and cancellations with the travel sector, and encourage travel providers to treat consumers fairly in these exceptional circumstances.\u201d The full report is here: That might be where I leave you for today, but never fear, you are in good hands with Christopher Knaus, who will guide you through the rest of Sunday\u2019s news. The most recent death in WA brings Australia\u2019s death toll to 95. WA Premier Mark McGowan said he is not currently planning to lift intrastate borders. I know there\u2019s a lot of pressure around that but I wouldn\u2019t think so. We\u2019ll just take medical advice on that. The main thing we\u2019re focused on is getting this right, and making sure we don\u2019t make changes that we then have to lock down again in the future... There are a lot of people in the regions who want us to keep the borders in place for longer. WA Premier Mark McGowan has confirmed the death of an 83-year-old woman who contracted Covid-19 from close contact. She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April. WA recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. They now have only 19 active cases across the state. NSW\u2019s public education union had this to say on today\u2019s political education news: Some more from the statement Tehan published this afternoon: The consistent advice from the expert medical panel, the Australian Health Principles Protection Committee, comprising all state and territory chief health officers and the federal chief medical officers has been that schools can be fully open. Not withstanding this position, the Victorian chief health officer has provided more cautious advice to the Victorian premier, who has been acting on this advice in relation to Victorian state schools... As education minister it is my job to take a national view of education and do everything possible to ensure our children are getting the best possible opportunities. I will continue working constructively with my state counterparts as they run their state school systems to support them with the best medical and education expert advice the federal government can offer. It seems to have been a morning of regret for federal education minister Dan Tehan. After an explosive ABC Insiders interview, he released a statement saying he \u201coverstepped the mark\u201d in his criticism of the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews: All premiers and chief ministers are seeking to make balanced judgements, in the best interests of their state or territory, on the basis of the advice they have available to them... It is important to note that this will not always result in all states and territories and the federal government agreeing on all points. The statement goes on to discuss how remote learning will negatively impact remote, disadvantaged and Indigenous students: It was those examples I was thinking of this morning during my interview on Insiders when I expressed my personal frustration that more schools weren\u2019t starting more in-class learning in my home state. It was this frustration that led me to overstep the mark in questioning premier Andrew\u2019s leadership on this matter and I withdraw. There have been rumours floating around Twitter this morning that the ABC Insiders panel were aware of the Victorian school closure before their interview with federal education minister Dan Tehan. Executive Producer Sam Clark has posted to say this was \u201cpatently untrue\u201d. The Meadowglen Primary School in Epping will be closed from Monday until Wednesday after a teacher, who was onsite, recently tested positive for Covid-19. However, the school\u2019s principal, Loretta Piazza, told Melbourne radio station 3AW the teacher had not been in contact with students in person this year, the AAP reports. She said contact tracing at the school has been completed and only two other teachers will need to enter quarantine for two weeks. The music teacher undertook the test which came back positive because a family member was tested. \u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that he was involved in a cluster very early on and he did go to get tested and he tried a number of times to be tested but was knocked back.\u201d Staying on NSW for a moment, there are plans to relax restrictions in the real estate sector. The AAP has this report: The changes will be implemented from next weekend with real estate agents urged to limit the number of people viewing properties and attending auctions and to follow stringent cleaning guidelines including ensuring people don\u2019t touch surfaces. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said it won\u2019t be like the \u201cold ways\u201d with social distancing to be adhered to and real estate agents to keep detailed contact records of people attending open homes and auctions and to consider extended times for open house viewings and inspections. \u201cThe community has done an outstanding job in limiting the spread of Covid-19 and we need to make sure we continue to exercise vigilance and care,\u201d he said. Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said the relaxing of restrictions was a sign of the ongoing success in limiting the spread of Covid-19, but warned there was no place for complacency. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said NSW has had a bumper weekend for testing so far with more than 7,000 tests conducted on Saturday. Four new cases were confirmed, two of which were connected to the Newmarch House aged care facility. NSW now has 3,035 Covid-19 cases with 14 people in intensive care including 11 who require ventilators. More than 2,300 people have recovered from the virus. Just back to the NSW Health Minister\u2019s press conference. Brad Hazzard said he was confident the state government had done everything it could to assist Newmarch house control the outbreak. I\u2019m relying on health advice obviously... but talking to the front line staff, the top of the top in terms of an infecious disease specialist. He is certainly saying we are, and so is the federal government and so is Anglicare in a sense. But it\u2019s been very challenging because obviously they have a huge number of people who were taken offline initially. The federal government had to then get Aspen medical, who then had to rely on a whole lot of agencies to bring people in ... My only debate with Anglicare was about communication. The most recent death of a Covid-19 positive patient at the Newmarch House aged care home is reported to be 76-year-old Ann Fahey. My colleagues Michael McGowan and Elias Visontay spoke to Ann\u2019s son Mark last week after he learned his mother had been diagnosed. She had previously tested negative to Covid-19 twice before she returned a positive test on Thursday. You can read their full report on the situation at Newmarch House here: Queenslanders are taking advantage of relaxed restrictions today, which, among other things, allows residents to go for a drive within 50km of home, use boats and jet skis, have picnics, visit national parks and shop for non-essential items. We\u2019re expecting the NRL\u2019s New Zealand Warriors to arrive in the country today, after being given an exemption from travel restrictions by home affairs minister Peter Dutton. They\u2019ll base themselves in Tamworth ahead of the season\u2019s resumption on 28 May. They\u2019re expected to be away from home until October, though Warriors boss Cameron George has expressed hope players\u2019 families may be able to follow in coming months. More from Plibersek on schools: If the federal government is really concerned about educational disadvantage, then it should properly fund all schools based on need, they\u2019re not doing that. So you\u2019ll excuse me for being a little bit sceptical about their newfound interest in disadvantaged students... Suddenly you\u2019re trying to bully or control or bribe schools to return against the medical advice in those states. That makes no sense at all. Federal shadow minister for health Tanya Plibersek is speaking now in Sydney. She criticised federal education minister Dan Tehan\u2019s comments on ABC this morning: A few weeks ago Scott Morrison was saying, \u2018listen to your state premiers when it comes to sending your kids back to school\u2019. And this morning we saw the federal education minister, sending the most confusing messages to parents about sending their kids to school, saying that they should do so immediately. This is a very difficult and stressful time for families, families are doing the very best they can, in extraordinary unprecedented circumstances, and to have a big political fight between the states and the Commonwealth, and accounts to schooling is the very last thing they need. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said two more people connected with Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House has tested positive to Covid-19. Neither are residents. \u201cOne of those was someone who had been in close contact with the case and had been in isolation for a period of time,\u201d she said. She said the other case was under investigation. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to test the residents in a regular fashion, looking for signs and symptoms.\u201d Today, Anglicare confirmed the death of a 76-year-old female patient, who was being treated at the Nepean Hospital. She is the 14th resident to die at the facility after testing positive to Covid-19. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking now about the Anglicare Newmarch House aged care home, which today confirmed the 14th death of a resident. There will now be a daily testing regime of every staff member walking into that facility. That will obviously have its own challenges ... I\u2019m asking staff just to be patient of what is quite an uncomfortable procedure on a daily basis... I seemed to me that, in talking to the infectious disease specialists, that this is a really good step we could take. Hazzard said it\u2019s \u201cnot a good thing to be blaming people who are at the front line\u201d. This comes after criticism of Newmarch House\u2019s infection control procedures as staff and residents continue to test positive despite more than two weeks of lockdown. When the chair of the National Covid Coordination Commission singled out an ammonia plant at the top of the list of projects to kickstart the economy, it raised a few eyebrows. Anne Davies has the full report: Just back to Queensland for a moment, they have recorded only one new case of Covid-19 overnight. Bringing the total number of active cases across the state to 53, AAP reports. Health minister Steven Miles said the state total was now 1,035 with 976 having recovered from the virus. Forty-six of the active cases are located in the south-east of the state, four in Cairns, two in Townsville and one in the Wide Bay region. Nine people are in hospital and four in intensive care. Miles also said the government would consider a staggered reopening of schools, which remain closed until 22 May other than for students of essential workers and vulnerable children. He said the results of this week\u2019s easing of restrictions would help the government plan how and when to send children back to the classroom: In some ways, the restrictions that we eased this weekend will help inform that decision because ... those restrictions were related to mobility. Once schools open up more, we will create a lot more mobility ... parents taking kids to school, teachers in the classroom, kids going to and from school. Australia isn\u2019t the only country with a contact tracing app, but how does ours compare? Guardian Australia\u2019s Josh Taylor explains exactly how our app stacks up: More from Mikakos on Tehan\u2019s condemnation of the Victorian government approach to schools: We look forward to the prime minister coming out today and explaining what he thinks of these comments. [If they] reflect the position of his government. I refer you back to the prime minister\u2019s comments only recently that Victorian parents should listen to the advice of the Victorian premier. Stacey has shared this photo of her family outing to Mount Coot-tha, taking advantage of Queensland\u2019s relaxed lockdown laws. Send me your weekend pics on Twitter (@MatildaBoseley). Mikakos was asked if the state government should name the meat processing plant currently experiencing an outbreak to allow concerned truck drivers to be tested. This is a closed work setting where more than 300 staff members have now been tested ... all the staff have been provided with the relevant information. I would encourage if anyone has any concerns whatsoever about this potential about this outbreak and potentially feel that they might have been exposed in some way that they can call the crime of our virus hotline. In this case the decision has been made by the public health team that there\u2019s no need to identify this location by name. Journalists at the press conference have questioned why Mikakos named the school affected by Covid-19 earlier in the press conference but not this meat processing plant. Mikakos holds firms on Victorian children learning from home. From day one we have always said that we will share all the information the advice with the Victorian community that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing. We have been saying that we are following the advice of Victoria\u2019s chief health officer and advice remains unchanged... If your child can learn at home, they must learn at home. Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos was asked about federal education minister Dan Tehan\u2019s comments on Insiders this morning. I think, Victorians understand and know who\u2019s been leading Victoria, to keep them safe to suppress the number of cases that we\u2019re seeing of coronavirus in Victoria, and it\u2019s certainly not been Dan Tehan... I encourage Victorian parents to continue to heed the advice of our government, and we are in fact the government that runs our schools in Victoria... If we just look to the fact today that we\u2019ve had a staff member [at a Victorian school] test positive. I\u2019m sure that then Tehan would have liked to have had that knowledge that the premier has had, that I have had, that our education minister has had, before making those remarks earlier today. Health minister Jenny Mikakos says a teacher has tested positive for Covid-19 at the Meadowglen Primary School in Epping. The schools will be closed for three days ... to enable a thorough cleaning to occur. She said students who can not undertake online learning would be supported in attending a neighbouring school for these days. This comes as the federal government continues to put pressure on Victoria to reopen schools to all students. Health Minister Jenny Mikakos says there are 13 new cases in Victoria. Six are from an outbreak in a meat processing factory, four were from recently returned overseas travellers and three were discovered Victoria\u2019s \u201ctesting blitz\u201d. This brings the state total to 1,384 cases. There were no new deaths overnight. Queensland health minister Steven Miles says the state government has purchased an additional 35 anaesthetic machines in part as a safeguard in case of a second wave in Covid-19. We ordered these machines as part of our surge planning, when we were planning for the worst, when we anticipated the worst, when we thought Brisbane and Queensland would look like New York City today. The AAP is reporting Queensland police handed out dozens of notices for breaches of Covid-19 directions on the first official day of eased lockdown laws. From Saturday, residents could travel up to 50km from their home to shop, visit a park or even go to the drive-in, but the two person gathering limit and physical distancing requirements still applied. Police handed out 32 on-the-spot fines for $1,334 on Saturday. So far 1,664 on-the-spot fines for Covid-19 related infringements have been issued, totalling more than $2.19m. ABC is reporting that the Victoria government will announce the closure of a school due to Covid-19. This comes as federal education minister Dan Tehan accuses Victorian premier Daniel Andrews of taking a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education by refusing to reopen schools along with other states. Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos will front press around 10.30am this morning and hopefully, we will be able to bring you more details then. Newmarch House has confirmed the 14th death of a resident diagnosed with Covid-19. They released this statement this morning: Anglicare is saddened to advise that a resident of Newmarch House who had tested positive for Covid-19 passed away in hospital yesterday 2 May. The family has been contacted as have all relevant authorities. This is a very sad time for the family and a distressing and challenging time for residents and staff as we deal with the impact of this dreadful virus. As of yesterday afternoon, 37 residents have tested positive and tragically now 14 have died. In addition, 26 staff have tested positive and as a consequence 63 have been in isolation. Anglicare has, in consultation with the commonwealth government, been able to source infection control specialists with experience in dealing with highly infectious diseases. Their roles will be to monitor and supervise all infection control protocols and advice and direct development of additional procedures should they be required. The carers who we discovered were infected on Friday and announced yesterday, were experienced with infectious disease situations which indicates just how contagious this is and how difficult to contain. Alternative accommodation options for people who are Covid-19 negative are being discussed with some residents and their families and of course, this is possible, provided there is a good understanding of the risks and precautionary measures that this would involve \u2013 for the resident and their families. Families of residents who have questions about this are encouraged to contact OPAN (Older Persons Advocacy Network). Our prayers and thoughts are with our grieving Newmarch House families and also with our staff who have worked so closely with the residents and their families. We are thankful for the ongoing support provided by government departments and their specialist staff. Federal education minister Dan Tehan was asked if it still the federal government\u2019s advice that Victorian parents only need to listen to the premier as to whether they should send their kids to school. His response: So the prime minister said that after seven national principles had been agreed by the national cabinet. The first of those principles was then having teachers in the classroom and students in the classroom is the best way we educate our children. The fifth one of those was that we need to make sure that we\u2019re following the national medical advice and state medical advice important national or state medical advice. One of the most controversial points from Dan Tehan\u2019s Insiders interview, he slammed Victoria premier Daniel Andrews for refusing to reopen schools. Over the past week, education minister Dan Tehan has been pushing a hard line on schools reopening sooner rather than late, at odds with Victoria\u2019s cautious approach. He was asked if online schools should continue after the lockdown is over: It depends ultimately on the capability of the school to be able to do it but I think one of the good things which has come out of this pandemic, if there is good thing, is that our ability to be able to provide online learning, when students need it. So for instance, if a student\u2019s sick, you might have a student who\u2019s suspended. If you will be able to offer online learning so that implication plays playing so I think it\u2019s really, really important. States including Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory are enjoying their first weekend with loosened physical distancing restrictions. If you are among the lucky ones, tweet me (@MatildaBoseley) photos of your weekend activities and I might share them here on the blog. Each state and territory is doing things slightly differently, so here is the breakdown: Queensland \u2013 Residents in the sunshine state are once again allowed to enjoy the sunshine. No longer do you have to be exercising (or pretending to) in order visit a park. Picnics are legal again, so are weekend drives and getting out on the water on a boat or jet ski. But you have to stay within 50km of home and the two-person gathering rules still apply. NSW \u2013 Up to two adults (and any children in their care) are allowed to visit any other person\u2019s household. Physical distancing must still be observed, but you can travel as far as you want (within NSW), and even stay the night. Western Australia - The two-person limit on gathering has been increased to ten, but social distancing must still be observed. Northern Territory \u2013 Outdoor activities are back on the table, such as public swimming pools, going to national parks or fishing with a mate. If you are having an outdoor wedding or funeral the restrictions on visitor numbers have also been lifted. You can find a full description of each state and territory\u2019s laws here: Travel agency Flight Centre will refund thousands of customers who it hit with fees to cancel trips called off because of the coronavirus crisis, the consumer watchdog says. From 13 March, Flight Centre charged customers $300 to cancel an international flight or $50 to cancel a domestic one. In a statement, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said: Flight Centre\u2019s decision follows weeks of pressure from the ACCC for Flight Centre to improve its treatment of customers during Covid-19 travel restrictions. The ACCC said its next step would have been court action if Flight Centre did not change its position. This announcement will provide faster relief for consumers than would have been likely to have resulted from any court action. The refunds are to be paid to customers of Flight Centre and other agents in its corporate group \u2013 Aunt Betty, Travel Associates, Student Universe, Universal Traveller and Jetescape Travel (trading as Byojet Travel). ABC is reporting a 14th resident has died at Newmarch House. The aged care home is in the centre of a Covid-19 outbreak. There have been 61 cases at the western Sydney aged care home. More details to come. Anglicare\u2019s chief executive says the organisation will raise the possibility of extracting residents from its western Sydney aged care home at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster with those living inside the facility. AAP reports that Newmarch House\u2019s infection control capacity has been brought into question after infections of residents and staff continue despite more than two weeks of lockdown. There have been 61 cases and 13 deaths related to transmission at the aged care home. Anglicare Sydney chief executive Grant Millard said \u201cit would seem that\u2019s fairly obvious that there have been failings\u201d. When asked whether there would come a point where Anglicare would decide to remove some residents from the aged care home, Mr Millard said the option would be brought up with those living at Newmarch House. \u201cIn small numbers to date that we\u2019ve had discussions and this is something that we\u2019re going to raise with residents in our communication shortly,\u201d Mr Millard said. NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay called on the government to give all Newmarch residents, even ones who were healthy, the option of being moved to the public hospital system. Passengers on a Qantas flight to Brisbane are being urged to contact Queensland health officials after one person was diagnosed with Covid-19. This report via AAP: The state\u2019s single new case was confirmed on Saturday and has prompted a public health alert. Passengers on flight QF614 from Melbourne to Brisbane on 22 April are being told to call 13 HEALTH to speak to officials, who will ask about their health and give some advice. \u201cWe ask that passengers seated in rows 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 of this flight, who have not already been contacted by Queensland Health to call 13 HEALTH and advise that you were a passenger on this flight,\u201d a statement from the health department said. \u201cAll other passengers are considered very low risk, however anyone with health concerns can contact 13 HEALTH.\u201d The passenger who tested positive had recently returned from overseas and is linked to a cruise ship carrying passengers who later tested for the virus, health minister Steven Miles said on Saturday. Not all of the passengers on the flight will be asked to go into quarantine. Good morning everyone, Matilda Boseley here to guide you through this fine Sunday morning. To start, why don\u2019t we have a look back at what happened yesterday. The Northern Territories broke its 25-day streak of no new Covid-19 cases. Two Australian defence force members recently returned from the Middle East, tested positive. This brings the total active cases in the NT to five. Three other states recorded new cases on Saturday. Queensland had one, New South Wales five and Victoria seven. There were no new deaths announced. A coronavirus cluster emerged at an unnamed Melbourne meat processing facility, with eight workers testing positive. Some states started to lift restrictions. Queenslanders were allowed non-essential travel up to 50km from their homes for recreation, but had to stick to social distancing rules. The National Rugby League\u2019s hopes for a restart by 28 May were boosted when the New Zealand Warriors were told they could fly into the Tamworth tomorrow. Australia\u2019s peak medical body, the AMA, urged the NRL and other sporting codes to be cautious as they planned their returns. Australia\u2019s US ambassador, Arthur Sinodinos, said calls for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus were not about retribution or revenge against China, but \u201cgetting the facts\u201d. As we travel along today let me know if I\u2019ve missed anything over Twitter or at matilda.boseley@theguardian.com.au",

      "bodyText": "After an ill-fated Antarctic expedition in which 60% of passengers and crew contracted coronavirus and spent a month stranded off the coast of South America, the successful repatriation of 132 tourists from a Australian cruise ship seemed like a rare happy ending. But what should have been a peaceful epilogue in which the crew of the Greg Mortimer sailed safely home has become a gruesome sequel of sickness and panic \u2013 with the added possibility of a legal battle in Miami courts. In recent days, tensions onboard the stranded ship reached a breaking point over allegations that the ship\u2019s operators and captain pressured the chief medical officer to mislead authorities in Uruguay about the health situation onboard. Emails seen by the Guardian appear to show that two companies associated with the Greg Mortimer \u2013 Miami-based crewing company CMI/Sunstone and the Australian cruise operator Aurora Expeditions \u2013 urged Dr Mauricio Usme to downplay the severity of the outbreak. A doctor from a third company linked to the vessel \u2013 the Fort Lauderdale medical company Vikand \u2013 also allegedly suggested Usme should play down the health situation onboard. The ship remains anchored 20km off the coast of Uruguay. Thirty-three members of its 85-strong crew \u2013 including Dr Usme \u2013 have tested positive for coronavirus, and one has died of Covid-19. \u201cMore will continue getting sick,\u201d Usme told the Guardian over a tenuous WhatsApp connection. \u201cWe\u2019re all exposed to the risk of potential death as long as we remain onboard, because having coronavirus is like having a timebomb ticking inside you that could go off at any moment.\u201d Usme and eight other crew members have retained the services of Miami maritime lawyer Louis Vucci. \u201cAt some point there could be legal action for them getting Covid unnecessarily,\u201d Vucci told the Guardian. The Greg Mortimer set out from the Argentinian port of Ushuaia on 15 March \u2013 four days after the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared an international pandemic. After a week at sea, coronavirus symptoms were detected, but by then, Argentina had closed its ports to cruise ships, so the Greg Mortimer changed course to Uruguay. As they neared Montevideo, Usme completed a maritime declaration of health \u2013 a standard form reporting the possible existence of infectious disease onboard. Usme had already divided the ship into red, grey and yellow zones, for passengers in isolation, quarantine or observation. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have test kits onboard, so I had to assume that anybody with symptoms was positive.\u201d In his health declaration for Montevideo, Usme stated: \u201cWe have patients with fever we need to rule out with specific test Covid-19/Sars2.\u201d But before submitting the declaration, Usme received emails from CMI/Sunstone and Aurora Expeditions, apparently urging him to change his answers. \u201cThe risk we carry is public outcry and wharf side workers refusing to allow the ship to berth and allow passengers to disembark,\u201d wrote Aurora director Glenn Haifer in an email dated 26 March. \u201cPlease bear in mind that how you write the health declaration will influence the way that this is viewed. We don\u2019t know we have Covid-19.\u201d Haifer added: \u201cGive limited information truthfully.\u201d Usme replied: \u201cFor ethics, for morality, for responsibility with ourselves and with the health of those who are not affected, the health declaration must reflect the reality that we currently have.\u201d A spokesman for Aurora said: \u201cWe strongly disagree with the characterisation of the situation, but understanding that legal action has commenced between various other parties, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.\u2019\u2019 The email from CMI argued that Usme should change his answer to a question about quarantine as the ship had not officially been put under quarantine. A spokesman for CMI denied that any pressure was put on Usme, saying: \u201cThe doctor was asked to accurately and truthfully complete the health declaration form.\u201d The spokesman added that CMI and the vessel worked closely with the Uruguayan authorities on every aspect of the vessel\u2019s arrival. \u201cThis was done with full and complete transparency at every step,\u201d he said. But at least two other crew members claimed pressure was brought to bear on the medical officer. An audio recording heard by the Guardian suggests that, as the ship approached Montevideo, the ship\u2019s Swedish captain, Joachim S\u00e4terskog, offered to change the doctor\u2019s declaration, as the ship had not been placed under quarantine by authorities. \u201cThe company wanted to disembark the passengers, which was very irresponsible because they would have represented a great risk for Uruguay,\u201d ship storekeeper Marvin Paz Medina told the Guardian in a WhatsApp message. Usme refused to reconsider and the unaltered declaration was sent to port authorities on 28 March \u2013 with the result that Uruguay did not allow the Greg Mortimer to disembark. It was not until 11 April that a \u201csanitary corridor\u201d was established for the first group of passengers to fly home to Australia, with a second flight leaving for the US a few days later. Crew members maintain that the ship\u2019s managers endangered passengers and crew by persisting with the cruise despite the WHO declaration of a pandemic. \u201cWe were convinced that, in light of the international pandemic alert already in place by then, this trip would be cancelled,\u201d the ship\u2019s security officer, Lukasz Zuterek, told the Guardian. Zuterek says he has been dismissed from duties and confined to his cabin, despite testing negative, after he recently spoke up against a plan by management to sail the ship to the Canary Islands. The crew remains in limbo. Uruguay will not let them disembark until they all test negative for more than 14 days. \u201cWe are very afraid, one of us already died, five others have been extremely ill,\u201d said Paz Medina. S\u00e4terskog on Thursday sent a message to all crew members assuring them that none of them would be forced to sail across the Atlantic against their will. \u201cWe are staying in Montevideo to make sure the entire ship is tested negative or until we receive permission from local authorities to disembark crew when commercial flights are available again,\u201d he wrote. Crew members, meanwhile, are demanding to be evacuated via special charter flights as the passengers were. Both CMI and Aurora said that the decision to set sail on 15 March was made \u201con the basis of the best information available to us at the time\u201d, adding that no passengers or crew were suspected of having contracted coronavirus at the time of boarding. CMI also said that on the day the ship set sail, only two coronavirus cases had been confirmed in the entire province of Tierra del Fuego, which includes Ushuaia. \u201cWe were very aware of the globally evolving coronavirus situation and after deep consideration and having sought and received guidance from trusted and globally respected advisers, the decision was made to proceed. The safety and wellbeing of our passengers has always been paramount,\u201d said a spokesperson for Aurora. \u201cWe understand the frustrations of crew in this unprecedented emergency and believe \u2026 that the real issue is the repatriation of our seafarers, truly essential workers around the globe, throughout the pandemic,\u201d said a spokesperson for CMI. Vikand and S\u00e4terskog did not respond to a request for comment.",

You could also try the BBC\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07r39cw\">Tunnel 29</a></em>, the brilliant true story of young men who dug a tunnel from west Berlin to east Berlin in the 60s and then smuggled people out.</p> <p>Jon Ronson\u2019s excellent, morally questioning two series about the porn industry, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Butterfly-Effect-Jon-Ronson/dp/B073JT718M\">The Butterfly Effect</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/audible/the-butterfly-effect-with-jon-ronson/e/59972665\">The Last Days of August</a></em>, unfold like thrillers.

Two of the most gripping are <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/\">Dirty John</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://livediela.com/#close\">To Live and Die </a></em><em><a href=\"https://livediela.com/#close\">in LA</a></em>, plus there\u2019s a great <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/joe-exotic/\">Joe Exotic: Tiger King</a></em> podcast that\u2019s far more in-depth than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/03/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-tv\">the Netflix show</a>.</p> <p>For fiction: <em><a href=\"https://www.werealive.com/\">We\u2019re Alive</a></em> is an absorbing, sprawling zombie series that came out in 2009, with a final series last year. It\u2019s had more than 200m downloads, and is definitely addictive. Also older but worth trying are <em><a href=\"https://twoupproductions.com/limetown/podcast\">Limetown</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/homecoming/episodes\">Homecoming</a></em>, which features David Schwimmer. Last year\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/blackout/id1447513097\">Blackout</a></em>, starring Rami Malek, is set in the US during a nationwide power grid outage, so there are some unsettling parallels with our current situation.

I highly recommend <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06spcbl\">The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06spb8w/episodes/downloads\">The Whisperer in Darkness</a></em>, Julian Simpson\u2019s up-to-the-minute reworkings of HP Lovecraft. The shows are made as though you\u2019re listening to a podcast called <em>Mystery Machine</em>, and are properly scary and weird (there\u2019s an extra EP towards the end of the second series that is exceptionally chilling).</p> <p>There are more spooky stories in <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07mxgxl\">Tracks</a></em>, written by Matthew Broughton: four excellently frightening series (the last came out in October last year), in which Dr Helen Ash is put through all sorts of terrifying wringers. <em>The Ash Tree</em>, made by Bafflegab, has just won a big award, and is short enough to binge in one go. <em>The Tower</em> is experimental and atmospheric. Humour? <em><a href=\"https://www.victoriocity.com/\">Victoriocity</a></em> is a funny show, as are <em><a href=\"https://www.woodenovercoats.com/\">Wooden Overcoats</a></em> and the brilliant <em><a href=\"https://www.beefanddairynetwork.com/\">Beef and Dairy Network Podcast</a></em>. <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/series/m000fpnb\">This Thing of Darkness</a></em>, also from the BBC, is unusual: a forensic psychiatrist follows the psychiatric impact of the murder of a young man on his family, while working with prisoners in group therapy.</p> <p><strong>Any recommendations for UK politics and current affairs podcasts beyond the Guardian and BBC?<br></strong><em>Sean Clayton</em></p> <p>If you\u2019re anti-Brexit, you might find your crew in <em><a href=\"https://www.remainiacs.com/\">Remainiacs</a></em>, where a bunch of clever people talk about what leaving Europe means and might mean in the future \u2013 and yes, it\u2019s still going, despite our farewell to the EU on 31 January, and despite coronavirus. From the same small podcasting company comes politics show <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker\">The Bunker</a></em>, which is just as insider-y and on-the-button, only without so much Brexit. <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker\">The Tortoise Podcast</a></em> is a newbie show that takes stories (not just from the UK, though there are a lot) and goes into more detail than most. And <em><a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/iain-dale/for-the-many-subscribe-lbc-brand-new-podcast-now/\">For the Many</a></em>, from LBC, is an upbeat and informed show with LBC presenter Iain Dale (confessed Thatcherite) and former Labour home secretary Jacqui Smith (obviously not) having a laugh while dissecting the UK\u2019s current affairs and politics. Dale ensures that they cover all the right topics, and the atmosphere is clever, but light (and quite fnar fnar).</p> <p><strong>I spend a lot of time playing video games. I am new to podcasts. Are there any out there for me?<br></strong><em>Iain Noble</em></p> <p>You\u2019re in luck! A brand new video game podcast has just come out: <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0874xc6\">This Game Changed My Life</a></em>. Games experts Aoife Wilson and Julia Hardy interview someone new every week about how, precisely, they were changed by a console, a virtual world and umpteen levels. These are far from ordinary stories: try the episode with Abdullah, who escaped the Syrian civil war when he was 18 \u2013 in an oil barrel at one point \u2013 and then made a computer game about it. <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrxgq/episodes/downloads\">Let\u2019s Talk About Tech</a></em> is more straightforward: chatty, up-to-date, useful. One of the most longstanding video games podcast from the US is the <em><a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/shows/630-npcs-are-here/2970-20108\">Giant Bombcast</a></em>, which is exactly how you imagine (a bro/nerd/bantz-cast that could benefit from an editing button) and has been going so long, there are more than 600 episodes to choose from\u2026 Interesting fact: one of the <em>Giant Bombcast</em>\u2019s previous video producers is Drew Scanlon, known across the internet as the sceptical \u201cblinking white guy\u201d meme.</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t want to listen to more grisly true crime. Are there any mysteries without the murder you can recommend?<br></strong><em>Olly Watson</em></p> <p>There\u2019s a nice branch of true crime that we might call true crime schadenfreude, where fast-talking, hubristic, money-mad charlatans (usually) get caught out. Here are a few: <em>Un</em><em>cover</em>\u2019s first series, <em><a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/radio/uncover/uncover-season-1-escaping-nxivm-1.4675949\">Escaping NXIVM</a></em>, about a weird self-improvement movement/cult that involved the actor Allison Mack from <em>Smallville</em>; <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/\">WeCrashed</a></em>, which tells the story of the once-madly successful WeWork real estate firm and how its bubble burst; <em><a href=\"https://abcaudio.com/podcasts/the-dropout/\">The Dropout</a></em>, which follows Elizabeth Holmes and her blood-testing company Theranos; <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07nkd84/episodes/downloads\">The Missing Cryptoqueen</a></em>, about a bitcoin pyramid scheme\u2026 All are presented in that OMG-what\u2019s-next? true-crime manner, but the body counts are very low.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Music rights are still a problem for many podcasts \u2013 podcasters can\u2019t play full tracks because it costs too much</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You might also like the schlocky but addictive <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/american-scandal/\">American Scandal</a></em>, which has covered the Lenny Bruce obscenity trial, Enron and other unsavoury but non-murderous events (avoid Waco, for obvious death reasons). Or <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p081ylhn/episodes/downloads\">Mortem</a></em>, which gives us a crime that never actually happened, but uses real experts to solve it. Or how about politics-as-whodunnits? Try <em><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/\">Floodlines</a></em>, about the Katrina hurricane response; the first two <em><a href=\"https://slate.com/podcasts/slow-burn/s1/watergate\">Slate Slow </a></em><em><a href=\"https://slate.com/podcasts/slow-burn/s1/watergate\">Burn</a></em> series; or <em><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/projects/other-latif-series\">The Other Latif</a></em>, a personal tale that leads to Guantanamo Bay.<strong><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/floodlines/\"><br></a></strong></p> <p><strong>I have just turned 50, am raising a family and tend to listen to Radio 4</strong><strong>. Podcasts have so far eluded me. What is the appeal of them? Are there any the family could enjoy together</strong><strong>?<br></strong><em>Victoria (a confused working mum of young teenage boys)</em></p> <p>Podcasts are, almost always, designed for individual listening, on headphones. So, you find the ones you like, subscribe to them, and then they turn up regularly on your phone and you listen whenever you want. Very few podcasts are made for group listening, though some can work that way\u2026 <em><a href=\"https://www.offmenupodcast.co.uk/\">Off Menu</a></em> with Ed Gamble and James Acaster is funny and warm, and has guests with teenage appeal. <em><a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all\">Reply All</a></em>, which seems to be about technology but is in fact about humanity, is occasionally a bit adult (drug mentions) but there are many episodes that are great for teenagers: try episodes <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/6nh3wk\">102</a> and <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/76h5gl/103-long-distance-part-ii\">103</a>, where Alex Goldman goes to India to try to track down a scam caller; <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/xjhewe/114-apocalypse-soon\">114</a>, which discusses Logan Paul; <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/49ho5a/130-the-snapchat-thief\">130</a>, about a Snapchat scam; or <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2h8bx/158-the-case-of-the-missing-hit\">158</a>, where a listener tries to track down an earworm of a pop song. Emotive and gripping, it\u2019s a perfect episode. <em><a href=\"https://answermethispodcast.com/\">Answer Me This!</a></em>, the longstanding listener-question podcast, definitely works as a family listen. If your sons like football, my son (14) recommends <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeFApGnSnG4\">HITC FTW</a></em>, a YouTube podcast that works without visuals. However, it\u2019s very likely to drive you personally bananas, so check out some of my other recommendations. Then you can get your own podcast habit, put on your headphones and ignore your children as and when you please.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36ceeef2ae23f29dfa15e5cbf40ecef95f8ac9ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ceeef2ae23f29dfa15e5cbf40ecef95f8ac9ca/0_118_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Off Menu presenters Ed Gamble and James Acaster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Off Menu presenters Ed Gamble and James Acaster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Publicity image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Can you recommend a good music podcast with people being interviewed?<br></strong><em>Marcus</em></p> <p>Music rights are still a problem for many podcasts \u2013 podcasters can\u2019t play full tracks because it costs too much money and is too difficult to arrange \u2013 though record companies might start working a bit harder to find a solution now Spotify is focusing on podcasts.

Our children can learn history, maths, languages, anything academic \u2013 yet self-esteem is not a teachable subject in the UK, apparently. As you might imagine, the US has plenty. One of the biggest \u2013 and most alien to the UK listeners \u2013 is <em><a href=\"https://app.kidslisten.org/pod/Dream-Big-Podcast\">Dream Big</a></em>. Presented by 10-year-old Eva Karpman and her mum Olga, this podcast interviews some big names and is usually about 20 minutes long. There are some nice short episodes made specifically for our lockdown, such as how to deal with your annoying siblings.</p> <p>Less irritating is <em><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/shortandcurly/episodes/\">Short and Curly</a></em>, which looks at tricky questions such as: \u201cAre you free?\u201d <em><a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/fierce-girls/\">Fierce Girls</a></em>, from Australia, tells dramatised life stories of feisty Aussie women; <em><a href=\"https://www.rebelgirls.com/pages/podcast\">Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls</a></em> has new tales of excellent women, in the same style as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-review-inspiring-stuff-elena-favilli-francesca-callo\">bestselling book</a>, read out loud, one per episode. To be honest, I remember learning confidence from various literary heroes and heroines when I was young, so you might also want to check out the numerous audiobooks for kids (<a href=\"https://www.audible.co.uk/cat/Children-Audiobooks/535836031?source_code=M2M30DFT1BkSH10161400A4&amp;&amp;ipRedirectOverride=true\">Audible</a> is offering them free at the moment), or story podcasts (<a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/\">Fun Kids</a> has loads to offer here). </p> <p><strong>Podcasts to drift off to sleep to, please. </strong><strong>Nothing too heavy!<br></strong><em>Antony O\u2019Brien</em></p> <p>Personally, I find single voice podcasts are often the way to go if you want to fall asleep: you could try Michael Goldfarb\u2019s podcast <em><a href=\"https://www.goldfarbpod.com/\">FRDH \u2013 First Rough Draft of History</a></em>. He has one of the loveliest voices in radio, plus an experienced journalist\u2019s eye, so if you don\u2019t drift off, you\u2019ll be learning all the while. Helen Zaltzman\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/\">The Allusionist</a></em> is making calming podcasts for these uncalm times: <em><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/category/Tranquillusionist\">The Tranquillusionist</a></em> features her reading out soothing words, or the names of dogshow winners. <em><a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes\">You Must Remember This</a></em>, Karina Longworth\u2019s long-running show about Hollywood\u2019s darker side, is pretty relaxing too (careful with the Manson episodes\u2026), mostly because her tone is quite unwavering. There\u2019s a bit of music, but not too much. Skip the adverts at the beginning.</p> <p><strong>Miranda, anything </strong><strong>you could recommend </strong><strong>that relates to being a wom</strong><strong>an, in her </strong><strong>50s, who feels invisible in the world</strong><strong>? </strong><strong> I could just do with listening to a little honesty and humour from like-minded women (</strong><strong>preferably not celebs </strong>\u2013<strong> </strong><strong>for me, well</strong><strong>being is tainted by the word \u201cG</strong><strong>oop\u201d!).<br></strong><em>Jacqueline Wood</em></p> <p>Warning: I would avoid almost every US podcast with the word mid-life in its title. But there are a couple of great UK ones out there. <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p04x5pd7\">Fortunately\u2026 with Fi and Jane</a></em> (Glover and Garvey), while not directly dealing with midlife, is genuinely life-affirming, mostly because Glover and Garvey\u2019s middle-agey-ness comes through with warmth and realism, and not too much hand-wringing. They interview guests, but not very Goop-y ones.</p> <p>Lorraine Candy and Trish Halpin, both women\u2019s magazine supremos, recently started <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/postcardsfrommidlife\">Postcards from Midlife</a></em>. As you might imagine, in this podcast middle age is dealt with in a glossy-mag manner, with direct discussions about libido changes, skin differences and how to cope with teenagers. <em><a href=\"https://www.thelastbohemians.co.uk/\">The Last Bohemians</a></em>, about older, free-spirited women, is a great podcast to help us middle-aged ones remember that there is plenty of life out there still to be lived.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"95dfdb1d28b619bf2e7fdf4e186107800bde0062\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95dfdb1d28b619bf2e7fdf4e186107800bde0062/79_401_3541_4426/800.jpg\" alt=\"Fi Glover and Jane Garvey present Fortunately... with Fi and Jane.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fi Glover and Jane Garvey present Fortunately... with Fi and Jane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>I love </strong><em><strong>Radiolab</strong></em><strong>, but is there anything like it and just as good?<br></strong><em>Ken Peel</em></p> <p>There\u2019s not really anything quite the same as <em>Radiolab</em>\u2019s forensic reporting and experimental sound techniques, but there are shows that are just as good.

      "bodyText": "I love true crime such as Australian True Crime and Serial. What should I try next? I\u2019m willing to try fiction. Robyn Peston There are loads of documentary series for you. I presume you\u2019ve already done S-Town, which out-Serials Serial in its presenter-led, gradually revelatory, unexpectedly moving truths. You could also try the BBC\u2019s Tunnel 29, the brilliant true story of young men who dug a tunnel from west Berlin to east Berlin in the 60s and then smuggled people out. Jon Ronson\u2019s excellent, morally questioning two series about the porn industry, The Butterfly Effect and The Last Days of August, unfold like thrillers. And true crime: well, where should I start? Two of the most gripping are Dirty John and To Live and Die in LA, plus there\u2019s a great Joe Exotic: Tiger King podcast that\u2019s far more in-depth than the Netflix show. For fiction: We\u2019re Alive is an absorbing, sprawling zombie series that came out in 2009, with a final series last year. It\u2019s had more than 200m downloads, and is definitely addictive. Also older but worth trying are Limetown and Homecoming, which features David Schwimmer. Last year\u2019s Blackout, starring Rami Malek, is set in the US during a nationwide power grid outage, so there are some unsettling parallels with our current situation. See the next question for British drama\u2026 What British drama podcasts are worth listening to? I have heard some of the American material like Night Vale and The Black Tapes\u2026 but are there any homegrown podcasts out there worth checking out? Adam British drama podcasts are getting a lot better. I highly recommend The Case of Charles Dexter Ward and The Whisperer in Darkness, Julian Simpson\u2019s up-to-the-minute reworkings of HP Lovecraft. The shows are made as though you\u2019re listening to a podcast called Mystery Machine, and are properly scary and weird (there\u2019s an extra EP towards the end of the second series that is exceptionally chilling). There are more spooky stories in Tracks, written by Matthew Broughton: four excellently frightening series (the last came out in October last year), in which Dr Helen Ash is put through all sorts of terrifying wringers. The Ash Tree, made by Bafflegab, has just won a big award, and is short enough to binge in one go. The Tower is experimental and atmospheric. Humour? Victoriocity is a funny show, as are Wooden Overcoats and the brilliant Beef and Dairy Network Podcast. This Thing of Darkness, also from the BBC, is unusual: a forensic psychiatrist follows the psychiatric impact of the murder of a young man on his family, while working with prisoners in group therapy. Any recommendations for UK politics and current affairs podcasts beyond the Guardian and BBC? Sean Clayton If you\u2019re anti-Brexit, you might find your crew in Remainiacs, where a bunch of clever people talk about what leaving Europe means and might mean in the future \u2013 and yes, it\u2019s still going, despite our farewell to the EU on 31 January, and despite coronavirus. From the same small podcasting company comes politics show The Bunker, which is just as insider-y and on-the-button, only without so much Brexit. The Tortoise Podcast is a newbie show that takes stories (not just from the UK, though there are a lot) and goes into more detail than most. And For the Many, from LBC, is an upbeat and informed show with LBC presenter Iain Dale (confessed Thatcherite) and former Labour home secretary Jacqui Smith (obviously not) having a laugh while dissecting the UK\u2019s current affairs and politics. Dale ensures that they cover all the right topics, and the atmosphere is clever, but light (and quite fnar fnar). I spend a lot of time playing video games. I am new to podcasts. Are there any out there for me? Iain Noble You\u2019re in luck! A brand new video game podcast has just come out: This Game Changed My Life. Games experts Aoife Wilson and Julia Hardy interview someone new every week about how, precisely, they were changed by a console, a virtual world and umpteen levels. These are far from ordinary stories: try the episode with Abdullah, who escaped the Syrian civil war when he was 18 \u2013 in an oil barrel at one point \u2013 and then made a computer game about it. Let\u2019s Talk About Tech is more straightforward: chatty, up-to-date, useful. One of the most longstanding video games podcast from the US is the Giant Bombcast, which is exactly how you imagine (a bro/nerd/bantz-cast that could benefit from an editing button) and has been going so long, there are more than 600 episodes to choose from\u2026 Interesting fact: one of the Giant Bombcast\u2019s previous video producers is Drew Scanlon, known across the internet as the sceptical \u201cblinking white guy\u201d meme. I don\u2019t want to listen to more grisly true crime. Are there any mysteries without the murder you can recommend? Olly Watson There\u2019s a nice branch of true crime that we might call true crime schadenfreude, where fast-talking, hubristic, money-mad charlatans (usually) get caught out. Here are a few: Uncover\u2019s first series, Escaping NXIVM, about a weird self-improvement movement/cult that involved the actor Allison Mack from Smallville; WeCrashed, which tells the story of the once-madly successful WeWork real estate firm and how its bubble burst; The Dropout, which follows Elizabeth Holmes and her blood-testing company Theranos; The Missing Cryptoqueen, about a bitcoin pyramid scheme\u2026 All are presented in that OMG-what\u2019s-next? true-crime manner, but the body counts are very low. You might also like the schlocky but addictive American Scandal, which has covered the Lenny Bruce obscenity trial, Enron and other unsavoury but non-murderous events (avoid Waco, for obvious death reasons). Or Mortem, which gives us a crime that never actually happened, but uses real experts to solve it. Or how about politics-as-whodunnits? Try Floodlines, about the Katrina hurricane response; the first two Slate Slow Burn series; or The Other Latif, a personal tale that leads to Guantanamo Bay. I have just turned 50, am raising a family and tend to listen to Radio 4. Podcasts have so far eluded me. What is the appeal of them? Are there any the family could enjoy together? Victoria (a confused working mum of young teenage boys) Podcasts are, almost always, designed for individual listening, on headphones. So, you find the ones you like, subscribe to them, and then they turn up regularly on your phone and you listen whenever you want. Very few podcasts are made for group listening, though some can work that way\u2026 Off Menu with Ed Gamble and James Acaster is funny and warm, and has guests with teenage appeal. Reply All, which seems to be about technology but is in fact about humanity, is occasionally a bit adult (drug mentions) but there are many episodes that are great for teenagers: try episodes 102 and 103, where Alex Goldman goes to India to try to track down a scam caller; 114, which discusses Logan Paul; 130, about a Snapchat scam; or 158, where a listener tries to track down an earworm of a pop song. Emotive and gripping, it\u2019s a perfect episode. Answer Me This!, the longstanding listener-question podcast, definitely works as a family listen. If your sons like football, my son (14) recommends HITC FTW, a YouTube podcast that works without visuals. However, it\u2019s very likely to drive you personally bananas, so check out some of my other recommendations. Then you can get your own podcast habit, put on your headphones and ignore your children as and when you please. Can you recommend a good music podcast with people being interviewed? Marcus Music rights are still a problem for many podcasts \u2013 podcasters can\u2019t play full tracks because it costs too much money and is too difficult to arrange \u2013 though record companies might start working a bit harder to find a solution now Spotify is focusing on podcasts. The classic music podcast is Song Exploder, a carefully produced show where musicians pull apart one of their own songs and explain how it was made. Dissect concentrates on albums, over a number of episodes, interviewing those who were involved; it\u2019s covered LPs by Kanye West, Frank Ocean, Tyler, the Creator, and two of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u2013 Damn and To Pimp a Butterfly. Questlove Supreme sees Questlove interview his musician friends in a revealing and engaging manner (Jimmy Jam is great); Spotify\u2019s Stay Free: The Story of the Clash and Slow Burn\u2019s Who Really Killed Biggie and Tupac? go in deep and detailed. The Sound of the Hound is about British recording history, the sound engineers that brought us the first recording studio and the music made there. Hello! I\u2019m looking for a podcast for children to listen to to boost their confidence\u2026 Karine Irving I really tried with this one, but there are very few British offerings. Our children can learn history, maths, languages, anything academic \u2013 yet self-esteem is not a teachable subject in the UK, apparently. As you might imagine, the US has plenty. One of the biggest \u2013 and most alien to the UK listeners \u2013 is Dream Big. Presented by 10-year-old Eva Karpman and her mum Olga, this podcast interviews some big names and is usually about 20 minutes long. There are some nice short episodes made specifically for our lockdown, such as how to deal with your annoying siblings. Less irritating is Short and Curly, which looks at tricky questions such as: \u201cAre you free?\u201d Fierce Girls, from Australia, tells dramatised life stories of feisty Aussie women; Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls has new tales of excellent women, in the same style as the bestselling book, read out loud, one per episode. To be honest, I remember learning confidence from various literary heroes and heroines when I was young, so you might also want to check out the numerous audiobooks for kids (Audible is offering them free at the moment), or story podcasts (Fun Kids has loads to offer here). Podcasts to drift off to sleep to, please. Nothing too heavy! Antony O\u2019Brien Personally, I find single voice podcasts are often the way to go if you want to fall asleep: you could try Michael Goldfarb\u2019s podcast FRDH \u2013 First Rough Draft of History. He has one of the loveliest voices in radio, plus an experienced journalist\u2019s eye, so if you don\u2019t drift off, you\u2019ll be learning all the while. Helen Zaltzman\u2019s The Allusionist is making calming podcasts for these uncalm times: The Tranquillusionist features her reading out soothing words, or the names of dogshow winners. You Must Remember This, Karina Longworth\u2019s long-running show about Hollywood\u2019s darker side, is pretty relaxing too (careful with the Manson episodes\u2026), mostly because her tone is quite unwavering. There\u2019s a bit of music, but not too much. Skip the adverts at the beginning. Miranda, anything you could recommend that relates to being a woman, in her 50s, who feels invisible in the world? I could just do with listening to a little honesty and humour from like-minded women (preferably not celebs \u2013 for me, wellbeing is tainted by the word \u201cGoop\u201d!). Jacqueline Wood Warning: I would avoid almost every US podcast with the word mid-life in its title. But there are a couple of great UK ones out there. Fortunately\u2026 with Fi and Jane (Glover and Garvey), while not directly dealing with midlife, is genuinely life-affirming, mostly because Glover and Garvey\u2019s middle-agey-ness comes through with warmth and realism, and not too much hand-wringing.

As you might imagine, in this podcast middle age is dealt with in a glossy-mag manner, with direct discussions about libido changes, skin differences and how to cope with teenagers. The Last Bohemians, about older, free-spirited women, is a great podcast to help us middle-aged ones remember that there is plenty of life out there still to be lived. I love Radiolab, but is there anything like it and just as good? Ken Peel There\u2019s not really anything quite the same as Radiolab\u2019s forensic reporting and experimental sound techniques, but there are shows that are just as good. You could try Love + Radio, which uses interesting sound techniques to tell personal (rather than scientific) stories. Or Have You Heard George\u2019s Podcast, where Benbrick\u2019s beautiful production helps George the Poet to weave the spell of his fact/fiction/social realism/music journalism/political discourse/poetry. 99% Invisible looks at design to help us understand how we live, but the production is much more straightforward. You might like The Memory Palace, too: history, emotion and gorgeous sound, with Nate DiMeo. I am a busy and sometimes quite isolated sheep farmer looking for a real sense of connection through listening: uplifting but honest conversations with all kinds of people about the beauty and challenges of their lives. Marie There used to be a great podcast for this: iPM, a spinoff from the PM show, where the stories were based around listeners\u2019 experiences. It\u2019s no longer made, but there are lots of episodes and some great true-life tales in there. Esther Perel\u2019s Where Should We Begin, where we hear real people discuss their relationship problems in a therapy session, is thoroughly absorbing and human, mostly because of Perel\u2019s steering and insights. And I found The Log Books, born of people\u2019s notes at the LGBTQ+ Switchboard helpline in the late 70s and early 80s, to be very moving.",

      "body": "<p>Hello friends! Do you fancy listening to \u201ca new type of time-shifted amateur radio\u201d? No? How about a brilliant podcast? Of course you do.</p> <p>Fifteen years ago, <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>, a magazine for fans of Apple products, announced, with limited fanfare, that Apple was about to add podcasts to iTunes, its music download offer. Unfortunately, few readers knew what a podcast was, hence <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>\u2019s \u201ctime-shifted radio\u201d definition. In June 2005, the idea of having thousands of ready-to-hear audio shows, anything from true-crime documentaries to all-chums-together comedy, to up-to-the-minute news to gripping drama to revealing interviews, and being able to listen to these shows whenever you want, wherever you are \u2013 well, that wasn\u2019t quite happening. So Apple\u2019s move didn\u2019t seem important. Nor did the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary added \u201cpodcast\u201d to its lexicon in the same year, after tech journalist Ben Hammersley came up with the term in 2004 (which was also the year the BBC launched a downloadable version of <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl\">In Our Time</a></em>)<strong>. </strong>Podcasts were new. It takes time for the new to become everyday.</p> <p>Podcasts were mostly unheard of, except by the tech savvy. They were either downloadable<strong> </strong>versions of existing radio shows or they were chatty riffs, made by amateurs who knew how to upload their aural blogs online. Still, they were interesting. At least to me. Soon after podcasts\u2019 iTunes debut, I started a new job as the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s radio critic. Great job \u2013 except there was a limited choice of programmes for me to review. Radio schedules rarely changed. Presenters stayed in their jobs for years. The BBC dominated speech radio, aside from phone-ins; hardly any other broadcaster had the money to make documentaries or drama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af4277da805f53aefe9e0dcf076a2ace0368ef27\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af4277da805f53aefe9e0dcf076a2ace0368ef27/0_38_5178_3105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Pilkington, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais after setting the Guinness world record for the most downloaded podcast in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karl Pilkington, Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais after setting the Guinness world record for the most downloaded podcast in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Podcasts rescued me from aural monotony; I wrote my first piece about them in the summer of 2006. Apparently <em><a href=\"http://cokemachineglow.com/podcasts/\">Coke Machine Glow</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://thedawnanddrewshow.com/\">The Dawn and Drew Show</a></em> were the ones to look out for (me neither, now). The podcast I do recall from then is <em><a href=\"https://www.therickygervaisshow.com/podcasts\">The Ricky Gervais Show</a></em>; this dominated the brand new iTunes podcast chart for weeks. Initially free, in early 2006 it switched to a pay-per-listen model and proved both a forerunner and an outlier: since then, much podcast uptake has been driven by comedy, but most shows are still free to listeners, paid for by adverts that appear during episodes.</p> <p>Today, the iTunes podcast chart is bustling with old hands and new kids on the block. Here are <em><a href=\"https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/\">No Such Thing As </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/\">a Fish</a></em>, Fearne Cotton\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.officialfearnecotton.com/news/2018/2/26/happy-place-podcast\">Happy Place</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg/episodes/downloads\">That Peter Crouch Podcast</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://kathbum.podbean.com/\">Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything</a></em>. Here are sections for new and noteworthy, cultivating calm, keeping the kids busy. There are lists of the top 10 episodes, top 10 shows; all aside from the 19 other regular categories: news, arts, true crime\u2026 So many podcasts! There are oodles of shows, too many to ever get through.</p> <h2>Gold rush</h2> <p>This is podcasting\u2019s boom time. There are now more than 900,000 podcasts to choose from. In the US, 22% of the population listens to at least one podcast every week and 51% to at least one podcast in their life (roughly 168 million people). In the UK, 12.5% of us (about 7.1 million people) listen to podcasts weekly, up 58% in the past two years.<strong> </strong>And on average, those UK podcast fans are hoovering up approximately seven podcasts a week. Even throughout lockdown, when other art forms closed or stopped producing, podcasts have continued to grow. The big shows just got bigger.</p> <p>Podcasts have taken off across the world. In South Korea, <a href=\"https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/\">58% of the population</a> has listened to a podcast in the past month \u2013more than 30 million people \u2013 while in Spain the figure is 40% (more than 18.5million). And there\u2019s evidence that our ever-expanding love of listening is part of a wider shift to audio. Recently, a media analyst gave a talk about about current and upcoming trends. He noted that car radios are digital, speakers can be blue-toothed, in-ear headphones are more and more popular (Apple sold an estimated 60 million pairs of its <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/apple-airpods-shipments-are-said-to-double-to-60-million-in-2019\">wireless AirPods</a> last year), as are home AI systems with Alexa and Google Home. We\u2019re absorbing more content through our ears than ever before, he said, because we can do other things as we listen and in the future, as smart headphones get smarter, our ears, rather than our eyes, may well become the main way we connect to the internet.</p> <p>Still, that\u2019s the future. For now, perhaps the biggest indicator that podcasts are having their moment is the way big players are moving in, whether brands or celebrities.<strong> </strong>In 2019, Spotify made an eye-watering financial investment, buying Gimlet Media and Parcast (which make podcasts), as well as Anchor (which provides tools for podcast makers), for a combined stake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/06/spotify-buys-podcast-firms-gimlet-and-anchor-streaming-profits-music\">more than \u00a3320m</a>. Universal has done a deal with Wondery, the American true-crime specialist that produced <em><a href=\"https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/\">Dirty John</a></em>. Sony has a similar deal with Somethin\u2019 Else, which makes <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/davidtennant\">David Tennant Does </a></em><em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/davidtennant\">a </a></em><em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/davidtennant\"> Podcast With\u2026</a></em> The BBC, now relieved by its regulator<strong> </strong>of previous restrictions around podcasts, is throwing all efforts at <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds\">BBC Sounds</a>, its audio app and podcast platform. Going where Jessie Ware, Fearne Cotton and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/02/bland-for-the-reload-why-has-george-ezra-got-a-podcast\">George Ezra</a> have successfully gone before, <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/perkins\">Sue Perkins</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-bradley-wiggins-show-by-eurosport/id1404437099\">Bradley Wiggins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p087dgcm\">Matt Lucas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-fake-doctors-real-friends-60367049/\">the two doctors from </a><em><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-fake-doctors-real-friends-60367049/\">Scrubs</a> </em>have all got new podcasts. The Obamas signed up to produce exclusive podcasts for Spotify. Even Kim Kardashian is dropping hints.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I would say we\u2019re in the podcast gold rush years,\u201d says Matt Deegan, who co-runs the British Podcast awards, as well as overseeing shows such as the Fun Kids\u2019<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/podcasts/#\">podcasts</a>. \u201cBut it can definitely get even bigger. Compared with the millions who use TV, or YouTube, or Instagram, podcasting\u2019s numbers are small\u2026\u201d</p> <p>For quite some time, podcast fans have been of a type: educated Apple users who want to be entertained, but intelligently. (<em>Observer</em> readers, essentially.) There is a massive mainstream audience as yet untapped, though some shows are making inroads; podcasts that discuss popular TV programmes, old and new, are a burgeoning area. So, room for expansion. The questions are: how big can podcasting get? And which shows will get left behind?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7c5628e37eafb601b7b6dbb3682b8c9048a54d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c5628e37eafb601b7b6dbb3682b8c9048a54d4/0_101_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Corden and David Tennant\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Tennant Does a Podcast With\u2026 James Corden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Acast/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Helen Zaltzman, who hosts and produces <em><a href=\"https://www.theallusionist.org/\">The Allusionist</a></em> \u2013 and, since 2007, the immensely popular <em><a href=\"https://answermethispodcast.com/\">Answer Me This!</a></em> with Olly Mann \u2013 thinks that big companies could bring some more trust to the medium. \u201cTheir investment demonstrates that podcasting isn\u2019t just made by amateurs in a garage,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But the independence of podcasting, the wild and wonderfulness of its offerings, its glorious niche-ness, where someone with a great idea or mad obsession can make a small show that turns into a roaring success\u2026 Zaltzman worries that this will be \u201csteamrollered by big, bland chat series with enormous marketing budgets\u201d. This would be, at the very least, galling. After all, without <em><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/\">99% Invisible</a></em> there would be no <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGeBogGDZ9W3dsGx-mWQGJA\">Impaulsive with Logan Paul</a></em>; without <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj\">Kermode and Mayo\u2019s Film Review</a></em>, no <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07kjlz7\">Gemma Collins Podcast</a></em>. Outliers light the way for the popular.</p> <h2>The app gap</h2> <p>Today, in the UK, we mostly get our aural hits via Apple, BBC Sounds, Spotify and \u2013 this may sound weird to some \u2013 YouTube. Listeners under 35 use YouTube more than any other platform to get their podcasts, often listening while doing other things, such as playing computer games (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ\">Joe Rogan</a>, one of the world\u2019s most successful podcasters, with 8 million subscribers, is most often accessed on YouTube). YouTubers are moving into podcasting, by the way: football YouTube sensation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/miniminter\">Miniminter</a> has a new podcast, as does <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JaackMaate\">JaackMaate</a>.</p> <p>Some podcasting history. For quite a few years, like many others, I found my podcasts via websites and through iTunes. This required me to be near my laptop, though I could download shows on to my creaky iPod (iPhones didn\u2019t come along until 2007; I got my first in 2011). Podcasting\u2019s accessibility was a problem: there were great shows out there, but most people had no idea how to get them.</p> <p>It\u2019s unusual to have brilliant content without a convenient platform \u2013 it\u2019s like a great chef without a restaurant \u2013 and it\u2019s this mismatch that has long held podcasting back. Usually, the platform exists, the content grows to fill it and then both grow together. But podcasts existed for ages before they were truly easy to hear. It wasn\u2019t until 2012, when Apple put a standalone podcast app on its iPhones, that podcasts became easily accessible (for iPhone users) and podcasting started to take off in the UK. Soon after, 4G and more widespread wifi made it possible to hear a podcast wherever you were.</p> <p>Then, in 2014, <em><a href=\"https://serialpodcast.org/\">Serial</a></em> came out. This who-really-dunnit re-examination of a cold case murder, led by <em><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/\">This American Life</a></em> veteran Sarah Koenig, massively boosted podcasting\u2019s profile. In every English-speaking country, there is evidence of \u201cthe <em>Serial</em> effect\u201d and the show also gave podcasting an identifiable style for a few years, one where the presenter showed their workings in their commentary (what we might call the \u201cI get that. But I still wanted to know\u2026\u201d style). In 2015, <em><a href=\"https://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/#intro1\">My Dad Wrote </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/#intro1\">a Porno</a></em> became another enormous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/30/my-dad-wrote-a-porno-podcast\">UK hit</a> and advertisers \u2013 other than early adopters Squarespace \u2013 started to take note. <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0008cx6\">Brexitcast</a></em> brought in a lot of new listeners in 2017, as did <em>That Peter Crouch Podcast</em> in 2018 and <em><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/sh-ged-married-annoyed/id1451489585\">Shagged Married Annoyed</a></em> last year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4a138551db7c3faf3b4c9ba83876a9a0c5a7759\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4a138551db7c3faf3b4c9ba83876a9a0c5a7759/0_326_2400_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama appearing on Marc Maron\u2019s podcast.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama appearing on <a href=\"http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_613_-_president_barack_obama\">Marc Maron\u2019s podcast WTF</a> in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Souza/The White House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But still, if we\u2019re honest, podcasts have been The Next Big Thing ever since I\u2019ve been writing about them and their reaching the mainstream has been a stop-start process. Even now, there are plenty of people who don\u2019t listen and many who have only just started. Why? Access. The problem \u2013 still \u2013 is how podcasts are delivered.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no perfect app for podcasts,\u201d says Zaltzman. \u201cThey are all a bit clunky, because they\u2019re free, so there\u2019s no real reason to make them great. The people who make the apps don\u2019t make their own podcasts, they just host other people\u2019s work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows. We just wind them up and let them go</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Harrison, Podmasters</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is changing. After Spotify\u2019s splashy podcasting entrance, Gimlet is now busily making shows for the streaming service. BBC Sounds hosts BBC podcasts, but has promised to expand to hosting other shows in the future. (During the coronavirus pandemic, it has agreed to host Fun Kids\u2019 excellent <em><a href=\"https://www.funkidslive.com/podcast/stuck/\">Stuck@Home</a></em>.) In the US, Luminary, which hoped to be the Netflix of podcasting (ie a subscription model), had a bumpy launch in 2019, with several established shows pulling out from being on the network. But it undoubtedly made some big signings, including Russell Brand\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/russell-brand-395/under-the-skin-with-russell-brand-luminary-exclusive/d55de7eb-6f34-48e6-aee4-48703f8fb675?country=US\">Under the Skin</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://loveandradio.org/\">Love + Radio</a></em>, and it makes its own shows with celebrities such as Trevor Noah and Karamo Brown from <em>Queer Eye</em>. (The subscription model might seem an obvious way for podcasts to go, but faces reluctance from listeners used to getting podcasts for free while suffering the adverts that pay for them.)</p> <p>Matt Hartman, who works for Betaworks, an American startup studio and venture capitalist company that invested in Gimlet in 2014, points out that most podcast apps just do the same thing: \u201cLet people search for and subscribe to shows and that\u2019s it.\u201d He says, diplomatically, that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to app innovation, mentioning <a href=\"https://www.breaker.audio/\">Breaker</a> as an app that\u2019s different: it\u2019s well laid out, has social functions, lets you search for individual episodes and automatically imports all your existing podcast subscriptions. (Breaker is also easy for podcasters to use and gives more listening information, which apps have previously been reluctant to hand out.)</p> <p>But at the moment, Apple\u2019s basic Podcast app dominates in the UK. This is despite the fact that most people don\u2019t own iPhones. Android phone users have various ways to get podcasts, though it took until 2018 for Google to put out Google Podcasts (before that, you had to go via Google Play). Now, Google Podcasts can be used on iPhones too and you can search for individual phrases within shows. There are other apps: Podcast Player, Pocket Casts (which charges a one-off fee), Stitcher, Castbox. So many, but unless Google Podcasts catches on, Spotify seems to be the most likely to threaten Apple\u2019s dominance.</p> <p>And the iTunes podcast chart, with its incomprehensible algorithms, is still where podcasters want to be, though the chart doesn\u2019t work in quite the same way as the UK\u2019s Top 40. Instead, says Deegan, \u201cit\u2019s about momentum\u201d. Momentum means a new show can make a splash and enter the iTunes top 10. The real talent is in making that show stick and, of course, making money from it. Such mainstream hits as <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/thehighlowshow\">The High Low</a></em>, <em>Peter Crouch</em>, <em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3GMZiZnqL4Hib6DD5PGhdj\">The Receipts</a></em>, <em>David Tennant\u2026</em>, <em><a href=\"https://adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts\">The Adam Buxton Podcast</a></em> and <em>My Dad Wrote </em><em>a Porno</em> act as starter programmes. Once people listen and love them, they are more likely to try others.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d99e294680867ccb8a3638763d4ddfec0b1ca1d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d99e294680867ccb8a3638763d4ddfec0b1ca1d/0_0_1125_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former footballer Peter Crouch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former footballer Peter Crouch has enjoyed success with his That Peter Crouch Podcast.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet our podcasting industry is a couple of years behind the US. Partly, this is because of our thriving radio sector; as Zaltzman points out, given the choice between a regular paid job at BBC radio and the uncertain economics of podcasting, many producers opt for the former. Things are changing, though: the BBC is losing its audio dominance, at least among young people. Other broadcasters have been quick to launch podcasts, or their own app (<a href=\"https://www.globalplayer.com/\">Global</a>\u2019s is good), and Deegan knows of many podcasters, \u201cbrilliant broadcasters\u201d, who have never worked in radio.</p> <p>Andrew Harrison, who runs a small podcasting company, Podmasters, is one of those. Having worked for nearly 30 years in magazines, he started making podcasts in 2016. One of them \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/remainiacs-podcast\">Remainiacs</a></em>, an anti-Brexit show that pulls in several big players, including Tony Blair \u2013 became a hit, and, from that, the company has launched political show <em><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker\">The Bunker</a></em> and started producing other people\u2019s podcasts. What Harrison likes, he says, is the direct nature of podcasting. All the investment is in the show, he explains: there are no printing or distribution costs, no investment in drama scripts and in building sets. \u201cWe put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then we just wind them up, let them go, record and edit and get the show out to listeners.\u201d</p> <p>A simple process: idea, execution, direct delivery to consumer. Several podcast producers and presenters I talk to contrast this with the traditional teeth-pulling procedure of making shows for the BBC. There, you \u201csit down in front of a Rupert and listen as your great idea is tweaked to within an inch of its life and then proposed as a vehicle for Sue Perkins or Romesh Ranganathan,\u201d says one producer. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p> <p>Presenters don\u2019t have it easy, either: one high-profile BBC host has been promised a podcast for the past two years, yet every suggestion they make for a show is rejected. No wonder BBC regulars such as Clara Amfo, Annie Mac and Clare Balding have recently brought out podcasts independently.</p> <p>So, we\u2019re getting more British podcasts. Perhaps we\u2019ll catch up to the US soon? Deegan isn\u2019t so sure. He says the main reason UK podcasts don\u2019t smash the American market is that \u201cBritain doesn\u2019t have celebrities that Americans have heard of. David Tennant\u2019s podcast has done well, because Americans know who he is.\u201d No doubt if Tom Holland or Idris Elba decided to make a podcast, it would go down brilliantly. But as podcasts move into the mainstream, they need mainstream stars to move with them.</p> <p>There is an argument, though, that niche is where it\u2019s at, especially when niche goes big. The most popular podcasts in the UK are made by enthusiasts, from <em>Kermode and Mayo</em> to <em>My Dad Wrote a Porno</em>. Jamie Morton, with his other <em>MDWAP</em> hosts, James Cooper and Alice Levine, has now done a full world tour twice, selling out the Sydney Opera House and New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall. Still, he says that when he moved into a new house recently, he had to explain to his neighbour what he did, \u201cwhich was embarrassing.

      "bodyText": "Hello friends! Do you fancy listening to \u201ca new type of time-shifted amateur radio\u201d? No? How about a brilliant podcast? Of course you do. Fifteen years ago, Macworld, a magazine for fans of Apple products, announced, with limited fanfare, that Apple was about to add podcasts to iTunes, its music download offer. Unfortunately, few readers knew what a podcast was, hence Macworld\u2019s \u201ctime-shifted radio\u201d definition. In June 2005, the idea of having thousands of ready-to-hear audio shows, anything from true-crime documentaries to all-chums-together comedy, to up-to-the-minute news to gripping drama to revealing interviews, and being able to listen to these shows whenever you want, wherever you are \u2013 well, that wasn\u2019t quite happening. So Apple\u2019s move didn\u2019t seem important. Nor did the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary added \u201cpodcast\u201d to its lexicon in the same year, after tech journalist Ben Hammersley came up with the term in 2004 (which was also the year the BBC launched a downloadable version of In Our Time). Podcasts were new. It takes time for the new to become everyday. Podcasts were mostly unheard of, except by the tech savvy. They were either downloadable versions of existing radio shows or they were chatty riffs, made by amateurs who knew how to upload their aural blogs online. Still, they were interesting. At least to me. Soon after podcasts\u2019 iTunes debut, I started a new job as the Observer\u2019s radio critic. Great job \u2013 except there was a limited choice of programmes for me to review. Radio schedules rarely changed. Presenters stayed in their jobs for years. The BBC dominated speech radio, aside from phone-ins; hardly any other broadcaster had the money to make documentaries or drama. Podcasts rescued me from aural monotony; I wrote my first piece about them in the summer of 2006. Apparently Coke Machine Glow and The Dawn and Drew Show were the ones to look out for (me neither, now). The podcast I do recall from then is The Ricky Gervais Show; this dominated the brand new iTunes podcast chart for weeks. Initially free, in early 2006 it switched to a pay-per-listen model and proved both a forerunner and an outlier: since then, much podcast uptake has been driven by comedy, but most shows are still free to listeners, paid for by adverts that appear during episodes. Today, the iTunes podcast chart is bustling with old hands and new kids on the block. Here are No Such Thing As a Fish, Fearne Cotton\u2019s Happy Place, That Peter Crouch Podcast, Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything. Here are sections for new and noteworthy, cultivating calm, keeping the kids busy. There are lists of the top 10 episodes, top 10 shows; all aside from the 19 other regular categories: news, arts, true crime\u2026 So many podcasts! There are oodles of shows, too many to ever get through. Gold rush This is podcasting\u2019s boom time. There are now more than 900,000 podcasts to choose from. In the US, 22% of the population listens to at least one podcast every week and 51% to at least one podcast in their life (roughly 168 million people). In the UK, 12.5% of us (about 7.1 million people) listen to podcasts weekly, up 58% in the past two years. And on average, those UK podcast fans are hoovering up approximately seven podcasts a week. Even throughout lockdown, when other art forms closed or stopped producing, podcasts have continued to grow. The big shows just got bigger. Podcasts have taken off across the world. In South Korea, 58% of the population has listened to a podcast in the past month \u2013more than 30 million people \u2013 while in Spain the figure is 40% (more than 18.5million). And there\u2019s evidence that our ever-expanding love of listening is part of a wider shift to audio. Recently, a media analyst gave a talk about about current and upcoming trends. He noted that car radios are digital, speakers can be blue-toothed, in-ear headphones are more and more popular (Apple sold an estimated 60 million pairs of its wireless AirPods last year), as are home AI systems with Alexa and Google Home. We\u2019re absorbing more content through our ears than ever before, he said, because we can do other things as we listen and in the future, as smart headphones get smarter, our ears, rather than our eyes, may well become the main way we connect to the internet. Still, that\u2019s the future. For now, perhaps the biggest indicator that podcasts are having their moment is the way big players are moving in, whether brands or celebrities. In 2019, Spotify made an eye-watering financial investment, buying Gimlet Media and Parcast (which make podcasts), as well as Anchor (which provides tools for podcast makers), for a combined stake of more than \u00a3320m. Universal has done a deal with Wondery, the American true-crime specialist that produced Dirty John. Sony has a similar deal with Somethin\u2019 Else, which makes David Tennant Does a Podcast With\u2026 The BBC, now relieved by its regulator of previous restrictions around podcasts, is throwing all efforts at BBC Sounds, its audio app and podcast platform. Going where Jessie Ware, Fearne Cotton and George Ezra have successfully gone before, Sue Perkins, Bradley Wiggins, Matt Lucas and the two doctors from Scrubs have all got new podcasts. The Obamas signed up to produce exclusive podcasts for Spotify. Even Kim Kardashian is dropping hints. \u201cYes, I would say we\u2019re in the podcast gold rush years,\u201d says Matt Deegan, who co-runs the British Podcast awards, as well as overseeing shows such as the Fun Kids\u2019 podcasts. \u201cBut it can definitely get even bigger. Compared with the millions who use TV, or YouTube, or Instagram, podcasting\u2019s numbers are small\u2026\u201d For quite some time, podcast fans have been of a type: educated Apple users who want to be entertained, but intelligently. (Observer readers, essentially.) There is a massive mainstream audience as yet untapped, though some shows are making inroads; podcasts that discuss popular TV programmes, old and new, are a burgeoning area. So, room for expansion. The questions are: how big can podcasting get? And which shows will get left behind? Helen Zaltzman, who hosts and produces The Allusionist \u2013 and, since 2007, the immensely popular Answer Me This! with Olly Mann \u2013 thinks that big companies could bring some more trust to the medium. \u201cTheir investment demonstrates that podcasting isn\u2019t just made by amateurs in a garage,\u201d she says. But the independence of podcasting, the wild and wonderfulness of its offerings, its glorious niche-ness, where someone with a great idea or mad obsession can make a small show that turns into a roaring success\u2026 Zaltzman worries that this will be \u201csteamrollered by big, bland chat series with enormous marketing budgets\u201d. This would be, at the very least, galling. After all, without 99% Invisible there would be no Impaulsive with Logan Paul; without Kermode and Mayo\u2019s Film Review, no Gemma Collins Podcast. Outliers light the way for the popular. The app gap Today, in the UK, we mostly get our aural hits via Apple, BBC Sounds, Spotify and \u2013 this may sound weird to some \u2013 YouTube. Listeners under 35 use YouTube more than any other platform to get their podcasts, often listening while doing other things, such as playing computer games (Joe Rogan, one of the world\u2019s most successful podcasters, with 8 million subscribers, is most often accessed on YouTube). YouTubers are moving into podcasting, by the way: football YouTube sensation Miniminter has a new podcast, as does JaackMaate. Some podcasting history. For quite a few years, like many others, I found my podcasts via websites and through iTunes. This required me to be near my laptop, though I could download shows on to my creaky iPod (iPhones didn\u2019t come along until 2007; I got my first in 2011). Podcasting\u2019s accessibility was a problem: there were great shows out there, but most people had no idea how to get them. It\u2019s unusual to have brilliant content without a convenient platform \u2013 it\u2019s like a great chef without a restaurant \u2013 and it\u2019s this mismatch that has long held podcasting back. Usually, the platform exists, the content grows to fill it and then both grow together. But podcasts existed for ages before they were truly easy to hear. It wasn\u2019t until 2012, when Apple put a standalone podcast app on its iPhones, that podcasts became easily accessible (for iPhone users) and podcasting started to take off in the UK. Soon after, 4G and more widespread wifi made it possible to hear a podcast wherever you were. Then, in 2014, Serial came out. This who-really-dunnit re-examination of a cold case murder, led by This American Life veteran Sarah Koenig, massively boosted podcasting\u2019s profile. In every English-speaking country, there is evidence of \u201cthe Serial effect\u201d and the show also gave podcasting an identifiable style for a few years, one where the presenter showed their workings in their commentary (what we might call the \u201cI get that. But I still wanted to know\u2026\u201d style). In 2015, My Dad Wrote a Porno became another enormous UK hit and advertisers \u2013 other than early adopters Squarespace \u2013 started to take note. Brexitcast brought in a lot of new listeners in 2017, as did That Peter Crouch Podcast in 2018 and Shagged Married Annoyed last year. But still, if we\u2019re honest, podcasts have been The Next Big Thing ever since I\u2019ve been writing about them and their reaching the mainstream has been a stop-start process. Even now, there are plenty of people who don\u2019t listen and many who have only just started. Why? Access. The problem \u2013 still \u2013 is how podcasts are delivered. \u201cThere\u2019s no perfect app for podcasts,\u201d says Zaltzman. \u201cThey are all a bit clunky, because they\u2019re free, so there\u2019s no real reason to make them great. The people who make the apps don\u2019t make their own podcasts, they just host other people\u2019s work.\u201d This is changing. After Spotify\u2019s splashy podcasting entrance, Gimlet is now busily making shows for the streaming service. BBC Sounds hosts BBC podcasts, but has promised to expand to hosting other shows in the future. (During the coronavirus pandemic, it has agreed to host Fun Kids\u2019 excellent Stuck@Home.) In the US, Luminary, which hoped to be the Netflix of podcasting (ie a subscription model), had a bumpy launch in 2019, with several established shows pulling out from being on the network. But it undoubtedly made some big signings, including Russell Brand\u2019s Under the Skin and Love + Radio, and it makes its own shows with celebrities such as Trevor Noah and Karamo Brown from Queer Eye. (The subscription model might seem an obvious way for podcasts to go, but faces reluctance from listeners used to getting podcasts for free while suffering the adverts that pay for them.) Matt Hartman, who works for Betaworks, an American startup studio and venture capitalist company that invested in Gimlet in 2014, points out that most podcast apps just do the same thing: \u201cLet people search for and subscribe to shows and that\u2019s it.\u201d He says, diplomatically, that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to app innovation, mentioning Breaker as an app that\u2019s different: it\u2019s well laid out, has social functions, lets you search for individual episodes and automatically imports all your existing podcast subscriptions. (Breaker is also easy for podcasters to use and gives more listening information, which apps have previously been reluctant to hand out.) But at the moment, Apple\u2019s basic Podcast app dominates in the UK. This is despite the fact that most people don\u2019t own iPhones. Android phone users have various ways to get podcasts, though it took until 2018 for Google to put out Google Podcasts (before that, you had to go via Google Play). Now, Google Podcasts can be used on iPhones too and you can search for individual phrases within shows. There are other apps: Podcast Player, Pocket Casts (which charges a one-off fee), Stitcher, Castbox. So many, but unless Google Podcasts catches on, Spotify seems to be the most likely to threaten Apple\u2019s dominance. And the iTunes podcast chart, with its incomprehensible algorithms, is still where podcasters want to be, though the chart doesn\u2019t work in quite the same way as the UK\u2019s Top 40. Instead, says Deegan, \u201cit\u2019s about momentum\u201d. Momentum means a new show can make a splash and enter the iTunes top 10. The real talent is in making that show stick and, of course, making money from it. Such mainstream hits as The High Low, Peter Crouch, The Receipts, David Tennant\u2026, The Adam Buxton Podcast and My Dad Wrote a Porno act as starter programmes. Once people listen and love them, they are more likely to try others. Yet our podcasting industry is a couple of years behind the US. Partly, this is because of our thriving radio sector; as Zaltzman points out, given the choice between a regular paid job at BBC radio and the uncertain economics of podcasting, many producers opt for the former. Things are changing, though: the BBC is losing its audio dominance, at least among young people. Other broadcasters have been quick to launch podcasts, or their own app (Global\u2019s is good), and Deegan knows of many podcasters, \u201cbrilliant broadcasters\u201d, who have never worked in radio. Andrew Harrison, who runs a small podcasting company, Podmasters, is one of those. Having worked for nearly 30 years in magazines, he started making podcasts in 2016. One of them \u2013 Remainiacs, an anti-Brexit show that pulls in several big players, including Tony Blair \u2013 became a hit, and, from that, the company has launched political show The Bunker and started producing other people\u2019s podcasts. What Harrison likes, he says, is the direct nature of podcasting. All the investment is in the show, he explains: there are no printing or distribution costs, no investment in drama scripts and in building sets. \u201cWe put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then we just wind them up, let them go, record and edit and get the show out to listeners.\u201d A simple process: idea, execution, direct delivery to consumer. Several podcast producers and presenters I talk to contrast this with the traditional teeth-pulling procedure of making shows for the BBC. There, you \u201csit down in front of a Rupert and listen as your great idea is tweaked to within an inch of its life and then proposed as a vehicle for Sue Perkins or Romesh Ranganathan,\u201d says one producer. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d Presenters don\u2019t have it easy, either: one high-profile BBC host has been promised a podcast for the past two years, yet every suggestion they make for a show is rejected. No wonder BBC regulars such as Clara Amfo, Annie Mac and Clare Balding have recently brought out podcasts independently. So, we\u2019re getting more British podcasts. Perhaps we\u2019ll catch up to the US soon? Deegan isn\u2019t so sure. He says the main reason UK podcasts don\u2019t smash the American market is that \u201cBritain doesn\u2019t have celebrities that Americans have heard of. David Tennant\u2019s podcast has done well, because Americans know who he is.\u201d No doubt if Tom Holland or Idris Elba decided to make a podcast, it would go down brilliantly. But as podcasts move into the mainstream, they need mainstream stars to move with them. There is an argument, though, that niche is where it\u2019s at, especially when niche goes big. The most popular podcasts in the UK are made by enthusiasts, from Kermode and Mayo to My Dad Wrote a Porno. Jamie Morton, with his other MDWAP hosts, James Cooper and Alice Levine, has now done a full world tour twice, selling out the Sydney Opera House and New York\u2019s Radio City Music Hall. Still, he says that when he moved into a new house recently, he had to explain to his neighbour what he did, \u201cwhich was embarrassing. They didn\u2019t know what a podcast was and the title was a bit\u2026 suspect.\u201d This combination of being under the radar for most people, but popular enough to sell out the Albert Hall, demonstrates the Big Niche appeal of podcasting. Morton describes MDWAP events as being \u201clike Comic Con: fans dress up as characters, they come by themselves and make friends when they\u2019re at the show\u201d. Podcasting appears to be going through the same arc as YouTube, in that its oldest stars have grown themselves by getting in early and posting regularly on an untested platform. Like YouTubers, the most popular podcasters, who draw huge audiences to their live shows, are able to walk around unnoticed by the vast majority of the population. Real celebrities \u2013 film stars, singers, chatshow hosts \u2013 come in later. So, can Big Niche go Big Big? Perhaps not.

Scientists, including public health experts, were <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/trump-administration-moves-muzzle-scientists#.Wd-AAxNSyi4\">barred</a> from communicating with the public about their work and new restrictions were imposed on the EPA.</p> <p>Since then the Union of Concerned Scientists has <a href=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/attacks-on-science\">recorded</a> no fewer than 139 major attacks from the Trump administration on scientific integrity.

The sidelining of expert advice that has been a trademark of this presidency has burst into full view, with Trump\u2019s belief in his own intellectual prejudices pitted directly \u2013 often in front of TV cameras \u2013 against the evidence-based advice of his own bewildered officials.</p> <p>\u201cMany scientists were dreading that the president would be faced by a test just like coronavirus,\u201d Halpern said. \u201cIt has had immediate and catastrophic consequences.\u201d</p> <p>All the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">major</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">mistakes</a> that have been made by the Trump administration in handling the pandemic can be ascribed to this failure to listen to, and trust, scientific advice. Trump was slow to mobilise the federal government because he failed to heed scientific warnings; instead he chose to follow his \u201chunch\u201d that a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/trump-coronavirus-disappear/index.html\">\u201cmiracle\u201d</a> would happen and the virus would disappear.</p> <p>His obsession with the anti-malarial drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/can-chloroquine-really-help-treat-coronavirus-patients\">chloroquine</a> as a potential <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">\u201cgame changer</a>\u201d in treating Covid-19 caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">havoc</a> in the US and around the world, with recent <a href=\"https://apnews.com/a5077c7227b8eb8b0dc23423c0bbe2b2\">studies</a> suggesting the drug has no beneficial qualities and plenty of side-effects.</p> <p>In contrast to other countries like South Korea where public health agencies have spearheaded successful efforts to contain Covid-19, in the US the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been sidelined. Its last press conference was in March.</p> <p>The assault on science does not end with the White House.

Until he entered presidential politics he was opposed to vaccinating children, claiming falsely that vaccines cause autism. Given these tendencies, when Trump snatched unexpected victory in 2016 the scientific community braced itself for what they knew would be an uncomfortable ride. The attack began in the very first week of Trump\u2019s presidency. Scientists, including public health experts, were barred from communicating with the public about their work and new restrictions were imposed on the EPA. Since then the Union of Concerned Scientists has recorded no fewer than 139 major attacks from the Trump administration on scientific integrity. For the Union\u2019s Michael Halpern, the mindset was summed up by Sharpiegate in September 2019 when the White House redrew the path of Hurricane Dorian to include Alabama so that the president would not have to admit he made a mistake. To the shock and dismay of the science community, the national weather agency was forced to play along. \u201cSharpiegate was the harbinger of what\u2019s happened with the pandemic,\u201d Halpern said. When the nation is dealing with a hurricane that threatens the lives of thousands it is serious enough, but a pandemic threatening millions of Americans is on another level. The sidelining of expert advice that has been a trademark of this presidency has burst into full view, with Trump\u2019s belief in his own intellectual prejudices pitted directly \u2013 often in front of TV cameras \u2013 against the evidence-based advice of his own bewildered officials. \u201cMany scientists were dreading that the president would be faced by a test just like coronavirus,\u201d Halpern said. \u201cIt has had immediate and catastrophic consequences.\u201d All the major mistakes that have been made by the Trump administration in handling the pandemic can be ascribed to this failure to listen to, and trust, scientific advice. Trump was slow to mobilise the federal government because he failed to heed scientific warnings; instead he chose to follow his \u201chunch\u201d that a \u201cmiracle\u201d would happen and the virus would disappear. His obsession with the anti-malarial drug chloroquine as a potential \u201cgame changer\u201d in treating Covid-19 caused havoc in the US and around the world, with recent studies suggesting the drug has no beneficial qualities and plenty of side-effects. In contrast to other countries like South Korea where public health agencies have spearheaded successful efforts to contain Covid-19, in the US the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been sidelined. Its last press conference was in March. The assault on science does not end with the White House. Trump\u2019s vocal disdain for evidence-based thinking has emboldened an army of quacks, pseudoscience groups and conspiracy theorists who have stepped up their proselytizing online and in protests across the country. The president\u2019s remarks about injecting disinfectant not only led to some people poisoning themselves by drinking cleaning fluid, it also encouraged peddlers of industrial bleach to reinforce their claims that they had a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d for coronavirus. Del Bigtree, a leading anti-vaxxer who produced the film Vaxxed based on the views of the disgraced British former physician Andrew Wakefield, told the Guardian that viewership of his online show the HighWire has increased \u201cexponentially\u201d during the pandemic. If there is a silver lining in the current browbeaten state of American science, it lies paradoxically in the pandemic itself. The crisis has not only brought the confrontation to a head, it also offers a possible way out of it. All the scientists consulted by the Guardian agreed that the cause of evidence-based leadership would emerge from the current crisis stronger. Naomi Oreskes, an historian of science at Harvard, pointed out that Americans remain generally favorable to the scientific mission. A recent Pew survey found that 73% of Americans thought that science had a positive impact on society. \u201cThe impression that anti-science sentiment is on the rise is false \u2013 it\u2019s what the merchants of doubt try to stoke because they want us to think that, to distrust science,\u201d Oreskes said. McCarthy believes that Covid-19 has handed science an unexpected gift. \u201cPeople are beginning to see the costs when you don\u2019t tell the truth and you sideline those who do.\u201d McCarthy predicts that a final collision is coming between the merchants of untruths led by Trump and a majority of the American people demanding real facts and real science. \u201cIt will be the people against polluters, experts against those winging it, scientists against the peddlers of misinformation. The question is, who is going to win?\u201d",

This is Christopher Knaus with the latest developments from Sunday 2 May.</p> <h2>Tehan withdraws extraordinary attack on Victorian premier</h2> <p>The education minister, Dan Tehan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/03/dan-tehan-tried-to-pressure-victoria-to-reopen-schools-but-he-went-from-raging-bull-to-mewling-kitten\">began the day</a> with a scathing attack on Victorian premier Daniel Andrews over his position on schools.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/Pages/coronavirus-advice-schools.aspx\">state government\u2019s current position is that all students</a> who can learn from home must do so.</p> <p>Tehan alleged on the ABC\u2019s Insiders that Andrews had taken a \u201csledgehammer\u201d to education by resisting wider reopening, and questioned his leadership.</p> <p>The comments represented a significant tonal shift from an otherwise impressive period of bipartisanship, via the Covid-19 national cabinet. The state health minister, Jenny Mikakos, immediately hit back, saying:</p> <p>\u201cI think Victorians understand who\u2019s been leading the effort in Victoria, how to keep them safe, to suppress the number of cases that we\u2019re seeing in Victoria, and that\u2019s certainly not been Dan Tehan.\u201d</p> <p>The state government also revealed on Sunday that a Melbourne primary school teacher had been infected with coronavirus, prompting the closure of the school for three days.</p> <p>Later on Sunday, Tehan issued a statement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/03/federal-education-minister-dan-tehan-says-he-overstepped-the-mark-criticising-victoria-over-schools\">withdrawing his comments</a>, saying he had spoken in frustration at the prospect children would miss their education.</p> <p>\u201cIt was this frustration that led me to overstep the mark in questioning premier Andrew\u2019s leadership on this matter and I withdraw.\u201d</p> <h2>Death toll rises to 95</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s death toll rose to 95 following another death in NSW at the Newmarch House aged care home, and the death of an 83-year-old woman in WA.</p> <p>The death of 76-year-old Ann Fahey at Newmarch is the 14th death connected to the aged care facility since the start of the pandemic. Fahey had previously tested negative to Covid-19 twice before she returned a positive test on Thursday.</p> <p>Her son, Mark Fahey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/02/why-is-it-spreading-sydneys-newmarch-house-aged-care-home-becomes-epicentre-of-covid-19-fight\">told the Guardian earlier this week</a> that his mother had done everything to protect herself.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. She was a model patient, did everything right, she\u2019s shut herself in her room the entire time,\u201d Fahey said.</p> <p>In WA, the state government said the 83-year-old woman who died had contracted Covid-19 from close contact. She was admitted to hospital in mid-April and died on 30 April.</p> <p>WA recorded no new cases overnight, the fourth consecutive day of zero cases. It now has only 19 active cases across the state.</p> <h2>CMO links app downloads to \u2018bold\u2019 easing of restrictions</h2> <p>The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said about one in four Australian adults with a smartphone had downloaded the COVIDSafe App.</p> <p>Uptake of the app has been tempered by concerns about privacy and data security. But Murphy said a greater uptake might help to relieve restrictions sooner.</p> <p>\u201cThe more we have signed up, the more confidence I\u2019ll be able to give national cabinet that they can make a decision,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe more confidence they can have, the more bold they might be.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy also indicated that universities might be able to resume some face-to-face teaching. The sector would be discussed at national cabinet this week, and Murphy said he expected a recommendation to partially reopen some of the more necessary face-to-face functions.</p> <p>\u201cI think universities are clearly in the mix of things that we\u2019re talking about with national cabinet this week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is likely that they will start to recommence some activities, without pre-empting the decision of national cabinet.\u201d</p> <h2>Further cause for optimism as new cases remain low</h2> <p>The positive trend of low rates of new cases continued on Sunday. Only 18 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours. That\u2019s within the government\u2019s current target of 20.</p> <p>In South Australia, the state\u2019s chief medical officer, Nicola Spurrier, said she was hopeful the state could soon be free of Covid-19.</p> <p>SA has had its 11th consecutive day without a new Covid-19 case. There are only seven active cases remaining.</p> <p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t have any more cases, soon we will be able to say that we have no one with Covid-19 in the state, which will certainly be something to celebrate,\u201d she said.</p> <p>South Australia joined the ACT, Western Australia, and Tasmania in recording no new cases. Queensland recorded a single new case.</p> <h2>NZ warriors arrive in Tamworth</h2> <p>The NRL\u2019s plans to resume competition later this month took another step forward as the New Zealand Warriors flew in to the NSW town of Tamworth.

      "bodyText": "Fracking billionaire and Trump donor Harold Hamm was among an elite group of oil and gas executives who met with the president in early April to press for federal help, including access to big loans for businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. It prompted Trump afterwards to promise to \u201cmake funds available to these very important companies\u201d. Major Trump ally Tommy Fisher, who last year landed a $400m Army Corps of Engineers contract to build 31 miles of Trump\u2019s border wall in Arizona, in April received another $7m from the army \u2013 despite an active investigation by a Pentagon watchdog into allegations of favoritism after Trump reportedly pushed for Fisher. Another big Trump donor, Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and the chair of Trump\u2019s campaign in Minnesota, got red-carpet treatment from Trump at a press briefing in late March. Lindell then praised Trump, hailing him as \u201cchosen by God\u201d as the president touted the firm\u2019s efforts to make thousands of face masks. The president\u2019s kid-glove treatment of the three Trump backers, who have donated well over $1m to help Trump and other Republican candidates try to win this fall, underscore how even during an unprecedented national crisis Trump\u2019s priorities and campaign machine often tilt towards giving donors and political allies favors, access and publicity. Numerous bosses of hotels, airlines and other sectors have lobbied Trump and cabinet officials during the pandemic. Watchdog groups say Trump\u2019s close ties with top backers and donors from the oil patch and other sectors deserve close scrutiny, as more than $2.6tn in relief funds are doled out. \u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s dealings with these and other big donors highlight why we need stringent oversight to make sure that the hundreds of billions of dollars sloshing around benefits the American people, and not the president\u2019s donors and political allies,\u201d said Robert Maguire, the research director at the watchdog group Crew. Hamm\u2019s inclusion at the White House meeting with chiefs from giants ExxonMobil and Chevron was not a surprise: Hamm gave a major speech at the 2016 Republican convention, has been an informal energy adviser to Trump, and has opened his checkbook wide for the president. Continental Resources, the company Hamm founded and is the major shareholder in, has donated almost $1m to the pro-Trump Super Pac America First Action. Hamm gave $50,000 to Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Trump\u2019s oil and gas meeting also drew billionaire Kelcy Warren, the chief of Energy Transfer Partners, which developed the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. Warren and his wife donated more than $720,000 to Trump Victory, according to the CRP. After the meeting, Trump asked his energy and treasury secretaries to explore options for helping oil and gas companies facing leaner times and debt burdens, as demand for oil and gas has plummeted during the pandemic. The options said to be under review include increasing loan limits in part of the $2.2tn relief act for troubled companies \u2013 especially mid- and smaller sized firms that have been hit hardest \u2013 and possibly putting tariffs on oil imports, an idea Hamm has touted before. Further, some mid-sized oil and gas companies are seeking waivers for debt strapped members looking to tap into part of the $2.2tn relief act that the Federal Reserve will launch soon, giving loans to firms with more than 500 employees. Veteran oil lobbyists caution that Trump\u2019s efforts to help fossil fuel allies, who have benefited mightily from Trump\u2019s deregulatory and tax policies, could spark a political backlash. \u201cSentiment against the oil industry is taking a backseat to concerns over the coronavirus, but that could change quickly if the administration offers up a generous economic package to the industry,\u201d warned Don Duncan, a former top lobbyist for ConocoPhillips. Separately, Trump personally backed the Army Corps of Engineers handing the $400m contract to Fisher\u2019s North Dakota-based company Fisher Sand &amp; Gravel, despite concerns the Corps had about Fisher\u2019s wall proposal, according to the Washington Post. Trump\u2019s support came after Fisher publicly touted Trump\u2019s wall and his own skills on Fox News, and his home state senator Kevin Cramer, who received $10,000 from Fisher for his campaign in 2018, championed him. The DoD inspector general\u2019s investigation of whether improper favoritism helped Fisher, didn\u2019t deter the Army giving him $7.6m more in mid-April to construct an 800ft barrier in Arizona. Meanwhile, MyPillow chief Lindell is reportedly weighing running for governor in Minnesota in 2022 with some encouragement from Trump.",

      "body": "<p>One day in the autumn of 2015, a small but significant change was implemented at the Instagram offices in Menlo Park, California. Employees arrived at work to discover the rubbish bins under each desk had disappeared. The bins had allowed people to work efficiently \u2013 no one had to stand up to throw away a coconut water carton or wasabi pea wrapper after they\u2019d enjoyed the company\u2019s free food. But the bins weren\u2019t really Instagram\u2019s \u2013 they were installed by Facebook, which had purchased the photo-sharing app for $1bn in 2012.</p> <p>Kevin Systrom, Instagram\u2019s co-founder, didn\u2019t like the bins. He didn\u2019t like the cardboard boxes employees used to file papers and paraphernalia. He hated old, sagging birthday balloons. Instagram\u2019s offices, he explained, after removing the bins, should represent its ethos. They should be beautiful, simple, pristine \u2013 much like the app itself.</p> <p>Tech reporter Sarah Frier, author of <em>No Filter: The Inside Story of How Instagram Transformed Business, Celebrity and Our Cultur</em>e, explains this story is significant for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Systrom\u2019s aesthetic sensibilities. Second, it is indicative of his frustration with Facebook. (A year earlier he had torn down motivational posters belonging to the parent company, one of which said: \u201cDone is Better than Perfect.\u201d) And third, while the incident obviously affected Instagram employees \u2013 they dubbed it #trashcangate \u2013 it also represented an issue facing its users, who were, Frier says, \u201cintimidated about posting because they thought Instagram warranted perfection\u201d.</p> <p>In the decade since the invention of Instagram, social media has dramatically changed our lives. This pursuit of perfection has led to a rise in filter-inspired plastic surgery and a boom in oversized desserts that don\u2019t fit in your mouth, but fit perfectly into a little square posted online. How did this simple photo-sharing service get 1bn users in eight years? Does Instagram create or reflect our values? And, if the former, shouldn\u2019t we know a little more about the mindset and motivations of the men behind the app?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd3f189c07edf1d670c0f4961cf6d91dc86707fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd3f189c07edf1d670c0f4961cf6d91dc86707fa/0_0_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Systrom, chief executive and co-founder of Instagram, who says he has no interest in leaving Instagram to run Twitter, despite the hopes of some on Wall Street that he would consider the job, in Menlo Park, Calif., June 22, 2015.

Frier interviewed a different person each day for a year after getting the book deal in 2018. Many spoke without Facebook\u2019s permission, and the majority of her sources remain anonymous. \u201cI realised that there was so much uncharted territory,\u201d she says. \u201cMy editor told me a book is ready to be written when you have 100 things in your pocket that nobody else has published.\u201d Frier surpassed this benchmark.</p> <p>One anecdote recalls Systrom saving actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ashton-kutcher\" title=\"\">Ashton Kutcher</a> from a 4am fire in a log cabin. In return, Kutcher helped Instagram grow credibility with celebs. (He hosted a party to introduce Systrom to superstars like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande\" title=\"\">Ariana Grande</a>, who the Instagram CEO didn\u2019t recognise.) Then there\u2019s the time the Instagram team celebrated the sale to Facebook with an all-expenses trip to the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, where they were greeted with personal congratulatory notes from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ivanka-trump\" title=\"\">Ivanka Trump</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>But gossip isn\u2019t</strong></em> at the heart of Frier\u2019s book and it\u2019s the mundane stories about Systrom that are most revealing. A Stanford alumnus who, at 25, worked in marketing at Google, he founded his company with software engineer and friend Mike Krieger in 2009. His original idea was a website called Burbn, which showed people where their friends were partying in real time. The name was inspired by Systrom\u2019s love of the whiskey. Throughout the book, Frier reveals his passion for prestige. Systrom enjoys fine drinks and bespoke bicycles \u2013 he snubbed Facebook\u2019s free coffee by importing beans that he only used at their \u201cpeak point\u201d (four days after roasting).</p> <p>\u201cI think that products are ultimately a reflection of their leaders,\u201d Frier says. \u201cHe wants everything to be at a level of quality because he believes in that quality.\u201d Systrom turned Burbn into Instagram when he realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones. But there was another problem he hoped to solve: back then, phone cameras were shoddy and took unattractive pictures. When Instagram launched, it offered filters that people could use to make their photos \u2013 and by extension, their lives \u2013 look more appealing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"388700ca289dc6b3c4f6b7bfee70ad3b7af30fa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/388700ca289dc6b3c4f6b7bfee70ad3b7af30fa6/0_559_2700_1620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zuckerberg used to end every staff meeting by shouting: \u2018Domination!\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zuckerberg used to end every staff meeting by shouting: \u2018Domination!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Chou/The New York Times/eyevine</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the outset, his demand for quality shifted our reality. \u201cA filter on Instagram was like if Twitter had a button to make you more clever,\u201d Frier says. Instagram was heavily curated in its early days. Because there are no mechanisms to go viral on the app (users can\u2019t share posts), Instagram employees manually chose photos to push on its \u201cPopular\u201d page. \u201cInstagram had a hand in it in a way none of us on the outside would ever necessarily realise,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>For example, in 2013, one Instagram employee dedicated his time to \u201cdiscovering pets\u201d. He tracked adorable dogs, birds and lizards in a spreadsheet before highlighting them on the official <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/instagram/\" title=\"\">@instagram</a> page. Frier chronicles how these decisions changed real lives. Courtney Dasher, for example, was a dog owner with a cute-looking pet named <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tunameltsmyheart/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Tuna</a>. She quit her job and earned money via Instagram thanks to the decision of that employee. Dasher tells Frier that pictures of her dog helped fans cope with anxiety and depression. \u201cThe tastes of one Instagram employee directly affected the habits of the 2m people who now follow that dog,\u201d Frier says.</p> <p>How else have we been influenced by Instagram? Frier\u2019s examples range from how we organise bookshelves by cover colour to how once rarely visited tourist destinations are now trampled underfoot. \u201cBy constantly serving users images of visually appealing lives and hobbies,\u201d she says, Instagram forced people to \u201cmake their lives more worthy of posting about.\u201d She notes how leisure time became a status symbol \u2013 how Instagram gradually affected the economy, as people began to value experiences over things. More of us now \u201cpursue vacations in more picturesque settings,\u201d Frier says, in part because pictures taken in those locations look great on the \u2019gram. (She links the app with nine major retailers filing for bankruptcy in the US in 2017).</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just our lives that have to look interesting on Instagram \u2013 our faces do, too. Photo-editing apps, like Facetune, have boomed in popularity. Teens slim their noses, enhance their waists and hide their spots with the help of digital editing tools. One plastic surgeon told Frier that his clients now seek impossible-to-achieve adjustments inspired by the app. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kimkardashian/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian,</a> owner of the seventh most popular Instagram account (and a famously large behind) can arguably be linked to the 20,000 people in the US who had a Brazilian bum lift in 2017.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t something Systrom actually wanted. Frier says that selfies and bikini shots were against the CEO\u2019s \u201cartistic sensibilities\u201d. These posts became popular despite the fact they were ignored by the official @instagram account. Yet Frier says that Instagram incentivised selfies and surgery through its metrics, if not its values. The choice to display numbers of followers and likes turned the app \u201cinto a game one could win\u201d. In 2017 a study by the <a href=\"https://www.rsph.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal Society for Public Health</a> found that Instagram was the worst app for teens\u2019 mental health. Was this an inevitable outcome?</p> <p>Frier starts her final chapter with a quote from an anonymous Instagram executive: \u201cEverything breaks at a billion.\u201d Instagram reached 1bn active monthly users for the first time in June 2018. \u201cI think at a certain point you lose control of something when it gets that big,\u201d she says, noting that 6m accounts on Instagram now have over 1m followers. \u201cThey wanted to build a better community, but they just didn\u2019t have the resources to do that, which is such a silly thing to say about a product that is part of a gigantic, well-sourced company, like Facebook.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg\" title=\"\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> bought </strong></em>Instagram in April 2012, when the app had just 13 employees and hadn\u2019t made a single penny in profit. Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for Frier\u2019s book, sending over a single emailed quote via a PR person. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he wrote, when asked why he both purchased Instagram and committed to keeping the company independent, \u201cit was a great service and we wanted to help it grow.\u201d Despite the fact he refused to take part in Frier\u2019s reporting, <em>No Filter</em> is as much about Zuckerberg and Facebook as it is about Systrom and Instagram. (The word \u201cFacebook\u201d appears 1,179 times in the book, while \u201cInstagram\u201d appears 1,673.)</p> <p>\u201cA lot of times we think when a company has been acquired that their business story is over,\u201d Frier says. She argues this isn\u2019t the case here. The book chronicles the power struggles between Systrom and Zuckerberg. Frier believes Zuckerberg acquired Instagram due to his paranoia about competition.

      "bodyText": "One day in the autumn of 2015, a small but significant change was implemented at the Instagram offices in Menlo Park, California. Employees arrived at work to discover the rubbish bins under each desk had disappeared. The bins had allowed people to work efficiently \u2013 no one had to stand up to throw away a coconut water carton or wasabi pea wrapper after they\u2019d enjoyed the company\u2019s free food. But the bins weren\u2019t really Instagram\u2019s \u2013 they were installed by Facebook, which had purchased the photo-sharing app for $1bn in 2012. Kevin Systrom, Instagram\u2019s co-founder, didn\u2019t like the bins. He didn\u2019t like the cardboard boxes employees used to file papers and paraphernalia. He hated old, sagging birthday balloons. Instagram\u2019s offices, he explained, after removing the bins, should represent its ethos. They should be beautiful, simple, pristine \u2013 much like the app itself. Tech reporter Sarah Frier, author of No Filter: The Inside Story of How Instagram Transformed Business, Celebrity and Our Culture, explains this story is significant for three reasons. First, it demonstrates Systrom\u2019s aesthetic sensibilities. Second, it is indicative of his frustration with Facebook. (A year earlier he had torn down motivational posters belonging to the parent company, one of which said: \u201cDone is Better than Perfect.\u201d) And third, while the incident obviously affected Instagram employees \u2013 they dubbed it #trashcangate \u2013 it also represented an issue facing its users, who were, Frier says, \u201cintimidated about posting because they thought Instagram warranted perfection\u201d. In the decade since the invention of Instagram, social media has dramatically changed our lives. This pursuit of perfection has led to a rise in filter-inspired plastic surgery and a boom in oversized desserts that don\u2019t fit in your mouth, but fit perfectly into a little square posted online. How did this simple photo-sharing service get 1bn users in eight years? Does Instagram create or reflect our values? And, if the former, shouldn\u2019t we know a little more about the mindset and motivations of the men behind the app? Frier and I talk on the phone a week before her book is published. No Filter, she says, is an omniscient narration of Instagram\u2019s birth and growth, cobbled together from insiders\u2019 memories. Frier interviewed a different person each day for a year after getting the book deal in 2018. Many spoke without Facebook\u2019s permission, and the majority of her sources remain anonymous. \u201cI realised that there was so much uncharted territory,\u201d she says. \u201cMy editor told me a book is ready to be written when you have 100 things in your pocket that nobody else has published.\u201d Frier surpassed this benchmark. One anecdote recalls Systrom saving actor Ashton Kutcher from a 4am fire in a log cabin. In return, Kutcher helped Instagram grow credibility with celebs. (He hosted a party to introduce Systrom to superstars like Ariana Grande, who the Instagram CEO didn\u2019t recognise.) Then there\u2019s the time the Instagram team celebrated the sale to Facebook with an all-expenses trip to the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, where they were greeted with personal congratulatory notes from Ivanka Trump. But gossip isn\u2019t at the heart of Frier\u2019s book and it\u2019s the mundane stories about Systrom that are most revealing. A Stanford alumnus who, at 25, worked in marketing at Google, he founded his company with software engineer and friend Mike Krieger in 2009. His original idea was a website called Burbn, which showed people where their friends were partying in real time. The name was inspired by Systrom\u2019s love of the whiskey. Throughout the book, Frier reveals his passion for prestige. Systrom enjoys fine drinks and bespoke bicycles \u2013 he snubbed Facebook\u2019s free coffee by importing beans that he only used at their \u201cpeak point\u201d (four days after roasting). \u201cI think that products are ultimately a reflection of their leaders,\u201d Frier says. \u201cHe wants everything to be at a level of quality because he believes in that quality.\u201d Systrom turned Burbn into Instagram when he realised there was a gap in the market for an app that helped people quickly share pictures from phones. But there was another problem he hoped to solve: back then, phone cameras were shoddy and took unattractive pictures. When Instagram launched, it offered filters that people could use to make their photos \u2013 and by extension, their lives \u2013 look more appealing. From the outset, his demand for quality shifted our reality. \u201cA filter on Instagram was like if Twitter had a button to make you more clever,\u201d Frier says. Instagram was heavily curated in its early days. Because there are no mechanisms to go viral on the app (users can\u2019t share posts), Instagram employees manually chose photos to push on its \u201cPopular\u201d page. \u201cInstagram had a hand in it in a way none of us on the outside would ever necessarily realise,\u201d Frier says. For example, in 2013, one Instagram employee dedicated his time to \u201cdiscovering pets\u201d. He tracked adorable dogs, birds and lizards in a spreadsheet before highlighting them on the official @instagram page. Frier chronicles how these decisions changed real lives. Courtney Dasher, for example, was a dog owner with a cute-looking pet named Tuna. She quit her job and earned money via Instagram thanks to the decision of that employee. Dasher tells Frier that pictures of her dog helped fans cope with anxiety and depression. \u201cThe tastes of one Instagram employee directly affected the habits of the 2m people who now follow that dog,\u201d Frier says. How else have we been influenced by Instagram? Frier\u2019s examples range from how we organise bookshelves by cover colour to how once rarely visited tourist destinations are now trampled underfoot. \u201cBy constantly serving users images of visually appealing lives and hobbies,\u201d she says, Instagram forced people to \u201cmake their lives more worthy of posting about.\u201d She notes how leisure time became a status symbol \u2013 how Instagram gradually affected the economy, as people began to value experiences over things. More of us now \u201cpursue vacations in more picturesque settings,\u201d Frier says, in part because pictures taken in those locations look great on the \u2019gram. (She links the app with nine major retailers filing for bankruptcy in the US in 2017). And it\u2019s not just our lives that have to look interesting on Instagram \u2013 our faces do, too. Photo-editing apps, like Facetune, have boomed in popularity. Teens slim their noses, enhance their waists and hide their spots with the help of digital editing tools. One plastic surgeon told Frier that his clients now seek impossible-to-achieve adjustments inspired by the app. Kim Kardashian, owner of the seventh most popular Instagram account (and a famously large behind) can arguably be linked to the 20,000 people in the US who had a Brazilian bum lift in 2017. This isn\u2019t something Systrom actually wanted. Frier says that selfies and bikini shots were against the CEO\u2019s \u201cartistic sensibilities\u201d. These posts became popular despite the fact they were ignored by the official @instagram account. Yet Frier says that Instagram incentivised selfies and surgery through its metrics, if not its values. The choice to display numbers of followers and likes turned the app \u201cinto a game one could win\u201d. In 2017 a study by the Royal Society for Public Health found that Instagram was the worst app for teens\u2019 mental health. Was this an inevitable outcome? Frier starts her final chapter with a quote from an anonymous Instagram executive: \u201cEverything breaks at a billion.\u201d Instagram reached 1bn active monthly users for the first time in June 2018. \u201cI think at a certain point you lose control of something when it gets that big,\u201d she says, noting that 6m accounts on Instagram now have over 1m followers. \u201cThey wanted to build a better community, but they just didn\u2019t have the resources to do that, which is such a silly thing to say about a product that is part of a gigantic, well-sourced company, like Facebook.\u201d Mark Zuckerberg bought Instagram in April 2012, when the app had just 13 employees and hadn\u2019t made a single penny in profit. Zuckerberg declined to be interviewed for Frier\u2019s book, sending over a single emailed quote via a PR person. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d he wrote, when asked why he both purchased Instagram and committed to keeping the company independent, \u201cit was a great service and we wanted to help it grow.\u201d Despite the fact he refused to take part in Frier\u2019s reporting, No Filter is as much about Zuckerberg and Facebook as it is about Systrom and Instagram. (The word \u201cFacebook\u201d appears 1,179 times in the book, while \u201cInstagram\u201d appears 1,673.) \u201cA lot of times we think when a company has been acquired that their business story is over,\u201d Frier says. She argues this isn\u2019t the case here. The book chronicles the power struggles between Systrom and Zuckerberg. Frier believes Zuckerberg acquired Instagram due to his paranoia about competition. Consequently, Zuckerberg occasionally held Instagram back \u2013 after it reached 1bn users, the Facebook founder deleted a feature that automatically linked Facebook users to their friends\u2019 Instagram pages. He also prevented the company from hiring more staff and prioritised Facebook\u2019s content moderation over Instagram\u2019s. Ineffective moderation allowed troubling practices \u2013 such as the sale of opioids and the proliferation of self-harm \u2013 to flourish on Instagram. For every banal coffee bean anecdote about Systrom, there is a story that makes Zuckerberg look equally weird. In 2012, on the night the Instagram deal was finalised, the Facebook founder\u2019s sheepdog, Beast, bit the leg of Facebook deals director Amin Zoufonoun.

      "body": "<p>The countdown to the play beginning was on screen rather than from a tinny tannoy. But there was a genuine sense of pre-curtain anticipation, though with shorter queues for drinks and loos, in my solo venue.</p> <p>On Saturday night at 7pm, an obscure 1969 Tom Stoppard TV play, A Separate Peace, was given a live online reading \u2013 by, at their separate locations, David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman, Denise Gough, Ed Stoppard and Maggie Service \u2013 in the first of a series of one-off shows raising funds for theatre workers unemployed in the pandemic.</p> <p>Some TV charity specials have shown the risk of a good cause excusing bad work. But director Sam Yates and the technical team created a piece that used Zoom technology with ingenuity and even beauty.</p> <p>As in Tom Tykwer\u2019s split-screen film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,4267,94485,00.html\">Run Lola Run</a> (1998), the frame was usually quartered, with boxes sometimes left empty, injecting tension about who might turn up there. The actors were wearing black tops against backgrounds that stayed white \u2013 except for a lovely graphic effect when the protagonist starts painting his walls \u2013 and were framed so their scripts were kept out of view.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84e310bc41dfd957b616fd98e5a1cf5ef4378ed5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84e310bc41dfd957b616fd98e5a1cf5ef4378ed5/109_22_2625_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Morrissey Jenna Coleman Ed Stoppard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Remote hypnosis \u2026 David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman and Ed Stoppard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Old plays take on fresh meanings in new times. Superficially, Stoppard\u2019s plot of a man demanding a hospital bed despite having no illness is spectacularly irrelevant. But lines such as \u201cWe have to keep the beds free for people who need them\u201d, written as surreal, now bump into our reality and themes of isolation, medical bafflement, mental illness and the legacy in England of the second world war also gain a coronavirus kick.</p> <p>The actors mined from their lines notes of humour, pain or mystery \u2013 suggesting serious work on the script. Scenes between Morrissey\u2019s enigmatic \u201cpatient\u201d, Coleman\u2019s loving nurse and Gough\u2019s unnerved doctor particularly achieved dramatic interaction belying the separation between performers.</p> <p>Every aspect of the production exuded the joy of those involved at resuming their suspended professions. Giving a standing ovation alone in front of a laptop felt strange even by the standards of this pandemic, but it was entirely deserved. If, for however long, this is live theatre\u2019s future, then it works triumphantly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The countdown to the play beginning was on screen rather than from a tinny tannoy. But there was a genuine sense of pre-curtain anticipation, though with shorter queues for drinks and loos, in my solo venue. On Saturday night at 7pm, an obscure 1969 Tom Stoppard TV play, A Separate Peace, was given a live online reading \u2013 by, at their separate locations, David Morrissey, Jenna Coleman, Denise Gough, Ed Stoppard and Maggie Service \u2013 in the first of a series of one-off shows raising funds for theatre workers unemployed in the pandemic. Some TV charity specials have shown the risk of a good cause excusing bad work. But director Sam Yates and the technical team created a piece that used Zoom technology with ingenuity and even beauty. As in Tom Tykwer\u2019s split-screen film Run Lola Run (1998), the frame was usually quartered, with boxes sometimes left empty, injecting tension about who might turn up there. The actors were wearing black tops against backgrounds that stayed white \u2013 except for a lovely graphic effect when the protagonist starts painting his walls \u2013 and were framed so their scripts were kept out of view. Old plays take on fresh meanings in new times. Superficially, Stoppard\u2019s plot of a man demanding a hospital bed despite having no illness is spectacularly irrelevant. But lines such as \u201cWe have to keep the beds free for people who need them\u201d, written as surreal, now bump into our reality and themes of isolation, medical bafflement, mental illness and the legacy in England of the second world war also gain a coronavirus kick. The actors mined from their lines notes of humour, pain or mystery \u2013 suggesting serious work on the script. Scenes between Morrissey\u2019s enigmatic \u201cpatient\u201d, Coleman\u2019s loving nurse and Gough\u2019s unnerved doctor particularly achieved dramatic interaction belying the separation between performers. Every aspect of the production exuded the joy of those involved at resuming their suspended professions. Giving a standing ovation alone in front of a laptop felt strange even by the standards of this pandemic, but it was entirely deserved. If, for however long, this is live theatre\u2019s future, then it works triumphantly.",

Put another way, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/cash-credits-and-crisis-life-in-the-new-european-precariat\">precariat</a>\u201d has suddenly expanded to denote a potentially universal condition.</p> <p>Late last week I chatted to people in Plymouth. Most spoke via webcam from their homes, which outwardly suggested comfort and material security. But one was a specialist in oven-cleaning and another was a plumber and heating specialist: both were waiting for chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s package for self-employed people to materialise, and were deeply worried about the future. Another ran a nail and beauty business from her house and feared that even if she was eventually allowed to reopen, people might be too scared to come there. On and on they went: everyone expressing anxiety and uncertainty, thereby joining the millions of people who experienced those things long before the outbreak began.</p> <p>As regular news of the soaring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/uk-food-banks-face-record-demand-in-coronavirus-crisis\">need for food banks</a> highlight a mounting social crisis,<strong> </strong>the government has begun its frenzy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/20/fears-of-flood-as-uks-covid-19-furlough-scheme-opens\">furloughing</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/uk-treasury-rushes-to-finalise-coronavirus-bounce-back-loan-scheme\">loans</a> for small businesses, as well as individuals. But these things do not solve basic matters of poverty (the furlough rate of 80% of wages is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-52447142\">bad news for anyone already on low pay</a>), and there are plenty of people who have already fallen through the cracks: workers who have been made redundant and are now enduring the five-week wait for universal credit, and people who have been self-employed for less than a year, or have paid themselves in dividends. Besides, as things stand, the furloughing schemes are set to finish at the end of June. Even if some miracle occurs and people are then able to start earning again, that will still leave a massive question unanswered: what will we do in the event of another disaster like this?</p> <p>So, a familiar idea has once again returned: that of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income\">universal basic income</a> (or UBI), whereby all of us would be entitled to a regular payment from the state, enough to cover such basics as food and heating. Ten days ago, the left-inclined pressure group Compass organised a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fdaf216-8324-11ea-b555-37a289098206\">letter</a>, signed by more than 100 MPs and peers from seven parties, calling for a \u201crecovery basic income\u201d that would be \u201csufficient to provide economic security\u201d. An accompanying <a href=\"https://www.compassonline.org.uk/publications/meeting-the-economic-and-livelihood-crisis-from-a-recovery-basic-income-to-a-permanent-income-floor/\">paper</a> sets out the case for these short-term measures being followed by a permanent basic income \u2013 set at a starting rate of \u00a360 a week per working-age adult and \u00a340 per child (or \u00a310,400 per year for a family of four), with additional unemployment, housing and disability benefits maintained. Over time, this \u201cincome floor\u201d could rise to \u00a3100 per adult.</p> <p>This would obviously take a large share of public spending, but through policies such as converting the current personal tax allowance into a cash payment, UBI\u2019s advocates insist the tax system could be remodelled to ease the cost. Besides, this might not be quite the hard sell some would suggest: after the bailing-out of the banks and the government\u2019s munificent response to the current crisis, radical spending plans are surely not the political taboo they once were.</p> <p>In Scotland, the SNP is <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/snp-makes-renewed-call-universal-basic-income-be-introduced-2532379\">enthusiastic</a>, reflecting a mood in some other countries pointing in a comparable direction. As if to remind us that not everyone involved has idealistic intentions, the Trump administration is currently distributing a one-off payment of $1,200 (\u00a3950) to millions of US citizens, while such forward-thinking democrats as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/take-dramatic-action-aoc-calls-for-universal-basic-income-as-response-to-coronavirus\">make the case</a> for an American UBI.</p> <p>In Spain, the governing coalition of the Socialist party and radical-left movement Podemos has pledged to introduce <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/economy_and_business/2020-04-19/spains-guaranteed-minimum-income-scheme-will-come-with-55bn-price-tag.html\">regular payments</a> to its poorest citizens. Podemos has long advocated full UBI, and clearly sees this first move as a big step in that direction.</p> <p>As with many radical ideas, the notion of a basic income is surrounded by tensions. Aside from the cost, in societies plagued by populism and arguments about who is entitled to what, UBI would be an obvious source of conflict. Even if many people are instinctively in favour, they also worry about the visions attached to the idea \u2013 of an imagined workless society in which we all somehow get the chance to be artists and coders, usually put forward by people with apparently no grasp of the damage that inactivity can do to people (as vividly proved by lockdown). For that reason, some people are keener on the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/uk-universal-basic-services-jonathan-portes\">universal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/uk-universal-basic-services-jonathan-portes\">basic </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/11/uk-universal-basic-services-jonathan-portes\">services</a>, with legal entitlements to core things such as housing, education and transport. But this seems like a false choice: if we are going to maximise our collective resilience, we should surely consider both.</p> <p>The centrality to human wellbeing of work will remain; the dangers of simply surrendering to the supposed inevitabilities of automation are obvious. But right now we need to think hard about a set of realities that the 20th century did not prepare us for. This crisis is likely be repeated. Covid-19, after all, is just the latest sign of the horrors let loose by human incursion into parts of the natural world. Even once the current disaster is somehow dealt with, the catastrophe of climate change \u2013 which itself <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/06/vibrio-zika-west-nile-malaria-diseases-spreading-climate-change/\">increases the danger</a> of disease, as tropical illnesses start to threaten new places \u2013 will speed on. This latest economic crash arrives only 12 years after the last one. We live, in short, in an age of ongoing shocks, and it is time we began to prepare.</p> <p>As and when that happens, debates about how to change what we get from the state will only be one part of the conversation. As the public response to this crisis proves, another key aspect of our changed reality is the amazing amount of local self-help the outbreak has triggered, and how important it is that this does not disappear.</p> <p>But if you are going to enable people to care for their family, friends and neighbours and involve themselves in their community, many of them will need the freedom to do the kind of work that currently brings no financial reward. Which brings us back to a basic income \u2013 and a question that, whatever people\u2019s doubts, needs to be asked with a real urgency. If unprecedented times demand drastic answers, isn\u2019t this where we should begin?</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Besides, this might not be quite the hard sell some would suggest: after the bailing-out of the banks and the government\u2019s munificent response to the current crisis, radical spending plans are surely not the political taboo they once were. In Scotland, the SNP is enthusiastic, reflecting a mood in some other countries pointing in a comparable direction. As if to remind us that not everyone involved has idealistic intentions, the Trump administration is currently distributing a one-off payment of $1,200 (\u00a3950) to millions of US citizens, while such forward-thinking democrats as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez make the case for an American UBI. In Spain, the governing coalition of the Socialist party and radical-left movement Podemos has pledged to introduce regular payments to its poorest citizens. Podemos has long advocated full UBI, and clearly sees this first move as a big step in that direction. As with many radical ideas, the notion of a basic income is surrounded by tensions. Aside from the cost, in societies plagued by populism and arguments about who is entitled to what, UBI would be an obvious source of conflict. Even if many people are instinctively in favour, they also worry about the visions attached to the idea \u2013 of an imagined workless society in which we all somehow get the chance to be artists and coders, usually put forward by people with apparently no grasp of the damage that inactivity can do to people (as vividly proved by lockdown). For that reason, some people are keener on the idea of universal basic services, with legal entitlements to core things such as housing, education and transport. But this seems like a false choice: if we are going to maximise our collective resilience, we should surely consider both. The centrality to human wellbeing of work will remain; the dangers of simply surrendering to the supposed inevitabilities of automation are obvious. But right now we need to think hard about a set of realities that the 20th century did not prepare us for. This crisis is likely be repeated. Covid-19, after all, is just the latest sign of the horrors let loose by human incursion into parts of the natural world. Even once the current disaster is somehow dealt with, the catastrophe of climate change \u2013 which itself increases the danger of disease, as tropical illnesses start to threaten new places \u2013 will speed on. This latest economic crash arrives only 12 years after the last one. We live, in short, in an age of ongoing shocks, and it is time we began to prepare. As and when that happens, debates about how to change what we get from the state will only be one part of the conversation. As the public response to this crisis proves, another key aspect of our changed reality is the amazing amount of local self-help the outbreak has triggered, and how important it is that this does not disappear. But if you are going to enable people to care for their family, friends and neighbours and involve themselves in their community, many of them will need the freedom to do the kind of work that currently brings no financial reward. Which brings us back to a basic income \u2013 and a question that, whatever people\u2019s doubts, needs to be asked with a real urgency. If unprecedented times demand drastic answers, isn\u2019t this where we should begin? \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

In an open letter to the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, figures including Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney warned the pandemic meant indigenous communities in the Amazon faced \u201can extreme threat to their very survival\u201d. \u201cFive centuries ago, these ethnic groups were decimated by diseases brought by European colonisers \u2026 Now, with this new scourge spreading rapidly across Brazil \u2026 [they] may disappear completely since they have no means of combating Covid-19,\u201d they wrote. The organiser of the petition, the Brazilian photojournalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, said trespassers including wildcat gold miners and illegal loggers must be expelled immediately from indigenous lands to stop them importing an illness that has killed more than 240,000 people around the world, including 6,750 in Brazil. \u201cWe are on the eve of a genocide,\u201d Salgado, who has spent nearly four decades documenting the Amazon and its inhabitants, told the Guardian. Even before Covid-19, Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples were locked in what activists call a historic struggle for survival. Critics accuse Bolsonaro, a far-right populist in power since January 2019, of stimulating the invasion of indigenous reserves and dismantling the government agencies supposed to protect them. \u201cIndigenous communities have never been so under attack \u2026 The government has no respect at all for the indigenous territories,\u201d Salgado said, pointing to crippling budget cuts and the recent sacking of several of top environmental officials who had targeted illegal prospectors and loggers. But the letter said the pandemic had made an already bleak outlook under Bolsonaro even worse by paralysing what protection efforts remained. \u201cAs a result, there is nothing to protect indigenous peoples from the risk of genocide caused by an infection introduced by outsiders who enter their land illegally,\u201d argued the signatories, who also include the supermodels Gisele B\u00fcndchen and Naomi Campbell, the author Mario Vargas Llosa, the artist Ai Weiwei, the architect Norman Foster and the actor Meryl Streep.

[and therefore] permission is being given for the death of these indigenous people.\u201d \u201cIt would mean the extinction of Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples,\u201d Salgado added. Fears Covid-19 could devastate indigenous communities grew last month when the death of a Yanomami teenager revived horrific memories of epidemics caused by roadbuilders and gold prospectors in the 1970s and 80s. \u201cIn some of the villages I knew measles killed 50% of the population. If Covid does the same thing it would be a massacre,\u201d said Carlo Zaquini, an Italian missionary who has spent decades working with the Yanomami. The Brazilian city so far worst hit by coronavirus is Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, the state where part of the Yanomami reserve is located. Salgado \u2013 who is calling for the creation of an army-led taskforce to evict intruders from protected areas \u2013 admitted Bolsonaro would not act of his own volition. But he believed international pressure could force the government to do so, as happened last year when global outrage resulted in the military being deployed to extinguish fires in the Amazon. \u201cJust in the Brazilian Amazon we have 103 indigenous groups which have never been contacted \u2013 they represent humanity\u2019s pre-history,\u201d Salgado said. \u201cWe cannot allow all of this to disappear.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Parents of sick and premature newborn babies are facing days or weeks unable to visit them in hospital neonatal units because of Covid-19, the Guardian has learned. Disparities in hospital guidance mean some parents have been unable to visit their babies at all, with one father saying he was facing three months without seeing his child. A national charity is urging the health secretary to ensure rapid testing across the board for parents of newborns forced to self-isolate owing to coronavirus symptoms experienced by them or a member of their household. Bliss, which supports the families of premature or sick babies, has launched a campaign, Parents Aren\u2019t Visitors, which also calls on Matt Hancock to introduce a package of support for parents facing visiting restrictions and financial pressures due to the pandemic. The government said any mother admitted to hospital who has a baby in a neonatal unit will automatically be tested for Covid-19, whether symptomatic or not \u2013 but parents spoke of the anguish of having to self-isolate away from their baby as a precaution. Kayleigh Anthony, 29, from Cwmbran in Wales, was separated for a fortnight from her three-week-old daughter.

A nurse was by her side but I felt guilty not being there to feed and change her.\u201d Anthony was finally able to bring Eva home last Thursday. \u201cWhen I finally saw her again she had changed so much,\u201d she said. Another mother who lost one of her twins in utero experienced further trauma when she could not see her surviving baby because she had been in contact with a relative who tested positive for Covid-19. Zoe Llewellyn\u2019s son, Louis, weighed 0.62kg (1lb 6oz) when he was born on 17 December. She said: \u201cWe had quite a few scares with him, he had infections and blood transfusions.

Last week Panorama reported that gowns, visors, swabs and body bags were left out of the government\u2019s stockpile when it was set up in 2009. Some of the items are now in short supply. Since the programme aired, a number of NHS workers who were interviewed for it were reported to be either longstanding members or supporters of the Labour party. Dowden also referred to another recent incident in which the BBC admitted it had made a mistake by reporting that a boss of an NHS trust had contacted the broadcaster with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cI am sure you will agree that it is vital that public confidence is maintained in the BBC\u2019s longstanding reputation for fair and balanced reporting, and that any damage to that would be deeply concerning,\u201d wrote Dowden. The minister also said he was aware the Panorama programme had been the subject of a number of complaints to the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom. \u201cConcerns have been raised that a disproportionate number of those interviewed in the programme were political activists or had clear links to a political party. This both was not made clear to viewers and does not reflect the balance of views of an institution as large as the NHS,\u201d he wrote in the letter, excerpts of which have been published by the Mail on Sunday. A spokesperson for the BBC confirmed on Sunday that it had received Dowden\u2019s letter, adding it would respond in due course. It referred to a statement issued last week that said sources for its PPE revelations were not the doctors who appeared on the show. The BBC\u2019s journalists had spoken to dozens of healthcare workers in the course of making the programme, some of whom were members of a political party and some not, it said. Given that NHS trusts had discouraged healthcare workers from discussing the lack of PPE, the statement said it was perhaps not surprising that those willing to speak out were more involved with campaigning around the NHS. Responding further on Sunday in relation to Dowden\u2019s letter, a BBC spokesperson said the broadcaster would like to highlight comments by the prime minister earlier this week in relation to PPE. Speaking at the No 10 briefing for the first time since recovering from the virus, Boris Johnson said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to minimise the logistical problems we\u2019ve faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people in the right place, both in the NHS and care homes.\u201d There was also support for the BBC from figures including the broadcaster James O\u2019Brien, who said of Dowden\u2019s letter: \u201cI read this twice and can\u2019t see a single reference to, never mind refutation of, the testimony given by the medics on the programme. It\u2019s the starkest example yet that the Vote Leave government is trying to make confected tribal allegiance more important than evidence. Again.\u201d Alan Rusbridger, the principal of Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford, and a former editor of the Guardian, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s really not the job of the culture secretary to bollock the BBC for what your govt regards as bias, @OliverDowden Leave that to @Ofcom.\u201d",

But when the time came for Brady to go home, his wife decided to leave too.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit scary being away from the hospital with a six-hour-old baby in case anything went wrong, but it\u2019s what Debbie wanted and I wouldn\u2019t have slept being away from them,\u201d says Brady, adding that leaving the hospital at 3am, in the first hours of the lockdown, was like walking into the end of the world.</p> <p>And while he and hairdresser Debbie, who are also parents to 11-year-old Sean, feel lucky to have a smiling newborn to brighten their lockdown days, it is heartbreaking for them that Flynn\u2019s grandparents, aunties and uncles cannot meet him.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand the reasons why. The last thing we want is to have wee Flynn or anybody else\u2019s health deteriorate over a wee meet and greet.\u201d Instead, he has been introduced to the world via social media and video calls.</p> <p>Brady is glad to have been furloughed from his job as a gas engineer so he can look after Flynn and help Sean with his homework. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have more time with the kids,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re just lucky, I think.\u201d</p> <h2>Cassidy and Coralie Price-Stephens</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dc6ea0d276e7a32cf9d7cf18f6a309c15047b422\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6ea0d276e7a32cf9d7cf18f6a309c15047b422/0_0_480_640/375.jpg\" alt=\"Cassidy and Coralie, identical twin girls born on 1 April\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cassidy and Coralie, identical twin girls born on 1 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caitlin Price-Stephens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The week Caitlin Price-Stephens spent on the postnatal ward, alone with her newborn twin girls, was one of the toughest of her life. After giving birth to Cassidy and Coralie on 1 April, their father, Tom, was only allowed to spend two hours with them before they were separated. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get to say goodbye, I just got wheeled away, the twins on the bed with me,\u201d says Price-Stephens, an HR director from London. \u201cI remember sitting in the hospital crying, not knowing what to do. He was just gone and I didn\u2019t know when I\u2019d see him again.\u201d</p> <p>Price-Stephens, 35, thought they would be in hospital for a day or two, but their stay became longer after the twins developed jaundice. And with no visitors able to help care for two sick babies, she relied completely on the staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe midwives and support staff did the best they could, and some went above and beyond,\u201d she says, but with staff shortages and redeployments to other departments \u201cthere were many occasions when both twins would be screaming, hungry, covered in vomit or with dirty nappies, and I had to choose which one to care for and which to leave to cry. The feeling of watching your sick baby scream, begging for you to pick them up, is something I\u2019ll never be able to erase.\u201d</p> <p>Mother and babies have been home for about three weeks. \u201cI will always feel sad that my husband missed the first week,\u201d says Price-Stephens. \u201cWhen we finally got home, the girls were already little people that I knew and he didn\u2019t. But it\u2019s a relief to be safe at home now with two healthy babies.\u201d</p> <h2>Isabella Rose</h2> <p>After having a fit at home in Surrey, Maria Novelli, 37, was rushed to hospital with eclampsia and gave birth to Isabella on 27 March via an emergency caesarean section. \u201cIt was a bit of a blur for me,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0534659946b9cb5d99caaabbde10fdc79f6e788b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0534659946b9cb5d99caaabbde10fdc79f6e788b/247_371_6327_3796/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Novelli and Phil Rose with Isabella\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maria Novelli and Phil Rose with Isabella.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe was six weeks premature and in the neonatal intensive care unit at St Peter\u2019s hospital in Chertsey for two days. Due to coronavirus I was only allowed to see her for one hour, twice a day, and had to wear an apron, mask and gloves,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Access for Novelli\u2019s partner, Philip Rose, 37, who works for London Undergroun, was even more restricted. \u201cHe was there for the C-section and allowed one hour of skin-to-skin with Isabella but that was it. He wasn\u2019t allowed to see us for the 13 days we were in hospital. It was really hard but the staff were amazing.\u201d</p> <h2>Mila Dhillon</h2> <p>Mila, who is nearly six weeks old, was born on the day the prime minister announced the lockdown. \u201cThere were mixed emotions,\u201d says her 31-year-old mother, Suprina Dhillon, in Hagley, Worcestershire. \u201cWe were excited to get the time to bond with her but sad our family wouldn\u2019t be able to visit.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e3b9056fa46006f55d77ed4d0f2cbe2396799ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e3b9056fa46006f55d77ed4d0f2cbe2396799ba/94_0_2642_3302/800.jpg\" alt=\"Roman Dhillon, five, with his brother Nico and sister Mila\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roman Dhillon, five, with his brother Nico and sister Mila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suprina Dhillon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dhillon, along with husband, Dav, 33, who works for a bank, say they were nervous going into hospital for their third baby.</p> <p>\u201cThe Russells Hall hospital in Dudley felt very quiet and eerie,\u201d she says. \u201cMidwives weren\u2019t wearing face masks but everyone was overly sanitising things.</p> <p>\u201cWe have two boys, Roman, five, and Nico, three, and after a miscarriage last year we were elated to be having Mila. I\u2019m Sikh and Asian so normally lots of people would come round but it\u2019s been nice not to have to share her.\u201d</p> <p>Dhillon\u2019s mother supports them at weekends. \u201cMum\u2019s self-isolated herself away from my dad and brother who are key workers distributing PPE [personal protective equipment],\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she could have survived lockdown not coming to see the children. She\u2019s been our lifeline.\u201d</p> <p>Like many others, they have not been able to register Mila\u2019s birth. \u201cI booked an appointment but got a call saying they were putting everything on hold,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had one visit from our midwife and are constantly in touch, but we\u2019ve not been to the doctors yet, but as it\u2019s my third I\u2019m slightly more relaxed.</p> <p>\u201cEven though we\u2019re in lockdown I\u2019m still on cloud nine. Mila\u2019s a beautiful distraction.\u201d</p> <h2>Obi</h2> <p>Helen, 43, from Exeter was always going to do it alone. \u201cSolo parenting was the plan so in a sense the hospital restrictions washed over me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the unicorn patient who didn\u2019t fear rumours that birth partners might be banned as I was never bringing one anyway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78233e1f6a183087f2deeb15c15b324b9ac15a49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78233e1f6a183087f2deeb15c15b324b9ac15a49/0_0_4032_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baby Obi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obi, born on 4 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Helen</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obi was born on 4 April at Royal Devon and Exeter hospital, where the midwives wore PPE. \u201cThe staff were wonderful and terribly uncomfortable under their masks, which were worn non-stop for four hours at a time,\u201d says Helen.</p> <p>Despite expecting to bring up Obi on her own, Helen has found lockdown frustrating in unexpected ways. \u201cI knew what to expect but this was different,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were wonderful by dropping off food but the practical help, like coming to hold the baby, was now banned.\u201d</p> <p>Her midwife, alarmed at her exhaustion, asked her to come to the hospital. \u201cThere were a lot of tears,\u201d says Helen. Life has become easier after reaching out to her dad. \u201cI can now say it is immeasurably easier with a second person. There are naps and food. For now, I am not doing it on my own.\u201d</p> <h2>Rae Hardman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d44f0961c7bd5d2df68052cd1fb128efc68b4b1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44f0961c7bd5d2df68052cd1fb128efc68b4b1a/261_799_4127_5156/800.jpg\" alt=\"Laura and Rob Hardman with Rae\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura and Rob Hardman with Rae, who was born in hospital on the day the government announced the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After losing five babies and having two rounds of IVF in their six years of trying to conceive, Rae was born on 23 March to Laura Hardman, a baker, and her husband, Rob, a producer. Both are 35. \u201cShe arrived on the same day the lockdown was announced by the government,\u201d says Hardman, in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. \u201cAfter Rae was delivered, me and the other mothers on the ward sat and watched Boris\u2019s speech.\u201d</p> <p>Rae was born four weeks early by planned caesarean. The placenta wasn\u2019t functioning well and there were restrictions to her growth. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad in a way as I think things would have been more strict at the hospital if she had been born on her due date,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been weighing her on our kitchen scales and they\u2019re happy with her weight.\u201d</p> <p>The hardest part of the lockdown for Hardman is not being able to see her parents, who live in Dorset. \u201cThat\u2019s been the most upsetting part for me,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been so excited for this pregnancy. Rae\u2019s been longed for and now nobody can meet her, it\u2019s been quite tough. Thank god for FaceTime.\u201d</p> <p>Hardman is looking forward to lockdown ending but has experienced some upsides being stuck at home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing in disguise to have the extra time to bond with her,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be up and down. Some days we\u2019re thankful no one\u2019s knocking on the door \u2013 at the same time I really want people to meet her and do normal things like take her to a cafe.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Flora Burr</strong></h2> <p>After a straightforward third pregnancy, Janey Burr was surprised to wake up on her due date with coronavirus symptoms. She immediately began to self-quarantine, but as her breathing worsened throughout the day, she went to hospital where she had a chest X-ray, antibiotics and a test for Covid-19.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2356b7188c5e6b1943ce0bab96e3dbd5bffa421b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2356b7188c5e6b1943ce0bab96e3dbd5bffa421b/402_3001_4970_2980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janey Burr and baby Flora (centre) with Albie, husband Pete and Wilf in Oxford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janey Burr and baby Flora (centre) with Albie, husband Pete and Wilf in Oxford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs the first suspected pregnant Covid-19 admission in the hospital, the care I received was amazing. Everyone was brilliant,\u201d says Burr, a research nurse, who was looked after by staff from the infectious diseases and obstetrics teams in her own isolated room. \u201cThey monitored my bump a lot as they were worried I would go into labour.\u201d</p> <p>The test came back negative and Burr, 37, was diagnosed with pneumonia secondary to pregnancy-related immunosuppression. \u201cWhat ridiculous timing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so bizarre. It just came and went out of the blue. It doesn\u2019t feel like it actually happened.\u201d</p> <p>She was discharged after 48 hours with hopes for the baby to stay put for as long as possible to give her a chance to recover, but after a few days at home, her waters broke and Flora was born on the morning of 23 March.</p> <p>That night, as lockdown was announced and Burr cuddled her daughter, she wondered what it all meant. \u201cFor a second I thought I was going to be locked down in hospital. And then I thought it would be quite nice if I could stay \u2013 have my own room with people bringing me food and looking after me so well. But they did kick me out eventually.\u201d</p> <p>She is now back home in Oxford with her husband, Pete, and their two sons Albie, 18 months, and Wilf, three.</p> <p>\u201cAs a nurse, I feel extremely guilty that I\u2019m not working right now,\u201d says Burr. \u201cBut I know every patient will be getting the same level of incredible care I received on my last two hospital visits. So thank you, it doesn\u2019t seem enough, but it is meant with every fibre of my being.\u201d</p>",

But when the time came for Brady to go home, his wife decided to leave too. \u201cIt was a bit scary being away from the hospital with a six-hour-old baby in case anything went wrong, but it\u2019s what Debbie wanted and I wouldn\u2019t have slept being away from them,\u201d says Brady, adding that leaving the hospital at 3am, in the first hours of the lockdown, was like walking into the end of the world. And while he and hairdresser Debbie, who are also parents to 11-year-old Sean, feel lucky to have a smiling newborn to brighten their lockdown days, it is heartbreaking for them that Flynn\u2019s grandparents, aunties and uncles cannot meet him. \u201cWe understand the reasons why. The last thing we want is to have wee Flynn or anybody else\u2019s health deteriorate over a wee meet and greet.\u201d Instead, he has been introduced to the world via social media and video calls. Brady is glad to have been furloughed from his job as a gas engineer so he can look after Flynn and help Sean with his homework. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have more time with the kids,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re just lucky, I think.\u201d Cassidy and Coralie Price-Stephens The week Caitlin Price-Stephens spent on the postnatal ward, alone with her newborn twin girls, was one of the toughest of her life. After giving birth to Cassidy and Coralie on 1 April, their father, Tom, was only allowed to spend two hours with them before they were separated. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even get to say goodbye, I just got wheeled away, the twins on the bed with me,\u201d says Price-Stephens, an HR director from London. \u201cI remember sitting in the hospital crying, not knowing what to do. He was just gone and I didn\u2019t know when I\u2019d see him again.\u201d Price-Stephens, 35, thought they would be in hospital for a day or two, but their stay became longer after the twins developed jaundice. And with no visitors able to help care for two sick babies, she relied completely on the staff. \u201cThe midwives and support staff did the best they could, and some went above and beyond,\u201d she says, but with staff shortages and redeployments to other departments \u201cthere were many occasions when both twins would be screaming, hungry, covered in vomit or with dirty nappies, and I had to choose which one to care for and which to leave to cry. The feeling of watching your sick baby scream, begging for you to pick them up, is something I\u2019ll never be able to erase.\u201d Mother and babies have been home for about three weeks. \u201cI will always feel sad that my husband missed the first week,\u201d says Price-Stephens. \u201cWhen we finally got home, the girls were already little people that I knew and he didn\u2019t. But it\u2019s a relief to be safe at home now with two healthy babies.\u201d Isabella Rose After having a fit at home in Surrey, Maria Novelli, 37, was rushed to hospital with eclampsia and gave birth to Isabella on 27 March via an emergency caesarean section. \u201cIt was a bit of a blur for me,\u201d she says. \u201cShe was six weeks premature and in the neonatal intensive care unit at St Peter\u2019s hospital in Chertsey for two days. Due to coronavirus I was only allowed to see her for one hour, twice a day, and had to wear an apron, mask and gloves,\u201d she says. Access for Novelli\u2019s partner, Philip Rose, 37, who works for London Undergroun, was even more restricted. \u201cHe was there for the C-section and allowed one hour of skin-to-skin with Isabella but that was it. He wasn\u2019t allowed to see us for the 13 days we were in hospital. It was really hard but the staff were amazing.\u201d Mila Dhillon Mila, who is nearly six weeks old, was born on the day the prime minister announced the lockdown. \u201cThere were mixed emotions,\u201d says her 31-year-old mother, Suprina Dhillon, in Hagley, Worcestershire. \u201cWe were excited to get the time to bond with her but sad our family wouldn\u2019t be able to visit.\u201d Dhillon, along with husband, Dav, 33, who works for a bank, say they were nervous going into hospital for their third baby. \u201cThe Russells Hall hospital in Dudley felt very quiet and eerie,\u201d she says. \u201cMidwives weren\u2019t wearing face masks but everyone was overly sanitising things. \u201cWe have two boys, Roman, five, and Nico, three, and after a miscarriage last year we were elated to be having Mila. I\u2019m Sikh and Asian so normally lots of people would come round but it\u2019s been nice not to have to share her.\u201d Dhillon\u2019s mother supports them at weekends. \u201cMum\u2019s self-isolated herself away from my dad and brother who are key workers distributing PPE [personal protective equipment],\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she could have survived lockdown not coming to see the children. She\u2019s been our lifeline.\u201d Like many others, they have not been able to register Mila\u2019s birth. \u201cI booked an appointment but got a call saying they were putting everything on hold,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had one visit from our midwife and are constantly in touch, but we\u2019ve not been to the doctors yet, but as it\u2019s my third I\u2019m slightly more relaxed. \u201cEven though we\u2019re in lockdown I\u2019m still on cloud nine. Mila\u2019s a beautiful distraction.\u201d Obi Helen, 43, from Exeter was always going to do it alone. \u201cSolo parenting was the plan so in a sense the hospital restrictions washed over me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was the unicorn patient who didn\u2019t fear rumours that birth partners might be banned as I was never bringing one anyway.\u201d Obi was born on 4 April at Royal Devon and Exeter hospital, where the midwives wore PPE. \u201cThe staff were wonderful and terribly uncomfortable under their masks, which were worn non-stop for four hours at a time,\u201d says Helen. Despite expecting to bring up Obi on her own, Helen has found lockdown frustrating in unexpected ways. \u201cI knew what to expect but this was different,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople were wonderful by dropping off food but the practical help, like coming to hold the baby, was now banned.\u201d Her midwife, alarmed at her exhaustion, asked her to come to the hospital. \u201cThere were a lot of tears,\u201d says Helen. Life has become easier after reaching out to her dad. \u201cI can now say it is immeasurably easier with a second person. There are naps and food. For now, I am not doing it on my own.\u201d Rae Hardman After losing five babies and having two rounds of IVF in their six years of trying to conceive, Rae was born on 23 March to Laura Hardman, a baker, and her husband, Rob, a producer. Both are 35. \u201cShe arrived on the same day the lockdown was announced by the government,\u201d says Hardman, in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester. \u201cAfter Rae was delivered, me and the other mothers on the ward sat and watched Boris\u2019s speech.\u201d Rae was born four weeks early by planned caesarean. The placenta wasn\u2019t functioning well and there were restrictions to her growth. \u201cI\u2019m actually glad in a way as I think things would have been more strict at the hospital if she had been born on her due date,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been weighing her on our kitchen scales and they\u2019re happy with her weight.\u201d The hardest part of the lockdown for Hardman is not being able to see her parents, who live in Dorset. \u201cThat\u2019s been the most upsetting part for me,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been so excited for this pregnancy. Rae\u2019s been longed for and now nobody can meet her, it\u2019s been quite tough. Thank god for FaceTime.\u201d Hardman is looking forward to lockdown ending but has experienced some upsides being stuck at home. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing in disguise to have the extra time to bond with her,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be up and down. Some days we\u2019re thankful no one\u2019s knocking on the door \u2013 at the same time I really want people to meet her and do normal things like take her to a cafe.\u201d Flora Burr After a straightforward third pregnancy, Janey Burr was surprised to wake up on her due date with coronavirus symptoms. She immediately began to self-quarantine, but as her breathing worsened throughout the day, she went to hospital where she had a chest X-ray, antibiotics and a test for Covid-19. \u201cAs the first suspected pregnant Covid-19 admission in the hospital, the care I received was amazing. Everyone was brilliant,\u201d says Burr, a research nurse, who was looked after by staff from the infectious diseases and obstetrics teams in her own isolated room. \u201cThey monitored my bump a lot as they were worried I would go into labour.\u201d The test came back negative and Burr, 37, was diagnosed with pneumonia secondary to pregnancy-related immunosuppression. \u201cWhat ridiculous timing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was so bizarre. It just came and went out of the blue. It doesn\u2019t feel like it actually happened.\u201d She was discharged after 48 hours with hopes for the baby to stay put for as long as possible to give her a chance to recover, but after a few days at home, her waters broke and Flora was born on the morning of 23 March. That night, as lockdown was announced and Burr cuddled her daughter, she wondered what it all meant. \u201cFor a second I thought I was going to be locked down in hospital. And then I thought it would be quite nice if I could stay \u2013 have my own room with people bringing me food and looking after me so well. But they did kick me out eventually.\u201d She is now back home in Oxford with her husband, Pete, and their two sons Albie, 18 months, and Wilf, three. \u201cAs a nurse, I feel extremely guilty that I\u2019m not working right now,\u201d says Burr. \u201cBut I know every patient will be getting the same level of incredible care I received on my last two hospital visits. So thank you, it doesn\u2019t seem enough, but it is meant with every fibre of my being.\u201d",

But you have had the \u201cCovid cut\u201d \u2013 and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidCutsChallenge?src=hashtag_click\">posted it on social media</a>. Likewise sourdough. But you feel empty, ratty, unfulfilled, helpless. Mostly helpless.</p> \n<p>It could be because you are literally not helping. Lockdown has been all about you and yours, shutting yourselves in, hunkering down and protecting yourselves. But looking outwards, towards helping others, doesn\u2019t just help them, it can help you, too. What is known in the business as win-win. <a href=\"https://www.stephengpost.com/downloads/Rx%20Its%20Good%20to%20be%20Good%202017.pdf\">A study at Stony Brook University</a> in New York after the 2008 financial crisis found that volunteering had psychological rewards; the majority of people who did so were happier and better able to deal with disappointment and loss.</p> \n<p>Rebecca Kennelly, the director of volunteering at the <a href=\"https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/\">Royal Voluntary Service</a>, which is behind the NHS Volunteer Responders scheme, goes along with that. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful experience. That sense of giving yourself to a common purpose is phenomenal.

They discussed \u201capplying the principles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid_(organization_theory)\">Mutual Aid</a> to the situation\u201d, says Kevin Smith, who has been involved from the beginning. \u201cHorizontal principles of solidarity, not a charity model of one group of society helping another.\u201d</p> \n<p>The group put leaflets through doors, asking who needed help and who could help, and started a Facebook page. Then people around the country got interested and involved. <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">A website was launched</a>.</p> \n<p>There are now more than 3,500 groups in the country. Smith says the number of people involved is in the millions. People helping others with the shopping, picking up a prescription, walking the dog, advising on renters\u2019 rights, whatever. He tells me about how his group was contacted by the charity Age UK about a strawberry milkshake. A woman who was dying wanted one. Of course, they got her one, a very posh one, delivered. Oh gosh.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s this narrative foregrounded that\u2019s it\u2019s all about self-interest in times of crisis,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThe flipside is that times of crisis also provoke these sentiments of collective care for each other, and that our wellbeing is fundamentally connected to the community as well.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Volunteer at a food bank</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/\">The Trussell Trust</a> supports a nationwide network of more than 1,200 food banks. There are also <a href=\"https://www.foodaidnetwork.org.uk/our-members\">loads of independent ones</a>. Trussell Trust\u2019s director of policy and research, Gary Lemon, says that coronavirus has thrown up new challenges \u201cfrom the health crisis and from the economic crisis and the increased demand for food banks that comes from that\u201d.</p> \n<p>Many older volunteers have had to stay at home. \u201cWe went through a very fraught couple of weeks, with lots of volunteers dropping out of the system,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>He has been moved by the huge response, but there are still opportunities; you can sign up on the website. Yes, there are risks, as there are for any key workers, but \u201cwe do everything we can to minimise them, with the bits of PPE where we can get it and physical distancing\u201d. If you are not high risk, and you want to help, <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/volunteer/\">the Trussell Trust volunteering page</a> is the best place to start.</p> \n<p>They have had to adapt, such as by moving to home delivery, which is a shame, as it means the food bank is not currently a place to come for a non-judgmental chat and a cup of tea. \u201cBut the first thing is the health and safety of the volunteers, and the people who need their services,\u201d says Lemon.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0458a05cca53aa894207b565072ee4911b1dc0ca\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0458a05cca53aa894207b565072ee4911b1dc0ca/0_0_6405_4270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A volunteer collects food donations for NHS staff in Glasgow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A volunteer collects food donations for NHS staff in Glasgow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Donate food</strong></h2> \n<p>One plea from Lemon: \u201cObviously, we\u2019re very grateful for any non-perishable food we get. But if you <a href=\"https://www.trusselltrust.org/get-involved/ways-to-give/donate-food/\">want to help</a>, find out which sorts of food your local food bank needs, find out what they\u2019re short of, fill those holes.\u201d</p> \n<p>They try to make parcels as nutritionally balanced as possible. Lemon mentions cartons of juice, tins of meat and fish and \u2013 always \u2013 UHT milk. But it will vary from place to place, so find out first. They also take toiletries and hygiene products, such as toothpaste and sanitary towels. Many supermarkets have collection points where you can leave stuff. Online supermarkets have ways of donating when you check out.</p> \n<h2><strong>Can you sew?</strong></h2> \n<p>Annabel Maguire can. She is a set designer, but there is not much need for that at the moment. She wasn\u2019t busy when, a few weeks ago, a doctor in her local Mutual Aid WhatsApp group who couldn\u2019t get scrubs anywhere asked if anyone could make some.</p> \n<p>Maguire and three others in the group \u2013 a pattern cutter in the fashion industry, a charity worker, another with a textile shop \u2013 were quickly on to it. \u201cI guess I had felt \u2026 not useless, but what could I even do with my time now; can I help in any way?\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I did actually have some skills that could help, and we quickly realised that between us we did have the perfect skills to help.\u201d</p> \n<p>They figured out how it could be done, a production line, but in different spaces without contact. And so <a href=\"https://scrubhub.org.uk/\">Scrub Hub</a> was born.</p> \n<p>At the time of speaking, there are 128 hubs across the UK with 1,766 volunteers who have delivered almost 3,500 scrubs. On the website, there is a directory of all the hubs. New ones are still being set up; get involved. You need to know what you are doing, have experience of sewing garments, know what \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlock\">overlocking</a>\u201d is. Maguire and her team were not happy when the Sun described them as a bunch of amateurs. They are proud of their scrubs.</p> \n<h2><strong>You can\u2019t sew?</strong></h2> \n<p>What can you do? Maguire and Ellis found meaning, purpose and structure by utilising their skills. \u201cIt sounds cliched, but I asked how I could help people,\u201d says Ellis. \u201cI look for where the gap is that people are trying to fill.\u201d</p> \n<p>What gaps might you be able to fill? What are your skills? There are organisations such as <a href=\"https://volunteeringmatters.org.uk/want-to-volunteer/\">Volunteering Matters</a> and <a href=\"https://do-it.org/\">Do It</a> that can connect you with charities. <a href=\"https://reachvolunteering.org.uk/\">Reach Volunteering</a> matches people with specialist professional skills.

      "bodyText": "So you have failed to read Proust. Or anything really. And you haven\u2019t learned the piano. But you have had the \u201cCovid cut\u201d \u2013 and posted it on social media. Likewise sourdough. But you feel empty, ratty, unfulfilled, helpless. Mostly helpless. It could be because you are literally not helping. Lockdown has been all about you and yours, shutting yourselves in, hunkering down and protecting yourselves. But looking outwards, towards helping others, doesn\u2019t just help them, it can help you, too. What is known in the business as win-win. A study at Stony Brook University in New York after the 2008 financial crisis found that volunteering had psychological rewards; the majority of people who did so were happier and better able to deal with disappointment and loss. Rebecca Kennelly, the director of volunteering at the Royal Voluntary Service, which is behind the NHS Volunteer Responders scheme, goes along with that. \u201cIt\u2019s a powerful experience. That sense of giving yourself to a common purpose is phenomenal. But also the acknowledgement, when you do a \u2018check-in-and-chat\u2019 call [phone support to people at risk of loneliness], or you drop somebody\u2019s shopping off \u2013 the knowledge that you\u2019ve made a real difference to a person\u2019s life.\u201d Sabrina Ellis in Wolverhampton is a check-in-and-chat responder on the scheme. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m helping people, without being an NHS frontline staff member,\u201d she says.

NHS Volunteer Responders When the scheme was launched on 25 March, the target of 250,000 volunteers was quickly passed. Then doubled, then tripled. \u201cI was incredibly humbled by the response, but I wasn\u2019t surprised; this country loves the NHS,\u201d says Kennelly. At 750,000, it stopped recruiting new volunteers, as there were many more than were needed for the tasks available (as of last Friday, 50,000 tasks had been completed). Keep an eye on it, though, as the situation develops. \u201cNew roles, or particular areas, might open,\u201d says Kennelly. Help yourself NHS Responders has also launched a self-referral number, which allows anyone shielding to ask for help. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t underestimate the depth of loneliness and isolation people are feeling,\u201d says Kennelly. \u201cPeople might feel it\u2019s a bit luxurious to ask someone to call them.

      "bodyText": "Four years ago, Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, ran a \u201cdoomsday\u201d management exercise in which UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain imagined its head office in Welwyn Garden City would have to shut down completely. \u201cAt the time people said it was a bit ridiculous and extreme,\u201d says Lewis. As it turns out, it wasn\u2019t extreme at all, and now looks extraordinarily prescient. Fewer than 30 people have been working at the supermarket chain\u2019s vast campus in Hertfordshire, which usually houses about 6,500 workers, in the past six weeks. Lewis is one of them, frequently popping in from his nearby flat. Thanks to a plan informed by that doomsday exercise, Tesco already had the kit in place for remote working. Some teams have been using Zoom calls to gather hundreds of staff together for about two years. In January, Tesco\u2019s first concerns about the coronavirus were focused on ensuring its non-food ranges were not affected by the impact of the outbreak in China. But by the end of that month the supermarket had spied big potential problems looming, and had a crisis response group in place which was holding daily meetings. As the UK government dithered on implementing a national lockdown, Tesco\u2019s chief executive signed off the retailer\u2019s plan to help feed the nation in mid-February. Lewis, 55, who is to leave the retailer in October after six years in the job, says Tesco has since \u201cchanged fundamentally\u201d how it operates. The most visible change is in stores, with oneway systems, physically distanced queues and protective kit for staff. Lewis says the industry has now bounced back from the shock when panic buying set in and shoppers loaded the equivalent of the peak-Christmas trading day into their baskets for five days on the trot. \u201cOur biggest day of the year is normally 23 December.

It has been hugely humbling,\u201d he adds. Lewis says shortages have now disappeared in all but a handful of categories, such as flour, but the way people shop has altered dramatically. The big weekend shopping trip has disappeared in favour of a steady flow of shoppers throughout the week. Instead of visiting an average three or four different shops to keep topping up their fridge, shoppers now rarely visit more than one, and have returned to a big weekly stock up any day of the week. The retailer took on 47,000 additional staff within days to help cope with demand although at least 7,000 of those have already been stood down, partly as regular staff have returned. There may be fewer visitors in stores but sales remain strong, according to Lewis. \u201cTransactions last week were down by 48% but our basket size more than doubled. People are going back to shopping once a week.\u201d But perhaps the most dramatic change has been on grocery home shopping. Tesco has nearly doubled capacity for delivery and click and collect slots in just six weeks as demand has soared, especially from vulnerable and sick shoppers. The retailer has reached its target of offering 1.2m slots a week, and Lewis says it is now aiming to offer 1.5m within the foreseeable future. Unlike online specialist Ocado, which uses robot-driven warehouses to pick groceries, 90% of Tesco\u2019s home deliveries are picked by hand in stores. That has given it the flexibility to expand by about two Ocado-sized businesses in just six weeks. To meet that demand the first big change was to switch the opening hours of the 350 stores where it picks home shopping orders, from 24-hour trading to daytime opening hours, so that more orders could be picked overnight.

We don\u2019t think there is a business anywhere in the world that does 1m food orders a week like us, but there are still people out there without a delivery slot.\u201d The 1.5m target will partly be achieved by extending click &amp; collect, with 15 more sites due to open this week. Improvements on the computer algorithms, which drive picking technology, and the growing expertise of new pickers hired to cope with the surge in demand will also help. Tesco has another weapon in its arsenal. Before lockdown the retailer was just three weeks away from completing the build of its first mini robot-driven distribution hub in the back of a store, in partnership with the robotic supermarket specialist Takeoff. Once construction is allowed to restart, that facility could rapidly help deliver groceries ordered online more quickly and efficiently. The coronavirus is expected to continue to cause disruption in stores until the end of the year at least, and no one knows whether shoppers will continue to be so keen on shopping from home once, hopefully, Covid-19 becomes a distant memory. \u201cWe don\u2019t know ,\u201d says Lewis, but picking from stores means they can \u201cflex up and down\u201d and \u201cfollow demand\u201d, says Lewis. He says the ability to increase capacity has helped Tesco answer the government\u2019s call to get food to the up to 400,000 people it had identified as extremely vulnerable to the virus, such as cancer patients, and those without regular support. But there are not enough delivery slots, and never will be, Lewis says. \u201cThere is more demand out there but we can\u2019t meet it all. \u201cEven if capacity triples across the whole industry, which is something very difficult to do in a short time, there will still be 80% of the market that needs to visit a store.

He\u2019s right: it is. Coming hot on the heels of Justin Bieber\u2019s similarly meme-focussed Yummy, it feels like a harbinger of a nightmarish new pop era in which every major artist feels obliged to reduce themselves to the level of a children\u2019s party DJ and trail their album with some ghastly millennial equivalent of the Birdie Dance or Agadoo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWggTb45brM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xWggTb45brM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Thankfully, Toosie Slide isn\u2019t the whole story.

It\u2019s also occasionally hugely irritating, as on Pain 1993, which features Playboi Carti whose \u201cbaby voice\u201d is a striking gimmick, but a little of it goes a very long way and there\u2019s an awful lot of it here.</p> <p>Most of Dark Lane Demo Tapes, though, sits somewhere in between.

That leaves the listener concentrating on Drake\u2019s lyrics, which is seldom one of life\u2019s more encouraging experiences. You know what to expect, and you duly get it: anyone in the market for a game of Drake bingo should have their dobber out midway through opener Deep Pockets \u2013 on which we find him \u201closin\u2019 sleep dealin\u2019 with the envy\u201d \u2013 and find themselves shouting \u201chouse\u201d around the time of Desires, where yet again one of his relationships has gone up the wazoo because, you guessed it: \u201cI was too good to you.\u201d</p> <p>To complain about a rapper bragging about being rich feels a bit like complaining about a Highland dancer wearing a kilt.

      "body": "<p>For more than two decades, BP has been represented on the judging panel for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/11/miriam-escofet-angel-table-mother-wins-2018-bp-portrait-award\">the prestigious portrait award</a> it sponsors. But not this year.</p> <p>After growing pressure from artists and campaign groups to end the oil company\u2019s involvement entirely, the prize will be decided without its help, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/national-portrait-gallery\">National Portrait Gallery</a>, organisers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/11/miriam-escofet-angel-table-mother-wins-2018-bp-portrait-award\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jun/11/miriam-escofet-angel-table-mother-wins-2018-bp-portrait-award\">award</a>, confirmed that for the first time since 1997 BP will have no influence on who walks away with the \u00a335,000 first prize, which is announced on Tuesday.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the NPG said: \u201cThe judging panel is refreshed each year to ensure new perspectives are brought to judge the entries. The gallery and BP jointly agreed not to have a sponsor representative on the judging panel this year.\u201d</p> <p>Des Violaris, BP\u2019s head of art, culture and sport, has regularly been on the judging panel. This year\u2019s panel is made up of the director of the NPG, Nicholas Cullinan, the author and curator Ekow Eshun, the writer Justine Picardie, the former portrait award-winner Benjamin Sullivan and the NPG senior curator Rosie Broadley.</p> <p>The spokesperson said the decision not to include a BP representative was not influenced by high-profile campaign work last year. First, a letter backed by 78 artists, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jul/05/five-turner-winners-call-on-national-portrait-gallery-to-cut-ties-with-bp\">five previous Turner Prize winners</a>, asked Cullinan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/10/bp-portrait-award-2019-charlie-schaffer-wins\">end </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jun/10/bp-portrait-award-2019-charlie-schaffer-wins\">BP\u2019s </a>sponsorship of the prize that started in 1990.</p> <p>That was followed up by a letter from the artist Gary Hume, a former judge of the portrait prize. He described the decision to not have a BP representative on the judging panel as \u201ca minor victory\u201d but said it did not go far enough.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still incredibly disappointed that they [the NPG] haven\u2019t bitten the bullet and followed the lead of other cultural institutions and decided that this would be a great opportunity to do the right thing,\u201d said Hume.</p> <p>The news follows mounting pressure on oil companies sponsorship of the arts. In October, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/04/national-theatre-to-end-shell-sponsorship-deal-from-next-year\">National Theatre</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/02/royal-shakespeare-company-to-end-bp-sponsorship-deal\">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> announced they would be ending sponsorship deals with Shell and BP respectively after Mark Rylance resigned from the RSC in protest over the continued relationship he said allowed the oil company to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/21/mark-rylance-resigns-from-royal-shakespeare-company-rsc-over-bp-sponsorship\">obscure the destructive reality of its activities</a>\u201d.</p> <p>A month later National Galleries Scotland said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/nov/11/national-galleries-scotland-end-bp-ties-climate-concerns\">would sever its ties to BP</a> over climate concerns. In July the novelist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ahdafsoueif\">Ahdaf Soueif</a> resigned as a trustee of the British Museum because of what she characterised as its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/16/trustee-resigns-from-british-museum-over-bp-sponsorship-and-artefacts-repatriation\">\u201cimmovability\u201d on critical issues</a>, including the sponsorship deal with BP.</p> <p>A spokesman for the pressure group Culture Unstained said it was no coincidence that the NPG decision came after last year\u2019s campaigning.

      "bodyText": "For more than two decades, BP has been represented on the judging panel for the prestigious portrait award it sponsors. But not this year. After growing pressure from artists and campaign groups to end the oil company\u2019s involvement entirely, the prize will be decided without its help, the Guardian has learned. The National Portrait Gallery, organisers of the award, confirmed that for the first time since 1997 BP will have no influence on who walks away with the \u00a335,000 first prize, which is announced on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the NPG said: \u201cThe judging panel is refreshed each year to ensure new perspectives are brought to judge the entries. The gallery and BP jointly agreed not to have a sponsor representative on the judging panel this year.\u201d Des Violaris, BP\u2019s head of art, culture and sport, has regularly been on the judging panel. This year\u2019s panel is made up of the director of the NPG, Nicholas Cullinan, the author and curator Ekow Eshun, the writer Justine Picardie, the former portrait award-winner Benjamin Sullivan and the NPG senior curator Rosie Broadley. The spokesperson said the decision not to include a BP representative was not influenced by high-profile campaign work last year. First, a letter backed by 78 artists, including five previous Turner Prize winners, asked Cullinan to end BP\u2019s sponsorship of the prize that started in 1990. That was followed up by a letter from the artist Gary Hume, a former judge of the portrait prize. He described the decision to not have a BP representative on the judging panel as \u201ca minor victory\u201d but said it did not go far enough. \u201cI\u2019m still incredibly disappointed that they [the NPG] haven\u2019t bitten the bullet and followed the lead of other cultural institutions and decided that this would be a great opportunity to do the right thing,\u201d said Hume. The news follows mounting pressure on oil companies sponsorship of the arts. In October, the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company announced they would be ending sponsorship deals with Shell and BP respectively after Mark Rylance resigned from the RSC in protest over the continued relationship he said allowed the oil company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d. A month later National Galleries Scotland said it would sever its ties to BP over climate concerns. In July the novelist Ahdaf Soueif resigned as a trustee of the British Museum because of what she characterised as its \u201cimmovability\u201d on critical issues, including the sponsorship deal with BP. A spokesman for the pressure group Culture Unstained said it was no coincidence that the NPG decision came after last year\u2019s campaigning. He added: \u201cThe government needs to urgently commit to properly funding the cultural sector so that organisations can weather the challenges of Covid-19.\u201d Paul Benney, a former portrait award nominee and signatory to last year\u2019s artists\u2019 letter, said he supports the NPG\u2019s decision on the judging panel and that he hoped it lead to \u201can easing of the dependence\u201d on BP for sponsorship. Hume said the coronavirus crisis, in which all major museums and arts institutions have had to close, offered an opportunity to rethink the sponsorship system in general. \u201cRather than just going \u2018Great I\u2019ll take that 10 quid\u2019, you say I think we\u2019ve got to think very seriously that this is a wake up call to how we behave and where we take money from,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue with the same models.\u201d The shortlisted works for this years portrait prize will be displayed online. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 May 2020. In October last year, the Royal Shakespeare Company announced it would be ending its sponsorship deal with BP, not with Shell as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully.

      "bodyText": "Spain and Italy, two of the European countries hardest hit by coronavirus, are beginning to emerge from lengthy and strict lockdowns as Russia and Afghanistan reported their biggest one-day rises in new infections. In Spain, where 217,466 cases of Covid-19 and 25,264 deaths have been confirmed, adults were allowed back on to the street to exercise for the first time in seven weeks this weekend. Small shops, such as bookshops, hardware stores and hair salons were due to reopen on Monday, serving customers by appointment, along with restaurants for the collection of takeaways. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that the wearing of face masks will be mandatory on public transport, and that 14.5m masks will be handed out across the country. S\u00e1nchez also confirmed that his coalition government would be seeking MPs\u2019 approval this week to extend the state of emergency declared on 14 March until 24 May. \u201cWe\u2019re winning the battle against the epidemic, but the cost in lives and sacrifices has been very high,\u201d he said on Saturday. \u201cThe virus isn\u2019t going anywhere. It\u2019s still there, lying in wait, and so we have to be prepared to react and, logically, to be able to manage this transition towards a new normality.\u201d On Sunday, Spain reported 164 deaths, the lowest single-day death toll in six weeks, while the number of new overnight cases was 838. From Monday, people in Italy will be able to travel within regions to visit relatives \u2013 provided they wear masks \u2013 but schools, hairdressers, gyms and many other commercial activities will stay closed. Cafes and restaurants will offer takeaways only, and all travel between regions will be banned except for work, health or emergency situations. Restrictions on funerals have been relaxed, with a maximum of 15 mourners allowed to attend, but the celebration of mass and weddings will have to wait. The virus has claimed almost 29,000 lives in Italy to date, and has infected more than 205,000 people. \u201cWe must maintain social distancing, maximum hygiene levels, and masks,\u201d said Italy\u2019s special commissioner for the virus emergency, Domenico Arcuri. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our bit to the best of our ability. From Monday, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d Portugal, meanwhile, ended its state of emergency on Saturday night and some small shops are reopening as it, too, begins a phased de-escalation. The country, which has reported 25,190 cases and 1,023 deaths, moved swiftly to contain the virus and declared a state of emergency on 18 March, when it had confirmed 448 cases and two deaths. On Saturday, France \u2013 which is set to lift parts of its lockdown on 11 May \u2013 extended the health emergency by two months until late July as it reported 166 new deaths, its lowest single-day toll in more than five weeks. The health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said the date of 11 May was an objective but warned it could be put back if people did not respect the rules. \u201cIf the lockdown is well-respected right to the end, the lid will have been put on the saucepan of the epidemic and we can progressively end the lockdown in the best conditions,\u201d he told Le Parisien newspaper. \u201cIn the opposite case, and if the number of new cases is too high, the date of the lifting of the lockdown could be in doubt and will be weighed up according to each department.\u201d Russia recorded its highest daily rise in confirmed Covid-19 cases on Sunday, with 10,633 new cases listed. It brings the overall number to 134,686. A further 58 deaths have been reported by the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre, increasing the total fatalities to 1,280. In Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak, about 2% of the population is infected by Covid-19, according to officials. \u201cThe threat is apparently on the rise,\u201d said the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin. Afghanistan has confirmed 235 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, marking its biggest one-day rise of new infections, and 12 patients died overnight \u2013 bringing the total number of infections to 2,704 and deaths to 85. The rise came as a third of 500 random tests in the capital, Kabul, came back positive, raising fears of widespread undetected infections in one of the world\u2019s most fragile states. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst-affected area and authorities have implemented a lockdown in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. The disease may cause huge collateral damage among Afghanistan\u2019s many vulnerable citizens. Save the Children has already warned that lockdowns \u2013 which are being widely ignored \u2013 have put 7 million children at risk of hunger. Six new polio cases were also reported in the country on Sunday. More than 250,000 Afghans have returned home from neighbouring Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of coronavirus. Iran has said it will reopen schools and mosques in some locations, even though the nation has been the regional centre of the pandemic since mid-February. \u2022 Additional reporting by Akhtar Mohammad Makoii and agencies",

A spokesperson for the embassy\u2019s said Sunday\u2019s statement had come from the Elys\u00e9e Palace. The Elys\u00e9e later confirmed the embassy\u2019s stance. However, at a press conference on Saturday, after a meeting of France\u2019s Conseil des Ministres (Council of Ministers), V\u00e9ran had announced: \u201cThis quarantine will be imposed on everyone arriving on French soil.\u201d He added it would affect mainly French people and those normally resident in France returning home from abroad. The minister\u2019s statement appeared to be based on a draft bill extending France\u2019s \u201cstate of health emergency\u201d until 24 July, drawn up after the ministers\u2019 meeting. The bill is to be presented to the S\u00e9nat, the upper house of parliament, on Monday and to the lower house the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale afterwards. Article two of the draft bill stated that the quarantine would be imposed on all those arriving on French territory from \u201czones where the virus is circulating\u201d. V\u00e9ran said the details of the quarantine and isolation rules would be published in a \u201cdecree\u201d, but there was no mention in either the minister\u2019s announcement or the draft legislation that EU citizens and those from Schengen countries and the UK would be exempted. \u201cThe 14 days [quarantine] is for people who are not symptomatic: isolation concerns those who have tested positive for the coronavirus according to a medical assessment\u201d, V\u00e9ran said. Cases will be treated on an individual basis and those placed in quarantine or isolation \u2013 organised by the French authorities and possibly in hotels or designated medical centres \u2013 will be able to appeal to a judge.

There is no indication of when the new rules in the draft bill, to be examined by parliament on Monday and Tuesday, will come into effect. It is understood that cross-border workers, international transport workers, hauliers and those involved in urgent medical work, currently allowed to enter France if carrying an international attestation, would not be subject to any restrictions. State television reported there were no plans to test people arriving in France from areas hit by the virus, before placing them in quarantine. France\u2019s borders have been closed to tourists or those with non-essential reasons to enter the country since 8 April. Saturday\u2019s announcement gave no indication of when hotels, restaurants and cafes would be allowed to reopen, which will disappoint the French tourism sector, already hit by cancellations and uncertainty. France is the world\u2019s number-one tourist destination, with more than 89 million visitors a year. Officials in popular holiday areas warned the situation was catastrophic and said many would find it hard to recover. Georges Mela, the mayor of Porto-Vechhio in Corsica, which attracts 3 million tourists annually, called on the government to introduce a system of \u201chealth passports\u201d for those who can prove they have tested negative for the virus in the seven days before arriving in France. The Italian government is considering a similar scheme, he said. \u201cThe collapse of the tourist industry would be a catastrophe for the whole of Corsica, one it would take years to recover from,\u201d Mela said in a statement. Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, has made a similar request. Christophe Castaner, the French interior minister, has already said France\u2019s borders would remain closed \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d even after the country\u2019s strict lockdown ends. People have been told to avoid journeys of more than 100km (62 miles) after 11 May. \u201cIt has to be said that this holiday season will not be like others,\u201d Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, secretary of state for tourism, told the national assembly last week, urging citizens to think \u201cultra-local\u201d when planning breaks this year. On Saturday, Castaner also announced the extension of fines for those who do not respect physical distancing rules in public places when the lockdown ends. \u201cThe challenge in the coming months will be learning to live with the virus,\u201d he said. There have been almost 131,000 official recorded confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and an estimated 24,760 deaths.",

A third hotel, the St Moritz in Trebetherick, is on standby should the county experience a Covid-19 surge.</p> \n<p>Rob Rotchell, cabinet member for adults at Cornwall council, has been coordinating what it calls its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cqc.org.uk/search/site/penventon?location=&amp;latitude=&amp;longitude=&amp;sort=default&amp;la=&amp;distance=15&amp;mode=html\">discharge lounges</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe opened the first one on 27 March. I think we were the first to do it. At that time there was an expectation that the whole NHS was going to be absolutely flooded. We needed somewhere else to put people who were well enough to be discharged from hospital but were not well enough to manage on their own at home \u2026 At the same time, a lot of hotels were closing because there were no tourists coming so it seemed an ideal opportunity for us. There\u2019s a double benefit really.\u201d</p> \n<p>The council pays the hotels around \u00a3100 a room a night to cover catering and housekeeping costs, said Rotchell. On top of that, they fund an army of carers to tend to the new residents between once and four times a day. It\u2019s a much more efficient way of working, without carers spending hours each day in their cars navigating Cornwall\u2019s narrow lanes.</p> \n<p>The seaside vistas appear to be speeding convalescence. \u201cThere\u2019s this great story of a chappie that was discharged from the Royal Cornwall hospital in Truro to Newquay. Let me tell you, the view from the hospital rooms in Truro isn\u2019t great. Usually you can just see a bit of wall. This chappie was admitted to the Carnmarth with a view over Fistral beach. What I am told is that he was much brighter, psychologically, because he had this fabulous view and could see the sun setting over the sea,\u201d said Rotchell.</p> \n<p>Around 350 miles north, just off the M62, the Cedar Court hotel in Huddersfield this week accepted its first guests after becoming an emergency care home after a breakneck, three-week refit. Its new residents will either have been discharged from hospital, as in Cornwall, or may come as part of a respite deal between the council and their families.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There are 113 rooms but Calderdale council has struck a deal to use a maximum of 70 during the crisis with an option to scale up if the local hospitals become overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>One of the first guests was a young man in his 20s with learning difficulties. \u201cHis family was struggling to keep their son at home during lockdown, when the day services he accessed were all closed. We offered to put him in Cedar Court as respite,\u201d said Iain Baines, Calderdale council\u2019s director of adult services and wellbeing.</p> \n<p>The hotel may also step in if the council\u2019s normal care providers are unable to assist, added Baines. \u201cAt the moment, 13% of staff working for those providers are off sick, either with Covid symptoms or because a family member is ill or because they are shielding themselves.

      "bodyText": "Guests rave about the sea views from the best rooms at Newquay\u2019s Carnmarth hotel, looking out over Fistral beach, one of Cornwall\u2019s finest surfing destinations. Even out of season, a double can cost \u00a3150 a night and must normally be booked months in advance. Now, though, the panorama is being enjoyed by a different kind of guest after the hotel was turned into an emergency care home for patients discharged from hospital in an effort to clear beds during the coronavirus crisis. Three Cornish hotels and one in West Yorkshire are among the first to reopen as what have been called \u201cNightingale care homes\u201d, plugging the gap between hospital and social care for those who have suffered conditions other than Covid-19. So far about 30 people have stayed at the Carnmarth and Penventon Park, a luxury four-star spa hotel in Redruth, as part of Cornwall council\u2019s hospital discharge plan during the pandemic. A third hotel, the St Moritz in Trebetherick, is on standby should the county experience a Covid-19 surge. Rob Rotchell, cabinet member for adults at Cornwall council, has been coordinating what it calls its \u201cdischarge lounges\u201d. He said: \u201cWe opened the first one on 27 March. I think we were the first to do it. At that time there was an expectation that the whole NHS was going to be absolutely flooded. We needed somewhere else to put people who were well enough to be discharged from hospital but were not well enough to manage on their own at home \u2026 At the same time, a lot of hotels were closing because there were no tourists coming so it seemed an ideal opportunity for us. There\u2019s a double benefit really.\u201d The council pays the hotels around \u00a3100 a room a night to cover catering and housekeeping costs, said Rotchell. On top of that, they fund an army of carers to tend to the new residents between once and four times a day. It\u2019s a much more efficient way of working, without carers spending hours each day in their cars navigating Cornwall\u2019s narrow lanes. The seaside vistas appear to be speeding convalescence. \u201cThere\u2019s this great story of a chappie that was discharged from the Royal Cornwall hospital in Truro to Newquay. Let me tell you, the view from the hospital rooms in Truro isn\u2019t great. Usually you can just see a bit of wall. This chappie was admitted to the Carnmarth with a view over Fistral beach. What I am told is that he was much brighter, psychologically, because he had this fabulous view and could see the sun setting over the sea,\u201d said Rotchell. Around 350 miles north, just off the M62, the Cedar Court hotel in Huddersfield this week accepted its first guests after becoming an emergency care home after a breakneck, three-week refit. Its new residents will either have been discharged from hospital, as in Cornwall, or may come as part of a respite deal between the council and their families. There are 113 rooms but Calderdale council has struck a deal to use a maximum of 70 during the crisis with an option to scale up if the local hospitals become overwhelmed. One of the first guests was a young man in his 20s with learning difficulties. \u201cHis family was struggling to keep their son at home during lockdown, when the day services he accessed were all closed. We offered to put him in Cedar Court as respite,\u201d said Iain Baines, Calderdale council\u2019s director of adult services and wellbeing. The hotel may also step in if the council\u2019s normal care providers are unable to assist, added Baines. \u201cAt the moment, 13% of staff working for those providers are off sick, either with Covid symptoms or because a family member is ill or because they are shielding themselves. The idea with Cedar Court came about as part of our scenario planning to make sure care needs are met,\u201d he said. No one who has tested positive for Covid-19 is allowed into any of the hotels. In Calderdale, the council is separately preparing a type of holding centre for patients well enough to be discharged from hospital who haven\u2019t yet had their test results back. Located in a former care home in the village of West Vale, two miles outside Halifax, it will keep residents in much stricter isolation than at Cedar Court, said Baines. As of Friday, 53 people in Calderdale were confirmed to have died from Covid-19, 23 of whom passed away in care homes. Boris Johnson claims the nadir has been reached nationally, but Baines thinks the worst is yet to come for Calderdale. \u201cSocial care has not yet reached its peak,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are two or three weeks behind our own acute [hospital] trust. I think we will probably see care home [deaths] continue to rise over the next few weeks but I would hope with the measures we are putting in place we will be able to reduce the prevalence in care homes as much as possible.\u201d The four hotels in Cornwall and Huddersfield have all been registered as care homes with the Care Quality Commission (CQC), which regulates the sector. A CQC spokesperson said: \u201cIn this period of unprecedented pressure we want to support health and social care providers to increase capacity as part of the ongoing effort to respond to Covid-19 ... A Covid-19 registration is any \u2018application\u2019 from a health or social care provider where they intend to deliver services which provide additional health and social care capacity in an area; or contribute to the control of the outbreak or the treatment of people who have contracted the illness. All applications relating to Covid-19 will be prioritised by CQC so that we can ensure the health and social care system is in the best position possible to meet this increased need.\u201d",

However, there is no \u2018blanket ban\u2019, and the suggestion that the clinically vulnerable \u201cinclude \u2018people aged 70 or older regardless of medical conditions\u2019\u201d is wrong and deeply misleading.\u201d That prompted some on social media to point to advice published on the government website on Friday, which includes the words: \u201cClinically vulnerable people are those who are: aged 70 or older (regardless of medical conditions) ...\u201d When contacted, the Department of Health and Social Care said the over-70s \u201care not included in the most at-risk group (extremely clinically vulnerable), who have been told to isolate for 12 weeks\u201d.",

The total UK death toll now stands at 28,446. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove reveals 76,496 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning, which is substantially below the 100,000 target it had set.

the NHS, when given that challenge, can very, very rapidly put in place the extra capacity that is required.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd they have done that magnificently, and at no point during the surge of cases in April was the NHS in a position where it was not able to give the treatment to patients with Covid-19 that they needed.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat is a great testament to how well the NHS has been able to cope.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I think then the lesson going forward is one, that we can do that, but two, we need to keep that capacity in place.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut we need to keep it in place at the same time as standing up all the other services that the NHS is providing.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re the ones we\u2019ve always provided, the emergency services, but some of the services that we\u2019ve had to stand down during April, so elective surgery for instance.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo my lesson is that the NHS is incredibly flexible. It can respond to this challenge, and it will respond to the challenge going forward into the months ahead.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaeebf18f082b32fdd6c863\" class=\"block\"

are working internationally to determine what the best means is of dealing with it.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we are piloting treatments which can prevent the virus, once people have been infected, becoming more dangerous for them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also why we\u2019re working internationally to seek to secure a vaccine, though of course we expect that may be some time away.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut one of the things that we have learned is how to improve our testing capacity.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe also now have increased domestic ventilator production and Lord Deighton is increasing domestic PPE production as well.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I think the lessons that we\u2019re learning in the UK are similar to the lessons that other countries are learning as

country\u2019s decision not to extend testing to all care homes regardless of whether there is an outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Gething said: \u201cEngland have gone out and created lots of capacity very quickly and they\u2019ve then gone out and used that capacity.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe challenge is though, that from a policy point of view there is clearly a difference, but that\u2019s partly because England decided that having set a big target they needed to go out and use all the tests.</p> \n  <p>\u201cNow, other people will tell you about how many of those tests are actual tests, or tests that have been sent out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut part of the difficulty we\u2019ve had is that the scientific underpinning for how and why you extend that policy isn\u2019t something where there has been a fully informed debate in advance, and we don\u2019t see that the science supports all of the differences in policy and the testing reach in England.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked if Wales could increase its number of tests available, Gething said: \u201cThat capacity is being increased each week.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor the current purpose of keeping people safe, in particular key workers, on understanding people in our healthcare system actually have coronavirus, we do have enough capacity.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut the continued build-up of capacity here is being driven at what happens for us to be able to get out of lockdown.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also criticised the UK Government for including a testing centre in Cardiff on its test-booking website, despite it

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me, Nadeem Badshah. To continue following our coronavirus coverage, you can check out our global liveblog NHS England announced 327 further deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,180. A further 14 people have died after testing positive in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 983. In Scotland, a further 12 people have died which brings the total to 1,571. There have been a further five confirmed deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, bringing the total deaths in the region to 381. The total UK death toll now stands at 28,446. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove reveals 76,496 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning, which is substantially below the 100,000 target it had set. He said the government has pledged an additional \u00a31.6 billion to councils across England to support their \u201cessential frontline services\u201d including adult social care. Gove also suggested the easing of lockdown restrictions will be \u201cstaged\u201d and will not be a \u201cflick of the switch\u201d. He added that 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been given an offer of accommodation since the end of March. Professor Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, insisted the new NHS Nightingale hospitals were \u201cabsolutely 100% not\u201d built in error, adding it would have been \u201cfoolish\u201d not to plan for extra capacity. Fewer people would have died from coronavirus in the UK if the country had greater testing capacity sooner, transport secretary Grant Shapps said. Asked whether fewer people would have died if testing capacity had been greater sooner, he told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cYes. If we had had 100,000 test capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively I\u2019m sure many things could be different.\u201d Three rail unions have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, saying this is not the time to lift the lockdown and run more trains. The joint letter \u2013 signed by the heads of ASLEF, RMT and the TSSA\u2013 says it is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d to put the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk. Police have arrested 13 people and issued 11 more with fines after breaking up two parties in Liverpool. Three officers were assaulted after attending one of the house parties in Garmoyle Road, Wavertree. Eleven people, most of whom had travelled from Greater Manchester, were issued with fixed penalty notices for breaching Covid-19 legislation yesterday. A 20-year-old woman, from Hyde in Greater Manchester, was arrested on suspicion of breach of Covid-19 legislation and three counts of assaulting constables after becoming aggressive when officers attended. Police were called to Duke Street, in the city centre, in the early hours after suspicions a group had forced entry to a property and were holding a party. Officers arrested four people in the car on suspicion of burglary. Eight more people were arrested on suspicion of burglary after officers attended the property, a police spokesman said. Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter Medical School, on the tracing app. Gove was also challenged about the role of Trevor Phillips in the inquiry over BAME patients, which has been the subject of controversy for his previous remarks about Muslims and his suspension from Labour. He said Phillips, when he was chair of the Equalities and Human Rights Committee, was always \u201cdriven by the data\u201d. Gove described Phillips as a \u201cdistinguished\u201d public servant. The daily press briefing from Downing Street has now concluded. Gove is asked about the inquiry into the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on BAME people. He replies there \u201cappears to be a significant number of deaths\u201d in the BAME community. He added there may be a greater prevalence of conditions such as diabetes in some communities but another factor may be inequality. But he said he does not want to \u201cprejudge\u201d the inquiry. Prof Powis said the R -rate is around 0.7 but the figure has yet to be finalised. Gove is asked how many prisoners have been released due to the coronavirus outbreak. He replies the early release of prisons was \u201cjust one part\u201d of reducing the number of cases in prisons in order to protect the NHS. Gove says pregnant women were at the front of the queue for release. He added at least 33 people had been released but the number is higher now. When asked about his confidence in models predicting what may happen with any change in lockdown rules, Prof Powis said \u201cthe reality will always be different from the model, it will not exactly replicate the model\u201d and \u201cthere are some unknowns\u201d. He said the public had been \u201creally excellent at complying\u201d with the rules, and thus far trends have tended to follow the models produced. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s followed it pretty much in the shape of what we\u2019ve seen so that does give me some confidence that going forward models are a reasonable way of predicting what we might see. \u201cThey do predict that over the next month or so we will continue to see a decline in the number of patients in hospital with Covid-19, the number of people in critical care and indeed the number of deaths.\u201d He added: \u201cThey will never be an absolute perfect prediction of reality but I have confidence that going forward they will give us a very good guide of what we are likely to see.\u201d Prof Powis has insisted the new NHS Nightingale hospitals were \u201cabsolutely 100% not\u201d built in error after reported emerged of a low capacity of patients. He said it would have been \u201cfoolish\u201d not to plan for extra capacity in the NHS, and it is \u201cgood news\u201d that the Nightingales\u2019 capacity has not been reached. Prof Powis says there is still a possibility they could yet be needed. He suggests the peak of the virus in the UK was around mid-April. Gove says the government plans a \u201cstaged\u201d return with ministers working with employers and unions to help workers understand safety guidance and public servants will be offered protective equipment varying \u201cfrom setting to setting\u201d. He also says it is possible restrictions could be reimposed in a \u201clocalised way\u201d but does not go into the specifics. Gove praised health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s \u201camazing success in increasing testing\u201d, which he said means the public will have \u201cgreater confidence\u201d in the government as they move into the next phase of lockdown. \u201cThe British public have shown amazing stoicism and understanding of the need for the lockdown measures,\u201d he said. \u201cQuite rightly they want to make sure that if and when they are eased, they\u2019re eased in way that makes sure the British people\u2019s sacrifice has been worthwhile, and that we continue to operate in a way that means public health comes first. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we consult with employers and trade unions, to make sure that people understand the guidance about working safely.\u201d He said the government will pursue a \u201cphased approach\u201d to removing lockdown restrictions rather than a sudden return to \u201cthe old normal\u201d. The phrase a \u201cnew normal\u201d has again been used. Gove says there will be a time when the virus is under control when \u201cdeep and probing questions\u201d about the government\u2019s handling of the crisis can be posed. \u201cUndoubtedly this government, like all governments, will have made mistakes,\u201d he admitted. Further bemused reaction to those daily testing numbers falling below the 100,000 target. Professor Stephen Powis has praised the resilience and professionalism of NHS staff. He said: \u201cWhat I learned is that the NHS and the great staff of the NHS, when given that challenge, can very, very rapidly put in place the extra capacity that is required. \u201cAnd they have done that magnificently, and at no point during the surge of cases in April was the NHS in a position where it was not able to give the treatment to patients with Covid-19 that they needed. \u201cThat is a great testament to how well the NHS has been able to cope. \u201cAnd I think then the lesson going forward is one, that we can do that, but two, we need to keep that capacity in place. \u201cBut we need to keep it in place at the same time as standing up all the other services that the NHS is providing. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones we\u2019ve always provided, the emergency services, but some of the services that we\u2019ve had to stand down during April, so elective surgery for instance. \u201cSo my lesson is that the NHS is incredibly flexible. It can respond to this challenge, and it will respond to the challenge going forward into the months ahead.\u201d Gove says there are around 80,000 households on the Isle of Wight, where the NHS contact-tracing app is being trialled, and they want more than half of them to download it. He added the dip in the number of coronavirus tests over the weekend is due to the fact it is the weekend and fewer people are at work. More from Gove on what lessons have been learned for future waves of the virus and how the government will ensure there are enough PPE and ventilators in the future. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re learning lessons all the time, as indeed the world is. \u201cThis is a new virus and scientists are working internationally to determine what the best means is of dealing with it. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we are piloting treatments which can prevent the virus, once people have been infected, becoming more dangerous for them. \u201cIt\u2019s also why we\u2019re working internationally to seek to secure a vaccine, though of course we expect that may be some time away. \u201cBut one of the things that we have learned is how to improve our testing capacity. \u201cWe also now have increased domestic ventilator production and Lord Deighton is increasing domestic PPE production as well. \u201cAnd I think the lessons that we\u2019re learning in the UK are similar to the lessons that other countries are learning as well.\u201d Gove is asked how the government will persuade people, when the lockdown is eventually eased, that it is safe to leave their homes. He replies that Britons have displayed \u201cstoicism\u201d in the face of the lockdown. He added that the lifting of the lockdown will be \u201cstaged\u201d and not a \u201cflick of the switch\u201d, while he highlights how the right supplies of PPE will be necessary. Gove also notes how the \u201camazing\u201d increase in the level of testing will give people greater confidence when the lockdown is eased. Gove said that 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been given an offer of accommodation since the end of March. Providing an update on work that was being done to help vulnerable people, he said the Government was nearing delivering its one millionth parcel of essential food. In terms of NHS volunteers, he told the briefing that more than 600,000 people have been verified \u201cand are helping with the daily errands that make such a significant difference\u201d. He added that officials were \u201cworking with supermarkets to make sure that a greater number of delivery slots are made available to those most in need\u201d. On how the government is finding a balance between the other impacts of lockdown compared to the impact of coronavirus infections, Gove said the government\u2019s five tests for lifting the lockdown are an \u201cappropriate\u201d way to measure that balance. Prof Powis said the harm that might be done as a direct effect due to the virus has to be balanced against the harms to health as a result of the lockdown, adding the NHS is \u201cvery aware\u201d of this. On PPE, Gove said: \u201cFrom February 25 to May 2 we had delivered over 1.08 billion items of PPE across the health and social care system within England. \u201cAnd tens of millions more have been distributed by our colleagues in the devolved administrations. \u201cThis overall figure includes 149 million masks, 173 million aprons, two million gowns and 614 million gloves. \u201cOn May 2 alone we delivered an additional 20 million items of PPE within England.\u201d He said there is \u201cmuch more to do\u201d. Gove said the government has committed 100 million for remote learning for \u201cthose who need it most\u201d and 180 video lessons per week were being supplied through the newly launched Oak National Academy. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly keen to help vulnerable and disadvantaged children to carry on with their education during the pandemic,\u201d he said. Gove added the government has ordered laptops for disadvantaged children sitting exams next year and for children with social workers to help them stay in touch with vital services. He said free internet routers and free school meal vouchers are being provided for those who need them. In response to a question about what lessons the government has learned to prepare the NHS for future waves of coronavirus infections, Gove says the UK has learned how to improve testing capacity, PPE production and the production of ventilators. Prof Powis says, if the R rate of reproduction of the virus is kept below 1, the UK should be protected from future waves of infections. He added the NHS has been found to be \u201cincredibly agile\u201d in terms of increasing capacity when it is needed. Prof Stephen Powis said the peak of hospital admissions has now passed, particularly in London. Gove now hands over to Professor Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. Prof Powis says Britons are continuing to respond to social distancing measures and have done so \u201cmagnificently\u201d. He admits there has been a \u201cdip\u201d in the number of coronavirus tests conducted over the weekend, but says the testing level is expected to increase over the coming days. It\u2019s \u201cevident\u201d the rate of coronavirus transmission in the community is decreasing despite the increase in testing which would show up more cases. He added: \u201cThe trend now is downwards\u201d as he displays a graph of the number of deaths in the UK. Prof Powis confirms the UK is through the peak of deaths. Gove says the government wants a greater number of children classified as vulnerable to go to school. Currently only around one in ten are attending. He added that 15,500 schools have asked to turn free school meals into food vouchers, with \u00a335 million worth of vouchers claimed. Gove says the government has pledged an additional \u00a31.6 billion to councils across England to support their \u201cessential frontline services\u201d including adult social care. Gove said \u201cbefore we can ease the existing restrictions we must ensure the government\u2019s five tests are met - that the number of cases are falling, that death rates are declining, that the NHS has what it needs, and that measures are in place to stop a second peak overwhelming the NHS.\u201d He said he is \u201cparticularly conscious\u201d that those in the frontline of our public services will need \u201cclear guidance on safe working\u201d. The minister added: \u201cThey\u2019ll need the right personal protective equipment and appropriate access to testing if we are to make all the progress that we want in the weeks ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re consulting with employers and unions, professionals and public health experts, to establish how we can ensure that we have the safest possible working environments, and the Prime Minister will be saying more later this week.\u201d Gove said more than 200,000 key workers and their families had been tested for coronavirus. He said criteria for testing had been extended beyond key workers to anyone over 65 displaying symptoms and anyone who has to travel to get to work. Gove also confirmed that this week the government will be piloting new \u201ctest, track and trace procedures\u201d on the Isle of Wight with a view to having them in place more widely later this month. Reaction to Gove\u2019s admission on the testing numbers. Gove paid tribute to Muslims celebrating Ramadan during lockdown who are mourning the loss of a loved one. He said: \u201cFor those experiencing the first Ramadan without a loved one, this will be a particularly painful time. \u201cAs with Christians who could not celebrate Easter together in church, and the Jewish community whose Passover rituals were affected by social distancing, our thoughts are with Muslim neighbours who cannot break their fast together and must adapt their religious and cultural practices because of the crisis.\u201d The Cabinet Minister said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s comprehensive plan will explain how we can get our economy moving, how we can get our children back to school, how we can travel to work more safely and how we can make life in the workplace safer.\u201d He added that over the Easter holidays, 60% of schools remained open for the children of key workers. Gove reveals 76,496 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning, which is below the 100,000 target it had previously set. Gove says the prime minister will say more this week about how people will be allowed to go back to work when the UK\u2019s lockdown is eased. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove begins the briefing by confirming that 76,496 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 9am this morning. And he announces 28,446 people have now died with coronavirus in the UK, up by 315 from 28,131 the day before. The government\u2019s 4pm briefing has been delayed and is expected to start within the next 20 minutes. The Welsh government does \u201cnot see the science\u201d in recent extensions to England\u2019s testing policy, according to Wales\u2019 health minister Vaughan Gething. He also raised doubts about the benefits and validity of England\u2019s 100,000 tests-per-day target and defended his own country\u2019s decision not to extend testing to all care homes regardless of whether there is an outbreak. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Gething said: \u201cEngland have gone out and created lots of capacity very quickly and they\u2019ve then gone out and used that capacity. \u201cThe challenge is though, that from a policy point of view there is clearly a difference, but that\u2019s partly because England decided that having set a big target they needed to go out and use all the tests. \u201cNow, other people will tell you about how many of those tests are actual tests, or tests that have been sent out. \u201cBut part of the difficulty we\u2019ve had is that the scientific underpinning for how and why you extend that policy isn\u2019t something where there has been a fully informed debate in advance, and we don\u2019t see that the science supports all of the differences in policy and the testing reach in England.\u201d Asked if Wales could increase its number of tests available, Gething said: \u201cThat capacity is being increased each week. \u201cFor the current purpose of keeping people safe, in particular key workers, on understanding people in our healthcare system actually have coronavirus, we do have enough capacity. \u201cBut the continued build-up of capacity here is being driven at what happens for us to be able to get out of lockdown.\u201d He also criticised the UK Government for including a testing centre in Cardiff on its test-booking website, despite it being under the control of the Welsh Government, and as such tells users that testing is \u201cunavailable\u201d in Wales. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is scheduled to lead the government\u2019s press conference in around five minutes. Joining him for the Downing Street briefing will be Professor Stephen Powis, the medical director for NHS England. Airline UK, which represents British Airways, Easyjet, Virgin Atlantic, Ryanair and other UK-based airlines, has warned that a 14-day quarantine period \u201cwould effectively kill air travel\u201d. Transport secretary Grant Shapps today told the BBC a compulsory 14-day quarantine could be imposed on anyone arriving in the country so when infection rates in the country are under control \u201cwe\u2019re not importing\u201d. Tim Alderslade, Airline UK chief executive, said a quarantine would \u201ccompletely shut off the UK from the rest of the world when other countries are opening up their economies\u201d and described the possible quarantine measure as a \u201cblunt tool\u201d. A paramedic has died in hospital after contracting Covid-19. He has been named locally as Robert Black from Campbeltown in Scotland. He died in a Glasgow hospital on Saturday. Pauline Howie, chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS), who did not name Black, said the service had been \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the loss of a \u201cdear colleague\u201d. On behalf of the SAS, she offered her \u201cheart-felt condolences and deepest sympathies\u201d to his family. Howie added: \u201cI would also like to thank our NHS Scotland colleagues for the compassionate care they have shown our friend during their illness.\u201d Radio station Argyll FM, where Black worked, said on its Facebook page that he was \u201ca much loved member\u201d of the team and would be \u201csorely missed\u201d. At the Scottish government\u2019s daily briefing, health secretary Jeane Freeman announced that outreach workers supplying emergency Naloxone, the life-saving overdose reversal drug, will not be prosecuted. Whilst it might seem peculiar that anyone attempting to save a life would be at risk of breaking the law, remember that drug laws are reserved to Westminster, there are particular legal restrictions around who can supply this particular drug and this change will allow drug treatment services to offer the life-saving kits without any concerns. Freeman said that the Lord Advocate has agreed that \u201cit would not be in the public interest, for the duration of the current crisis, for any individual working for a service registered with the Scottish government to be prosecuted for supplying naloxone in an emergency to save a life\u201d. She also announced extra funding for two specialist organisations helping people with autism, acknowledging that changes to routine and stress are especially difficult for those who are autistic, as well as more support for young people and families \u2013 funding to develop digital resources on mental well-being for teens and funding for a helpline that specialises in help for those experiencing relationship difficulties. Earlier on Sunday, first minister Nicola Sturgeon backed up the Welsh government on Twitter as regards who will make decisions about children returning to school. Both Welsh and Scottish governments have stressed that they would prefer a four nations approach to lifting lockdown, but the differences in tone between devolved administrations and Westminster are becoming ever more apparent. Professor Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, has spoken about the prospect of a vaccine in the next year. He told NBC \u201cthe prospects are pretty good, I certainly wouldn\u2019t put the possibility at 80 percent\u201d. Sir Bell said: \u201cPeople who have dedicated their careers to this kind of a problem have a tendency to get excited about the prospects because the prospects are pretty good. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t put the possibility at 80% -- that\u2019s a pretty big number. But we are gradually reeling it in bit by bit and as every day goes by, the likelihood of success goes up.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019ve already started clinical trials, so we\u2019ve already given the vaccine to about a thousand people and we\u2019re going to grow that pretty rapidly. \u201cWe\u2019ve consolidated the phase one and two programs because we are pretty confident that the vector itself is safe because it\u2019s been used in about 5,000 people already up to now. \u201cSo that\u2019s allowed us to really accelerate the phase one program and we hope that there would be enough disease that we would get evidence that the vaccine has efficacy by the beginning of June.\u201d Of the 21,180 reported coronavirus deaths so far in hospitals in England, 11,090 (52%) have been people aged 80 and over while 8,238 (39%) were 60-79. A further 1,691 (8%) were aged 40-59, with 150 (1%) aged 20-39 and 11 (0.05%) aged 0-19, according to NHS England. The number of deaths announced so far by University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust has reached 778, the highest number for any trust in England. London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust has announced 520 deaths. Three trusts have announced between 400 and 500 deaths: the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust (446), King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (432) and Barts Health NHS Trust (412). A further seven trusts have announced between 300 and 400 deaths. A further 14 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 983, Public Health Wales said. Another 174 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 10,329. As of 2pm today, 12,097 people positive for coronavirus in Scotland while 1,571 patients have sadly died, an increase of 12. Some 60,295 people in Scotland have been tested for the virus. There have been a further five confirmed deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health, bringing the total deaths in the region to 381. NHS England has announced 327 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,180. Of the 327 new deaths announced today: - 56 occurred on May 2 - 125 occurred on May 1 - 43 occurred on April 30 The data also show 95 of the new deaths took place between April 1 and April 29 while the remaining eight deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on March 28. The figures published today by NHS England show April 8 remains the day with the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring with a total of 867. A \u201cdoomsday\u201d management exercise in which Tesco, the UK\u2019s biggest supermarket chain imagined its head office would have to shut down completely, helped the company to cope with the impact of the pandemic. Sarah Butler has written an interesting piece, based on an interview with Tesco\u2019s chief executive, Dave Lewis. In January, Tesco\u2019s first concerns about the coronavirus were focused on ensuring its non-food ranges were not affected by the impact of the outbreak in China. But by the end of that month the supermarket had spied big potential problems looming, and had a crisis response group in place which was holding daily meetings. Three rail unions have written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, saying this is not the time to lift the lockdown and run more trains. The joint letter \u2013 signed by the heads of ASLEF, RMT and the TSSA\u2013 says it is \u2018completely unacceptable\u2019 to put the lives of passengers and rail staff at risk. They warn: We have severe concerns over attempts by operators to increase service levels. First, it sends out a mixed message that it is okay to travel by train \u2013 despite official advice suggesting otherwise. This mixed messaging could be dangerous and lead to the public flouting the rules on travel and work. Second, there is no agreement on how actually services can be increased whilst protecting workers and passengers. This includes protections through social distancing, adequate and appropriate PPE, and determination of essential and non-essential tasks. Deborah Buchanan, a woman in Northern Ireland who shared a final photo of her dying mum in hospital in a bid to get people to wake up to the realities of coronavirus, wrote about it on Facebook. \u201cWe had to watch her gasp her last breaths and slip away in agony. My dad says this is the worst thing he has ever felt in his life, he fears going to sleep incase he doesn\u2019t wake up. They hadn\u2019t left the house in weeks but still picked this up and both took very unwell,\u201d she wrote. The BBC declined the opportunity today to respond publicly to the letter from culture minister Oliver Dowden, but a spokesperson did that they the broadcaster wanted to highlight comments by the prime minister earlier in the week in relation to personal protective equipment (PPE). Speaking at the No 10 briefing for the first time since recovering from the virus, he said: I\u2019m not going to minimise the logistical problems we\u2019ve faced in getting the right protective gear to the right people in the right place, both in the NHS and care homes. The BBC has stood by its defence of a Panorama investigation exposing shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) among healthcare workers, after a formal complaint from the culture secretary. Oliver Dowden, in a letter to the BBC director general, Tony Hall, claimed the corporation was at risk of losing the public\u2019s confidence amid accusations of political bias. Last week Panorama reported that gowns, visors, swabs and body bags were left out of the government\u2019s stockpile when it was set up in 2009. Some of the items are now in short supply. Since the programme aired, a number of NHS workers who were interviewed for it were reported to be either longstanding members or supporters of the Labour party. Dowden also referred to another recent incident in which the BBC admitted it had made a mistake by reporting that a boss of an NHS trust had contacted the broadcaster with concerns about the provision of gowns for staff during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cI am sure you will agree that it is vital that public confidence is maintained in the BBC\u2019s longstanding reputation for fair and balanced reporting, and that any damage to that would be deeply concerning,\u201d Dowden wrote in the letter, excerpts of which have been published by the Mail on Sunday. A spokesperson for the BBC confirmed on Sunday that it had received Dowden\u2019s letter, adding it would respond in due course. It referred to a statement issued last week that said sources for its PPE revelations were not the doctors who appeared on the show. There\u2019s a moving story in Northern Ireland\u2019s Sunday Life newspaper about a woman who shared a final photo of her dying mum in hospital in a bid to get people to wake up to the realities of coronavirus. Deborah Buchanan, from Antrim, posted the image just hours after mum Joan Wright (75) died from Covid-19 on Thursday. \u201cThis is the reality of coronavirus. Wake up and wise up,\u201d said Deborah, from Newtownabbey, as she urged people to stay at home. A view on the UK from a Chinese village which isolated itself during the worst days of the pandemic there, courtesy of a Financial Times reporter in China. A woman has had to bury her daughter and husband within days of each other after both died from coronavirus. Tributes were paid to former police officer and Red Cross director David Whincup, 79, and his daughter Joanne Rennison, 52, who both passed away after contracting the disease. MP David Davis described Whincup, from Cottingham in east Yorkshire, as an \u201cutterly decent man\u201d. \u201cDavid was the kindest, most thoughtful and utterly decent man I have ever had the privilege to meet. He had a fantastic commitment to selfless public service. We shall all miss him greatly,\u201d he added. Whincup, who lived with his wife, Margaret, their daughter Joanne and granddaughter Alice, said his greatest achievement was his family. He worked as a director for the Red Cross and prior to that he was a Humberside police officer for more than 30 years. His charity work raised thousands of pounds for causes in Hull and East Yorkshire and he supported many other charities as a founder member of Haltemprice Lions club in 1973, serving as president four times and as secretary. This evening\u2019s Downing St briefing at 4pm will be fronted by Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog again now while Nadeem takes a break. More details on the smartphone app to trace the spread of coronavirus which will be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week before being rolled out more widely later this month. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said around 50% to 60% of people will need to use the software for it to be effective as he described it as the \u201cbest possible way to help the NHS\u201d. The NHSX app is part of the government\u2019s test, track and trace strategy and will be central to its efforts in slowing the spread of coronavirus. Contact tracing has been used extensively in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany, where outbreaks have been contained more quickly. The government intends to use the app and a phone team to carry out the tracing. It will be downloaded on to smartphones and use bluetooth technology to work out when other app users are in close enough proximity to potentially spread the virus. The data is recorded under an anonymous ID, rather than by the person\u2019s name. If someone starts showing symptoms, or tests positive for Covid-19, they are able to share that on the app. The app then sends a notification warning of possible infection to all those phone users to have come in requisite proximity recently. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has posted this video on Twitter to thank Londoners for observing the lockdown rules. On a lighter note, actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new television series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers. Marsan and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV\u2019s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic. Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband\u2019s performance while two of their children joined in the acting. On his wife\u2019s directorial debut, Marsan told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: \u201cShe was fantastic, she really took it on. \u201cShe was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.\u201d Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom but does not think she would start a new film career. The daily Downing Street briefing will be at 4pm today and will be led by Michael Gove and Stephen Powis, National Medical Director of NHS England. The press conference for David King\u2019s alternative scientific advisory group is tomorrow at 4pm. A passenger plane has landed in the UK with 10 million pairs of surgical gloves for the NHS. The Airbus A340 9H-EAL, with \u201cThank You NHS\u201d written on its fuselage, arrived at Bournemouth Airport after picking up the supplies from Kuala Lumpur. The aircraft, owned by Bournemouth-based European Aviation Group, touched down at around 8.15am today with the boxes of gloves then passed to NHS supplier Crest Medical, based in Warrington, which commissioned the delivery. Paul Stoddart, European Aviation\u2019s chairman, told the PA news agency: \u201cToday\u2019s flight was a total success. Twenty million gloves, that\u2019s 10 million pairs of gloves, delivered to Crest Medical and on their way to the NHS. \u201cWell done everyone.\u201d The flight is the second to land at the airport with NHS supplies, after 120,000 surgical gowns were brought from Tianjin, northeastern China, on Tuesday. Several more flights are scheduled to depart from Bournemouth over the next few weeks to bring back PPE. Baroness Ros Altmann, a former minister, believes a ban on older people leaving their homes as the rest of the country surfaces from lockdown would be \u201cage discrimination\u201d. She said using age-based criteria to lift restrictions would send a message that older people\u2019s lives \u201cdon\u2019t count in the same way as others\u201d. NHS England\u2019s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis said on Friday that officials are considering whether stricter measures will still apply to the elderly when lockdown is eased. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday, Baroness Altmann said: \u201cI think using an age-based criteria is fundamentally wrong and would potentially cost the lives of many people, and risk social unrest.\u201d The life peer said many elderly people have only accepted lockdown conditions \u201cbecause everyone else has got to do it,\u201d and \u201clots of them\u201d have said they would \u201crisk going to prison\u201d rather than continue isolating. She added \u201cnobody would dream\u201d of applying restrictions on the basis of skin colour, despite a higher death rate among BAME people. \u201cIt\u2019s not OK to discriminate on grounds of gender, or obesity, or colour of skin, but everybody is saying, let\u2019s think about somehow discriminating on the basis of age.\u201d Comedian Sir Michael Palin agreed in a BBC interview that age restrictions would be \u201cvery difficult and very wrong and very unfair\u201d. Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organisation\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, said that many people remain susceptible to the virus, even where transmission has been suppressed. Asked if a second wave of infection could be likely in countries that have started to ease their lockdowns, she said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly possible. What we\u2019re seeing in a number of countries that have been successful in suppressing transmission is that many more people remain susceptible.\u201d She added: \u201cAll countries must remain on alert for the possibility of additional transmission even if they have been successful in suppressing transmission in the first round.\u201d Following comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson that face masks will be \u201cuseful\u201d as part of measures to come out of lockdown, Dr Van Kerkhove said that masks are recommended for those who are feeling unwell. She told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme: \u201cWe do recommend the use of masks for people who are feeling unwell, but masks alone will not solve the problem, they cannot solve the problem, and especially if you\u2019re thinking about lockdowns and you\u2019re thinking of lifting lockdowns. \u201cThere has to be a number of measures that have to be put in place before lockdowns can be released and it must be done in a slow and staggered approach.\u201d Health secretary Matt Hancock has tweeted a link to advice to different groups who are more susceptible to Covid-19. It comes after he responded to a Sunday Times article about people aged over 70 in lockdown by saying the \u201cclinically vulnerable, who are advised to stay in lockdown for 12 weeks, emphatically DO NOT include all over 70s.\u201d There is a \u201cgreat deal of logic\u201d in targeting the nation\u2019s youngest children to return to school first when the coronavirus lockdown lifts, the head of Ofsted has said. Amanda Spielman said younger pupils need \u201croutine\u201d and, from parents\u2019 perspectives, are those who need the most \u201ccare and oversight\u201d. She also said it is in all children\u2019s best interests that they return to the classroom \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, but there is no single \u201cno-brainer answer\u201d on how to do so. \u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of logic in targeting younger children,\u201d she told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. \u201cWe know that making normality for children is really important, the younger the children, the more they need that simple structured routine where they understand what\u2019s happening. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for them to go to school one day and then not for another two weeks. So I entirely recognise and see the logic of this. \u201cI also think there\u2019s a logic from the point of view of parents. The youngest children are the ones who need the greatest care and oversight. \u201cIt\u2019s hardest for parents to work and do all the other things they need to do if they\u2019re also looking after perhaps several young children at the same time and trying to make sure they work through schoolwork remotely. \u201cIf you look at the interests of children, it\u2019s very clear that their interests are best served, in the vast majority of cases, by being back at school as soon as possible.\u201d Spielman said it is in the \u201chands of the health experts\u201d to say what is safe and how education could be organised, and she \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to second guess that for one moment\u201d. More from First Minister Mark Drakeford who has defended the decision not to extend coronavirus testing to all care homes in Wales regardless of whether there is a confirmed case or not. He told The Andrew Marr Programme: \u201cThe advice we have from our chief medical officer is that if there is no coronavirus at all, in a care home, then testing all residents and staff would not be the best use of the tests that we have available.\u201d Asked if it had been a mistake for Wales to abandon its 5,000 tests-a-day in April, he added: \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t a mistake. \u201cThe feeling I had and the feeling reported to me from people in the front line is that the number itself was a distraction. \u201cCarrying out tests, without a purpose or a point is not a good use of the limited resources that we have.\u201d Grant Shapps said he was \u201cactively looking at\u201d quarantining people travelling to the UK from abroad to keep coronavirus infection rates under control. \u201cI think it is important that as we are seeing the numbers decrease and the R rate we hope decrease... that we do ensure that the sacrifices in a sense - social distancing - that we are asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. \u201cI am actively looking at these issues right now so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we are not importing,\u201d he told The Andrew Marr programme. The number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK stood at 182,260 yesterday. Fewer people would have died from coronavirus in the UK if the country had greater testing capacity sooner, transport secretary Grant Shapps said. Asked whether fewer people would have died if testing capacity had been greater sooner, he told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cYes. If we had had 100,000 test capacity before this thing started and the knowledge that we now have retrospectively I\u2019m sure many things could be different. \u201cThe fact of the matter is this is not a country that had - although we\u2019re very big in pharmaceuticals as a country - we\u2019re not a country that had very large test capacity.\u201d Shapps added the UK may have had a high death rate compared to some other countries because of \u201cdensity of population\u201d. He said Britain has \u201cdenser cities\u201d compared to other countries and the number of deaths are high because the figures are a \u201cproduct of excellent statisticians counting in a way that other countries don\u2019t\u201d. On the issue of infection rates in care homes, he said: \u201cInfections in care homes are now falling, not rising.\u201d He added that patients and residents of care homes can now be tested. First Minister Mark Drakeford has spoken about plans to reopen schools and workplaces in Wales, with the possibility of schools opening by June. Asked for an indication about when pupils could return, he told the BBC\u2019s Andew Marr Show: \u201cOur advice from the trade unions and from the local education authorities is that you will need three weeks as a minimum from the point that we decide to do that, to when schools can reopen, so we are talking about the beginning of June.\u201d Drakeford said some groups could return earlier than others, citing the examples of year-six children who are due to move up to secondary school and Welsh medium pupils who may not have had opportunities to use the language at home during lockdown. He added: \u201cYou certainly can\u2019t have schools reopen as they did before and sustain social distancing, and you need it for public health reasons, but you also need it in order to persuade parents and teachers that you are asking young people to come back into an environment that is safe for them.\u201d On testing in care homes, he said Wales is testing all care home staff and care home residents in care homes where there is a case of coronavirus. A former government chief scientific adviser has assembled a group of experts to look at how the UK could work its way out of coronavirus lockdown. Sir David King, who worked under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, created the board \u201cin response to concerns over the lack of transparency coming from the UK Government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The new 12-strong committee of academics is keen to investigate seven key points, including how can successful test and trace be achieved, and what social distancing measures will be needed in the future. The new committee\u2019s first press conference will be held on Monday at 4pm, the same usual time as the Downing Street briefings over the weekend. Sir David said transparency within scientific discussion was essential. He told the Sunday Times: \u201cI am not at all critical of the scientists who are putting advice before the government ... but because there is no transparency the government can say they are following scientific advice but we don\u2019t know that they are.\u201d The future of Britain\u2019s world-renowned science sector \u2013 and its ability to lead global research into Covid-19 \u2013 risks being fatally undermined if the UK crashes out of the EU without a trade deal by the end of this year, Toby Helm and Robin McKie report in the Observer. The warning has been issued by leading scientists \u2013 including UK-based Nobel prize winners \u2013 as fears grow that British science could lose access to the EU\u2019s \u20ac100bn (\u00a385bn) research funding scheme, Horizon Europe, which will run from 2021 to 2027. The government says it is \u201cconsidering\u201d applying to be an \u201cassociate member\u201d (a relationship available for non-member states at the discretion of the 27 member nations) of Horizon Europe and the European Research Council (ERC), which is a component of the funding scheme. The ERC says one of its UK-based \u201cgrantees\u201d, Prof Cecilia Mascolo, is already working in this country on rolling out a mobile app to quickly diagnose Covid-19. The government has formally complained to the BBC over a recent Panorama programme reporting on problems with the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline NHS staff. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, wrote to the corporation\u2019s director-general, Tony Hall, warning the corporation it risks losing the public\u2019s confidence as a result of accusation of bias. Key items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were not included in the government\u2019s pandemic stockpile when coronavirus reached the UK, the investigation by BBC Panorama reported It found that gowns, visors, swabs and body bags were left out of the stockpile when it was set up in 2009. Some of the items are now in short supply. However, there was controversy around some of the interviewees, who critics of the BBC and some news outlets described as \u201cleft-wing activists.\u201d In a letter, excerpts from which were published in the Mail on Sunday, Dowden says that he was sure Lord Hall \u201cwill agree that at a time of heightened risk of misinformation and disinformation, it is more important than ever that the BBC upholds the values and standards we all expect.\u201d \u2018The public should be able to turn to the BBC for transparent, unimpeachable, reliable news\u2019. Among those criticising Dowden\u2019s actions today were Alan Rusbridger, formerly of this parish: The prime minister has been tweeting details of \u201cfive key tests\u201d that must be satisfied before the government can adjust the current lockdown measures. The last one is: \u201cWe must make sure that any adjustments to the current measures do not risk a second spike that would overwhelm the NHS.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds meanwhile kept up pressure on testing, telling Sky News: \u201cof course I\u2019m pleased that testing has been ramped up. But that in itself is not a strategy.\u201d \u201cFirstly, the testing has to be increased further, I mean the original target we were talking about a quarter of a million tests a day some time ago, but it has to be linked to tracing as well and it\u2019s that testing and tracing that is going to be so important now in terms of easing the measures of the lockdown in the weeks and months ahead.\u201d Many older people would rebel and risk going to prison if they were forced to remain locked down for a considerable period of time as younger people were treated differently, according to Baroness Ros Altmann. The pensions expert and political campaigner on age-related issues, told Sky News: \u201cIf they are fit and healthy and need to get out for their own physical health then the idea that the government will tell them you are under house arrest while everybody else is out, and force them into solitary confinement\u2026 then I think they wouldn\u2019t accept it.\u201d Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, the broadcaster Michael Palin also said it would be \u201cvery unfair\u201d to treat large numbers of older people differently from others and policy makers had to be \u201cvery careful.\u201d For more on fears among older people about an extended lockdown, here is a recent Guardian piece by my colleague Mattha Busby. It\u2019s too early to say how many people in Britain have had Covid-19, according to Ian Diamond, head of the Government Statistical Service, which is receiving initial results from some major surveys over the past number of weeks. Very large numbers of people, more than 80pc, are concerned still and worried about the future not being able to make plans, he said. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show that the survey backed up suggestions that adherence to the lockdown was very good. The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food. New data from the Food Foundation shared exclusively with the Observer has revealed that almost a fifth of households with children have been unable to access enough food in the past five weeks, with meals being skipped and children not getting enough to eat as already vulnerable families battle isolation and a loss of income. The strain on larger families, single parent homes and those with disabled children has been immense. A reported 30% of lone parents and 46% of parents with a disabled child are facing food insecurity and finding it difficult to manage basic nutritional needs at home. With schools no longer providing a reprieve for children reliant on free breakfast clubs and school lunches, poorer families are at crisis point. Using characteristic language, Boris Johnson has described a strategy that evolved for a period of time around plans to announce his potential death from Covid-19 as a \u201cdeath of Stalin-type scenario.\u201d It\u2019s not entirely clear if he was taking his cue from Armando Iannucci\u2019s (excellent) 2017 satire. Nevertheless, speaking about his hospitalisation recently, he told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cI was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. \u201cThe doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. \u201cThey gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie.\u201d Johnson, 55, said it was \u201chard to believe\u201d his health had deteriorated in just a few days, saying he \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t getting better\u201d. \u201cThey had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario,\u201d he recounted. He told the newspaper that the \u201cindicators kept going in the wrong direction\u201d and that he kept asking himself: \u201cHow am I going to get out of this?\u201d \u201cThe bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. \u201cThat was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.\u201d Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, have meanwhile named their son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson, in a tribute to their grandfathers and the doctors who treated the prime minister for coronavirus. Symonds, 32, posted a picture of her holding the newborn on Instagram on Saturday, saying she \u201ccouldn\u2019t be happier\u201d and that her \u201cheart is full\u201d. A few developments in relation to misinformation include a call by a leading news organisation for a digital \u201ckitemarking\u201d system online to distinguish between quality journalism and fake content \u2013 with internet companies facing penalties if they publish inaccurate information. ITN, the maker of news for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, says the coronavirus pandemic has revealed both the importance of \u201ctrustworthy and reliable information\u201d and the dangers to democracy of fast-spreading misinformation. Meanwhile, YouTube has deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. Britain could be asking all visitors to the UK to have the NHS tracking app which is likely to be a major part of the government\u2019s strategy. The system is going into testing on the Isle of Wight later this week and will be rolled out to the population at large provided the tests were responsible, added Grant Shapps. The Transport Secretary said the government needed 60 to 70 percent of people to use the app for it to be successful. He compares it to the clapping which people do on Thursday night. It\u2019s another way to support the NHS, according to Shapps. There\u2019s more on the App here: Active transport and getting people to work \u201con their own steam\u201d will be a major part of attempts to prevent overcrowding on the public transport network, added Grant Shapps. The Transport Secretary said he would be saying more, \u201cshortly,\u201d in relation to measures such as the scheme which helped people to buy their own bike at a cheaper price. Preventing overcrowding on the transport network will involve a massive logistical operation and will require the same sort of determination as the public have shown in recent weeks. Grant Shapps was non-committal on the question of whether there could be temperature checks on public transport. People should not be leaving home if they feel unwell, adding: \u201cIn a sense you should not be there in the first place.\u201d This, of course, leaves doubts about the role of people who are asymptomatic. Pressed, he added: \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible.\u201d It\u2019s not going to be \u2018business as usual\u2019 for the UK when the prime minister details plans for changing or lifting lockdown measures later this week, according to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, but people do want to see a \u201croad map\u201d. Shapps told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that testing, tracking and tracing would be \u201cvital\u201d in terms of next steps. He added that it was no secret that the government wants children to go back to school but he was reluctant to give a date. The Sunday Telegraph has a front page story today on a government \u2018blue print\u2019 for schools to return in June. A failure to provide care homes with enough NHS expertise and hospital equipment has exacerbated the growing coronavirus crisis among their residents, senior care figures have warned. Thousands of deaths within homes have come alongside spare intensive care capacity in hospitals, raising concerns in the social care sector that resources have been misallocated. It has also prompted scepticism within the sector over claims from Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, that the threat to care homes had been \u201cflagged\u201d since the start of the pandemic. Care home owners are now warning that the sector is still some way off a peak in cases, unlike the country as a whole. Official data next week is expected to show well over 5,000 care home deaths in total.\\ However, unions are also warning that money has been stripped out of the care home sector for years in profits, leaving it underfunded and ill-prepared. Among other things, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the Sunday morning news shows. Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds are on Sophy Ridge on Sky from 830am. Following that World Health Organisation (WHO) Covid-19 technical lead Dr Maria Van Kerkhove and Wales\u2019 First Minister Mark Drakeford are on the Andrew Marr show on BBC One from 9am. Later today, a Scottish Government briefing expected is expected at 2.30pm, while a Downing Street briefing is scheduled for 4pm. Good morning. It\u2019s Ben Quinn here at the helm of the live blog to steer you through the start of the day\u2019s coronavirus developments in the UK. They include a revelation by the prime minister that doctors prepared to announce his death as he battled coronavirus in hospital last month. Boris Johnson spent three nights in intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 in London with the disease, where he said medics gave him \u201clitres and litres of oxygen\u201d. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, he described it as a \u201ctough old moment\u201d, adding: \u201cThey had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario. \u201cI was not in particularly brilliant shape and I was aware there were contingency plans in place. Some suggest the experience has had a dramatic impact on what his views, otherwise, may have been when it comes to lifting Britain\u2019s lockdown. That\u2019s not going to be an easy task, if new indications of public mood today are anything to go by. Fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed.",

      "bodyText": "A woman who shared a final photo of her dying mother in hospital has said she did so in order to warn the public about the dangerous realities of Covid-19. Deborah Buchanan, from Newtownabbey in County Antrim, said she was asked by her mother, Joan Wright, 75, to take the photo last week in what were some of the last words she uttered. A Facebook post by Buchanan featured the photo, taken at Furness general hospital, Cumbria, showing her mother in bed and with family members around her, dressed in personal protective equipment (PPE). They included Buchanan\u2019s father, who she said was still in hospital. Wright died with her husband holding her hand and with other family members by her side. \u201cWe had to watch her gasp her last breaths and slip away in agony,\u201d Buchanan wrote in the post, which has been shared more than 4,000 times. \u201cMy dad says this is the worst thing he has ever felt in his life, he fears going to sleep in case he doesn\u2019t wake up. They hadn\u2019t left the house in weeks but still picked this up and both took very unwell. My dad is still in hospital and not out of the woods yet, his heart is broken and he has to continue to fight to try and beat this.\u201d She added: \u201cThis is the reality of coronavirus. Wake up and wise up. This is not going away anytime soon and more and more people are going to die. Don\u2019t let it be your parent or grandparent or any member of your family who ends up like this. Stay away from those you love, and protect yourselves and them.\u201d The couple had both tested positive for Covid-19 on 27 April after being admitted to hospital days earlier.

It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Several countries, such as Austria and Denmark, have moved to partially reopen schools as coronavirus fears have receded.

      "bodyText": "Almost four in five Australians say they trust the government to give clear and accurate advice on the Covid-19 pandemic, a larger share than those who report the same feelings about the media, according to a new survey. The poll by the Australia Institute also shows two in three Australians believe the government should take the lead in sustaining the economy as the country recovers from the Covid-19 crisis, while just one in 10 say that role should be taken by big business. The progressive thinktank surveyed 6,000 people across six countries \u2013 Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the US, Italy and South Korea \u2013 to gain an insight into their views on trust and economic anxiety in a time of coronavirus. Based on responses from 1,000 people in each country, the exercise reveals a close relationship between trust in a government\u2019s advice and views about that nation\u2019s performance in responding to Covid-19. On the whole, it shows people place the most trust in governments and friends and family to give clear and accurate advice, followed by the media, while they place the least trust in material shared on social media. In Australia, 78% of respondents report that they have either some or high trust in government as a source of information, while 77% say the same about friends and family and 58% say so about the media. Just 30% express some level of trust in social media information. Ben Oquist, the executive director of the Australia Institute, said Covid-19 was affecting nations around the world in very different ways, but the one unifying response appeared to be a high level of trust in the institution of government. \u201cThe health and economic response to the current has been a serious challenge for democratically elected governments the world over and each nation will emerge from this crisis changed in some way,\u201d he said. \u201cReassuringly, so far at least, faith in government has yet to fall victim to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d In all but one of the six countries, a majority rated their national government\u2019s overall response to Covid-19 as good or very good, with the highest such rating found in New Zealand (83%), where Jacinda Ardern has pursued an elimination strategy. The lowest rating was found in the US (49%), where Donald Trump has faced criticism for a sluggish initial response and poor national coordination. In Australia, seven in 10 respondents (71%) rated the Morrison government\u2019s overall response as good or better. But in a sign of ongoing concerns about a protracted economic crisis, just one in three of the Australian respondents (34%) were confident they would keep their current jobs and hours \u2013 the lowest rate of confidence among the countries included. On the notion of keeping current jobs and hours, confidence was found to be highest in the United Kingdom (43%) and New Zealand (41%). Australian and American respondents were also the most likely to have reported already losing their jobs or that they had stopped being rostered on for shifts (both 16%). People were also asked to say which out of five groups they think should take the lead in sustaining the economy in the months ahead \u2013 government, big business, individuals, small business or charities. Across the six countries, government was twice as likely to be selected as the other four groups put together. The survey report said people in Australia and the UK were most likely to say that the government should take the lead in sustaining the economy (both 64%), followed by New Zealand (62%). Only in the US \u2013 where sentiments about \u201cbig government\u201d are more strongly held \u2013 did fewer than half say that the government should take the lead in the months ahead (43%).

Clubs should not resume with out-of-date assessments and a safety officer cannot do a risk assessment from memory alone, especially not when faced with something we have never dealt with before.\u201d</p> <p>Premier League clubs will meet again this week to attempt to find a way to complete the season, although matches will be allowed to go ahead only with approval from police, the club doctor and the public body that issues licences for stadium safety (the Sports Ground Safety Association).</p> <p>The FSOA says that is not enough because safety officers devise tailor-made risk assessments and contingency plans for in and around stadiums and training grounds.</p> <p>Such assessments need to be updated to take account of risks associated with coronavirus, with arrangements needing to be made for disinfection, physical distancing and contingency measures in the event of groups gathering outside grounds.</p> <p>John Newsham, an FSOA consultant and its former chairman, wrote to nearly 350 safety officers, including those at all league clubs, asking for details about their working arrangements. Only 33 replied, including six from Premier League clubs.</p> <p>\u201cI got a lot of automatic out of office replies,\u201d said Newsham, who has drafted a risk analysis to guide members. \u201cA lot of safety officers cannot even access their club emails at the moment. From ones I have spoken to, many say there has not been enough consultation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible to resume the season but there needs to be a lot more input before leagues decide: \u2018OK, let\u2019s go on 6 June or whatever.\u2019 Even matches behind closed doors at neutral venues need careful consideration.</p> <p>\u201cThere are big decisions that have to be made and the right safety officers have to be in the right places so they can make sure they\u2019ve got the risk assessment right. That\u2019s not happening as far as we know.\u201d</p> <p>Houghton is particularly concerned about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/premier-league-clubs-fear-becoming-scapegoats-if-game-returns-too-soon\">lower-league teams returning to training and playing</a>. \u201cMany safety officers outside the Premier League and most of the Championship are not full-time. If there is a lawsuit as a result of tragedy befalling a match-day operative or even a footballer, how fair is it for the safety officer to be taken to court and prosecuted as a result of a risk he didn\u2019t think the club should take, but which a competition provider or national governing body has decided is acceptable?\u201d</p>",

The Football Safety Officers Association, whose members are employed by clubs and would normally be responsible for drafting risk assessments for stadiums, is concerned that clubs seem to be preparing to return to training while many safety officers have been furloughed or are working from home. The FSOA fears inadequate planning could result in tragedy, especially at lower-league level, and safety officers may be held liable despite having been unable to make plans as carefully as they would usually have done. \u201cThe role of the safety officer appears to be lost in the Project Restart negotiations,\u201d said Peter Houghton, the FSOA director of operations. \u201cOur concerns in relation to our members and colleagues are that many clubs are pressing on in the restart direction while safety officers have been furloughed or are working from home. \u201cIt has not left them in the best place to be assessing the risks involved around their stadium while it is closed down. Clubs should not resume with out-of-date assessments and a safety officer cannot do a risk assessment from memory alone, especially not when faced with something we have never dealt with before.\u201d Premier League clubs will meet again this week to attempt to find a way to complete the season, although matches will be allowed to go ahead only with approval from police, the club doctor and the public body that issues licences for stadium safety (the Sports Ground Safety Association). The FSOA says that is not enough because safety officers devise tailor-made risk assessments and contingency plans for in and around stadiums and training grounds. Such assessments need to be updated to take account of risks associated with coronavirus, with arrangements needing to be made for disinfection, physical distancing and contingency measures in the event of groups gathering outside grounds. John Newsham, an FSOA consultant and its former chairman, wrote to nearly 350 safety officers, including those at all league clubs, asking for details about their working arrangements. Only 33 replied, including six from Premier League clubs. \u201cI got a lot of automatic out of office replies,\u201d said Newsham, who has drafted a risk analysis to guide members. \u201cA lot of safety officers cannot even access their club emails at the moment. From ones I have spoken to, many say there has not been enough consultation. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible to resume the season but there needs to be a lot more input before leagues decide: \u2018OK, let\u2019s go on 6 June or whatever.\u2019 Even matches behind closed doors at neutral venues need careful consideration. \u201cThere are big decisions that have to be made and the right safety officers have to be in the right places so they can make sure they\u2019ve got the risk assessment right. That\u2019s not happening as far as we know.\u201d Houghton is particularly concerned about lower-league teams returning to training and playing. \u201cMany safety officers outside the Premier League and most of the Championship are not full-time. If there is a lawsuit as a result of tragedy befalling a match-day operative or even a footballer, how fair is it for the safety officer to be taken to court and prosecuted as a result of a risk he didn\u2019t think the club should take, but which a competition provider or national governing body has decided is acceptable?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct and House of Fraser chains have asked store managers to work at least once a week while under the government\u2019s furlough scheme. Ashley\u2019s managers had also been asked to return to work \u2013 on reduced pay \u2013 on Monday, but the company did a U-turn on Sunday after the Guardian published details of the plan. Staff told the Guardian they had been asked to volunteer to go into stores about one day a week since the entire store team were put on furlough last month. Two managers said they had been told not to clock on when they worked in stores while on furlough \u2013 seemingly in breach of the rules of the scheme, under which the government covers 80% of staff pay. They said they had been asked to pack up store stock so it could be returned to the group\u2019s warehouse and sold online. \u201cThey are doing it secretly so people don\u2019t know what they are doing,\u201d one worker said. Andrew Crudge, an employment law expert at legal firm Trethowans, said: \u201cThe guidance is quite clear. If people are being asked to work and that will create any revenue for the company that would be a breach of the provisions.\u201d He said workers could be furloughed and then brought back into work for a period before being put on furlough again but that could only be for blocks of at least three weeks. Last week, staff were asked to return to work full time on Monday. In a conference call and messages to workers, seen by the Guardian, Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group asked Sports Direct and House of Fraser managers to return from furlough full time on Monday on 90% pay. They were told they were required in stores 10 hours a day on at least five days a week to return stock to the retail group\u2019s warehouse in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, so that it could be sold online and to prepare stores for physical distancing measures for when they are allowed to reopen. Managers were told that Frasers had seen non-food stores being allowed to open again in mainland Europe and believed the UK government could release shops from lockdown within three weeks. But some managers told the Guardian they did not want to return to work on less pay while they feared being at risk of contracting coronavirus and did not believe they would be provided with sufficient protective kit or social distancing measures. \u201cUntil the government says we need to go back and the protection is there I am not going,\u201d one said. However, he added that he felt under pressure to go back to protect his job. \u201cEveryone is scared,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are paying us low wages for a long time and we have been working overtime for years \u2026 Why do I have to be frightened and likely spreading disease if they are not giving us anything.\u201d On Sunday afternoon after the Guardian published details of the plan, managers said they had been told they no longer had to return to work. The latest controversy comes after Ashley was forced to issue a public apology after he pressed the government to allow Sports Direct to remain open as other non-essential retailers closed, on the basis that selling fitness equipment made the company a vital asset to Britons stuck at home. The company has meanwhile admitted that it struggled to enforce physical distancing measures to protect staff at its Shirebrook warehouse. Frasers Group did not respond to requests to comment.",

      "body": "<p>It is a mystery that has left doctors questioning the basic tenets of biology: Covid-19 patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death.</p> \n<p>The phenomenon, known by some as \u201chappy hypoxia\u201d (some prefer the term \u201csilent\u201d) is raising questions about exactly how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/what-happens-to-your-lungs-with-coronavirus-covid-19\">the virus attacks the lungs</a> and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients.</p> \n<p>A healthy person would be expected to have an oxygen saturation of at least 95%. But doctors are reporting patients attending A&amp;E with oxygen percentage levels in the 80s or 70s, with some drastic cases below 50%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are,\u201d said Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at Manchester Royal Infirmary. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they\u2019re unaware of that. We wouldn\u2019t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It\u2019s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. \u201cWith pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn\u2019t be sat up in bed talking to you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t understand it. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s causing organ damage that we\u2019re not able to detect. We don\u2019t understand if the body\u2019s compensating.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. \u201cI was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should\u2019ve come into hospital. I\u2019m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky.

      "bodyText": "It is a mystery that has left doctors questioning the basic tenets of biology: Covid-19 patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death. The phenomenon, known by some as \u201chappy hypoxia\u201d (some prefer the term \u201csilent\u201d) is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients. A healthy person would be expected to have an oxygen saturation of at least 95%. But doctors are reporting patients attending A&amp;E with oxygen percentage levels in the 80s or 70s, with some drastic cases below 50%. \u201cIt\u2019s intriguing to see so many people coming in, quite how hypoxic they are,\u201d said Dr Jonathan Bannard-Smith, a consultant in critical care and anaesthesia at Manchester Royal Infirmary. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing oxygen saturations that are very low and they\u2019re unaware of that. We wouldn\u2019t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It\u2019s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.\u201d Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. \u201cWith pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn\u2019t be sat up in bed talking to you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t understand it. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s causing organ damage that we\u2019re not able to detect. We don\u2019t understand if the body\u2019s compensating.\u201d Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. \u201cI was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should\u2019ve come into hospital. I\u2019m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn\u2019t working very well.\u201d He recovered after a few days in bed, but he and others are conscious that not all cases have positive outcomes. An anaesthetist at a London hospital, who spoke anonymously, recalled one patient who attended A&amp;E saying she felt cold. \u201cWhen we put the stats probe on her, her saturation was 30% on air,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously thought that was wrong, as usually patients are likely to have hypoxic cardiac arrests.\u201d But when a blood sample was taken, her blood was very dark and had oxygen levels equivalent to those seen in people acclimatised to high altitudes. The patient was placed on a ventilator and survived for about a week before dying. \u201cI have had a few patients like this,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cSadly, their outcomes tend to be bad in my experience.\u201d Conventional medical wisdom is that as oxygen supplies fall, the heart, brain and other vital organs are placed at risk \u2013 and the effect is thought to be cumulative. Typically patients would lose consciousness below an oxygen saturation of 75%. However, it is not the fall in oxygen levels itself that leaves people feeling breathless. Instead, the body senses the rising levels of carbon dioxide that typically occur simultaneously as the lungs are unable to clear gas as efficiently. But in some Covid-19 patients, this response does not appear to be kicking in. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us expect that what we\u2019re seeing can be explained by one process,\u201d said Bannard-Smith. Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make it difficult for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. There is also emerging evidence that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting. The vessels in the lungs that collect oxygen and transfer it into the wider bloodstream are so tiny they can become blocked with the smallest of clots. Several clinical trials are looking at whether blood thinners could prevent or treat complications of Covid-19, including respiratory problems and low blood oxygen. Some have suggested that, since people are often oblivious to falling oxygen levels, those with Covid-19 symptoms or a positive test result should be given pulse oximeters, a simple device that clips on to the finger and can be used to detect oxygen levels at home. However, as yet there is no evidence that early detection of hypoxia would help avoid severe outcomes and Charlesworth said the practicalities would be difficult. \u201cTransportation of the devices would put more people on the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there are issues around people buying them on the internet and whether they [have proper safety certificates] \u2026 If you\u2019re at the point of needing your oxygen levels monitored that\u2019s the time to go to hospital.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed on Sunday there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. Pompeo\u2019s claims, made in an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, represented an escalation in rhetoric. He had previously said the US was looking into the possibility the virus came from a lab in Wuhan, China. On Sunday, Pompeo said: \u201cThere is enormous evidence that that\u2019s where this began,\u201d later adding: \u201cI can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d At one point, the secretary of state appeared confused over whether he was claiming the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes the Covid-19 disease) was deliberately engineered or escaped as the result of a lab accident. \u201cLook, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,\u201d he said. But when he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite \u2013 that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified \u2013 Pompeo replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I agree with that.\u201d Donald Trump made a similar unsupported claim on Thursday, saying he was privy to evidence of the pandemic began in a Chinese lab but was not permitted to share it. On the same day, Pompeo told a radio interviewer: \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We don\u2019t know if it emanated from the wet market or yet some other place. We don\u2019t know those answers.\u201d By Sunday afternoon, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the US had confirmed 1,134,507 coronavirus cases and more than 66,000 deaths. Worldwide, there had been nearly 3.5m cases confirmed and more than 245,000 people had died. Beset by criticism of its response to the outbreak and management of the ensuing public health crisis, the Trump administration has sought to focus blame on China. Most epidemiologists say that while it is possible the outbreak started in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where coronaviruses have been intensively studied, it is a far less likely scenario than the theory that it was transmitted naturally from bats through an intermediary animal, mutating along the way to become dangerous to humans. On Tuesday, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, said \u201cthe weight of evidence\u201d pointed to natural transmission but was not conclusive. Beijing has rejected the suggestion the virus could have escaped from a laboratory. But Chinese authorities have not allowed foreign experts, including investigators from the World Health Organization, to take part in the investigation into the origins of the virus. Nor have they shared samples taken from wild animals at the Wuhan livestock market where they claim the outbreak began. In 2018, US diplomats and scientists raised concerns in state department cables about safety standards and the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Analysis of the first 41 Covid-19 patients in medical journal the Lancet found that 27 had direct exposure to the Wuhan market. The same analysis found that the first known case of the illness did not. Pompeo has a patchy record on characterising US intelligence estimates. He repeatedly claimed there was no direct evidence linking the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to the murder of journalist and dissident Jamal Khashoggi, contradicting substantial US evidence implicating him. He also repeatedly claimed there was evidence of an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to US embassies posed by the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, who the US killed in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. A formal letter justifying the strike sent by the White House to Congress in February made no mention of an imminent threat.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 4 April. Top stories A new report shows that the ABC has lost $783m in funding since the Coalition came to power in 2014. Despite a hiatus in implementing budget cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, has warned staff he will unveil measures to meet the shortfall at the end of July. A survey has found that most Australians want government, not business, to lead the post-pandemic recovery. Ninety-five Australians have now died after contracting Covid-19. The poll by the Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, shows two in three Australians believe the government should take the lead in sustaining the economy, and almost four in five said they trust the government to give clear and accurate advice on the pandemic. On Sunday the federal education minister, Dan Tehan, said he \u201coverstepped the mark\u201d when criticising the Victorian government over schools earlier in the day. A Melbourne primary school will be closed for three days after a teacher was infected with coronavirus. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has claimed there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory. He didn\u2019t provide any of the alleged evidence and the claim is an escalation in rhetoric about the origins of the pandemic. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has spoken of his dramatic stay in intensive care, saying it was a 50-50 decision on whether he should be ventilated, and revealing that plans were drawn up about how to announce his death. UK ministers face ongoing criticism about coronavirus testing, with daily tests dropping below a goal of 100,000, and more people are now in hospital with coronavirus in the north-west of England than in London. Spain and Italy, two of the European countries hardest hit by coronavirus, are beginning to emerge from strict lockdowns, but Russia and Afghanistan have reported their biggest one-day rises in new infections. The Australian government will offer $300m to boost hydrogen investment under clean energy financing. The government will change the investment mandate of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, directing it to make up to $300m available for a new Advancing Hydrogen Fund. The move comes ahead of other changes the government is planning to the CEFC\u2019s investment program. Australia\u2019s energy ministers signed off on a national hydrogen strategy in November when the Coag energy council met for the first time in more than 12 months. Australia The coal industry in NSW and Queensland is using as much water as all of Sydney\u2019s households, new research shows. The report was commissioned by the Australian Conservation Foundation and used public data to examine the impact of coalmining on water resources. A byelection in the NSW seat of Eden-Monaro will take place in a political scene utterly transformed since the federal election a year ago. The battle for the traditionally marginal seat is a first test for the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as the Coalition hopes to pull off the rare feat of gaining a seat while in government. Google Australia says the search engine is the internet-age equivalent of a newspaper poster in a newsagent\u2019s window. The local arm of Google is responding to the government\u2019s claim that Australian news content is lucrative for tech titans. The world Doctors have reported a mysterious phenomenon in coronavirus patients they are calling \u201chappy hypoxia\u201d: patients who are talking and apparently not in distress, but who have oxygen levels low enough to typically cause unconsciousness or even death. It is raising questions about exactly how the virus attacks the lungs and whether there could be more effective ways of treating such patients A global coalition of artists, scientists and celebrities are urging Brazil\u2019s leaders to take immediate action to save the country\u2019s indigenous peoples from a Covid-19 \u201cgenocide\u201d. In an open letter to Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, the group warns the pandemic poses an extreme threat to the survival of indigenous communities in the Amazon. Benjamin Netanyahu could be barred from forming a government after Israel\u2019s high court began assessing petitions that seek to obstruct the prime minister because he is under criminal indictment. Syria\u2019s richest man and the first cousin of President Bashar al-Assad has exacerbated a spectacular falling out with the Syrian leader \u2013 accusing him of sending security forces to arrest his employees and take over his business. Rami Makhlouf is accused by the US and EU of bankrolling the Syrian regime. Recommended reads It\u2019s time to radically rethink public toilets.

We owe it to every woman who has a story <strong>to listen to that story, and then to vet that story,</strong> ask the questions and be critical thinkers, and then make a judgment, based on all of those pieces. I have done that in this instance. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I will tell you this. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s consistent with the Joe Biden that I know.

The US secretary of state claimed there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. Gretchen Whitmer backs Joe Biden on alleged assault. Michigan\u2019s governor has spoken out in support of Joe Biden, telling CNN that when it comes to accusations of sexual assault, \u201cnot every claim is equal\u201d Trump adviser: coronavirus relief aid threat to \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 could happen. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has not ruled out any element in the next potential coronavirus relief bill, including more money for state and local governments and the small business programme. The Associated Press has news of an incident that will concern those who believe social distancing patrols can lead to police exercising too much force on the public. From the AP\u2019s report: A New York City police officer who was caught on video on Saturday pointing a stun gun at a man and violently taking him to the ground over an alleged social distancing violation has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation. Bystander video showed the plainclothes officer, who was not wearing a protective face mask, slapping 33-year-old Donni Wright in the face, punching him in the shoulder and dragging him to a sidewalk after leveling him in a crosswalk in Manhattan\u2019s East Village. \u201cThere will unquestionably be a careful look at what happened there,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday. Police spokeswoman Sgt Mary Frances O\u2019Donnell said Wright \u201ctook a fighting stance against the officer\u201d when he was ordered to disperse and was arrested on charges including assault on a police officer and resisting arrest. Joe Biden further reasserted his status as the presumptive challenger to Donald Trump for the presidency after winning a Democratic presidential primary in Kansas that the state party conducted exclusively through mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. The former vice-president earned 77% of the vote and 29 of the state\u2019s delegates in a primary that employed a new ranked choice system and saw three times the standard turnout, according to the Topeka Capital Journal. The change from a caucus format and an aggressive push for mail-in ballots while the state was on lockdown for Covid-19 led to a dramatic increase in turnout for the party, which typically sees 8-10% participation in presidential primaries. Four years ago, the total turnout was 39,230. This year, the vote total more than tripled as 34.7% of registered Kansas Democrats participated. \u201cThe KDP offers its congratulations to former Vice President Joseph Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders for receiving delegates from the Sunflower State,\u201d said party chairwoman Vicki Hiatt. \u201cKansas Democrats made history in this election with record participation levels along with demonstrating how a vote-by-mail election can protect voters and our democracy, even in the most uncertain of times. We are confident the enthusiasm and engagement seen during the 2020 Primary will only continue to grow and translate into Democratic victories up and down the ballot in November.\u201d Biden won 69% of votes in the first round of a ranked choice system. The candidate receiving the least votes is eliminated every round, with those votes going to the next choice on the ballot. Sanders won 18% with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren getting 8% and 1% going to Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. About 3% declined to commit to a top choice. Gabbard, uncommitted and Warren votes were redistributed over the course of three additional rounds. \u201cThe Kansas Democratic Party will carry this record-breaking momentum into our robust coordinated campaign to elect Democrats who will fight for working families, healthcare reform, and a future we all can be proud of in November,\u201d said Ben Meers, the party\u2019s executive director. While presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is already confronting allegations of sexual assault on one front, the vice-president must also now combat a growing campaign of misinformation. Rumors quickly circulated online over the weekend claiming that, in 2008, Biden made inappropriate comments toward Eva Murray. The niece of one-time Republican senate hopeful Christine O\u2019Donnell then claimed to be just 14 at the time of the incident. Event organizers immediately worked to prove the claims false, providing evidence Biden wasn\u2019t in attendance. ABC News reporter Sasha Pezenik faced mounting backlash for first tweeting the unverified claim on Saturday night. While she has apologized, claiming the tweet was misguided, critics have called on the reporter to be sacked. Snopes, the non-profit fact-finding group, is calling foul on a photo that appeared to show the then-senator awkwardly meeting with congressional staffer Tara Reade. Reade has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in a senate corridor in 1993. Over the weekend, social media postings popped up claiming to show a lost image of Biden with a woman users suggested was Reade. The vice-president has asserted he \u201cnever met\u201d her. The photo is obviously fake. According to Snopes: Such posts were wrong on two fronts. First, Biden has not maintained that he \u201cnever met\u201d Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in his Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993 (and it\u2019s unclear whether he has even averred that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t remember\u201d Reade). Second, and more important, although this photograph dates from the correct time period (i.e., January 1993) to potentially be a picture of Biden with Tara Reade, it is actually a photograph of Biden posing with Zo\u00eb Baird, who had then just been nominated for the position of U.S. Attorney General by President Bill Clinton. Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing efforts to erase any perception of negligence from the timeline of his administration\u2019s coronavirus response continued on Sunday afternoon as he fired off a pair of tweets shortly after returning to the White House following a working weekend at Camp David and ahead of his Fox News virtual town hall tonight at the Lincoln Memorial. \u201cIntelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cFake News got it wrong again, as always, and tens of thousands of lives were saved by my EARLY BAN of China into our Country. The people that we\u2019re allowed were heavily scrutinized and tested U.S. citizens, and as such, I welcome them with open arms!\u201d These assertions are inconsistent with a Washington Post report from March which stated Trump ignored early warnings as early as January from US intelligence agencies about the threat posed by the outbreak. Florida\u2019s department of health has reported the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has climbed past 36,000. But the hotbed of south Florida has seen a drop in known positive test results and now accounts for less than half of the state\u2019s increase in new novel coronavirus cases and deaths, the Miami Herald reports: Of Florida\u2019s 615 new confirmed Covid-19 cases from Saturday\u2019s update, putting the state at 36,078, 248 (40.3%) came from Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe counties. The 15 newly reported deaths around the state, raising the state death toll to 1,379, include six (40%) from South Florida. As for number of people tested, the state reported 12,208 new tests have been administered and 1,881 people are now awaiting test results. But that results-pending number includes only state labs. As reported earlier in the month by the Miami Herald, it doesn\u2019t include the private labs doing an overwhelming majority of the testing. The state\u2019s official numbers also conflict with work from by a University of Miami group that extrapolated from a study of 1,400 people that about 165,000 Miami-Dade residents or 6% of the population, have antibodies indicating a past novel coronavirus infection. About 3.4% of Miami-Dade\u2019s population has been tested for Covid-19. The breakdown by county: \u25aa Miami-Dade had 143 new cases and two deaths, leaving it at 12,775 and 369 respectively, both state highs. The number of people hospitalized at some point by Covid-19 is 1,664, an increase of 13 from Saturday. The positive test rate is 13.7, down from 13.8 at Saturday\u2019s update. \u25aa Broward added 55 cases, which now total 5,312; and three deaths, which now total 207; and 12 hospitalizations, which now total 1056. Like Miami-Dade, the county\u2019s positive test rate edged down 0.1 of a percent, to 10.2% from 10.3%. \u25aa In Palm Beach, 50 new cases raised that total to 3,130 and one death pushed that total to 196. Another three hospitalizations were reported for a total of 474. The positive test rate moved a breath, from 10.32% to 10.27%. \u25aa Monroe County saw no changes in cases (80), hospitalizations (11) or deaths (3) and it\u2019s positive test rate dropped from 5.9% to 5.7%. The latest figures were reported amid the incremental re-opening of Florida\u2019s beaches, to which Death himself took objection on Friday. Gun sales may be up in the US during the pandemic, as has been widely noted, but here\u2019s an interesting report from the Associated Press on problems facing the normally hugely powerful National Rifle Association. \u201cThe NRA has laid off dozens of employees, canceled its national convention and scuttled fundraising, membership and shooting events that normally would be key to rallying its base in an election year,\u201d the AP reports. The lobbying group has also \u201cimposed a four-day work week for some employees and cut salaries across the board, including for CEO Wayne LaPierre. The financial issues \u2026 have complicated its ability to influence the 2020 election.\u201d According to the AP, \u201cLaPierre earned about $2m, according to the group\u2019s most-recent tax filings. The NRA would not say how much of a pay cut he\u2019s taking\u201d. Robert J Spitzer, chairman of political science at the State University of New York at Cortland, told the AP: \u201cEverybody\u2019s in the same boat as the NRA. The NRA\u2019s real problem is they had real existing financial problems before this happened. It simply does not bode well for their impact on the upcoming election.\u201d Gun-control groups \u201ccontend the NRA\u2019s financial troubles will leave it incapable of playing a significant role in Trump\u2019s campaign\u201d. \u201cI would be shocked if the NRA were able to sustain the investment in support of Trump in 2020 that it made in 2016,\u201d Peter Ambler, executive director of the Giffords group, named after former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who was seriously wounded after being shot in 2011, told the AP. Meanwhile, in related reading, here\u2019s a report about how Canada has reacted to its latest mass shooting: Katherine Viner, editor-in-chief of the Guardian, spoke about imperative nature of open journalism in the age of coronavirus on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources today on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day. \u201cWhenever there is a shock to the system, governments will try to use that, unless we keep an eye on them, to crack down,\u201d Viner said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s essential that we try and stop that from happening, or at least draw attention to the fact that freedom of expression and freedom of the press is crucial to any democratic society. And I think transparency matters a lot right now when good information and how you come to it, how you come to the facts, can really help save lives.\u201d Viner went on to discuss Lost on the frontline, the ongoing project from the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to document the life of every healthcare worker in America who dies from Covid-19 during the pandemic. \u201cWe should be holding authorities to account, wherever they are,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s usually governments but it might also be health authorities. We have to ask difficult questions even if people don\u2019t like it. We have to show empathy and humanity for the victims of this really frightening disease and tell their stories. Often these are from very marginalized communities. And we try to give visibility and humanity to them.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn reports on how some New Yorkers are calling foul on the city\u2019s enforcement of stay-at-home restrictions. Community advocates across New York\u2019s Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn boroughs have called out city and state officials or what they claim are racial and ethnic double standards in its application of social distancing orders. Images of wealthier, white residents in Manhattan disregarding stay-at-home orders in neighborhood parks have gone viral throughout much of the weekend. But many residents have said that so far, it is neighborhoods in the city\u2019s less affluent communities that have been targeted for ticketing and arrests. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio was forced to apologize this week for personally overseeing the dispersal of a Hasidic Jewish funeral in Brooklyn on Wednesday after lashing out at the conduct of mourners. But crowds in Manhattan gathered that same day to watch a city flyover by the US navy\u2019s Blue Angels and the air force\u2019s Thunderbirds planes in honor of healthcare workers. \u201cOnly bigots have a problem when a few 100 Hasidim do what thousands of people in the same city have done the same day: not social distance,\u201d the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council tweeted. The mayor\u2019s actions renewed focus from community leaders on the city\u2019s unequal application of stay-at-home orders, especially as other groups have also been violating restrictions without consequence. While social distancing is meant to curb the spread, health experts say racial disparities have influenced the outbreak from the beginning. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testing requirements, including recent foreign travel, meant that guidelines skewed heavily affluent and white in early weeks. That meant low-income, mostly black and brown areas of Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens were not tested as quickly, leading to the city\u2019s stark racial disparities among cases. More than 18,500 people have died in the city, with nearly two-thirds being black or Latino. New York state\u2019s mandatory stay-at-home order expires 15 May but is expected to be extended. More on the Joe Biden-Tara Reade story. The presumptive Democratic nominee is accused by his former staffer of sexually assaulting her in 1993. Biden denies the claim, while Reade has disputed an Associated Press report which says she did not describe a sexual assault or harassment on the complaint she says she filed 27 years ago. She has also reportedly received threats. On CNN earlier, Michigan governor and potential Biden running mate Gretchen Whitmer had an instructive exchange, considering the dynamics of the issue as Democrats defend Biden and Republicans, including party chair Ronna McDaniel, attack. Jake Tapper: \u201cYou have said that you believe Vice-President Biden. I want to compare that to 2018, when you said you believed Dr Christine Blasey Ford after she accused now (supreme court) justice Brett Kavanaugh of assault. Kavanaugh also, like Biden, categorically denied that accusation. And Blasey Ford, to be honest, she did not have the contemporaneous accounts of her view of what happened that Tara Reade does. \u201cYou have spoken movingly about how you\u2019re a survivor of assault yourself. Why do you believe Biden, and not Kavanaugh? Are they not both entitled to the same presumption of innocence, regardless of their political views? Whitmer: \u201cYou know, Jake, as a survivor and as a feminist, I will say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. But then we have a duty to vet it. And just because you\u2019re a survivor doesn\u2019t mean that every claim is equal. It means we give them the ability to make their case, and the other side as well, and then to make a judgment that is informed. \u201cI have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I have watched his defense. And there\u2019s not a pattern that goes into this. And I think that, for these reasons, I\u2019m very comfortable that Joe Biden is who he says he is. And you know what? And that\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say about it. \u201cI really resent the fact that, every time a case comes up, all of us survivors have to weigh in. It is reopening wounds \u2026 take us at our word, ask us for our opinion, and let\u2019s move on. Tapper: \u201cWell, just for the record, the reason I\u2019m asking you is because you\u2019re the only Democrat on the show today, not because you\u2019re a survivor, and not because you\u2019re a woman.\u201d Whitmer said she was not criticising Tapper, but \u201cjust sharing, I think, some of the simmering anger that we survivors have every time that we have got to confront this from someone else\u2019s behavior that we weren\u2019t a party to, that we weren\u2019t even a part of the reality in the moment. \u201cWhat I think is this. We owe it to every woman who has a story to listen to that story, and then to vet that story, ask the questions and be critical thinkers, and then make a judgment, based on all of those pieces. I have done that in this instance. \u201cAnd I will tell you this. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s consistent with the Joe Biden that I know. And I do believe Joe, and I support Joe Biden.\u201d Cuomo says \u201cpeople expect more from government than ever before\u201d and discusses the \u201ctransformative\u201d effective of this pandemic. \u201cI believe this has been transformative for a generation,\u201d he says. \u201cThink about when was the last time government was this vital. I don\u2019t know, maybe in a war? World War II, when government had to mobilize overnight? But literally for decades you haven\u2019t seen government this essential to human life. Literally. And government has to work and it has to work well, and it\u2019s not for the faint of heart. And people want government to perform. And government is making decisions every day that affect their lives and they deserve the best government. They\u2019re paying for it, they deserve it. And they deserve competence and expertise and smarts and for government to be doing creative things and learning like we doing here today.\u201d The New York governor then goes on to stress the importance of individual responsibility in the ongoing fight, reiterating the necessity of social distancing. \u201cAn individual\u2019s role is responsibly and intelligently for yourself for your family and for your community,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to honor the healthcare workers and the people who literally gave their lives in some cases for what they did here? Act responsibly. Wear a mask. I know the weather is getting warmer, I know people want to get out of the house. Fine. Wear a mask and socially distance. That is your social responsibility in the middle of this overall pandemic. And when we talk about New Yorkers together and the spirit of unity and how people are helping one another and how tough we are and how smart we are and how disciplined we are and how we love one other? Show it. You know how you show love? By wearing a mask.\u201d After noting that New York state has spent more than $2 billion on medical equipment this year alone, Cuomo announces the formation of a regional buying consortium with seven neighboring states to \u201cincrease market power and bring down prices\u201d in the pursuit of PPE, ventilators and other medical equipment. The governor says the mutual-aid agreement \u201cwill make us more competitive in the international marketplace and I believe it will save taxpayers money\u201d. \u201cWe will come up with a regional identification of all the equipment we need,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cLet\u2019s come up with the total amount that we need. Let\u2019s stop doing business with vendors we found to be irresponsible and we found out the hard way \u2013 I can\u2019t tell you how many orders we placed with vendors who are acting basically as brokers, who just started businesses in the middle of this pandemic because they saw an opportunity \u2013 so let\u2019s compare notes among the states to find out who is good to do business with [and] who was not good to do business with. Let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t do the purchasing in this country and let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t do the purchasing in this region. Why we buying all this material from China? \u201c New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the number of current Covid-19 hospitalizations statewide has dropped below 10,000 for the first time since mid-March in his daily coronavirus briefing from Albany. The number of new hospitalizations over the last 24-hour period has also fallen to 789, though Cuomo warns this could be an anomaly. Cuomo says 280 people died yesterday, lifting the total death toll to 19,189. \u201cThe overall direction is good even though it\u2019s very painful,\u201d Cuomo says. Tara Reade, the woman who accuses Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her in a Capitol Hill corridor in 1993, has disputed an Associated Press report that said she said she did not use the words \u201csexual harassment\u201d in a complaint she says she filed 27 years ago. The AP report is here. Reade\u2019s tweets on the matter are here. \u201cThis is false,\u201d Reade wrote first, adding later: \u201c\u2026The headline was quite misleading. I filed the intake form regarding sexual harassment and retaliation however that was articulated on form in 1993. I filed with Senate Personnel. Perhaps Joe Biden knows where that form is located. Ask him.\u201d Reade also confirmed a report she had cancelled a Fox News Sunday interview after receiving threats, writing: \u201cNo survivor be fearful to come forward. And I did file a complaint.\u201d In a statement and TV interview on Friday, Biden flatly denied the accusation and asked the National Archives to look for Reade\u2019s complaint. The Archive said it wouldn\u2019t have it, but the Senate might. Donald Trump, who faces and denies numerous accusations of sexual misconduct and assault, commented on the claim against Biden on Friday, as did his new press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Here\u2019s Lauren Gambino\u2019s excellent look at the story and its political implications for both parties: Democrats have been accused of brushing aside an allegation of sexual assault against Joe Biden from former Senate staffer Tara Reade. Reade says the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate assaulted her in 1993. On ABC\u2019s This Week, the chair of the DNC, Tom Perez, defended Biden. \u201cJoe Biden has been very clear that this did not happen,\u201d Perez said on Sunday. \u201cHe was forceful in that, and he\u2019s been equally clear that when women come forward with complaints of this nature, they should be taken seriously, their complaints should investigate, they should be treated with dignity, and he\u2019s done exactly that. He called for the Senate to release any documents they have, she indicated that she filed a complaint. Joe Biden wants that complaint released. He is an open book. He understands that it\u2019s important for the information to get out.\u201d Perez also attacked Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThis president has been chronically inept at handling this coronavirus,\u201d said Perez. \u201cWe have less than 5% of the world\u2019s population. We have one-third of the world\u2019s coronavirus cases and 25 % of the world\u2019s deaths from coronavirus. His inattention, his ineptitude, he needs to be the commander in chief, not the Tweeter in chief. He needs to understand that the buck stops with him. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to talk about in this campaign, accountability, we\u2019re going to talk about leadership.\u201d It\u2019s World Press Freedom Day today and Donald Trump has chosen to mark it by saying he welcomes the important role the media plays in holding the powerful to account. Or maybe he went on Twitter to attack journalists as \u201cthe Enemy of the People\u201d. \u201cThe Fake News doesn\u2019t show real polls. Lamestream Media is totally CORRUPT, the Enemy of the People!\u201d he wrote on Twitter this morning, as he highlighted a Gallup poll that shows he has the highest approval rating of his presidency so far. CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter contrasted Trump\u2019s tweet with messages of support for the media from the leaders of Greece, Namibia, Lithuania and the Maldives. \u201cThe pandemic, breaking with the rules of our everyday life, reaffirms in the most unequivocal manner the vital role of the free press in offering citizens accurate and valid information,\u201d wrote Katerina Sakellaropoulou, the president of Greece on Twitter on Sunday. More on China and North Korea from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has been speaking to ABC. \u201cI can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan,\u201d Pompeo said, when asked about Trump\u2019s claim this week to have seen intelligence confirming the theory that Covid-19 was man-made and did not originate in bats and find its way to humans via a \u201cwet market\u201d, as is generally accepted. He did not, of course, say what the evidence was. Pompeo added: \u201cThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point.\u201d Then the exchange with This Week host Martha Raddatz got confusing, as to what Pompeo does or does not think. This is from ABC\u2019s transcript: RADDATZ: Your Office of the [Director of National Intelligence] says the consensus, the scientific consensus [is that the virus] was not man-made or genetically modified. POMPEO: That\u2019s right. I agree with that. Yeah. I\u2019ve seen their analysis. I\u2019ve seen the summary that you saw that was released publicly. I have no reason to doubt that that is accurate... (CROSSTALK) RADDATZ: OK, so just to be clear, you do not think it was man-made or genetically modified? POMPEO: I\u2019ve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they\u2019ve got it wrong. Um\u2026 Pompeo continued to attack China for its handling of the outbreak and what he said was a delay in transmitting information to the rest of the world. So far, so in line with White House attempts to blame China and thereby shift attention or blame from its own stumbling response as the US situation worsened throughout February and March. Raddatz asked \u201cDo you think they intentionally released that virus or it was an accident in the lab?\u201d \u201cYou know,\u201d Pompeo said, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say about that. I think there\u2019s a lot to know. But I can say this. We\u2019ve done our best to try and answer all of those questions. We tried to get a team in there. The World Health Organization tried to get a team in there. And they have failed. No one\u2019s been allowed to go to this lab or any of the other laboratories \u2013 there are many labs inside of China, Martha. This risk remains.\u201d The chair of the Republican National Committee Chair, Ronna McDaniel, appeared on ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos where she was asked about allegations from Tara Reade, a former Senate staffer, that she was sexually assaulted by Joe Biden in 1993. McDaniel accused Democrats and the media of hypocrisy over the allegations, saying Biden had been treated lightly, compared to the scrutiny given to Brett Kavanaugh when allegations of sexual assault were levelled against him before his appointment to the supreme court. \u201cIt has been appalling, the hypocrisy, as to how Brett Kavanaugh was treated versus Joe Biden,\u201d said McDaniel. \u201cBrett Kavanaugh, every accuser was put on TV. It was wall-to-wall coverage. They went into his high school year book. They said he needed an FBI investigation ... And then you go to Joe Biden. Five weeks of silence. Nineteen interviews without a single question. He won\u2019t let people go into his records in the University of Delaware. They\u2019re calling on the DNC to do the investigation. \u201cIt went from MeToo, MeToo, MeToo, to Move on, Move on, Move on in a nanosecond because he\u2019s a Democrat and the hypocrisy is appalling and it\u2019s not just from the Democrats, it\u2019s from the media, and I\u2019ll tell you, I think any outlet that conducted those 19 interviews and didn\u2019t ask a single question should be disqualified from conducting any part of a presidential debate.\u201d Biden, has in fact, been asked about the allegations, most recently on Friday on MSNBC. Various publications, including the Guardian, have also discussed the claims. The New York Times editorial board has called on the DNC to conduct an independent review of the matter. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who has also been accused of sexual assault, appeared to be sympathetic to Biden, who he is almost certain to face in this year\u2019s presidential election. In an interview on Friday, Trump said: \u201cI would just say to Joe Biden, just go out and fight [the allegation]\u201d. McDaniel said the president made his comments because he believes in justice. \u201cBecause due process and the presumption of innocence has no longer been the standard in this country when it comes to Republicans and now Democrats are suddenly embracing those legal standards that we made the cornerstone of our country when it comes to Joe Biden, but they threw it out the window when it came to Brett Kavanaugh, and so did the media,\u201d she said. McDaniel also said she was not worried about polls showing that Trump trails Biden in several key states. \u201cI think the American people recognize what a strong leader he has been through this unprecedented crisis,\u201d she said. Maryland governor Larry Hogan, a Republican not exactly on Donald Trump\u2019s good side, most of the time, also spoke to CNN this morning. He admonished Kudlow\u2019s comments about further economic aid to states possibly being linked to policy priorities such as clamping down on undocumented migrants, blaming Democrats in the House, Republicans in the Senate and the White House for indulging in \u201cdivisive politics\u201d when \u201cit\u2019s time to get something done\u201d. Hogan famously did get something done, flying in 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea \u2013 Hogan\u2019s wife is Korean, which helped \u2013 and then guarding them at a secret location to stop the federal government from swooping and taking the tests for itself. Remarkably enough, Hogan confirmed to CNN that he had been worried the Trump administration would steal his tests, although he said the worry was not so strong now. Hogan was also asked about anti-lockdown protests in his state, including a speech on Saturday from Andy Harris, a Republican congressman who said he \u201cdid not wake up in Communist China or North Korea\u201d and demanded his right to attend church if he wished. \u201cI think everyone has a right to protest,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cA couple dozen did so yesterday and \u2026 sadly we had far more people die yesterday in Maryland than we did protesters. Congressman Harris, I\u2019m not sure where he woke up yesterday morning \u2026 he\u2019s obviously got the right to say whatever crazy things he wants to say.\u201d The Johns Hopkins figures for Maryland: 24,473 cases and 1,251 deaths. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer appeared on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, for an interview subject to a particularly glitchy feed from Zoom, Skype or whichever video service was being used, making her look at times a bit like she was wearing first world war \u201cdazzle\u201d camouflage. Our leaders are subject to the same trials of working from home as the rest of us, evidently, if not quite so eager to show off that they did an MA in British modern art. Whitmer was asked about the protest in her state capital, Lansing, on Thursday in which men armed with \u201clong guns\u201d participated \u2013 carrying them legally, it should be noted, in the statehouse. \u201cWe know that people are not all happy about having to take the stay home posture,\u201d she said, \u201cand you know what, I\u2019m not either. But we have to listen to the public health experts and displays like the one we saw in our state capital are not representative of who we are in Michigan. \u201cThere were swastikas and Confederate flags and nooses and people with assault rifles. That\u2019s a small group of people when you think that this is a state of almost 10m people, the vast majority of whom are doing the right thing.\u201d Donald Trump has regularly expressed support for the Michigan protesters, who on Friday he called \u201cvery good people\u201d, inviting comparisons to his infamous comments about the Charlottesville white supremacists and neo-Nazis who marched in the summer of 2017. (They were \u201cvery fine people\u201d, for the inglorious record.) Asked about the president\u2019s comments, Whitmer said: \u201cSome of the outrageousness of what happened in our capital this week depicted some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country. Now, the Confederate flags and nooses, the swastikas, the behaviour that you\u2019ve seen, is not representative of who we are in Michigan.\u201d In other words, she chose not to shout back at the president, or comment on his suggestion she should \u201cmake a deal\u201d with such protesters. Whitmer was also asked about her support for Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s presumptive challenger in November, who is accused of sexual assault and who might also name Whitmer as his running mate. More on that to come. Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, appeared on ABC News\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos this morning to talk about his decision to make a phased reopening of businesses in his state. The manufacturing and construction sector will reopen on Monday before retail businesses come back on 12 May. Zoos, amusement parks and sports stadiums will remain closed until further notice. DeWine said that while he was keenly aware the world is in the middle of a pandemic, he wanted to balance safety measures with personal freedom. \u201cI think generally Republicans are less inclined to have the government tell them what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s generally how I am. I\u2019m a conservative Republican.\u201d That philosophy may well have played into DeWine\u2019s decision to reverse an order mandating that customers should wear face masks when shopping. \u201cPeople were not going to accept the government telling them what to do,\u201d said DeWine, who added that retail workers would still need to wear masks. \u201cWe put out dozens and dozens of orders, that was one that it just went too far. But at the same time we pulled that back, I said ... I highly recommend [wearing masks] ... Unless you have a physical reason you can\u2019t wear the mask, and we understand that, but when you go into a retail store, that is the kind thing to do because I worry and we should all worry about the folks who are stocking shelves in grocery stores, the people who are [on] the check-out line who work there all day, and we got to try to protect them.\u201d DeWine also stopped short of saying he would issue another stay-at-home order if cases started to rise after the reopening. \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch numbers every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to communicate those numbers to the people of Ohio. That\u2019s one of the things we\u2019ve done. We do a press conference virtually every day and we try to give them the data that we\u2019re looking at. So if we\u2019re starting to see those numbers, the people of the state are going to see those numbers and we\u2019ll have to take action. But what I hope is as people see those numbers, if they do go up and if they go up dramatically, that the people of the state will react to that. \u201cWe keep saying we\u2019re all in this together and that\u2019s the way I look at it as far as my job as governor and the people of the state. I got to keep them informed of what\u2019s going on. I think they\u2019ll do the right thing once they know the facts.\u201d More than 1,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Ohio so far. From a White House economic adviser to a White House public health adviser: Dr Deborah Birx is talking on Fox News Sunday: She\u2019s referring to protesters who want state economies and societies reopened, and who have been seen in states across the US. Here\u2019s an AP intro that sums up rather neatly the tensions between such demands and governors and experts who think reopening too quickly will most likely prove deadly: Hundreds opposed to Oregon\u2019s stay-at-home order demonstrated at the state capitol on Saturday as health officials announced dozens more cases and five additional deaths from Covid-19. Relative to California and Washington state, for two nearby examples, Oregon has not been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus: the Johns Hopkins figures put cases there at 2,635 and deaths at 109. The protests there on Saturday were not as angry as those in Michigan, for example, this week, where armed men entered the statehouse, frightening lawmakers \u2026 and earning the support of the president. Nonetheless, the AP continues, \u201cprotest organizers [said] they view the social distancing mandates issued by Governor Kate Brown as government overreach. Since mid-March, Brown\u2019s orders have closed many businesses, put some parks and campgrounds off limits, and required public schools to adopt distance learning programs. \u201cMost of the protesters did not wear face masks, but they waved American flags and Trump campaign signs in the rain. Other signs read \u2018Reopen Oregon\u2019 and \u2018Let me earn a living.\u2019 \u201cA group of healthcare workers demonstrated at the top of the Capitol steps, urging a phased plan to ease the state\u2019s social distancing requirements. Most of the other protesters ignored them. \u201cYou can\u2019t just place citizens under house arrest and enforce those orders,\u201d event organizer Adam Ellifritt said. Here\u2019s some video of the Michigan protests: White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow is up on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, discussing the economy and how to get it going again with a pandemic still raging, as more than half of the 50 states are now attempting to do. Kudlow mentions that further aid may be coming for struggling Americans, with almost 30m unemployed, and also floats again the idea that the Trump administration may try to tie it to such moves as concessions on sanctuary cities, mostly Democratic-run places which do not co-operate with attempts to remove undocumented migrants. Many observers have pointed out tying aid to policy priorities like that would be unprecedented and, to some, unconscionable. Kudlow also predicts a \u201cpotentially strong springback\u201d from state economies, and saying 2021 could \u201cbe one of the fastest growth rebounds in US history\u201d. The economy is central to Trump\u2019s case for re-election, of course. Here\u2019s Robert Reich again on that: Kudlow is asked about disconnects between public health advisers who counsel caution on reopening and economic advisers, such as him, who say it is time to reopen. He defends his own previous remarks about the coronavirus being contained. Obviously. The virus has \u201cspread exponentially in ways no one could\u2019ve predicted\u201d, he says, which epidemiologists and others would and do contest. Also obviously. Oh, and Maine: Maine is a state not yet so badly hit \u2013 Johns Hopkins figures put it at a little more than 1,150 cases and 56 deaths. But here\u2019s Lauren Aratani with a more, uh, considered take on the problems facing a state dependent on summer tourism\u2026 Trump has also tweeted about how he misses his rallies: Hopefully our Country will soon mend. We are all missing our wonderful rallies, and many other things!\u201d Many people thought Trump was using his daily White House coronavirus briefings as rally substitutes, pounding out misinformation and attacks on familiar enemies with a captive national audience. Then the president used the podium (or lectern, Twitter pedants, a line I now have on shortcut) to suggest people might inject themselves with disinfectant to beat the coronavirus and that alley was, for now, in the main, closed off too. It\u2019s also worth remembering that the president has often claimed not to have left the White House during the pandemic other than to visit a hospital ship leaving Virginia for New York, when in fact he staged rallies and visited the CDC in Atlanta. Trump is currently at Camp David in Maryland. There is no White House briefing on the schedule but he does have a Fox News town hall at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington tonight, at 9pm ET. Donald Trump is awake and \u2013 in Withnailian terms I can\u2019t resist and initiates of the film will get, Curse of the Superman and all that \u2013 he\u2019s stepped back into society and started tossing his orb about. One target this morning: President George W Bush, who has called for Americans to put partisanship aside during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump says Bush was \u201cnowhere to be found\u201d when his Republican successor was impeached, and thereby failed to \u201cspeak up against the greatest Hoax in American history!\u201d Also in the firing line, on Saturday night, was MSNBC host Nicole Wallace. It turns out I\u2019m right to think a double dog is a yoga pose, but in Trumpian tweet trash talk terms it\u2019s the following: \u201cShe was thrown off The View like a dog, Zero T.V. Personas. Now Wallace is a 3rd rate lapdog for Fake News MSDNC (Concast). Doesn\u2019t have what it takes!\u201d Nice to see he\u2019s using his time constructively. On Saturday night, Trump also claimed to have done more for African Americans than any president, although Honest Abe\u201d \u2013 Lincoln, who ended slavery, remember \u2013 \u201cwasn\u2019t bad\u201d. He also said of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un \u201cI, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!\u201d, earning predictable rebukes for praising a dictator. To Sunday morning: Trump has already attacked \u201cthe Fake News\u201d and \u201cthe Lamestream Media\u201d about polls, of course he has, and he has also retweeted a message which ends \u201cJeffrey Epstein didn\u2019t kill himself.\u201d That one, by the by, is from the same failed congressional candidate who\u2019s \u201c#FireFauci\u201d tweet Trump retweeted last month, causing widespread consternation. It\u2019s fun, keeping up with Trump tweets. Really, it is. \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus \u2013 and politics \u2013 in the US. First, as ever, the figures from Johns Hopkins University: US cases: 1,132,903 US deaths: 66,380 New York cases: 312,977 New York deaths: 24,198 Other states are badly hit: New Jersey is approaching 8,000 deaths, Michigan\u2019s toll has passed 4,000. And states with governors looking to reopen their economies faster than might be wise are affected too: there have been more than 35,000 cases and more than 1,300 deaths in Florida, for example, where the Grim Reaper himself, sort of, is patrolling the beaches in protest. In Washington, or near it at Camp David, Donald Trump continues to stir the pot. The Senate is due back in session on Monday \u2013 Mitch McConnell has judges to confirm, among other business \u2013 despite the dangers to its distinctly aging population. Trump has been busy slamming Nancy Pelosi, 80, for not reopening the House. It\u2019s worth noting that Pelosi and McConnell together, a rare sight, turned down Trump\u2019s offer of accelerated testing for members of Congress. Also, the White House has blocked Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying before a House committee about the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. This is one that\u2019s going to rumble on. In a tweet on Saturday night, Trump said: \u201cThe Democrats are just, as always, looking for trouble. They do nothing constructive, even in times of crisis. They don\u2019t want to blame their cash cow, China, for the plague. China is blaming Europe. Dr Fauci will be testifying before the Senate very soon!\u201d Republicans control the Senate, although Fauci has a history of contradicting Trump or reportedly angering him by sticking to inconvenient facts whatever the venue for doing so. We\u2019ll be watching this one as the morning shows roll on. There\u2019s also mounting Democratic anger about Trump\u2019s moves to neuter oversight of his administration, most recently by removing a health watchdog who wrote a report critical of the first responses to and preparations for the arrival of Covid-19. Elizabeth Warren: \u201cWhen it comes to his handling of this pandemic, Donald Trump has a view on oversight: He doesn\u2019t want any. Make no mistake: We will keep doing our jobs and holding him accountable for his botched response to a national crisis.\u201d All that and more to come, you lucky, lucky readers. Before it does, here\u2019s our columnist Robert Reich with an elegant evisceration of the Trump administration\u2019s moves to reopen the US economy\u2026",

The Dogs Trust says it is concerned that the increased interest in acquiring a dog may be followed by a rise in people giving up their new pets when some form of normality resumes. The animal welfare charity, formerly known as the National Canine Defence League, is temporarily changing its famous slogan, \u201ca dog is for life, not just for Christmas\u201d to \u201ca dog is for life, not just for lockdown\u201d. The organisation\u2019s chief executive, Owen Sharp, said: \u201cLike Christmas, when people are at home more, they might think now is the perfect time to get a dog. \u201cFor some people this will be the case, but we\u2019re asking people to consider when the lockdown lifts how your life will need to change to accommodate your four-legged friend.

Instead of asking potential owners to come to a centre to pick up their dog, the animal will be brought to them. The charity\u2019s warning came amid a surge in popularity during the first three months of this year of the Scottish terrier, popularly known as the Scottie dog. Statistics released by the Kennel Club showed a boost for the Scottish terrier, with puppy registrations increasing by 92% in the first few months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, making it the \u201ctop riser\u201d so far in the new decade.

The accountancy group Deloitte found that nine out of 10 finance directors believe there is a high or very high level of uncertainty facing their business. Deloitte\u2019s latest quarterly survey of chief financial officers took place after the UK was placed into lockdown, and warns that only 16% of executives are more optimistic about the prospects for their company than they were three months ago. The first-quarter survey gauges the sentiment of more than 100 finance bosses at some of the country\u2019s largest firms, including FTSE350 companies. The survey has recorded its lowest business confidence reading since it was launched in 2007, even lower than during the global financial crisis, in stark contrast to the final quarter of 2019, when the survey recorded confidence at a record high. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said the Covid-19 pandemic has seen business confidence plummet from an all-time high following the UK\u2019s December general election, to an all-time low in the space of three months. \u201cCFOs expect the lockdown to ease in May and June and demand in their own sectors to start recovering later this year. But there is no expectation of a quick snap back in activity, with most CFOs assuming revenues will not return to pre-crisis levels for at least a year,\u201d said Stewart. Almost all the executives surveyed expect UK corporate revenues to fall over the next 12 months, while the executives expect revenues at their own businesses to be on average 22% lower than they estimated before the pandemic. The coronavirus crisis has made businesses significantly more risk-averse, with almost all executives surveyed (94%) unwilling to take risk on to their balance sheets. As a result, 98% of CFOs expect UK business to reduce their capital spending during 2020, with the same percentage anticipating a slowdown in hiring. Despite government support packages for businesses during the pandemic, finance bosses who responded to the survey reported the tightest squeeze in credit conditions on record, with a significant fall in the availability and cost of debt during the first quarter. The economic outlook for the UK is gloomy, according to the majority of finance bosses, with over half (53%) forecasting a deep and prolonged downturn in Britain, which lasts until the end of 2020. According the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent economic forecaster, the economy could shrink by 13% this year.

There was a warning of further bad news in a survey by the Sutton Trust suggesting that some British students want to delay starting an undergraduate degree given the current uncertainties. Some 19% of UK applicants said they were changing their plans to go on to higher education in autumn, of which 4% said they had definitely decided not to go. If the survey\u2019s results were repeated nationally, that would mean about 10,000 fewer undergraduates in 2020-21, and about \u00a390m lost in tuition fee income.

The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) UK-wide survey of more than 22,000 health and care workers was conducted over the weekend before the government\u2019s announcement of testing expansion. At that time, 76% of all those surveyed said they had not been offered a test. Of those, 44% said they did not know how to access testing. The RCN also found more than four in five temporary staff had not been offered Covid-19 testing, compared to three-quarters of permanent staff. The survey found 79% of those working outside of the NHS had not been offered a test, compared with 75% in the health service. It found that in care homes and prisons, about 50% did not know how to access tests. With temporary staff, this figure was 60%. Of the staff who were offered testing, 90% were able to access it. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now and for the next few hours. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed on Sunday there is \u201cenormous evidence\u201d the coronavirus outbreak originated in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 but did not provide any of the alleged evidence. Pompeo\u2019s claims, made in an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, represented an escalation in rhetoric. He had previously said the US was looking into the possibility the virus came from a lab in Wuhan, China. On Sunday, Pompeo said: \u201cThere is enormous evidence that that\u2019s where this began,\u201d later adding: \u201cI can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d At one point, the secretary of state appeared confused over whether he was claiming the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes the Covid-19 disease) was deliberately engineered or escaped as the result of a lab accident. \u201cLook, the best experts so far seem to think it was manmade. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,\u201d he said. But when he was reminded that US intelligence had issued a formal statement noting the opposite \u2013 that the scientific consensus was that the virus was not manmade or genetically modified \u2013 Pompeo replied: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I agree with that.\u201d That\u2019s all from me for today, thank you for reading and writing in. Handing over to my colleague Helen Sullivan to take you through the next few hours. Here\u2019s a summary of the key developments from over the last few hours: The global confirmed case total is approaching 3.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins. The global death toll is at 246,736. Bolsonaro fuelled protests over the weekend in defiance of his own health ministry\u2019s appeals for citizens to stay at home because of the coronavirus. The country has now registered 101,147 confirmed cases of the virus and 7,025 deaths. New York hospitalisations have fallen below 10,000 for the first time since mid-March. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced 280 further deaths, lifting the total toll to 19,189. Travellers to France who arrive from a country within the European area (EU, the Schengen open-border area and the UK) will be exempt from a planned compulsory two-week quarantine, the French embassy in Britain announced on Sunday. Portugal has downgraded its state of emergency to a category of \u201ccalamity\u201d, as the rate of new infections reached its lowest since the beginning of the outbreak, six weeks after a state of emergency was declared. Qatar, the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s second worst-hit country after Saudi Arabia, reported 679 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 15,551. Twelve people have died from the virus in the Middle Eastern country. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme, which includes a smartphone app alongside traditional tracing techniques, on the Isle of Wight next week. Meanwhile, France\u2019s state-supported \u2018StopCOVID\u2019 contact-tracing app is expected to enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to relax its lockdown. Greece prepared to evacuate hundreds of migrants from the notoriously overcrowded island camp Moria to the mainland on Sunday. Two groups, of 142 and 250 \u201cvulnerable\u201d migrants will board ferries from the island of Lesbos. A Sydney school has closed for intensive cleaning and contact tracing after a student tested positive to the coronavirus. Warragamba public school will be \u201cnon-operational for on-site learning\u201d on Monday, with all students undertaking at home learning. The UK government\u2019s plan to exit lockdown through a tracking app will need detailed justification to satisfy human rights and data protection laws, a report has warned. A centralised system for contact tracing, which it is thought the government may well choose, would result in \u201csignificantly greater interference with users\u2019 privacy and require greater justification\u201d, the report \u2013 given as a legal opinion \u2013 concludes. Read the full story here. More than 2,000 rural migrant workers blocked from returning home pelted Indian police with stones, officials in Gujarat said, as millions more stranded in the state readied to return to villages. Poor migrant workers across the country lost their jobs during the world\u2019s biggest pandemic lockdown, which began in late March to guard against the spread of new coronavirus. Saturday\u2019s clash in western India\u2019s Gujarat is the latest in a spate of such protests across India. It happened when officials stopped the workers, who had rented vehicles, from crossing into neighbouring Madhaya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh states, because they did not have sufficient paperwork for entry, officials told AFP. Serbia will end its state of emergency over the coronavirus next week, as the rate of infections has slowed sufficiently, President Aleksandar Vucic has announced. The lifting of the state of emergency - involving closure of borders and airports, a daily curfew, and weekend lockdowns since mid-March - should be ratified by the government-controlled parliament on Wednesday, Vucic said. The Balkan nation has confirmed 9,464 cases and 193 people deaths from the Covid-19 disease, but infections have declined to under 5% of the thousands of people tested daily, epidemiologists say. There have been 4,588 new cases of the coronavirus in Brazil and 275 deaths over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said on Sunday, bringing total confirmed cases in the country to over 100,000. The nation has now registered 101,147 confirmed cases of the virus and 7,025 deaths. The number of cases increased roughly 5% on Sunday from the previous day, while deaths rose by roughly 4%, the ministry said. Travellers to France who arrive from a country in the European area (EU, the Schengen open-border area and the UK) will be exempt from a planned compulsory two-week quarantine, the French embassy in Britain said on Sunday. The new quarantine rules will apply to travellers, whether French or foreigners, as part of the fight against the new coronavirus. \u201cPeople entering the French territory from countries in the European area (EU/Schengen and United Kingdom) will NOT be affected by the quarantine measure announced in France, the details of which will be specified shortly,\u201d the French embassy in Britain said on Twitter. France, which has been the fifth-hardest hit country with 24,895 deaths from Covid-19, is preparing to gradually lift lockdown measures from May 11. French government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said earlier on Sunday that a list of \u201ccountries at risk\u201d would soon be issued, without giving details. South Africa\u2019s mining union has announced it has won a court case against the government that will force authorities to impose strict guidelines on mining companies to protect workers against Covid-19. The union said in a statement on Facebook that it was \u201ctruly elated\u201d with the court\u2019s ruling on Friday. \u201cNow the lives and livelihoods of mineworkers can be protected,\u201d South Africa\u2019s Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) president Joseph Mathunjwa said. South Africa, the world\u2019s largest platinum, manganese and chrome ore producer which has recorded 6,336 cases of the coronavirus, of whom 123 have died, is letting its mines run at half-capacity during a national lockdown. But AMCU filed the court action to demand national safety standards for mines, including sanitisation procedures and minimum level of protective gear, before they go back to work.The miners fear being infected because social distancing is near impossible inside deep mine shafts. Workers in deep mines in Peru have also pushed back against returning to work without adequate protective gear and proper information about cases at sites. Such resistance could also spread to Chile, Burkina Faso, the United States and other countries, where mine workers are making similar demands. Portugal has downgraded its state of emergency to a category of \u201ccalamity\u201d, as the rate of new coronavirus infections reached its lowest since the beginning of the outbreak, six weeks after a state of emergency was declared. \u201cIt\u2019s like being freed from prison,\u201d enthused Rodrigo Garcia, 40, on a walk to Lisbon\u2019s River Tagus with his wife, two sons and dog. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone out here and there, but with the end of the state of emergency we feel much freer.\u201d A three-phase reopening plan begins on Monday, after a six-week state of emergency when people were urged to stay indoors except for brief exercise, and most non-essential services were shut. Beaches remain closed other than for water sports and exercise, but under the lesser state of calamity spending time in parks is no longer strictly forbidden. Still, police officers were out in force on Sunday urging people not to linger and to maintain social distancing. \u201cA state of calamity still means you should stay home as much as you can,\u201d officer Sofia Gordinho told Reuters. \u201cIf people want to sit in the sun for a bit, that\u2019s okay, but we are asking them to move on so others can come without it getting crowded.\u201d Spared the huge tolls in neighbouring Spain and some other Western European nations, Portugal reported 25,282 cases of the new coronavirus on Sunday, just 0.4% more than the day before, and 1,043 deaths in a population of 10 million people. Coronavirus test kits used in Tanzania have been dismissed as faulty by President John Magufuli because he said they had returned positive results on samples taken from a goat and a pawpaw. Magufuli, whose government has already drawn criticism for being secretive about the coronavirus outbreak and has previously asked Tanzanians to pray the coronavirus away, said the kits had \u201ctechnical errors\u201d. The Covid-19 testing kits had been imported from abroad, Magufuli said during an event in Chato in the north west of Tanzania, although he did not give further details. The president said he had instructed Tanzanian security forces to check the quality of the kits. They had randomly obtained several non-human samples, including from a pawpaw, a goat and a sheep, but had assigned them human names and ages. These samples were then submitted to Tanzania\u2019s laboratory to test for the coronavirus, with the lab technicians left deliberately unaware of their origins.

Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan will not be hosting the programme tomorrow as he waits for the results of a Covid-19 test after experiencing a \u201cmild symptom\u201d. \u201cOn medical advice, and out of an abundance of caution for a mild symptom that arose in past 48hrs, I\u2019ve had a test for Covid-19 and so won\u2019t be working on @GMB until I get the result back, which should be tomorrow,\u201d he tweeted. Qatar, the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2019s second worst-hit country after Saudi Arabia, reported 679 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total confirmed cases to 15,551. Al Jazeera reports that 12 people have died from the virus in the Middle Eastern country. Meanwhile in the UK, more people are now in hospital with coronavirus in the north-west of England than in London, as regional differences in the spread and peak of the pandemic become increasingly apparent. Latest figures show 2,033 people in London hospitals compared to 2,191 in the north-west, where the peak for hospitalisation appears to have been on 13 April, compared to 8 April in the capital. Read the full report here. France\u2019s state-supported \u2018StopCOVID\u2019 contact-tracing app should enter its testing phase a week on Monday when the country starts to unwind its lockdown, a government minister has said. Minister for Digital Affairs Cedric O, a member of President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s inner circle, presented the app as a key element of France\u2019s strategy to stave off the coronavirus as authorities grapple with the prospect of mass testing. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magical about this app, but it\u2019s not technological coquetry either,\u201d O wrote on online publishing platform Medium. \u201cIt\u2019s only useful if it\u2019s integrated into a global health system.\u201d Countries are rushing to develop apps to assess the risk of one person infecting another, helping to isolate those who could spread the disease. The Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, has written this dispatch on the situation in Brazil: Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has spent another weekend stirring up street protests in defiance of his own health ministry\u2019s appeals for citizens to stay at home because of coronavirus. On Sunday lunchtime Bolsonaro appeared outside his palace in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, where a crowd of several hundred hardcore supporters had gathered with yellow and green flags and vuvuzelas. Brazil\u2019s far-right leader embraced and shook hands with admirers as the throng shouted anti-left slogans such as: \u201cOur flag will never be red!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m certain of one thing: we have the people on our side [and] the armed forces are on the side of the people,\u201d Bolsonaro said. A Brazilian photographer from one of the country\u2019s top newspapers was reportedly assaulted by Bolsonaro supporters as he documented the rally. Bolsonaro\u2019s outing - apparently an attempt to project strength in the face of a mounting political and economic crisis - drew immediate criticism from both left and right. One right-wing commentator, Diogo Mainardi, dubbed the president\u2019s supporters \u201cthe death squad\u201d. As Bolsonaro attended the demonstration, his health minister flew to the crisis-stricken Amazon city of Manaus where authorities have been forced to dig mass graves to accommodate the soaring number of dead. So far Covid-19 - which Bolsonaro has dismissed as \u201ca bit of a cold\u201d - has claimed at least 6,750 Brazilian lives. France has recorded a further 135 deaths in hospitals and nursing homes, bringing the country\u2019s total to 24,895. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 fell on Sunday to 25,815 from 25,827 on Saturday, and the number of people in intensive care fell to 3,819 from 3,827. Some readers have written in with questions about the UK figures today - Reuters explains how totals are calculated here: The UK\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 rose to 28,446, an increase of 315, according to latest data on Sunday that includes hospitals and other settings like nursing homes. The data is produced by the official Public Health England and its counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, records the number of deaths in a 24-hour reporting period. Earlier data on Sunday published by NHS England, the body which leads the state-funded health system in Britain\u2019s most populous nation, said there had been 327 deaths reported by hospitals in England in the reporting period. The discrepancy between these two totals is because the NHS England figure records the date when deaths are reported by hospitals, which is not necessarily the same day they occurred. The UK-wide figures collated by Public Health England are based on when deaths occurred rather than when they were reported by hospitals. Italy has reported 174 new coronavirus deaths, its lowest toll since 168 fatalities were registered when the country\u2019s lockdown started on March 10. The Mediterranean country\u2019s toll on the eve of its first easing of lockdown measures on Monday officially stands at 28,884 dead, second only to the United States. The 1,389 new infections were also the lowest since the first week of March. The UK will trial a new coronavirus tracing programme next week on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England, cabinet minister Michael Gove has announced as the government looks to minimise the risk of a second wave of infection. Suffering one of the worst death tolls in Europe from Covid-19, Britain is confident that the peak of the virus has passed and is now looking at how to restart its shuttered economy and ease social restrictions on citizens, according to the Press Association. \u201cThis week we will be piloting new test, track and trace procedures on the Isle of Wight with a view to having that in place more widely later this month,\u201d Gove said. Gove said the system being trialled next week would include asking citizens on the island to download a smartphone app as well as traditional ways of tracing those who have come into contact with a patient who has tested positive. Greece is preparing to evacuate hundreds of migrants from a notoriously overcrowded island camp to the mainland, according to AFP. Two groups, of 142 and 250 \u201cvulnerable\u201d migrants will board ferries from the island of Lesbos, according to a police source, after leaving the \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions in Moria camp. In April, Human Rights Watch urged Greek authorities to act quickly to ward off a potential health crisis in migrant camps lest the coronavirus take hold there. The sites are battling rampant overcrowding, poor sanitation, lack of proper water supplies and rudimentary healthcare. A transfer from the Moria camp would be the first since confinement measures were imposed on March 23 to stem the spread of Covid-19. A few days before that around 600 migrants had been transferred to the Greek mainland. An estimated 37,000 migrants live in terrible conditions on five Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. The camps were built to house 6,200 people. Moria holds around 19,300 migrants, more than six times its capacity. Plans to alleviate overcrowding were stalled by the discovery of Covid-19 cases among migrants on the mainland. But Greek officials now plan to move around 2,000 people from the islands, and migration minister Notis Mitarachi said recently that 10,000 had reached the mainland in the first three months of the year. Around 150 migrants on the mainland have tested positive for the virus, but up till now, no cases have been reported in the overcrowded island camps. French feminist advocacy groups are reporting an increase in sexual assault and harassment incidents in broad daylight by aggressors who know their victims are unlikely to be able to summon help. Fatima Benomar, a 36-year-old rights activist, said she was hounded by several youths on the Rue de Rivoli in Paris, a wide-open thoroughfare that has been emptied of cars and passers-by. \u201cThey came up because I was ignoring their catcalls, and started insulting and threatening me,\u201d Benomar told AFP. \u201cIt was incredibly scary.\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any way to escape, all the stores were closed and there was nobody to ask for help,\u201d she said. Police have been urging victims or witnesses to report any cases. They have not released official figures on the number of assault reports during the lockdown. But prosecutors reported last week that two women were raped in public spaces within 24 hours of each other - one in a park, the other on a street - in Seine-Saint-Denis, just north of Paris. Singapore has confirmed 657 new coronavirus cases, the vast majority of them foreign workers living in dormitories, taking the city-state\u2019s total to 18,205. Reuters reports the health ministry announced one death, an 86-year-old Singaporean woman, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 18. Among the new infections, ten were Singaporeans or permanent residents, while 626 cases were foreign workers living in dormitories, the ministry said. Singapore has among the highest number of coronavirus infections in Asia, mainly due to outbreaks in cramped migrant-worker dormitories. It has managed to curb the spread of the disease among locals outside the dormitories. Singapore will start easing coronavirus restrictions over the next few weeks, authorities said on Saturday. In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, Netherlands, McDonald\u2019s has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed, Reuters reports. Adjustments such as Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand sanitisers at restaurant entrances and designated waiting spots are being tested. Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since March 15. As of Friday, 39,791 coronavirus cases had been confirmed with 4,893 deaths. But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of May 19. A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around May 12, but Prime Minister Mark Rutte has ruled out a return to normal. If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections. About three quarters of McDonald\u2019s 39,000 restaurants worldwide were operational as of Thursday, including almost all its nearly 14,000 outlets in the United States, where drive-throughs are common. The UK daily briefing has been delayed and is expected to begin within the next 15 minutes. Head over to the UK live blog to follow Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. Hello, I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog for the next few hours. If you have a news tip, comment or suggestion, please get in touch via Twitter DM @cleaskopeliti or by email at clea.skopeliti.casual@guardian.co.uk. Thanks in advance. I\u2019m passing you on now to my colleague, Clea Skopeliti, who will continue to bring you the day\u2019s Coronavirus news from around the world on this live blog. Thanks for all your emails, tweets and comments over the past eight hours. The Pope has called for any successful Covid-19 vaccine to be shared worldwide. He said international scientific cooperation would be important in discovering a vaccine, stressing that it is \u201cimportant to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way\u201d. NHS England has announced a further 327 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19. The total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England is now 21,180. A coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has warned that Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples are at grave risk of a Covid-19 \u201cgenocide\u201d. Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney are among those who have signed an open letter to the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Vietnam has confirmed its first Coronavirus case in nine days, meaning its total now stands at 271. The country\u2019s lockdown was eased in late April and it is yet to record a Covid-19 death. Footballers in Serie A, Italy\u2019s top division, will be allowed to start individual training sessions from Monday. It is the latest step in a series of cautious moves towards restarting top-level sport across Europe, which has also seen players in England and Germany permitted different degrees of training ground work. One third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan\u2019s capital, Kabul, have come back positive. It has raised fears that one of the world\u2019s most fragile states may be harbouring widespread undetected infections. Primary schools in England could reopen on 1 June. Here is more from our education editor, Richard Adams: One third of 500 random coronavirus tests in Afghanistan\u2019s capital, Kabul, came back positive, health officials have said, raising fears of widespread undetected infections in one of the world\u2019s most fragile states. The results are concerning, said public health ministry spokesman Wahid Mayar. Afghanistan has performed only limited testing so far: close to 12,000, with more than 2,700 confirmed infections, in a nation of 36.6 million. As more testing becomes available, the country\u2019s confirmed infection numbers will likely rise sharply, said Mayar. He urged residents to stay home. Kabul and most other cities are in lockdown, but compliance has not been widespread. The death toll, officially at 85, could also be much higher. More than 250,000 Afghans returned home from Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across their country without being tested or quarantined. Anecdotal reports have emerged of dozens of returnees dying of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. At a recent briefing, a senior government official said 40 people died of the virus in Sarobi district, barely 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Kabul. The Health Ministry said it could not confirm the claim, reports AP. The country\u2019s health care system, devastated by four decades of war, is woefully unprepared for a major outbreak. It has only 400 ventilators. An international media rights group says the coronavirus pandemic is being used by governments around the world to increase restrictions on press freedoms, AP reports. In a report issued to coincide with World Press Freedom Day 2020, the International Press Institute concluded that in both democratic and autocratic states the public health crisis has allowed governments to exercise control over the media on the pretext of preventing the spread of disinformation. It said authoritarian governments have been abusing emergency measures to further stifle independent media and criminalise journalism, while in democracies efforts to control the public narrative and restrict access to information around the pandemic are on the rise. The Vienna-based organisation said it has documented 162 press freedom violations related to coronavirus coverage over the past two and a half months, almost a third of which have involved the arrest, detention or charging of journalists. The institute\u2019s report came three days after the International Federation of Journalists published a survey that found that the working conditions of news reporters around the globe have deteriorated during the coronavirus pandemic amid job losses and attacks on media freedom. Earlier, Egypt was singled out by Amnesty International for its treatment of journalists over the last four years. Our US live blog is now up and running. Martin Pengelly has all the Coronavirus updates from New York and beyond; Donald Trump has once again awoken in vocal mood: Top executives of Emirates and Etihad, two of the Middle East\u2019s biggest airlines, have said passenger demand may not return to pre-coronavirus crisis levels until 2023, reports AFP. About 85% of the world\u2019s airlines could face financial distress by the end of the year without government aid, Emirates president Tim Clark and Etihad CEO Tony Douglas told a video conference hosted by the US-UAE Business Council last week. Clark and Douglas reiterated their beliefs that until an effective vaccine for the COVID-19 respiratory disease becomes widely available, how passengers fly will be different, a statement by the council said. Lasting restrictions like 14-day quarantines, testing, and social distancing will impact demand and operations, they said. The airlines could not be reached for comment. Emirates and Etihad, which operate fleets of over 370 aircraft, a majority of them wide-bodied, have grounded their operations in March and are serving limited outbound flights to take repatriate foreigners from the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is expected to resume welcoming tourists by July, more than four months after halting the vital sector due to the coronavirus pandemic, an official said. The return, however, will be gradual and could be delayed until September, Helal al-Marri, the director general of Dubai\u2019s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, told Bloomberg TV last week. A majority of global airlines have also stopped operations due to shutdowns imposed to counter the spread of coronavirus. This global report from Sam Jones in Madrid focuses further on the easing of lockdown measures in Spain and Italy. In Spain, where 217,466 cases of Covid-19 and 25,264 deaths have been confirmed, adults were allowed back on to the street to exercise for the first time in seven weeks this weekend. Small shops, such as bookshops, hardware stores and hair salons were due to reopen on Monday, serving customers by appointment, along with restaurants for the collection of takeaways. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that the wearing of face masks will be mandatory on public transport, and that 14.5m masks will be handed out across the country. S\u00e1nchez also confirmed that his coalition government would be seeking MPs\u2019 approval this week to extend the state of emergency declared on 14 March until 24 May. \u201cWe\u2019re winning the battle against the epidemic, but the cost in lives and sacrifices has been very high,\u201d he said on Saturday. Here it is in full: Test results suggesting people in South Korea had been reinfected after recovering from Covid-19 were actually false positives caused by dead lung cells, the World Health Organisation\u2019s technical lead, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show today. You can watch the video here: Footballers in Serie A, Italy\u2019s top division, will be allowed to start individual training sessions from Monday in the latest cautious step towards a restart for sport across Europe. \u201cAthletes and non athletes, of non individual disciplines, just like any citizen, are allowed to practise individual sporting activities, in private and public areas, in respect of the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres and in respect of the ban to gather in any form,\u201d the Italian interior ministry said in a letter to local authorities. A number of clubs in England\u2019s Premier League allowed players to work on an individual basis at their training grounds on a strict rota basis from last Monday, while players at clubs in the German Bundesliga are permitted to train in small, socially-distanced groups. The leagues in France and the Netherlands, however, have been concluded without any further activity taking place. NHS England has announced 327 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,180. More details on this, and the rest of the Covid-19 picture across the UK, from my colleague Nadeem Badshah. I\u2019m back with you from now until around 4pm BST. Do send any hints, tips or observations to nick.ames@theguardian.com or @NickAmes82. Thanks for all your communications so far today. Nearly 3,000 cruise ship workers quarantined aboard a liner will undergo tests for the novel coronavirus, German travel group TUI said. \u201cMein Schiff 3\u201d was being used to ferry 2,899 TUI employees and crew home with both cruises and the usual means of transport in much of Europe shut down by the pandemic. Problems began when the huge vessel docked at in the German North Sea port of Cuxhaven on April 28 with more than a dozen crew members showing flu-like symptoms. One of them then tested positive for the virus on Friday leading the company to quarantine everyone on board. A first wave of 229 tests on personnel who had been in contact with the infected crew member came back negative, TUI said. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said mosques would reopen across large parts of the country Monday, as officials reported a drop in the number of deaths from the novel coronavirus. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 47 people died of the virus over the past 24 hours, the lowest daily count in 55 days. He told a news conference he hoped \u201cthe trend will continue in the upcoming days\u201d. His remarks came as President Hassan Rouhani said 132 counties, around one third of the country\u2019s administrative divisions, would \u201creopen their mosques as of tomorrow\u201d. \u201cSocial distancing is more important than collective prayer,\u201d he said in a televised meeting of the country\u2019s virus taskforce. The president argued that Islam considers safety obligatory, while praying in mosques is only \u201crecommended\u201d. Rouhani did not give the names of the counties affected by the measure or the number of mosques due to reopen on Monday. The measure is not expected to be implemented in the capital, Tehran, or in the main Shiite holy cities of Mashhad which are among those most affected by the outbreak. Mosques and some key Shiite shrines in Iran were closed in March amid the Middle East\u2019s deadliest COVID-19 outbreak. The targeted counties are \u201clow-risk\u201d, Rouhani said. According to Jahanpour, the 47 new deaths brought to 6,203 the total number officially recorded in Iran since it reported its first cases in mid-February. He added that 976 fresh infection cases were confirmed in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 97,424. Hello everyone. I am going to be updating you on the latest developments while Nick takes lunch. Please do share your news tips, insights and comments with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Handing over to my colleague Sarah Marsh for the next hour or so of global coronavirus updates. Dutch health authorities have confirmed a daily increase of 335 coronavirus infections, meaning the country\u2019s total is now 40,571, while 69 new deaths have been recorded. In total, the Netherlands has now seen 5,056 fatalities. This rise means the Netherlands is still 15th in the global ranking of Covid-19 cases, although the authorities have warned that the actual number of infections is probably higher because not all suspected patients are being tested. For those waking up in the US around now, Gene Marks has written a guide for small businesses who may not be covered by the government\u2019s paycheck protection program (PPP). If that applies to you, there could be other funding streams available. Our coronavirus world map, curated by Pablo Guti\u00e9rrez, has up-to-date visuals displaying where the virus has spread and where its impact has been most significant. Vietnam has confirmed its first Coronavirus case in nine days, meaning its total now stands at 271. The country of 95 million locked down for more than a month but began to re-open in late April. To date it has not recorded any deaths caused by Covid-19. Pope Francis has called for international scientific cooperation to discover a vaccine for the coronavirus and said any successful vaccine should be made available around the world, Reuters reports. \u201cIn fact, it is important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way to find vaccines and treatments,\u201d he said when delivering his Sunday address from the papal library in the Vatican City, a measure necessitated by the Italian lockdown. He added that it was also important to \u201cguarantee universal access to essential technologies that allow each infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary medical treatment\u201d. The pope also backed a proposal by an inter-religious group known as the Higher Committee on Human Fraternity for an international day of prayer and fasting on 14 May to ask God to help humanity overcome the pandemic. Brazil\u2019s indigenous peoples are at grave risk of a Covid-19 \u201cgenocide\u201d, a coalition of artists, celebrities, scientists and intellectuals has warned. Madonna, Oprah Winfrey, Brad Pitt, David Hockney and Paul McCartney are among those who have signed an open letter to the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, warning that warned the pandemic meant indigenous communities in the Amazon faced \u201can extreme threat to their very survival\u201d. They have warned that these communities, decimated centuries ago by diseases brought by European colonisers, may now disappear completely. Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro: Italy\u2019s two-month shutdown will partially ease from tomorrow onwards. This has been known for almost two weeks, but a report by AFP suggests many are still in the dark about what they will \u2013 and won\u2019t \u2013 be permitted to do. They quote Pietro Garlanti, a 53-year-old cleaner in Rome, asking: \u201cI\u2019m hoping this morning\u2019s paper will clear it up. I want to take my old mum to the sea-side, can I?\u201d Italians will be able to move more freely within their own regions, visiting relatives, going to the re-opened parks with their children and going cycling or running further from home. But these activities cannot be undertaken in groups and people will not be allowed to leave their regions unless for an essential reason. But several of the 20 regions have come up with their own interpretations of the rules. Veneto and Calabria have already relaxed their lockdowns, allowing restaurants and bars with outdoor tables to open earlier in the week. Liguria is reopening its beaches. But a lack of clarity is causing significant concern. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting with longing for May 4, but now it\u2019s finally arrived it\u2019s a letdown. Until they tell me I\u2019m really free, I\u2019ll feel paranoid, like I\u2019m breaking the rules in some way,\u201d 37-year old Michele Magna said. On Saturday the government published a Q&amp;A that explained people could see extended relatives, but not friends. Maternal care in the US has been derailed because of the coronavirus pandemic, writes Alexandra Villarreal. It poses a particularly serious problem for black mothers as they navigate the hospital system. Maternal care in the US, already flawed compared to similarly well-off countries, has been derailed because of the global coronavirus pandemic. Prenatal visits have transitioned to a combination of telehealth and in-person appointments where only the pregnant person is allowed to be physically present. Maternity units are also limiting visitors, usually to one, though some hospitals in Covid-19 hotspots have not allowed any. These changes have made deliveries difficult for all expecting mothers, regardless of a Covid-19 diagnosis, race or ethnicity. But even under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances, black mothers face a terrifying prospect as they navigate US hospitals, historically influenced by systemic racism and implicit biases, experts say. Add a global pandemic that\u2019s overwhelming the country\u2019s healthcare institutions, and advocates warn the outcome could be disastrous. \u201cBlack women aren\u2019t trusted. They aren\u2019t trusted to know and understand their own bodies,\u201d said Nia Martin-Robinson, director of black leadership and engagement at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Read the piece in full here: Armenia will reopen some shops, restaurants and bars from Monday. It marks the start of a significant relaxation of restrictions that will also see manufacturing resume and restraints upon movement lifted. Confirmation of the easing was given by Tigran Avinyan, the deputy prime minister, and came despite a recent rise in confirmed infections. The country has registered 2,386 cases of the coronavirus and 35 deaths, with the number of infections rising from an average of 50 a day in mid-April to more than 100 in recent days, including 134 registered on Wednesday. Reuters reports that Armenia is looking to ease the hit on an economy that could shrink by 2% this year. Smaller shops, beauty salons and dry cleaners will open on Monday, Avinyan stated on social media. Malls, trade centres, markets and all schools and colleges will remain closed for now, however, while public transport is to remain suspended. Russia has announced its biggest daily increase in Covid-19 cases to date. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre reported 10,633 new cases and 58 deaths, increasing the total fatalities to 1,280. Afghanistan has confirmed its highest rise both in coronavirus cases and deaths. The country confirmed 235 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, marking its biggest one-day rise of new infections, and 12 patients died overnight \u2013 bringing the total number of infections to 2,704 and death toll to 85. Japan could start easing its coronavirus curbs. Parks and museums are among the facilities that could reopen soon, as long as strict preventative measures are adhered to. However, its state of emergency \u2013 which currently expires on Wednesday \u2013 is likely to be extended by another month. Spain has reported its lowest rise of Covid-19 deaths in six weeks. The health ministry announced a one-day rise of 164 deaths from coronavirus, meaning the country\u2019s total is now 25,264. It is the smallest increase since 18 March. Meanwhile, confirmed cases of the virus in Spain rose to 217,466 today. Iran will reopen mosques across large parts of the country on Monday. The president, Hassan Rounani, confirmed that centres of worship in around one third of the country\u2019s administrative division would be allowed to operate from tomorrow. He did, however, stress that \u201csocial distancing is more important than collective prayer\u201d. Watchdogs in the US say Donald Trump\u2019s links with donors and backers deserve scrutiny as huge amounts of federal funds are distributed. There are concerns that, even during an unprecedented national crisis, Trump\u2019s priorities and campaign machine often tilt towards giving donors and political allies favours, access and publicity. Watchdog groups in the US say Donald Trump\u2019s close ties with donors and backers deserve scrutiny as trillions in federal funds are handed out during the Covid-19 crisis. Peter Stone reports from Washington. Fracking billionaire and Trump donor Harold Hamm was among an elite group of oil and gas executives who met with the president in early April to press for federal help, including access to big loans for businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. It prompted Trump afterwards to promise to \u201cmake funds available to these very important companies\u201d. Major Trump ally Tommy Fisher, who last year landed a $400m Army Corps of Engineers contract to build 31 miles of Trump\u2019s border wall in Arizona, in April received another $7m from the army \u2013 despite an active investigation by a Pentagon watchdog into allegations of favouritism after Trump reportedly pushed for Fisher. Another big Trump donor, Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and the chair of Trump\u2019s campaign in Minnesota, got red-carpet treatment from Trump at a press briefing in late March. Lindell then praised Trump, hailing him as \u201cchosen by God\u201d as the president touted the firm\u2019s efforts to make thousands of face masks. As evidence of lockdown regulations being loosened in some parts of Europe, Reuters has reported on the return to action of Austria\u2019s tennis players. Players can compete again, in singles format, with no touching of each other\u2019s match balls and no handshaking. Golf, horse riding, archery, shooting and mini-golf are among other social distancing-compatible sports to have been given the green light since Friday in the country\u2019s second wave of lockdown easing. Our daily roundup of coronavirus developments across Australia is now up, courtesy of Christopher Knaus. Indonesia\u2019s health ministry has reported 349 new coronavirus cases and 14 new deaths. The country\u2019s total number of infections now stands at 11,192, with 845 deaths in total. More than 83,000 people have been tested. Neighbouring Malaysia has reported 122 new cases, meaning the total now stands at 6,298. Its health ministry also reported two new deaths, raising the total number of fatalities to 105 Here is a big Sunday piece by Ed Pilkington, chief reporter for Guardian US. Three years of hostility to evidence-based policy have led to a crisis in which the Donald Trump\u2019s ill-informed, self-serving \u201chunches\u201d have deadly consequences \u2013 but how will the president\u2019s war on science play out? Three months into the pandemic, with the number of confirmed cases passing 1 million, the tension that has been simmering for months between Trump and the scientific world is at boiling point. His improvisation about injecting disinfectant encapsulated the sense of demoralisation \u2013 of despair, almost \u2013 that many American scientists now feel about the drift from evidence-based leadership. Full article: Spain\u2019s health ministry has reported a one-day rise of 164 deaths from coronavirus, meaning the country\u2019s total is now 25,264. It is the lowest increase since 18 March. Meanwhile confirmed cases of the virus rose to 217,466 today, from 216,582 on Saturday. Iran will reopen mosques across large parts of the country on Monday, the country\u2019s president Hassan Rouhani has confirmed. Mosques have been closed since early March after the coronavirus outbreak intensified, but AFP quote Rouhani saying 132 counties, around one third of the country\u2019s administrative divisions, would \u201creopen their mosques as of tomorrow\u201d. \u201cSocial distancing is more important than collective prayer,\u201d he added, arguing that Islam considers safety obligatory, while praying in mosques is only \u201crecommended\u201d. The targeted counties are \u201clow-risk\u201d, Rouhani said in a televised meeting of the country\u2019s virus taskforce. He said the committee was also mulling reopening schools by May 16 to allow for a month of classes before the summer break. Covid-19 has killed more than 6,150 and infected over 96,440 in Iran since it announced its first cases in mid-February. On Saturday, the country reported its lowest daily toll of new infections since 10 March.

Tensions aboard the Greg Mortimer, an Australian cruise ship that spent a month stranded off the South American coast and remains in limbo, are running high amid allegations that the ship\u2019s operators and captain pressured the chief medical officer to mislead authorities in Uruguay about the health situation onboard. Thirty-three members of its crew have been diagnosed with Covid-19 and one has died. Uki Go\u00f1i reports: Japan could start easing some of its coronavirus-enforced curbs, with parks and museums among the facilities being slated to reopen. The economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura is quoted by Reuters as saying certain restrictions may be eased as long as the correct preventative measure are imposed. \u201cAs long as the proper preventive measures are in place, it could be possible to ease some of the current restrictions on economic activities,\u201d Nishimura said. Places like parks, museums, art galleries, and libraries could reopen even in the 13 prefectures where coronavirus has spread rapidly, if they take steps to disinfect their premises and ensure visitors maintain their distance, he added. Further details of how restrictions might be eased will be discussed at an experts\u2019 meeting on Monday. Regardless, Japan\u2019s state of emergency \u2013 which currently expires on Wednesday \u2013 is expected to be extended by another month. Covid-19 has infected 15,589 people and killed 530 in the country. The developed world\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic is imperilling health systems, economies and livelihoods elsewhere in the world that were already on the edge, writes Simon Tisdall. The west\u2019s self-absorption threatens to obscure the virus\u2019s harmful impact on treatment of non-Covid, preventable diseases. Just as UK cancer deaths are forecast to rise due to a diversion of resources, so measles and other immunisation programmes in poorer nations are being undercut. The WHO announced last week that polio vaccinations for up to 12 million children in Africa will be delayed as resources are switched to fighting Covid-19. It admitted the move would inevitably lead to more child polio cases. Disrupted vaccination programmes have frequently led to \u201cexplosive\u201d outbreaks of life-threatening diseases previously held in abeyance, warned vaccine specialist Edward Parker. \u201cWithout systematic efforts to maintain immunisation programmes, the virus\u2019s legacy could include a disastrous surge in childhood deaths.\u201d The pandemic is providing cover for malign governments to pursue or accelerate policies that place lives at risk, regardless of Covid-19. A striking example is Myanmar, where the army has renewed its repression of minorities in Rakhine and Chin states. Six new polio cases have been reported in Afghanistan as the war-torn country recorded its highest one-day rise of new coronavirus cases and deaths, triggered by the continued surge of transmission in Kandahar and Kabul amid an intensified war across the country. The country confirmed 235 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, marking its biggest one-day rise of new infections, and 12 patients died overnight \u2013 bringing the total number of infections to 2,704 and death toll to 85. There have so far been 345 recoveries. Wahidullah Mayar, a health ministry spokesman, said 256 health workers have also tested positive in the country. Most of the new infections were confirmed in Kabul, raising the total number of transmissions to 680 \u2013 with 63 reported in the last 25 hours. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst-affected area and authorities have implemented a lockdown in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Despite the lockdown in several provinces, in most cities streets are still crowded with vehicles and people walking freely around. Experts fear that may be a challenge in the fight with Covid-19. The disease may cause huge collateral damage among Afghanistan\u2019s many vulnerable citizens. Save the Children has already warned that lockdowns \u2013 although they are being widely ignored \u2013 have put seven million children at risk of hunger. Meanwhile, Mayar said on Saturday that six new polio cases were recorded in the country, mostly in the southern province of Kandahar. Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria are the only three countries in the world where polio remains endemic. War continued to intensify in the country. A government spokesman said 17 civilians were killed by the Taliban in the first week of Ramadan. Russia has recorded its highest daily rise in confirmed Covid-19 cases, with 10,633 new cases listed today. It brings the overall number to 134,686. A further 58 deaths have been reported by the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre, increasing the total number of fatalities to 1,280. Our UK live blog is now up and running, with Ben Quinn \u2013 you can join it here: Pharma giant Roche gets US go-ahead for Covid-19 antibody test Swiss drug maker Roche Holding AG says it has received emergency use approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus. Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies. Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to \u201chigh double-digit millions\u201d per month. Singapore has confirmed 657 new coronavirus infections, taking its total to 18,205. According to the country\u2019s health ministry, most of the new cases were diagnosed among migrant workers living in dormitories. After Covid-19: How will a socially distanced high street actually work? Britain\u2019s once bustling high streets are now eerily quiet, with all non-essential shops closed and thousands of staff furloughed. Many may never reopen as the lockdown accelerates shifts to online shopping, while others will have to find ways to adapt to a radically different retail world of long-term social distancing rules and nervous customers afraid of catching the virus. The British Independent Retailers Association warned last week that one fifth of their members might close for good if footfall is low. Yet some of the big non-food retailers such as Homebase and B&amp;Q are starting to reopen stores, and the British Retail Consortium has issued guidance on how non-essential shops could trade while keeping customers and staff safe. The Observer spoke to five shop owners on one British high street to find out how they are faring and what the future holds for their businesses. Hello, this is Nick Ames and I\u2019ll be with you for the next eight hours or so as our coverage of live coronavirus news from around the world continues. If you have any tips, suggestions, feedback or anything else then please feel free to email me at nick.ames@theguardian.com or send me a direct message on Twitter @NickAmes82. That\u2019s it for me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I have just one question before I go: did you remember to video-chat the eels? Let me know here. In case you missed it, they\u2019re forgetting humans exist: Global cases near 3.5 million as death toll approaches 250,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker there were 3,428,422 confirmed cases worldwide on Sunday, with 243,831 people losing their lives to the disease. The US continues to be the most affected country, with more than 1.3 million cases and 66,385 deaths. Warren Buffett says \u2018world has changed\u2019 for airlines. The legendary American investor has dumped his firm\u2019s holdings in the four major US airlines, warning that the \u201cworld has changed\u201d for the aviation industry in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an \u201cextraordinarily wide\u201d range of possible economic outcomes. Only 17% of Brits want schools, pubs and restaurants reopened. Fewer than one in five Britons believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. Half of UK doctors say they have had to source their own PPE. Almost half of Britain\u2019s doctors have sourced their own personal protective equipment or relied on a donation when none was available through normal NHS channels, according to a survey. The British Medical Association said its latest survey was the biggest of frontline NHS staff during the coronavirus crisis. European leaders join forces to combat Covid-19. European leaders have pledged to raise billions of pounds to help find a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19 as part of an \u201cinternational alliance\u201d fighting the disease. An online pledging conference due to be held on Monday will aim to pull in \u20ac7.5bn (\u00a36.6bn) in funding to support the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. YouTube deletes conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old conspiracy theorist David Icke had violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. India imposes jail lockdowns as virus spreads in overcrowded prisons. The spread of the coronavirus in India\u2019s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease. Boris Johnson\u2019s doctors had plan to announce his death. Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he spent three nights in intensive care last month. Britain\u2019s PM told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cThey had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario. The doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.\u201d Johnson, 55, said: \u201cThe bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. That was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.\u201d Travel within China surges. China\u2019s most populous cities saw a leap in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China\u2019s internet giant Baidu Inc. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan with questions, comments and news from your part of the world. \u201cWe forget that flu once plagued the economy as coronavirus does today,\u201d writes William Keegan, the Observer\u2019s senior economics commentator. It is a sobering thought that, according to the many well-researched accounts to have appeared in recent weeks, this Johnson/Cummings government seems to have been prepared to risk 250,000 deaths from the policy of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. This approach was, mercifully, laid to rest after the intervention of Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, on 16 March. There followed the introduction of lockdown and what some of us prefer to call \u201cphysical distancing.\u201d Commentators have been putting the 27,000 or more deaths in this country attributed to the virus so far in the context of the 60,000 civilian deaths recorded during the second world war. This is bad enough. But I wonder how many people are aware that during the \u201cSpanish\u201d flu epidemic of 1918-21, which followed the first world war, the estimated loss of life in this country was, well, 250,000? The number of households with children going hungry has doubled since lockdown began, as millions of people struggle to afford food. New data from the Food Foundation shared exclusively with the Observer has revealed that almost a fifth of households with children have been unable to access enough food in the past five weeks, with meals being skipped and children not getting enough to eat as already vulnerable families battle isolation and a loss of income. The strain on larger families, single parent homes and those with disabled children has been immense. A reported 30% of lone parents and 46% of parents with a disabled child are facing food insecurity and finding it difficult to manage basic nutritional needs at home. With schools no longer providing a reprieve for children reliant on free breakfast clubs and school lunches, poorer families are at crisis point. Pandemic! by Slavoj \u017di\u017eek; Where Is God in a Coronavirus World? by John Lennox \u2013 review Detained at home with time to write instant books, two septuagenarian sages here make very different attempts to wrest a meaning or moral from the coronavirus pandemic. The Slovenian theorist Slavoj \u017di\u017eek treats the disease as an intellectual malaise from which we will only be rescued by a \u201cphilosophical revolution\u201d; John Lennox, an Oxford mathematician who moonlights as a Christian evangelist, approaches Covid-19 as a theological conundrum and tries to explain why God seems so unbothered by our distress. While clinicians work on decoding the coronavirus, \u017di\u017eek unhelpfully inflates it to an imaginary bogey, a \u201cspectral fantasy\u201d. In the absence of a vaccine, Lennox prescribes prayer, which at least is better advice than injecting bleach. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Elsewhere, the pandemics danger remained evident. Pakistan followed Russia in reporting its biggest one-day spike in new infections. Pakistan announced nearly 1,300 new cases Saturday, raising the total in the country of 220 million people to about 18,000. The government has said it might ease controls, but doctors have pleaded for stricter lockdowns, warning an explosion of infections would overwhelm hospitals, AP reports. Moscow is considering establishing temporary hospitals at sports complexes and shopping malls to deal with the influx of patients. Russia has reported around 125,000 cases and more than 1,200 deaths, but the actual numbers are believed to be much higher because not everyone is tested. Singapore announced Saturday it will let selected businesses reopen from 12 May in a cautious rollback of a two-month partial lockdown, and Sri Lanka said the government and private sector should resume work from 11 May \u201cto ensure a return to normalcy in civilian life and to revive the economy. Bangladesh, which opened thousands of garment factories last month, confirmed 552 new cases on Saturday. From the United States to Europe and Asia, people in many parts of the world are emerging from their homes as virus-related restrictions begin to ease and springtime temperatures climb, AP reports. Chinese were flocking to tourist spots, many newly reopened, after a relaxation of domestic travel restrictions ahead of a five-day holiday that runs through Tuesday. Nearly 1.7 million people visited Beijing parks on the first two days of the holiday, and Shanghai\u2019s main tourist spots welcomed more than a million visitors, according to Chinese media reports. Many spots limited the number of daily visitors to 30% of capacity or less, keeping crowds below average. Masks were worn widely, from runners in Spain to beach-goers in the southern United States. In New York City\u2019s Central Park, joggers moved past each other without a glance on Saturday, and a steady stream of folks left tips for a trio working their way through a set of jazz standards alfresco. Neighbouring New Jersey reopened state parks, though several had to turn people away after reaching a 50% limit in their parking lots. Warren Buffett dumps US airline stocks, saying \u2018world has changed\u2019 after Covid-19 Warren Buffett, the legendary American investor, has sold his firm\u2019s entire holdings in the four major US airlines, warning that the \u201cworld has changed\u201d for the aviation industry because of the coronavirus crisis. In comments that will send shockwaves through financial markets already pulverised by the economic shock of the outbreak, Buffett said the outbreak could have an \u201cextraordinarily wide\u201d range of possible outcomes. Shares around the world are poised for another torrid week as worldwide cases of the virus creep towards 3.5 million and deaths near 250,000. Despite massive central bank and government intervention, stock markets have been rocked by the continued spread of Covid-19, the plunge in oil prices and Donald Trump\u2019s threats to reignite his trade war with China. Buffett, 89, who has become known as the Sage of Omaha for his investment skill over the decades, indicated that he believed stock markets had not reached the bottom of the current dip. Speaking at the virtual annual meeting of his company Berkshire Hathaway from Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett said he had not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing \u201cattractive\u201d enough, even after the recent plunge in the markets.

Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider lifting lockdown. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. Primary schools in England and Wales could reopen for all in June. Children aged five to 11 could return to school from Monday 1 June as part of government plans to gradually ease lockdown measures, the Sunday Telegraph has reported. Number of people travelling outside home cities in China jumps 50% in a month. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China\u2019s internet giant Baidu Inc. Venezuela prison riot leaves 40 dead. A riot erupted at a prison in central Venezuela on Friday, killing at least 40 people and injuring 50 more, including a National Guard officer who was wounded by an explosion and the warden, who suffered a knife wound, authorities said.

Nearly 3,000 crew quarantined on cruise ship in German port. Nearly 3,000 crew of a cruise ship belonging to German tourism giant TUI have been quarantined on board after one person tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the company said on Friday. France proposes 14-day quarantine on entry. Those entering France after the end of lockdown on 11 May could be subjected to a minimum of a fortnight in quarantine as part of a new proposed law which would extend the state of \u201chealth emergency\u201d for weeks further. Businessman Warren Buffett has given an upbeat assessment of the US\u2019 ability to withstand crises.\u201cThis is quite an experiment,\u201d Buffett said. \u201cI remain convinced ... that nothing can basically stop America.\u201d Three new cases in Yemen. Fears of an outbreak are growing in the war-ravaged Gulf country after two new cases were confirmed in Aden and one in Taiz province, which is now set to seal its borders. Cinemagoing habits could see further long-term shift. Lockdown hit Trolls World Tour, an animated musical extravaganza about a group of pop-loving trolls, could become the most important film in recent Hollywood history after amassing digital sales of \u00a380m in three weeks. China has published a short animation titled \u201cOnce Upon a Virus\u201d mocking the U.S. response to the new coronavirus using Lego-like figures to represent the two countries, Reuters reports. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was confident the coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence. In the animation posted online by China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency, red curtains open to reveal a stage featuring Lego-like figures in the form of a terracotta warrior wearing a face mask and the Statue of Liberty. Washington and Beijing are locked in a war of words over the origins of the disease, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has grown into a global pandemic. The United States and other countries have accused China of misleading the world about the severity of the outbreak, and there are growing calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the virus. Lego\u2019s press office wrote in an emailed statement on Saturday: \u201cWe weren\u2019t involved in making the animation in any way.\u201d Nearly 3,000 crew of a cruise ship belonging to German tourism giant TUI have been quarantined on board after one person tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the company said on Friday. Fifteen crew members of the \u201cMein Schiff 3\u201d were tested after showing mild flu symptoms, with one of them testing positive for COVID-19. All 2,899 crew members would remain in quarantine on board in the ship\u2019s home port of Cuxhaven on Germany\u2019s North Sea coast until further notice, TUI said in a statement. The cruise ship had no passengers on board, TUI added. TUI, the leader in global tourism, has agreed a 1.8 billion euros ($1.9 billion) bridging loan from the German government to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on one of the hardest-hit sectors. A riot erupted at a prison in central Venezuela on Friday, killing at least 40 people and injuring 50 more, including a National Guard officer who was wounded by an explosion and the warden, who suffered a knife wound, authorities said. The upheaval at the Llanos Penitentiary Center started with an inmate protest demanding that their relatives be allowed to deliver them food and then an armed confrontation broke out between inmates and guards, lawmaker Mar\u00eda Beatriz Mart\u00ednez told The Associated Press. The National Guard officer was injured by a grenade explosion, said Mart\u00ednez, who had access to an early report prepared by the town\u2019s security forces. The prison is located in the city of Guanare, 450 kilometers (280 miles) south-west of the capital of Caracas. Venezuela has roughly 30 prisons and 500 jails that can hold an estimated 110,000 inmates. Human rights officials say the prisons are violent and badly overcrowded, with gangs that traffic weapons and drugs in control. According to the human rights group Venezuelan Prison Observatory, the Guanare prison was built to hold 750 inmates but is jammed beyond capacity with 2,500 inmates. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 793 to 162,496, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 74 to 6,649, the tally showed. For more on the pandemic in Germany at the moment, the Guardian\u2019s Kate Connolly and Kim Willsher have this report on Europe\u2019s schools re-opening: Playgrounds began reopening in Germany on Friday and pupils aged 11 and 12 are due to return to school in a staggered system starting next week. Classes will be split in two and the groups will alternate between lessons at school and at home. Hygiene measures being adopted across Europe include strict handwashing and disinfection regimes, physical distancing and the demarcation of playgrounds into zones to ensure pupils do not mix more than necessary. Children will have to file out of classrooms at different times to maintain physical distancing. Germany has temporarily removed sport and music lessons from the curriculum because they are considered too great a risk, but older pupils already returned to sit exams last month. Nurseries will remain closed for all children, except those of key workers, for the time being. China\u2019s most populous cities saw a spike in outbound travellers, tourists and day-trippers on 1 May, first day of a long holiday weekend, led by Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus epidemic that first struck the country late last year. The number of people travelling outside their home cities jumped nearly 50% at the start of the Labour Day weekend, compared with the first day of the Tomb Sweeping holiday on 4 April, according to Reuters calculations on data from China\u2019s internet giant Baidu Inc. The increase in outbound travel during the five-day holiday, one of China\u2019s peak tourism periods each year, would help lift the travel and hospitality sectors that have been hit hard by disruption from the coronavirus pandemic. The spike in tourism was led by increases in travellers from Wuhan, Beijing, Dalian, Tianjin and Jinan, with China having eased curbs on travel and relaxed rules on quarantine amid dwindling cases of the coronavirus. Hundreds of sightseeing spots have also been reopened, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, as authorities sought to revive and repair local economies. The country recorded more than 23 million domestic tourists on 1 May, according to China\u2019s culture and tourism ministry. Hubei\u2019s tourism department said its 22 reopened tourist sites saw 109,664 visitors on 1 May, down 87% from a year ago, while tourism revenue plunged 95% to 6.79 million yuan ($961,729). As more and more state and local officials announce the release of thousands of at-risk inmates from the nations adult jails and prisons, parents along with children rights groups and criminal justice experts say vulnerable youths should be allowed to serve their time at home, AP reports. But they say demands for large-scale releases have been largely ignored. Decisions are often not made at the state level, but instead carried out county by county, with individual judges reviewing juvenile cases one by one. Such legal hurdles have resulted in some kids with symptoms being thrown into isolation for 23 hours a day, in what amounts to solitary confinement, according to relatives and youth advocates. They say many have been cut off from programs, counsellors and school. Some have not been issued masks, social distancing is nearly impossible and they have been given limited access to phone calls home. One mother reported that her daughter was so cut off from the outside world with no TV and staff not wearing any protective gear that the girl had no idea a deadly virus was even circulating in America. In some states, authorities have been shuttling kids between facilities, trying to make sure sick and healthy young people are kept apart. Growing fears and frustrations have led to violence and mayhem not just in Louisiana, but at juvenile centres in other coronavirus hot spots such as New York. Young people are calling their parents to say they\u2019re scared and desperate to escape. Sheriffs deputies responded to a facility in Portland, Oregon, this month after a disturbance broke out, but no injuries were reported. The Bolshoi ballet held its first online classes only this week, more than a month after lockdown began, AFP reports. In the middle of their bedroom, Bolshoi ballet dancers Margarita Shrainer and Igor Tsvirko have placed a linoleum mat and a barre. Since the start of the lockdown, the couple, both soloists in the legendary troupe, have largely used their own initiative to keep up their dance skills at home. Yet Tsvirko and Shrainer still look toned and Tsvirko pulls at his waistband. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got fat, that\u2019s the main thing,\u201d says the 30-year-old dancer, a leading soloist at the Bolshoi who has performed lead roles in \u201cIvan the Terrible\u201d and \u201cNureyev\u201d. Shrainer, a first soloist who has performed major roles in \u201cCoppelia\u201d and \u201cCarmen Suite\u201d, massages her leg with a tennis ball and moves into the splits. Together for more than a year, they are living in a studio flat owned by the theatre. The same block is home to several other dancers and it was outside this building that the notorious acid attack on then-artistic director Sergei Filin took place in 2013. Their Zoom class is led by a teacher doing steps in his bedroom to a piano accompaniment. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported 1,349 new known coronavirus cases and 89 more deaths on Saturday, bringing the country\u2019s total to 22,088 cases and 2,061 deaths. The head of Mexico\u2019s consumer protection agency, Ricardo Sheffield, said on Twitter on Saturday he had tested positive, becoming at least the second high-ranking federal government official with the virus. China reported two new coronavirus cases for 2 May, up from one the day before, data from the country\u2019s national health authority showed on Sunday. One case was imported and the other was local, the National Health Commission (NHC) said. This compares to one imported case and no domestic transmissions on 1 May. The NHC also reported 12 asymptomatic cases for May 2, down from 20 the day before. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 82,877. With no new deaths reported, the death toll remained at 4,633. AFP has this equine report from Germany: Every morning white mare Jenny leaves her stable to stroll through her Frankfurt neighbourhood. Bringing trams to a halt and smiles to people\u2019s faces, the free-roaming horse is brightening up the coronavirus lockdown for many. \u201cEveryone else has to live with coronavirus restrictions but Jenny is as free as ever,\u201d her owner Anna Weischedel, 65, told AFP. For more than a decade Jenny has wandered solo through her local Fechenheim area, a green part of Frankfurt on the bank of the Main river. She explores the high street, trots along the tram line to a nearby field and spends hours nibbling on patches of grass. The beloved Arabian mare, already a venerable 25 years old, has always been a hit with residents. But never more so than in recent weeks. Like many countries, Germany has closed schools, playgrounds and many businesses to curb the outbreak. Though it has slowly started easing some lockdown measures, people are encouraged to limit their social interactions and keep their distance. Why is Australia\u2019s Covid commission backing a fertiliser plant as its top recovery project? When the Daily Telegraph reported last week that a fertiliser plant in Narrabri being advanced by a West Australian businessman had topped the list of the projects being promoted by the National Covid Coordination Commission, there was some surprise. Vikas Rambal and Perdaman Chemicals and Fertilisers are not exactly household names, and the controversial Narrabri coal seam gas project \u2013 which would provide the cheap gas that the fertiliser project depends on \u2013 is yet to be approved by the New South Wales government. The commission considered fertilisers to be one of the biggest opportunities, along with petrochemicals and methanol, the executive chairman of the Covid commission, Nev Power, the former Fortescue Metals chief executive, told the Telegraph. \u201cA cracking idea,\u201d the energy minister, Angus Taylor, told the Telegraph in response to Power\u2019s touting of the Perdaman project. \u201cI like to think of the other side of Covid-19 as being a gas-fired recovery,\u201d Taylor said. Just why Power has chosen to promote this project in his quest to rebuild the nation is unclear. The Guardian\u2019s Toby Helm, Robin McKie and Lin Jenkins report. Fewer than one in five of the British public believe the time is right to consider reopening schools, restaurants, pubs and stadiums. The findings, in a new poll for the Observer, suggest Boris Johnson will struggle to convince people to return their lives to normal if he tries to ease the lockdown soon. The poll by Opinium, taken between Wednesday and Friday last week, found 17% of people think the conditions have been met to consider reopening schools, against 67% who say they have not been, and that they should stay closed. Opposition to reopening restaurants and pubs \u2013 and allowing mass gatherings in sports and other stadiums to resume \u2013 is even higher. Just 11% of people think the time is right to consider reopening restaurants, while 78% are against. Only 9% believe it would be correct to consider reopening pubs, while 81% are against; 7% say it would be right to allow mass gatherings at sports events or concerts to resume, with 84% against. As warmer weather tempted New Yorkers to come out of quarantine, police dispatched 1,000 officers this weekend to enforce social distancing and a ban on congregating in public spaces, AP reports. Officers set out on foot, bicycles and cars to break up crowds and remind those enjoying the weather of public health restrictions requiring they keep 6 feet away from others. \u201cI believe with the warm weather people will come outside,\u201d Governor Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. \u201cYou cant stay indoors all the time. People will come outside and thats great, go for a walk. But respect the social distancing and wear a mask.\u201d The New York City Police Department has made 60 arrests and issued 343 summonses related to social distancing since 16 March. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea issued a stern warning after a series of clashes this week between police officers and members of Orthodox Jewish communities over social distancing. A stark example of non-compliance came Thursday when officers interrupted a crowded funeral procession in Brooklyns Borough Park neighbourhood. Video posted to social media showed officers in protective masks chasing a minivan and shouting at dozens of people marching behind the van to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. On 18 April officers passed out summonses and made arrests at a Bronx parking lot and garage where they found a makeshift nightclub featuring a pool table and bar offering hard liquor and Corona beer, and at a closed Brooklyn barbershop where more than 50 people gathered for a party featuring loud music and gambling. Two days later officers broke up a 4/20 marijuana holiday celebration staged in the vacant third floor of a building in Manhattans Chelsea neighborhood. Dozens of people, some drawn by social media hype about the party, were given summonses for trespassing. China and Australia: how a war of words over coronavirus turned to threats of a trade war Australia and China\u2019s fractious relationship scrapped its way to an unedifying new low this week, with a degenerating dispute emerging, ostensibly, from Australia\u2019s call for an international, independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic that has so far killed more than 230,000 people. But China and Australia view this inquiry \u2013 amorphous though the proposal still is \u2013 as entirely different entities. China sees Australia as frontrunning \u2013 yet again in Beijing\u2019s eyes \u2013 on an issue deliberately constructed to isolate, condemn and humiliate China. It contends the inquiry is a political witch-hunt, engineered by Washington. From Australia\u2019s perspective, the Chinese response appears a dramatic overreaction to an entirely legitimate international concern to understand the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. The response appears, to Canberra, like an attempt to deflect responsibility, or worse, to shift blame elsewhere. Relations were already deeply damaged, scarred by a succession of antagonisms that the two countries seem to find easy to accumulate, but far harder to shake: the decision of Australia to exclude Huawei from the 5G network rollout; China\u2019s continued incarceration of Australian pro-democracy writer Yang Hengjun; a dispute over the South China Sea; concerns over Chinese influence in Australian business, economics and politics; continuing allegations of espionage. As countries around the world try to figure out the best way to limit the spread of coronavirus, many are considering some form of contact tracing app. But the methods and level of privacy intrusion vary widely. Here\u2019s what we know about how apps are being rolled out in various countries. \u2018How is this possible?\u2019 Researchers grapple with Covid-19\u2019s mysterious mechanism Respiratory physician Dr David Darley says something peculiar happens to a small group of Covid-19 patients on day seven of their symptoms. \u201cUp until the end of that first week, they\u2019re stable,\u201d says Darley, a doctor with Sydney\u2019s St Vincent\u2019s Hospital. \u201cAnd then suddenly, they have this hyper-inflammatory response. The proteins involved in that inflammation start circulating in the body at high levels.\u201d In these patients, the lungs begin to struggle. Blood pressure lowers. Other organs, including the kidneys, may begin to shut down. Blood clots form throughout the body. The brain and intestines may also be affected. Some suffer changes to their personality, suggesting brain damage. Darley is one of the researchers working on a long-term St Vincent\u2019s study of patients admitted to the hospital with Covid-19. Patients will be followed for a year after being discharged, receiving tests at regular intervals to see if there are any lasting effects or changes in the body\u2019s immune system and blood. They will also be assessed for any ongoing changes to lung, gut and brain functions. No one yet knows if the virus causes permanent or long-term harm. The spread of the coronavirus in India\u2019s notoriously crowded prisons has prompted authorities to impose jail lockdowns and release thousands of pretrial detainees on parole, as health experts worry that the cramped facilities are serving as breeding grounds for the disease, PA media reports. Although there are no official numbers on how many inmates have been infected by the virus, Indias correction facilities are slowly recording more infections and have temporarily banned visitors. On Thursday, authorities locked down Nagpur Central Jail in coastal Maharashtra, among the Indian states worst hit by the pandemic. It was the eighth prison in Maharashtra to be locked down. The move came after 19 inmates in Indore Central Jail in central Madhya Pradesh state tested positive for the virus on Tuesday. Around 250 others who came in contact with them were shifted to a temporary jail. Boris Johnson has revealed that doctors prepared to announce his death as he battled coronavirus in hospital last month. The UK Prime Minister spent three nights in intensive care at St Thomas\u2019 in London with the disease. He told the Sun On Sunday: \u201cThey had a strategy to deal with a \u2018death of Stalin\u2019-type scenario. \u201cThe doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong.\u201d Mr Johnson, 55, said it was \u201chard to believe\u201d his health had deteriorated in just a few days, saying he \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t getting better\u201d. The PM told the paper the \u201cindicators kept going in the wrong direction\u201d and that he kept asking himself: \u201cHow am I going to get out of this?\u201d \u201cThe bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe. \u201cThat was when it got a bit ... they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally.\u201d He said he was \u201cin denial\u201d initially about how serious his illness was, and that doctors were right to \u201cforce\u201d him to go to hospital. After a fortnight convalescing from the virus, and just two days after he returned to work full-time, his fiancee Carrie Symonds gave birth to their son, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. YouTube has deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke\u2019s account. The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus. The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including one that it is linked to the 5G mobile network. The video service, which is owned by Google, told the BBC: \u201cYouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS. \u201cDue to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke\u2019s YouTube channel.\u201d The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, which removed Icke\u2019s page on Friday. Here is the full story on European leaders joining forces to combat Covid-19 Writing in the Independent newspaper, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and Norway and senior EU officials said the outbreak had \u201ccaused devastation and pain in all corners of the world\u201d. They said responding to the \u201cglobal challenge\u201d required \u201cbringing together the world\u2019s best \u2013 and most prepared \u2013 minds to find the vaccines, treatments and therapies we need to make our world healthy again\u201d. This would accompany \u201cstrengthening the health systems that will make them available for all, with a particular attention to Africa\u201d. The politicians declared their support for the World Health Organisation (WHO) and backed the recent launch of the \u201cAccess to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator\u201d. The \u201cglobal cooperation platform\u201d aims to accelerate research, development, access and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine and other treatments, the leaders wrote, adding that it has \u201claid the foundation for a real international alliance to fight Covid-19\u201d.
