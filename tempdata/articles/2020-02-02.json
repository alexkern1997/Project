      "bodyText": "How many people in Australia have the new coronavirus? While globally there were more than 14,000 cases of coronavirus, and more than 300 deaths as of Sunday afternoon, there are still just 12 confirmed cases of the virus in Australia \u2013 four in New South Wales, four in Victoria, two in Queensland, and two in South Australia. Health minister Greg Hunt said three of those in NSW have been discharged from hospital having been cleared. See this explainer to find out how this coronavirus spreads and how to protect yourself. What travel restrictions apply between Australia and China? On Saturday evening, prime minister Scott Morrison announced that except for Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family, legal guardians and spouses, anyone travelling from or through China to Australia will not be allowed to enter in a bid to contain coronavirus. The federal government cancelled the visas of 71 people who were attempting to fly out of China to Australia overnight, as the travel ban took effect. People on flights that were in transit when the policy change was announced were allowed to enter Australia. More than 700 people arrived in Melbourne and at least 70 in Brisbane, according to Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram. \u201cThey\u2019ve been met on those flights by biosecurity officers, and they\u2019ve been asked questions and they\u2019ve been subject to health screening, including by state and territory health officials,\u201d he said. \u201cA small number of people, as I understand it, were then taken for further screening at a hospital, but that\u2019s a handful \u2013 two or three.\u201d Twelve flights out of China to Australia have been cancelled since the travel ban was put in place. Outram said any non-citizen or non-resident who arrives in Australia having travelled through China will have their visa cancelled and they will be put into detention for the quarantine period. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said the extreme measure was taken in order to contain the spread of the virus. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to contain the spread of the virus in Australia. We don\u2019t apologise, but we do understand that this could be a significant imposition on many people.\u201d Have Australians in Hubei province been evacuated? The government is still attempting to get about 600 Australian citizens or permanent residents in the Hubei province back to Australia. They will still be taken to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period, once China has agreed to allow a flight in. An Australian medical assistance team and a mobile hospital has arrived on Christmas Island, and the flight to collect people from Wuhan is expected to leave in the next 24 hours. Hunt said it wasn\u2019t expected any of these people would have coronavirus, but the medical team was prepared for that. The airline crew that will fly in to Wuhan will not be required to be quarantined, but will be wearing face masks and gloves during the flight, and will be subject to a health screening upon arrival in Australia. Will people be charged for their evacuation? The government has backed down on plans to charge people up to $1,000 to be evacuated to Christmas Island, with treasurer Josh Frydenberg telling the ABC that the department of foreign affairs gave the government incorrect information about the charge. \u201cWe won\u2019t be charging. Those people will be able to come to Australia with no cost incurred,\u201d he said. This came despite home affairs minister Peter Dutton saying an hour earlier that people would still be charged. The government had said previous governments had charged for airlifts such as those run out of Lebanon in 2006, and Egypt in 2011. But that claim was contradicted by Julia Gillard, who was prime minister at the time, and Kevin Rudd, who was foreign minister. Is there medical advice for travel to any other country? No. Australians have been told not to travel to China, but Dutton went one step further and suggested Australians about to leave for any overseas holiday should reconsider their travel. The chief medical officer said the medical advice around travel was currently limited to China. What is the advice for students attending school or university? Prior to 1 February, students who had travelled from the Hubei province were told to stay home for a 14-day quarantine period. From 1 February, this now extends to any student who has travelled from mainland China on or since 1 February.",

Aston Martin was \u201cworth\u201d \u00a34.3bn at the time, a valuation that was rapidly revealed to be fanciful. A plan that relied on a new factory doubling total production meant that the company\u2019s chief executive, Andy Palmer, was always walking a tightrope. When sales dropped and costs kept rising, Aston Martin was left horribly exposed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/31/lawrence-stroll-f1-boss-fashion-tycoon-rescuing-aston-martin\" title=\"\">The serial fashion investor Lawrence Stroll</a>, who led the rescue consortium and will now become executive chairman, at least appears to have his heart in it, with a pledge to use the Aston Martin brand on his Formula One racing team for the next decade. </p> <p>Investors have welcomed Stroll.

The bet on an untested SUV is not a surefire winner. Nor are luxury products aimed at the rich immune from shocks. China is key for the SUV, so the coronavirus could not have come at a worse time.</p> <p>Slashing investment in zero-emissions electric battery technology will surely store up problems for the future for shareholders (not to mention the planet).</p> <p>Palmer needs the DBX launch to go to plan if the bailout is not to become his swan song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6dffd2baa0cb3849198c131f88cad277de3489bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6dffd2baa0cb3849198c131f88cad277de3489bf/710_0_3290_1974/1000.jpg\" alt=\"007 to the rescue?

The CMA has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jul/04/cma-seeks-to-find-viagogo-in-contempt-of-court\" title=\"\">fought a long-running battle with StubHub\u2019s chief rival, Viagogo</a>, which refused to change its ways until the CMA resorted to legal action.</p> <p>StubHub styles itself as the more acceptable face of ticketing. Now it has been accused by the regulator of Viagogo-style transgressions, such as selling tickets without warning buyers that they might be refused entry to events when artists have imposed prohibitions on resale. The company also allegedly misleads consumers about the scarcity of available tickets \u2013 a pressure-selling tactic.</p> <p>If both major resale sites behave like this, what hope is there of any improvement if Viagogo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/nov/29/viagogo-takeover-of-stubhub-music-industry-calls-for-watchdog-to-intervene\" title=\"\">proposed \u00a33.1bn takeover of StubHub</a> goes ahead, creating an unrivalled industry powerhouse?</p> <p>The CMA is currently weighing up whether to intervene in the British part of this tie-up on monopoly grounds. It is hard to imagine why it would allow the two major players in the UK\u2019s ticket resale market to get together, even if they had spotless records.</p> <p>While the watchdog has the power to intervene in the merger, its teeth are less sharp when it comes to consumer law. The CMA can go to court but it\u2019s a lengthy and costly process that requires a judge to make a ruling. That\u2019s why the CMA\u2019s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, used the StubHub announcement to call for the regulator to be given greater powers to determine when consumer law has been broken and to issue fines.</p> <p>Given the difficulty it has had in bringing StubHub and Viagogo to heel, it is hard to argue that the CMA should be denied more effective ways of exercising its authority.</p>",

There is one final problem: monetary union will remain half-baked without a banking union and a unified eurozone budget. Neither \u2013 largely due to German opposition \u2013 is remotely in prospect. The year ahead is going to be tough \u2013 just as tough, if not tougher, than it will be for the UK. Aston Martin pins its hopes on Bond and an SUV Aston Martin\u2019s much-hyped stock market float has ended with a humiliating bailout by a billionaire not even 18 months later. The luxury carmaker\u2019s executives, international shareholders and bankers made fortunes from the initial public offering in late 2018. Aston Martin was \u201cworth\u201d \u00a34.3bn at the time, a valuation that was rapidly revealed to be fanciful. A plan that relied on a new factory doubling total production meant that the company\u2019s chief executive, Andy Palmer, was always walking a tightrope. When sales dropped and costs kept rising, Aston Martin was left horribly exposed. The serial fashion investor Lawrence Stroll, who led the rescue consortium and will now become executive chairman, at least appears to have his heart in it, with a pledge to use the Aston Martin brand on his Formula One racing team for the next decade. Investors have welcomed Stroll. Following a cash injection to stave off bankruptcy, the shares rose 24% on Friday (though they are still just a quarter of their \u00a319 float price). With the prospect of a James Bond marketing blitz around the latest film in April \u2013 just as Aston Martin starts production of its new DBX SUV \u2013 and the stardust of Formula One, there might finally be a few reasons for cautious optimism at the company\u2019s HQ in Warwickshire. Still, there are bumps ahead. The bet on an untested SUV is not a surefire winner. Nor are luxury products aimed at the rich immune from shocks. China is key for the SUV, so the coronavirus could not have come at a worse time. Slashing investment in zero-emissions electric battery technology will surely store up problems for the future for shareholders (not to mention the planet). Palmer needs the DBX launch to go to plan if the bailout is not to become his swan song. Ticketing watchdog needs rather more bite No one familiar with \u201csecondary\u201d ticketing will have been surprised to see the ticket resale site StubHub criticised by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) for allegedly misleading consumers and potentially breaking consumer law. After all, we\u2019ve been here before. The CMA has fought a long-running battle with StubHub\u2019s chief rival, Viagogo, which refused to change its ways until the CMA resorted to legal action. StubHub styles itself as the more acceptable face of ticketing. Now it has been accused by the regulator of Viagogo-style transgressions, such as selling tickets without warning buyers that they might be refused entry to events when artists have imposed prohibitions on resale. The company also allegedly misleads consumers about the scarcity of available tickets \u2013 a pressure-selling tactic. If both major resale sites behave like this, what hope is there of any improvement if Viagogo\u2019s proposed \u00a33.1bn takeover of StubHub goes ahead, creating an unrivalled industry powerhouse? The CMA is currently weighing up whether to intervene in the British part of this tie-up on monopoly grounds. It is hard to imagine why it would allow the two major players in the UK\u2019s ticket resale market to get together, even if they had spotless records. While the watchdog has the power to intervene in the merger, its teeth are less sharp when it comes to consumer law. The CMA can go to court but it\u2019s a lengthy and costly process that requires a judge to make a ruling. That\u2019s why the CMA\u2019s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, used the StubHub announcement to call for the regulator to be given greater powers to determine when consumer law has been broken and to issue fines. Given the difficulty it has had in bringing StubHub and Viagogo to heel, it is hard to argue that the CMA should be denied more effective ways of exercising its authority.",

      "bodyText": "Australians stranded in the Chinese city of Wuhan were expected to fly out of the city on Monday morning as they make their way towards Christmas Island. There are believed to be around 600 Australian citizens and permanent residents stuck in Wuhan. The Australian government had been negotiating with the Chinese government to allow a plane to fly in and evacuate those stuck in Wuhan as the world works to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak that has now more than 14,000 confirmed cases and has killed 305 people. A Qantas 747 aircraft left Sydney early Sunday afternoon with a team of 14 Qantas cabin crew and four pilots bound for Hong Kong, and then Wuhan. It is understood the flight will be departing from Wuhan at 2am local time (5am AEDT) and will head straight to mainland Australia, where those on board will then be transported to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period. The flight could not go direct to Christmas Island because the runway on the island is not long enough for the 747. Those Qantas staff assigned to the flight volunteered, and the number of staff who volunteered exceeded the number of available positions on the flight. Passengers will be required to go through health checks before boarding, and there will be medical staff on board to assist. All crew and passengers will wear surgical masks that will be changed hourly, and crew will be given hand sanitiser. The entire upper deck of the 747 will be reserved for the Qantas crew, and there will be limited inflight food and drinks in order to limit the exposure of the crew to passengers. Speaking on Triple M radio on Friday, the Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce, said crew would lay out meals and drinks on seats before the flight departed to avoid direct contact with passengers. In normal operations, the 747-400 has 364 seats. The aircraft also uses HEPA filters in its air-conditioning, and the plane will be cleaned once it has returned to Australia. The crew will not be required to be quarantined after the flight. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said on Sunday that the measures put in place to protect the crew should be sufficient to avoid the need for quarantine. The federal government is covering the majority of the cost of the flight, and as announced on Sunday, passengers will not be expected to pay up to $1,000 for the evacuation, after the government backed down on its previous plan. On Saturday, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced anyone bar Australian citizens and permanent residents, and New Zealand visa holders, would not be allowed to travel to Australia if they are coming from, or have travelled through, China. Those who have arrived in Australia before the ban came into effect have been asked to isolate themselves for 14 days.",

The foreign secretary said the government was doing everything in its power to help Britons who wished to leave but that the process posed serious challenges. \u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to make sure that those that still want to leave, give them the opportunity to do so,\u201d he said on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show. \u201cThe challenge that we\u2019ve got, and the Chinese have got frankly, is to contain the virus but also then to lift out people that want to come back home and we\u2019re doing that as sensitively and as effectively as we can.\u201d The second group of evacuees - made up of British nationals and family members - boarded a French flight and will also be brought to Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral where they will spend 14 days in quarantine, Raab said. Mr Raab had said 11 British nationals would be returning but the Foreign Office later confirmed the group includes a mix of British nationals and some of their relatives. He said the Government is doing all it can to help Britons in Wuhan leave if they want to. Raab\u2019s comments came as the Philippines reported the first death from coronavirus outside China, where 304 have died since it was first detected, and the first people to be tested positive for the virus in the UK continue to be treated at a special unit at a hospital in Newcastle. The Department of Health on Sunday confirmed 266 tests have been carried out in the UK for coronavirus and that 264 have been confirmed negative. The UK government had been expecting that 200 people would be on Friday\u2019s chartered flight, but when it left Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, only 83 Britons were onboard.

It\u2019s a good example of how even though we leave the EU will be cooperating with our friends and partners very effectively.\u201d Asked why more people were not flown out on Friday, Raab listed some of the difficulties UK diplomats have faced negotiating with Chinese officials. He said: \u201cThe challenge has been immense. You\u2019ll know that Hubei province is nine times the size of Wales. \u201cWe had a job to do to get permissions for the charter flight going in, then the permissions to get the roadblocks eased for the UK nationals to get to the muster points. We had four coaches put on, and we delayed the original flight by three hours on the tarmac to try and make sure as many people could get out that wanted to get out.\u201d He added: \u201cAs this flight with the French shows, we will continue to work for those that didn\u2019t make the first flight to give them the cooperation, the support and reassurance that we can help them as best we can.\u201d Britons still stranded in Wuhan have said confusing messages from officials contributed to them missing Friday\u2019s evacuation flight home. Chris Hill, 38, said he had refused to board the flight back to the UK because because the Foreign Office could not confirm whether his four-year-old daughter, a Chinese national, would be allowed to join him. Hill, from Sunderland, said his wife of 11 years could not travel as she was needed to work in a hospital in Wuhan, and he could not consider leaving his family. He criticised the planning of the flight, saying he was given only seven minutes\u2019 notice to arrive at the airport. \u201cThere\u2019s no cars, there\u2019s no taxis, anything, and the FCO say, \u2018Oh we\u2019ll pick you up from Wuhan Tianhe airport but you have to make your own way there.\u2019 That gives me a very bad taste in my mouth. It\u2019s just bad planning.\u201d One British man in the city said he had been offered a place on a French evacuation flight, but told of his fears of being left stranded in the city after deciding he could not leave his wife, who is a nurse, behind when she could not get the time off work A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: \u201cThe government is in touch with British nationals who remain in Wuhan, and are doing everything we can to bring them home as safely and quickly as possible.\u201d Meanwhile, more than 240 calls have been made to a dedicated helpline in York after a student at the city\u2019s university was confirmed as having the coronavirus. The University of York set up a call centre on Saturday after confirming one of the first two confirmed UK cases of the virus was a student. In a statement on Sunday, University of York vice-chancellor Professor Charlie Jeffery and representatives from the Chinese Students and Scholars Association said the student did not attend a university Chinese New Year celebration or recent graduation ceremonies. They said as soon as the student\u2019s relative showed symptoms, they contacted emergency services and were both taken to the specialist medical facility in Newcastle, where they were diagnosed with the virus. A spokesman said the university remains open as usual and stressed that it will continue to monitor the situation. He added: \u201cWe reiterate Public Health England\u2019s assurance that the risk level to our staff and students remains low.\u201d",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Chinese police <a href=\"https://www.nchrd.org/2020/01/china-protect-human-rights-while-combatting-coronavirus-outbreak/\">punished</a> frontline doctors for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d for trying to warn the public in late December.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s central bank has pledged to pump 1.2tn yuan (\u00a3130bn) into its financial system in an attempt to protect its economy from the coronavirus epidemic. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) announced it would launch the operation on Monday, to ensure a stable currency and \u201creasonable and abundant liquidity\u201d in the banking system. Under this \u201creverse repo\u201d scheme, PBoC will purchase a range of securities from investors seeking ready cash, to avoid a wave of forced selling as investors return to work from the lunar new year break, which was extended after the coronavirus outbreak. According to Reuters\u2019 data, just over 1tn yuan of existing reverse repo contracts expire on Monday \u2013 the PBoC\u2019s move will allow these to be rolled over, plus an extra 150bn yuan (\u00a316bn) of fresh support. Over the weekend, the PBoC also announced more monetary and credit support for hospitals and medical institutions at the frontline of the battle against the Wuhan coronavirus. It urged financial institutions to provide \u201csufficient credit resources\u201d to hospitals and medical research units. Economists believe the virus will hurt the global economy in 2020. Goldman Sachs predicts it could knock Chinese growth down to 5.5% for the year, from 6.1% in 2019. Turbulence is expected on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges when they reopen on Monday. They have been shut for the holidays since 23 January, when the coronavirus crisis was intensifying. Other markets have already suffered heavy losses, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index losing 6% last week when it reopened after the new year break. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 dropped by 4% during the week, hitting a seven-week low. Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp, said the PBoC\u2019s liquidity injection went \u201cwell beyond a Band-Aid fix\u201d.

According to trading firm IG, Hong Kong is on track to fall a further 1% on Monday, while the FTSE 100 was down 0.5% in futures trading. On Friday, the US announced an entry ban on foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks, as countries around the globe evacuate their citizens from Wuhan, where the epidemic began. The death toll from the coronavirus passed 300 people on Sunday, with the first fatality outside China recorded in the Philippines.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In China, cities began to implement more extreme restrictions on residents. In Huanggang \u2013 the second most affected city after Wuhan \u2013 authorities barred residents from leaving their homes.

      "bodyText": "The Philippines has reported the first death from the coronavirus outside China, adding to fears about the spread of the virus as more countries imposed travel restrictions. The outbreak of the respiratory illness has killed 304 people in China since it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. Across China, there were 2,590 new confirmed infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 14,380, China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Sunday. A study published on Saturday by scientists from the University of Hong Kong found that the virus may have infected as many as 75,815 people in Wuhan. The virus, which has been declared a global public health emergency, has caused at least 100 infections in more than 20 countries, with Britain, Russia and Sweden confirming their first infections over the weekend. Japan has recorded 20 cases, including those involving human-to-human transmission, while the US on Sunday reported its eighth case. Japan on Saturday confirmed an additional three cases among evacuees from Wuhan, including one, a man in his 40s, who initially tested negative, the health ministry said. The fatality in the Philippines is a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan who died in a hospital in Manila. He appears to have been infected before his arrival in the Philippines. \u201cThis is the first reported death outside China,\u201d Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the World Health Organisation representative to the Philippines, said. \u201cHowever, we need to take into mind that this is not a locally acquired case. This patient came from the epicentre of this outbreak.\u201d The Philippine department of health said the man was admitted to hospital on 25 January with a fever, cough and sore throat. He developed severe pneumonia, but in the past few days, \u201cthe patient was stable and showed signs of improvement\u201d, it said. However, his condition then deteriorated and he died within 24 hours. The man was with a Chinese woman who also tested positive for the virus, health secretary Francisco Duque said. She was the Philippines\u2019 first case of the virus and is recovering in a hospital isolation ward. The news of the man\u2019s death was released shortly after the Philippines announced it would immediately halt the arrivals of any foreign travellers from China, joining several other countries that have imposed similar bans in an attempt to contain the virus. On Sunday, Indonesia also said it will temporarily stop flights to and from mainland China from Wednesday and bar visitors who have been in China for 14 days from entering or transiting. Stricter border controls, along with the suspension of flights and business operations have sparked fears of a slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-biggest economy. The US, Australia, Singapore and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China over the previous 14 days, and advised their own citizens not to travel there. Mongolia, Russia, and Nepal closed their land borders, while Papua New Guinea has banned anyone arriving from ports or airports across Asia. Other countries have imposed restrictions on people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days. Vietnam declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus epidemic on Saturday and said it would halt all flights to and from China. The government said it would also stop issuing visas for foreign visitors who had been in China in the past two weeks. On Sunday, New Zealand said it would bar entry to all foreign nationals arriving from mainland China. The ministry of foreign affairs and trade also raised its travel advice to New Zealanders for all of mainland China to \u201cDo not travel\u201d, the highest level. Confirmation of the first death outside China comes after thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted to go on strike, calling for the government to close the border with mainland China. The financial hub had 13 confirmed cases of the disease as of Saturday, with 112 patients isolated. More than 3,000 public hospital staff, including doctors and nurses, agreed to a week of phased strike action starting on Monday if the government failed to meet their demands. In China, cities began to implement more extreme restrictions on residents. In Huanggang \u2013 the second most affected city after Wuhan \u2013 authorities barred residents from leaving their homes. Families in the city, also in Hubei province, were to choose one person from their household to leave and buy food and other necessities. The city of Wenzhou in neighbouring Zhejiang province announced similar measures. In Huanggang, six officials were fired over \u201cpoor performance\u201d in handling the outbreak, the official Xinhua news agency reported. It cited the mayor as saying the city\u2019s ability to treat patients remained inadequate and that there was a severe shortage of medical supplies such as protective suits and medical masks. The situation across Hubei province remains \u201csevere and complicated\u201d and medical resources at county level are relatively weak, vice governor Xiao Juhua told a news conference on Sunday. China\u2019s military said it would send 1,400 medical personnel to Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. The personnel will staff one of two new hospitals built in the past two weeks, scheduled to open on Monday. China is facing increasing global isolation as dozens of airlines suspended flights. Some countries are still trying to evacuate hundreds of their citizens. On Sunday Australia backed down on plans to charge its evacuees $1,000 to be taken to quarantine on Christmas Island, while a plane repatriating 250 French and European nationals landed at a military airbase in Istres in southern France. The Russian military will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday, domestic media reports said. In China itself, cities and villages are becoming ghost towns, with about 50 million people in Hubei province alone under lockdown and many more living under self-imposed quarantine. In Hubei, roads have been sealed off and public transport shut down, and the province extended its Lunar New Year holiday break to 13 February. However, people are leaving Hubei on foot over a bridge spanning the Yangtze river. Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 3 February. Top stories Australians stranded in the Chinese city of Wuhan were expected to fly out of the city on Monday morning as they make their way towards Christmas Island. It is understood the flight was due to depart from Wuhan at 2am local time (5am AEDT) and would head straight to mainland Australia, where those on board will then be transported to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period. Footage of government officials in Wuhan appearing to take face masks intended for health workers battling the highly infectious coronavirus has fuelled a growing wave of anger over how Chinese authorities have handled the outbreak. It comes as the Philippines has reported the first death from the coronavirus outside China, adding to fears about the spread of the virus as more countries imposed travel restrictions. China\u2019s central bank has pledged to pump 1.2tn yuan (A$256bn) into its financial system in an attempt to protect its economy from the coronavirus epidemic. Bridget McKenzie has resigned from Scott Morrison\u2019s ministry in an effort to stem the rolling controversy and political damage over sports grants before the opening of the 2020 parliamentary session this week. The prime minister confirmed the departure of the besieged deputy leader of the Nationals late on Sunday after receiving advice from his departmental head and former chief of staff, Phil Gaetjens, and after a meeting with the governance committee of cabinet. Morrison declined to release the Gaetjens adjudication. \u201cMorrison wants this whole mess to be over with McKenzie\u2019s departure,\u201d writes Katherine Murphy. \u201cQuick prediction. This isn\u2019t over.\u201d A man has been shot dead by armed police in south London following a terrorist-related incident in which a number of people are believed to have been stabbed. The Metropolitan police confirmed the man, who was shot at about 2pm in Streatham, had been pronounced dead and added: \u201cWe believe there are two injured victims. We await updates on their conditions.\u201d They said the scene had been \u201cfully contained\u201d. The man shot dead by police was wearing a \u201cfake suicide vest\u201d made of objects designed to look like an improvised explosive device. Australia A group of 200 scientists are urging parliament to reduce Australia\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions, and work diplomatically to achieve coordinated global climate action after a catastrophic summer of bushfires. Government should abandon plans to increase employer contributions towards superannuation because new research shows about 80% of the extra money would be taken out of pay packets in the form of lower wage increases, the Grattan Institute says. The father of three of four children killed after a car crashed into them in Sydney has spoken of his devastating loss. Danny Abdallah told reporters on Sunday he was heartbroken. \u201cMy name is Daniel Abdallah, I have a wife, Leila, and six beautiful children I\u2019ve been blessed with. Yesterday, I lost three of my children,\u201d he said. The world At least 20 people have been killed in a crush during a church service at a stadium in northern Tanzania. Hundreds of people packed a stadium on Saturday evening in Moshi town, near the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, and were crushed as they rushed to get anointed with \u201cblessed oil\u201d. The looming Senate acquittal of Trump threatens to overshadow Iowa. As a growing number of Republican senators confirmed they will vote to acquit Donald Trump at the conclusion of his impeachment trial on Wednesday, the saga threatened to overshadow the first contest of the Democratic primary season in Iowa on Monday. The release of one of the most influential polls of the Democratic primary was cancelled on Saturday night, after candidate Pete Buttigieg reportedly complained that his name had been left off at least one survey. Enthusiasm would be widespread in the European Union if Scotland applied to rejoin after independence, Donald Tusk has said. The former president of the European council told the BBC he had great sympathy with the desire of many Scots to rejoin the EU after Brexit. Recommended reads In 2019 the idea of a millennial and Gen Z \u201csex recession\u201d became fact. \u201cOr it became the 2019 version of a fact: something we all (myself included) absorb after reading viral headlines on Facebook,\u201d writes Meg Watson. \u201cLast year ABC\u2019s national survey Australia Talks found that 40% of people aged 18 to 24 report \u2018never\u2019 having sex. Since then, young people have been lightly mocked on ABC TV, and in the Daily Telegraph. They\u2019ve even been made the subject of an \u2018intervention\u2019-based ad campaign for a condom company. But as clicky as that story sounds, it\u2019s not the whole truth. Instead of scolding young people for not having sex which they are in fact having, maybe we could look to them to understand the many ways that modern sex is changing.\u201d \u201cQ&amp;A succeeded because it created an opportunity that hadn\u2019t existed for ordinary Australians to challenge our politicians directly and measure their responses,\u201d writes Peter McEvoy, the program\u2019s former executive producer as part of Guardian Australia\u2019 Unforgettable Australian TV series. \u201cWe brought together Australian citizens from diverse political and cultural backgrounds to discuss the direction of the nation \u2026 After 12 years at Q&amp;A my faith in the power of reasoned discussion to change minds and build a consensus has taken a battering, but I can\u2019t identify any pathway forward that isn\u2019t built on bringing together people with divergent views to listen, debate and discuss.\u201d Listen/Watch On today\u2019s Full Story podcast, Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor explores Australia\u2019s long track record of stalling on climate change action. This summer, Scott Morrison has faced international criticism over his climate change policies. But this government is just the latest in a long line that have either failed on meaningful climate policy at home or blocked stronger climate action on the world stage. Sport Novak Djokovic has outlasted Dominic Thiem to win his eighth Australian Open crown, 6-4, 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. Kevin Mitchell writes: \u201cNovak Djokovic strolled out of Rod Laver Arena a little after midnight, the cheers \u2013 and a few jeers \u2013 behind him drifting into the cool night through the opened roof.

The Australian Financial Review warns the ASX is set to have its weakest day of 2020 as fears over economic damage caused by the coronavirus escalate. Coming up Australians trapped in the Chinese city of Wuhan due to the coronavirus will be evacuated to Christmas Island. A memorial service will be held in Sydney for John Morrison, the father of the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Follow all the Superbowl LIV action from Miami in our dedicated liveblog from 10am.
