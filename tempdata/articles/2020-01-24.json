Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hubei officials said schools, on break for the spring festival holiday, would delay the beginning of the spring term.</p> \n<p>The illnesses from the newly identified coronavirus appeared last month in Wuhan, an industrial and transportation hub in central China.

While sweeping measures are typical of China\u2019s communist government, large-scale quarantines are rare around the world, even in deadly epidemics, because of concerns about infringing on people\u2019s liberties, and the effectiveness of such measures is unclear. \u201cTo my knowledge, trying to contain a city of 11 million people is new to science,\u201d Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in China, told the Associated Press. \u201cIt has not been tried before as a public health measure.

As the death toll rose to 26, with 830 people infected, footage emerged online of quarantine measures being taken to control the virus, including barriers being erected in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/wuhan-the-city-of-11-million-at-the-heart-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">the city of Wuhan</a> where officials are racing to build a new 1,000-bed hospital. Patients have reported being turned away from overflowing medical centres and there have also been reports of hospitals running out of diagnostic testing kits. </p> \n<p>In Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/increased-likelihood-coronavirus-uk-health-secretary-matt-hancock\">14 people have been tested for the virus</a>, with five cleared, but nine are still waiting for their results. Public Health England has not given a breakdown of where the people were tested but Downing Street said four of the suspected cases in Scotland were believed to be Chinese nationals. Another patient is understood to have been tested at Belfast\u2019s Royal Victoria hospital.</p> \n<p>While the spread of the virus is dominating international news, the story is being downplayed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/chinese-state-media-downplays-coronavirus-as-xi-strikes-positive-tone\">by Chinese state media.</a> Friday\u2019s front page of the the Communist party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, led with president Xi Jinping\u2019s warm wishes for lunar new year\u2019s eve, including a picture of him attending a spring festival gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. On CCTV, prime-time news bulletins have featured the virus as the fifth or sixth item over the past two nights.</p> \n<p>You can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/live/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-china-virus-flu-scotland-testing-wuhan-live-news-updates\">follow our updates about the virus on our live blog</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>HS2\u2019s damning report</strong> \u2013 The high-speed rail project is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/24/hs2-cost-impossible-to-estimate-with-certainty-says-nao\">years behind schedule and billions of pounds over budget </a>because of failures by the government, a National Audit Office report has found. It said the risks of HS2 were not understood and that costs could escalate beyond \u00a3100bn. The NAO said it was \u201cimpossible to estimate with certainty\u201d how much the project would eventually cost. Boris Johnson is expected to make a decision within weeks on the future of the 250mph network, something he postponed in November in a move widely viewed as a means of avoiding a political landmine in the run-up to the election. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/hs2-politics-boris-johnson\">Simon Jenkins writes</a> that whatever the decision, HS2 no longer has anything to do with trains, let alone economics, politics or the north-south balance; it is about Johnson and what sort of leader he intends to be. And the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/24/hs2-high-speed-rail-europe-infrastructure-project\"> looks at how the project went so wrong</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Harry Dunn</strong>\u2013 The Home Office has described the US secretary of state\u2019s decision to reject an extradition request for the suspect charged in connection with the death of Harry Dunn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/23/harry-dunn-us-rejects-extradition-request-for-anne-sacoolas\">as a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d</a>. Anne Sacoolas, 42, was charged with causing Dunn\u2019s death by dangerous driving. She was granted diplomatic immunity after the crash and returned to the US. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Home Office said: \u201cWe are disappointed in this decision, which appears to be a denial of justice.\u201d The statement added that the Home office was \u201curgently\u201d considering its options.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump impeachment \u2013 </strong>Democratic prosecutors in Washington gave their third day of evidence against the president. Jerry Nadler told the Senate that Trump\u2019s conduct was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/23/trump-impeachment-trial-day-two-senate-democrats\"> \u201cnot America first\u201d but \u201cDonald Trump first\u201d.</a> Impeachment, he continued, is the \u201cconstitution\u2019s final answer to a president who mistakes himself for a king\u201d. Adam Schiff, who has borne much of the brunt of the president\u2019s ire over the trial, said that \u201cright matters\u201d and \u201cyou know that what [Trump] did was not right\u201d, in an increasingly restless chamber <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/23/impeachment-trial-chambers-day-three-trump\">as the Democrats methodically laid out their case</a>.

The policy will apply from March to Tesco\u2019s label products as well as from major brands such as Heinz, Green Giant, John West and Princes. \u201cWe are removing all unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic from Tesco,\u201d said chief executive Dave Lewis. Tesco said shoppers would not end up paying more because the packs would be replaced with permanent multi-buy deals on individual tins.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Slow-cook space cookies </strong>\u2013 Astronauts on the international space station have baked chocolate-chip cookies for the first time. But it wasn\u2019t a quick job: after four attempts, the right cooking time<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/space-baked-chocolate-chip-cookies\"> turned out to be a whopping two hours</a>, instead of 20 minutes for Earth-baked cookies. They cooked in a small electric oven that was sent up to the space station in November. And how did they taste? No one knows. Still sealed in individual baking pouches and packed in their spaceflight container, the cookies remain frozen in a Houston-area lab after splashing down two weeks ago in a SpaceX capsule. They were the first food baked in space from raw ingredients.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44a6d8bce0cd9b08e0a09e3009757b7b5ef9af93\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44a6d8bce0cd9b08e0a09e3009757b7b5ef9af93/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The International Space Station (ISS) commander, Luca Parmitano, and astronaut Christina Koch with milk and cookies on board the ISS\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The slow-cooked space cookies are yet to be tasted.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NASA/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: How did Isabel dos Santos become Africa\u2019s richest woman?</h2> \n<p>Dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of the former president of Angola, claims to be a self-made businesswoman but the Luanda Leaks, a cache of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits, and accounts, help explain how she actually built her business empire.

The three albums (Electric in 2013 and Super in 2016) followed a succession of releases where, as Neil Tennant puts it, they variously \u201cpretended to be a rock band\u201d (Release), \u201cmade a zany one with everything and the kitchen sink on it\u201d (Yes) and \u201cwent to LA and made an album about being old\u201d (Elysium).

      "bodyText": "Top story: death toll in China hits 26, as infections rise to 830 Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s briefing with me, Alison Rourke. China has shut down transport in 10 cities, confining at least 20 million people as it struggles to control the outbreak of the coronavirus. As the death toll rose to 26, with 830 people infected, footage emerged online of quarantine measures being taken to control the virus, including barriers being erected in the city of Wuhan where officials are racing to build a new 1,000-bed hospital. Patients have reported being turned away from overflowing medical centres and there have also been reports of hospitals running out of diagnostic testing kits. In Britain, 14 people have been tested for the virus, with five cleared, but nine are still waiting for their results. Public Health England has not given a breakdown of where the people were tested but Downing Street said four of the suspected cases in Scotland were believed to be Chinese nationals. Another patient is understood to have been tested at Belfast\u2019s Royal Victoria hospital. While the spread of the virus is dominating international news, the story is being downplayed by Chinese state media. Friday\u2019s front page of the the Communist party\u2019s People\u2019s Daily, led with president Xi Jinping\u2019s warm wishes for lunar new year\u2019s eve, including a picture of him attending a spring festival gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. On CCTV, prime-time news bulletins have featured the virus as the fifth or sixth item over the past two nights. You can follow our updates about the virus on our live blog. * * * HS2\u2019s damning report \u2013 The high-speed rail project is years behind schedule and billions of pounds over budget because of failures by the government, a National Audit Office report has found. It said the risks of HS2 were not understood and that costs could escalate beyond \u00a3100bn. The NAO said it was \u201cimpossible to estimate with certainty\u201d how much the project would eventually cost. Boris Johnson is expected to make a decision within weeks on the future of the 250mph network, something he postponed in November in a move widely viewed as a means of avoiding a political landmine in the run-up to the election. Simon Jenkins writes that whatever the decision, HS2 no longer has anything to do with trains, let alone economics, politics or the north-south balance; it is about Johnson and what sort of leader he intends to be. And the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, Gwyn Topham, looks at how the project went so wrong. * * * Harry Dunn\u2013 The Home Office has described the US secretary of state\u2019s decision to reject an extradition request for the suspect charged in connection with the death of Harry Dunn as a \u201cdenial of justice\u201d. Anne Sacoolas, 42, was charged with causing Dunn\u2019s death by dangerous driving. She was granted diplomatic immunity after the crash and returned to the US. In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Home Office said: \u201cWe are disappointed in this decision, which appears to be a denial of justice.\u201d The statement added that the Home office was \u201curgently\u201d considering its options. * * * Trump impeachment \u2013 Democratic prosecutors in Washington gave their third day of evidence against the president. Jerry Nadler told the Senate that Trump\u2019s conduct was \u201cnot America first\u201d but \u201cDonald Trump first\u201d. Impeachment, he continued, is the \u201cconstitution\u2019s final answer to a president who mistakes himself for a king\u201d. Adam Schiff, who has borne much of the brunt of the president\u2019s ire over the trial, said that \u201cright matters\u201d and \u201cyou know that what [Trump] did was not right\u201d, in an increasingly restless chamber as the Democrats methodically laid out their case. You can read today\u2019s five key impeachment trial takeaways here. The Democrats will continue tomorrow and Trump\u2019s lawyers could start their defence on Saturday. * * * Tesco \u2013 The supermarket giant will remove shrink-wrapped multipacks of baked beans, soup and tuna as part of a drive to slash its use of plastic packaging. The policy will apply from March to Tesco\u2019s label products as well as from major brands such as Heinz, Green Giant, John West and Princes. \u201cWe are removing all unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic from Tesco,\u201d said chief executive Dave Lewis. Tesco said shoppers would not end up paying more because the packs would be replaced with permanent multi-buy deals on individual tins. * * * Slow-cook space cookies \u2013 Astronauts on the international space station have baked chocolate-chip cookies for the first time. But it wasn\u2019t a quick job: after four attempts, the right cooking time turned out to be a whopping two hours, instead of 20 minutes for Earth-baked cookies. They cooked in a small electric oven that was sent up to the space station in November. And how did they taste? No one knows. Still sealed in individual baking pouches and packed in their spaceflight container, the cookies remain frozen in a Houston-area lab after splashing down two weeks ago in a SpaceX capsule. They were the first food baked in space from raw ingredients. Today in Focus podcast: How did Isabel dos Santos become Africa\u2019s richest woman? Dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of the former president of Angola, claims to be a self-made businesswoman but the Luanda Leaks, a cache of 715,000 emails, charts, contracts, audits, and accounts, help explain how she actually built her business empire. And: why are the world\u2019s oldest trees dying? Lunchtime read: How Pet Shop Boys became a curious national institution Pet Shop Boys are returning to their roots, with the release of Hotspot, their third album in a trilogy that is putting \u201celectronic purism\u201d back in the driver\u2019s seat, writes Alexis Petridis. The three albums (Electric in 2013 and Super in 2016) followed a succession of releases where, as Neil Tennant puts it, they variously \u201cpretended to be a rock band\u201d (Release), \u201cmade a zany one with everything and the kitchen sink on it\u201d (Yes) and \u201cwent to LA and made an album about being old\u201d (Elysium). Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe say they feel a little out of place in the current pop climate\u2019s obsession with authenticity and ordinariness (\u201cauthenticity is a style,\u201d notes Tennant, \u201cand it\u2019s always the same style\u201d) and its lyrical penchant for what they waspishly term \u201cnarcissistic misery\u201d. But neither man has lost their love for recording: \u201cMaking music, there is still a magic about going into a studio and finding that sort of euphoria and excitement of something new,\u201d says Tennant. \u201cIt\u2019s a supremely enjoyable and satisfying career, and, you know, you can\u2019t stop doing it.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our news story on George Soros\u2019s new initiative: The key points: George Soros is also stingingly critical of Facebook, saying the social network has not improved its behaviour. He suggests it will now work to ensure Donald Trump is re-elected in November. George Soros has outlined plans for a new higher education network, to promote his vision of an open society against the likes of populist politicals. The initiative is called \u201cThe Open Society University Network\u201d, and is being endowed with $1bn from the billionaire philanthropist. Soros tells his audience in Davos tonight that it will be an international platform for teaching and research, offering classes, and aiming to reach places in need of high quality education. That could include refugees, the Roma people and other displaced people, he adds. It sounds like a successor to his Central European University, which Soros founded in Hungary - it fled to Vienna after falling foul of prime minister Victor Orb\u00e1n. Soros says he will provide $1bn funding to get it going, but is calling on other philanthropists to help too. Soros, who turns 90 in August, says that he considers OSUM to be the most important and enduring project of his life, adding: I hope to see it implemented when I\u2019m still around. Soros is also concerned about President Xi, and his attempts to control Chinese society. With the climate crisis a growing threat too, 2020 and next few years, may determine the fate of both Xi and Trump and the whole world, he adds. George Soros says there is now a torrent of protests from people around the world against closed societies. The biggest is Hong Kong, he says, which \u201cmay well destroy the city\u2019s economic prosperity.\u201d Onto economics and markets ....Soros warns that Trump has pumped up an already overheated economy through tax cuts. That\u2019s why the markets have risen so high \u2014 high enough to guarantee Trump\u2019s re-election, Soros says, except there\u2019s still 10 months to go. Plenty of time for things to change, in a revolutionary time George Soros now turns his guns on Donald Trump, saying that the US president\u2019s \u201cimpetuous actions have heightened the risk of a conflict in thei Middle East\u201d (he\u2019s thinking of the asssasination of Qasem Soleiman) Then he really wades in: Trump is a con man and the ultimate narcissist who wants the world to revolve around him. When his dream of the presidency came true, his narcissism took on a pathalogical dimension, Soros continues. And it\u2019s now become a malignant disease, because Trump has build a following who believe him. Soros then gives a searing assessment of the global situation. The strongest powers - the U S, China and Russia - have all ended up in the hands of would-be or actual dictators. And the battle against Brexit, which will be bad for the UK and the EU, ended in \u201ca crushing defeat\u201d, Soros adds. He also criticises India\u2019s Modi for trying to create a Hindu state. Hello again. George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist is speaking at an event in Davos now. He starts by warning that open societies (Soros\u2019s big cause) is under threat, and Climate crisis is threatening our civilisation. It is easier to influence events than understand what\u2019s going on, he warns. This is leading to widespread unhappiness in the population, which populists have taken advantage of, he says. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points from another busy day here in Davos. Greta Thunberg has hit back at criticism from US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, as the climate emergency continues to dominate the World Economic Forum. Mnuchin claimed that Thunberg should go and study economics before pronouncing on fossil fuel. He also defended America\u2019s record on sustainability, hailing its private sector\u2019s work. Thunberg pointed out that you don\u2019t need a college degree to see which way the (hot, polluted) wind is blowing. Angela Merkel also hailed the contribution of young activists, as she warned that the cost of inaction would be hugely higher than the cost of action. In other news: Leading experts in viruses and infection control have warned that the Wuhan coronavirus is a global issue, as they announced new partnerships to find a vaccine. But with the virus spreading fast, experts are very concerned -- and want people to be meticulous about hand-washing and getting a flu vaccine to lower the burden on doctors. Steven Mnuchin and Microsoft\u2019s Satya Nadella wouldn\u2019t say whether they might be caught up in the WhatsApp hacking scandal suffered by Jeff Bezos. UK chancellor Sajid Javid tried to reassure businesses that Brexit won\u2019t lead to a bonfire of EU rules. At a lunch with top UK corporate leaders, he pledged: We won\u2019t diverge just for the sake of it\u201d A few photos from today: If you missed this morning\u2019s blog, here\u2019s a reminder of what Steven Mnuchin, the US treasury advisor, said about Greta Thunberg\u2019s anti-fossil fuel campaign: Is she the chief economist? Who is she, I\u2019m confused. After clarifying he was joking, he added: After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us. Here\u2019s our write-up: Just in: Greta Thunberg has responded to Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\u2019s claim that she should go and learn economics.....with a dose of climate science: The press conference ends with another reminder of the uncertainty, from Jeremy Farrar. We don\u2019t know if we\u2019re at the influenza end, or the SARS end. Influenza in 1918 had a very low mortality rate, but because it spread around the world it killed 50 million people, he explains. SARS had a 10% mortality rate, but only killed 774 people. There\u2019s so much uncertainty about the coronavirus, Jeremy Farrer of Wellcome Trust adds, and he won\u2019t get into guesswork about what the future holds. In particular, he wants to know more about exactly how the virus spreads -- how long is the incubation period, and the infection period? This will become a global issue. This isn\u2019t just a China issue, it\u2019s going to affect us all. Richard Hatchett of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) agrees. Other countries have to accept that it isn\u2019t just a China problem. Q: How can you calm people watching in China, and panicking? The message needs to come from a Chinese voice, Farrer replies. We need to trust the Chinese authorities - they\u2019re making decisions without knowing all the information. Q: What can people do to help? The importance of hand-washing can\u2019t be overstated, says Farrar, along with avoiding schools and crowded places. And he has advice for Europeans too -- go and get your flu vaccine. It\u2019s currently the flu season, so medical staff presented with a potential Wuhan coronavirus victim need to tell if it\u2019s actually coronavirus, or influenza. Hatchett agrees, and also cites the use of the \u2018elbow bump\u2019 technique instead of shaking hands. If everyone assumes responsibility for this virus, we can beat it. Jeremy Farrer is taking more questions now (I think the video feed has been cut). He explains that the transmission of Wuhan coronavirus began in the animal market, but it\u2019s now moved beyond that phase. It is now transmitting between humans. It has moved beyond Wuhan, Farrer adds. Richard Hatchett says lessons can be learned from flu -- closing schools can be very successful at slowing the spread of flu. Q: What more can the authorities in China do? Reliant on classic public health measures -- hand-washing, keeping people apart, masks, and travel restrictions. Q: Why is there such panic? The world has been getting ready for this to happen since SARS 18 years ago. When you see a virus moving from animals to humans, people will worry. Farrer then says: We want to keep a calm, moderated approach, but we need to take this incredibly seriously And he warns that a virus which spreads from animals to humans, and then between humans, and spreads by the respiratory route, is a very serious issue. It\u2019s what Richard and I, and others, have been worried about, Farrer adds. Q: What can we learn from previous outbreaks? Richard Hatchett cites the H5N1 virus, when there was no vaccine when it first appeared. That means governments had to impose non-pharmaceutical measures, such as travel restrictions, closing schools When you don\u2019t have treatment and you don\u2019t have vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions are the only thing you have got. He says there is evidence that US cities who imposed restrictions quickly back during in the influenza epidemic a century ago fared better. But those measures impose enormous cost, and cause enormous anxiety among populations. One of the three vaccines is being developed by Moderna, which uses a new class of drugs, messenger RNA Therapeutics. St\u00e9phane Bancel, its CEO, says the company is trying to develop the vaccine faster than ever before, with the US government helping with its design. Richard Hatchett announces three new partnerships to develop vaccines to combat the Wuhan Coronavirus. Our hope is to have these vaccines developed very rapidly and moved into human trials soon, maybe as soon as this summer. Q: What impact will travel restrictions have? Jeremy Farrar says the actual impact of travel restrictions is quite limited. People can evade them, or they could be allowed to travel if they are infectious with no symptoms. They can buy you some time, maybe a day a week or a few weeks. But you need to put the critical public health response into place. Travel restrictions alone will not stop the Wuhan Coronavirus spreading, Farrar adds. Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), says there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know about the Coronavirus. Many of the answers may not become available for some time. We going to have to make decisions under ambiguity and uncertainty. Farrar adds that he can\u2019t predict the future, but we should give China credit for responding and publicising the issue quickly. Q: What do we know about the Wuhan Coronavirus? Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust says the virus probably crossed the species barrier from bats to humans at an animal market in the city of Wuhan, with the first case detected in December. It can now clearly spread between humans, though coughing and sneezing. It is not SARS, but it\u2019s a similar family. It looks different -- and it finds it easier to pass between humans than SARS did, Farrar says. Farrar warns: When a virus can spread between humans easily, it is very hard to bring it under control. We can expect many more cases in China, and many more cases in the rest of the world. But the mortality rate might be lower than SARS (which had a mortality rate of 10%). WEF are holding a press conference now on the Wuhan Coronavirus. It will examine the priorities for responding to the outbreak, and lessons from previous epidemics. On the panel are: Jeremy Farrar: Director, Wellcome Trust Richard Hatchett, Chief Executive Officer, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) St\u00e9phane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer, Moderna Juliana Chan, Chief Executive Officer, Wildtype Media Group We\u2019ll bring you the key points.... Angela Merkel hails the work of the new generation of climate activists, saying; \u201cThe impatience of our young people is something that we should tap\u201d But she warns of \u201cenormous tension between the rural areas and the cities\u201d over the measures that will be needed to tackle the climate emergency. That\u2019s because infrastructure, such as public transport, is much better developed in the urban areas. And Merkel, a scientist herself, says the evidence of climate change is so clear, but... \u201cWhenever facts and emotions clash, one can always try to develop an anti-fact position.\u201d The solution is for the two sides to talk to each other, and don\u2019t stay locked in their own digital bubble. Otherwise we will be led \u201cright into catastrophe, we have to overcome this.\u201d I am totally convinced that the price of inaction will be far higher than the price of action. German chancellor Angela Merkel, a Davos regular, is now addressing the World Economic Forum. She says the world has changed a lot in the 50 years since the first Davos meeting -- Merkel never imagined in 1971 that she\u2019d be standing here today. The cold war ended 30 years ago, and the Bipolar world turned into a multipolar world. There has been major progress since - increases in per capita income, sharp declines in poverty, and major progress fighting infections diseases. Those achievements were build on countries cooperating at an international level, Merkel says pointedly. Similar cooperation is needed on climate, as we are under pressure, and we have to act, says the German leader. If the world is going to keep global warming to below 1.5 degrees C, we need to speed up. The global community has to act together, Merkel insists, adding that \u201cunfortunately not everyone is with us\u201d, but most are there. The news that Jeff Bezos has - a UN report says - been hacked via Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s WhatsApp account has caused a stir. But those who have met MBS in recent years aren\u2019t keen to discuss the issue here at Davos. US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin declined to comment on the issue, having met with the crown prince back in 2018. I caught up with Mnuchin in Davos after his morning press conference and asked whether he\u2019d ever received a WhatsApp message from MBS, and whether his phone could have been hacked. Mnuchin would only say: \u201cI only know what I\u2019ve read in the paper.\u201d Microsoft\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella, also met the crown prince in 2018. My colleague Larry Elliott caught up with him in Davos, and asked if he was concerned. Nadella said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen it. Perhaps I need to catch up and we can talk again then.\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook wouldn\u2019t talk about the issue last night either - he also met MBS during his tour of the US in 2018. Nor would Majid Al-Kasabi, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Minister of Commerce and Investment, who I tried to speak to in the hall this morning. Sajid Javid also seeks to reassure business that there won\u2019t be a bonfire of deregulation from the EU rule book after Brexit. The chancellor says: \u201cWe won\u2019t diverge just for the sake of it.\u201d UK chancellor Sajid Javid is telling UK business leaders that the UK needs a \u201ccourse correction\u201d. Speaking at the CBI\u2019s lunch in the Belvedere hotel in Davos, Javid identifies three priorities -- skills, infrastructure and fiscal responsibility. Javid says: In Britain today there are too many people who feel hopeless and let down by the way politics works. There is a sense of anger and betrayal in some communities.\u201d He adds that the problem goes back decades, to decades before financial crisis. Greta Thunberg hasn\u2019t responded to Mnuchin\u2019s comments yet -- but she will be making her case tomorrow, at a school strike here in Davos. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister has launched his own attack on the move against fossil fuels. Prince Abdulaziz Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud argued that the world still needs fossil fuels - so oil and gas need to remain part of the mix. We want to make sure that the world focuses on every sort of energy, Al Saud said, pointing to the \u2018big issue\u2019 of energy poverty. There are 2.6 billion citizens who do not have accessibility to a clean cooking fuel, mainly in Africa, Al Saud continued. He was appearing on a panel on Saudi Arabia\u2019s priorities when it takes on the G20 chair this year. But some of the climate message seems to have got through to the Saudis, with Al Saud talking about the need to mitigate emissions. \u201cWe owe it to ourselves, and the generation to come to come, that this world has to attend to all gases that cause climate change.\u201d If you\u2019re just tuning in, here\u2019s our news story on Mnuchin\u2019s dismissal of Greta Thunberg today: Newsflash: The head of the CBI is telling some of Britain\u2019s top corporate leaders that last month\u2019s general election result has lifted business uncertainty. Speaking at the CBI\u2019s annual, exclusive, lunch here in Davos\u2019s Belvedere hotel, Carolyn Fairbairn says: There is a real sense of relief that we are moving on and there is a sign of spring in our steps.\u201d French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has just been discussing the agreement with the US over the digital sales tax (our friends at France 24 tell us). Le Maire said that France\u2019s unilateral tax on US tech giants has been deferred from April (when it was due) to December. In return, the US are not imposing tariffs on EU automobiles, while talks on a multinational approach to the taxation of companies such as Facebook and Amazon are held (with the OECD playing a role). Le Maire said France has succeeded in getting all sides to talk about the issue. \u201cWe also have an aggressive tactic\u2026 and it has been efficient. We can be tough too.\u201d Without France\u2019s efforts, the issue of a digital tax \u201cwould have been buried\u201d otherwise, Le Maire claimed, adding: \u201cWe will never give up.\u201d But what about Britain\u2019s own plans for a unilateral digital sales tax, in the face of US opposition? Le Maire says it is up to the UK to decide what to do but an agreement at an OECD level would be best. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has been talking about the importance of trust in technology. Speaking here in Davos, Nadella warned: We will go backwards unless there is trust in the factor of production that is supposed to fuel the 4th Industrial Revolution. We need global norms to ensure trust in technology. Trust in tech is indeed a key issue right now, given worries over Huawei\u2019s 5G systems (which Steve Mnuchin and Sajid Javid will discuss this weekend). Microsoft faces being removed from China in 2023 as Beijing bans foreign-made tech. And Nadella says he\u2019s worried about new barriers springing up between countries. I would urge us to think about what would happen if we decouple the internet or trade. It will increase the transactional costs of our economy and we will all be worse off. Nadella also called for data and privacy needs to be thought of as a human right. Data dignity goes further than privacy, he said. People\u2019s data has a value, and we need to account for that, and control in a finer-grained way how the data is used... to create value wider society and the world, Nadella continued. Economics professor Mariana Mazzucato has heard a fine description of Davos: In other Davos news, Venezuelan politician Juan Guaid\u00f3 has called for international help to dislodge Nicolas Maduro. Juan Guaid\u00f3 told delegates that Maduro\u2019s government were a \u201ccriminal\u201d group, who needed to be removed. Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself the legitimate president a year ago, blasted Venezuela\u2019s failed economic model. But his presence here is also a reminder that his bold attempt to lead a popular uprising against Maduro has stalled. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair fears a massive refugee crisis is building. Alarmingly, the head of the World Bank hasn\u2019t even come to Davos this year. That\u2019s another indication that the US isn\u2019t stepping up to the climate challenge. My colleague Larry Elliott reports that David Malpass\u2019s absence has caused disappointment. Hopes of using Davos to forge a new international consensus to tackle poverty and the climate crisis have been thwarted by the decision of the World Bank president, David Malpass, to boycott the event. To the surprise of the other multilateral institutions, Malpass turned down his invitation to attend despite being in Europe this week for the UK government\u2019s Africa investment summit in London. In the past, World Bank presidents have played a prominent role at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, taking the opportunity to make the case for concerted action to tackle global poverty. But there may be reasons, Larry adds: Those more sympathetic to Malpass said he was a shy man who did not know how to do smalltalk and hated events such as Davos. Welcome to the club, David! Trump\u2019s cabinet also sounded upbeat about the prospects of a swift trade deal between the US and UK after Brexit. That puts the NHS in the spotlight. Wilbur Ross, the Commerce secretary, suggested that pharmaceuticals prices should be more uniform -- currently they cost a lot more in the US. But he denied that the White House plans to impose prices on the NHS: Economist Jonathan Portas isn\u2019t impressed by Mnuchin\u2019s swipe at Thunberg. After trying to clip Greta\u2019s wings, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin argued that there are no easy choices when it comes to the environment. He told reporters: When I was allowed to drive I had a Tesla. I drove in California. I liked it. But nobody focuses on how that electricity is made, and what happens to the storage and the environmental issues on all these batteries. The environmental issues are clearly complicated. Mnuchin also argues that America is taking a lead -- but through its companies. If you look at the US from a leadership standpoint - driven by private industry not governent control, we\u2019ve been a leader. And he says that people who call for fossil fuel divestment (such as Thunberg this week) should realise there are significant economic issues, and potential job losses. Many economies are transitioning to more efficient and cleaner energy. That doesn\u2019t have to be all renewables. Mnuchin adds that people who call for fossil fuel divestment should remember there are significant economic issues, issues with jobs. Many economies are transitioning to a lower-emissions economy. Eugene Scalia says that pensioners could suffer if there is a sudden divestment of fossil fuel assets. Q: Does Greta Thunberg\u2019s call for an end to fossil fuel investment threaten US economic growth? \u201cIs she the chief economist...that\u2019s a joke\u201d says Mnuchin sarcastically. After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us, he adds. Q: The UK is planning to use Huawei equipment in its 5G networks - is that sensible? Mnuchin says he\u2019ll be meeting Sajid Javid in London this weekend, when this will be discussed. Q: What\u2019s happening with the threat of tariffs on EU auto industry? Wilbur Ross says the US has not abandoned the option of imposing these tariffs, they\u2019re still available to be used if necessary. We are eager to reach a resolution with the EU, he adds. But president Trump has said the tariffs are still an option if we go down a different route. Donald Trump left Davos yesterday, but several member of his cabinet are still here - and they\u2019re holding a briefing now. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and Eugene Scalia are here. Mnuchin speaks first, outlining about how Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulations have been good for growth (this has been a regular theme from the US this week). Mnuchin adds that Trump met an enormous number of CEOs, and also held a meeting about WTO reform. On the US-French tax spat, Mnuchin confirms that presidents Trump and Mnuchin reached an agreement under which the digital sales tax will be postponed this year. We\u2019ll continue to have discussions at the OECD on the wider issue, Mnuchin adds. With a political crisis brewing in Italy, prime minister Giuseppe Conte has pulled out of Davos. Conte\u2019s coalition is looking shaky, following the resignation of foreign minister Luigi Di Maio - a move that has hurt Italian bonds: Good morning from the third day of the World Economic Forum in Davos. With barely a week until Brexit, UK chancellor Sajid Javid will attempt to reassure British business leaders as they face choppy waters ahead. Javid is speaking at the CBI\u2019s traditional lunch on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. He\u2019s expected to talk up the \u201copportunities of Brexit\u201d, saying: With the Brexit question settled, we have the chance to move forward and tackle the hard problems facing our economy. To level up and spread opportunity; to raise the potential of our country; and decarbonise our economy.\u201d Businesses are alarmed, though, by Javid\u2019s talk of diverging from the EU after Brexit. Trade tensions are also bubbling away here. France and the US have reached a temporary truce in their dispute, with Paris dropping its digital sales tax (to avoid tariffs on its car sales). Angela Merkel is speaking later, while Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 is expected to appeal for help from Davos attendees. Plus tonight we hear from billionaire philanthropist George Soros.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.

The University of Chester said it had warned its Chinese students in the UK that if they returned to their homeland they may not be readmitted without a suitable quarantine period. Universities across the UK are closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak and have followed Foreign Office advice warning people not to travel to the affected region. The vice-chancellors\u2019 group Universities UK said: \u201cEnsuring the safety and welfare of their students is a top priority for universities. UK universities have been monitoring the coronavirus situation as it unfolds and universities with students in affected areas are working to identify appropriate actions. \u201cUniversities will continue to follow the latest FCO advice and to monitor the situation, which is evolving rapidly.\u201d Chester has a China Centre based on its campus whose aim is to increase growth of trade and educational links between the UK and China. It is planning a cultural and economic exchange forum next week for people and organisations to learn more about potential business growth in China. The university\u2019s website says the event will include Chinese delegations and partners of the institution. Wuhan University, in the Chinese city where the outbreak began, has international partnerships with Aberdeen, Glasgow, Birmingham and Leeds universities and Edinburgh university has international partnerships with 42 universities across China. Meanwhile, two police stations were temporarily closed amid fears that a Chinese detainee was displaying flu-like symptoms. Avon and Somerset police said the decision to close Patchway police station, near Bristol, and Trinity Road police station in Bristol city centre on Wednesday night was taken as a precaution. The force said a man being detained had fallen ill and there were fears he may have had contact with people who had travelled from Wuhan. But following investigations it emerged the man did not have the virus. Hospitals in Wuhan have been thrown into chaos and the movement of about 20 million people has been restricted by an unprecedented and indefinite lockdown imposed to halt the spread of the deadly new coronavirus. At least 10 cities in central Hubei province have been shut down in an effort to stop the virus, which by Friday had killed 26 people across China and affected more than 800. Cases have been reported in the US, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Hong Kong. The World Health Organization described the outbreak as an emergency for China, but stopped short of declaring it to be a public health emergency of international concern. There are no known cases in the UK, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said, which was \u201cwell prepared\u201d to deal with an outbreak. Fourteen people in the UK have now been tested for the virus, according to figures released by Public Health England (PHE). Five tested negative for the virus, while nine are still awaiting results. Earlier, it emerged six people were being tested in hospitals in Scotland and Northern Ireland after showing symptoms. All the patients had been in Wuhan, which can cause lung disease such as pneumonia, first emerged, in the last 14 days. The Scottish patients all travelled from Wuhan, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and were showing symptoms of respiratory trouble \u2013 a red flag for the virus. While there remain no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Scotland, the Scottish government has set up a daily incident management team with Health Protection Scotland, to continue monitoring the situation. On Thursday night, it was confirmed that two people diagnosed with flu were being tested for the virus in Scotland. Three others were also being tested on a precautionary basis. At least three of the patients are believed to be Chinese nationals. While the Scottish government would not confirm where the patients were being treated, on Friday morning the Courier newspaper reported that two were from the Tayside region, two from Glasgow and one from Lothian. Dundee University, in Tayside, has a joint education partnership with Wuhan University: it said five members of staff had returned from a visit to Wuhan last week but that no health concerns had been raised. Aberdeen University said five of its staff members had also visited Wuhan during the outbreak, and one of those \u2013 who has a non-teaching role \u2013 was working from home as a precautionary measure. On Wednesday, PHE began carrying out enhanced monitoring of direct flights from China. On Thursday, Hancock told the Commons the UK was one of a few countries to have developed a test for the latest coronavirus, so any suspected case could be diagnosed quickly. However, the symptoms do not develop for five to seven days, and sometimes even up to 14, meaning the virus can circulate undetected. The UK has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. While the UK has put in place measures to check passengers at Heathrow airport arriving from Wuhan, the Chinese government has stopped flights out of the city. \u201cThe chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low and concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well-prepared and well-equipped to deal with them,\u201d Hancock told MPs.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. More than 800 infected and 26 dead amid coronavirus crisis At least 10 cities in central China\u2019s Hubei province have been locked down and the movement of about 33 million people restricted as Beijing seeks to slow the spread of the coronavirus that has killed 26 people and infected at least 830 more. In Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, a new, 1,000-bed hospital is being built in just six days to deal with the virus. Yet President Xi Jinping and China\u2019s state media have sought to downplay the severity of the crisis. Virus spread. The World Health Organization has called the outbreak an emergency for China, but stopped short of declaring it an international crisis. So how far has the virus spread, and how worried should the rest of the world be? Impeachment trial day three: \u2018Right is supposed to matter\u2019 Republicans apparently remained unmoved by the stirring oration of the Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, the lead prosecutor in the president\u2019s impeachment, as the Senate trial reached the end of its third day on Thursday. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t trust this president to do what\u2019s right for this country,\u201d said Schiff. \u201cYou can only trust this president to do what\u2019s right for Donald Trump.\u201d Far from riveted, senators passed notes back and forth, doodled, stifled yawns and laughter, and even twirled fidget spinners. Muzzling Bolton. Former justice department officials and legal scholars have warned that Trump\u2019s threat to assert executive privilege in blocking testimony from his former national security adviser, John Bolton, would undermine the constitution. No limits. The behaviour of GOP senators at this sham of a trial will tear up any restraints on presidential abuses of power, argues Andrew Gawthorpe. Trump administration played up wildfires to promote logging The Trump administration\u2019s political appointees at the US interior department sought to craft a narrative that played up the climate impact of California\u2019s wildfires \u2013 and played down fossil fuel emissions \u2013 in a bid to promote further logging of the nation\u2019s forests, internal emails obtained by the Guardian reveal. Experts have long refuted Trump\u2019s claim that thinning California forests by harvesting more timber would reduce the risk of fires. Australian crisis. The ongoing bushfire crisis is expected to contribute significantly to one of the largest ever annual increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Kate Lyons reports on Australia\u2019s apocalyptic weather. Floods and storms. A study has found that the climate crisis could help cause a doubling in the frequency of intense floods and storms around the world over the next 13 years. True identity of US neo-Nazi leader revealed The FBI recently carried out raids targeting the American neo-Nazi group the Base, after uncovering its members\u2019 plans to try to incite a race war in the US.

Nazzaro has billed himself online as an intelligence, military and security contractor. Previously based in New York and New Jersey, he is now thought to live in Russia with his wife. Cheat sheet The former Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra on Thursday recounted her alleged rape by Harvey Weinstein, as the first of six women set to testify at the disgraced film producer\u2019s trial in New York. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has denied the UK\u2019s extradition request for Anne Sacoolas, the American diplomat\u2019s wife accused of causing the death of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn in a road accident last August. North Korea has appointed a former army officer with a reputation for being a hardliner as its new foreign minister, suggesting Pyongyang may take a tougher stance in its nuclear talks with the US. The former PBS NewsHour host Jim Lehrer, a frequent moderator of televised presidential debates known for his thoughtful take on current events, has died aged 85.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The hospital in the Chinese capital featured individual isolation units that looked like rows of tiny cabins.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese city of Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, has begun the ambitious task of building a 1,000-bed hospital in just 10 days to treat victims of the epidemic. To speed construction, the hospital is being built with prefabricated buildings around a holiday complex originally intended for local workers, set in gardens by a lake on the outskirts of the city. Although the timescale is ambitious, China has form for constructing hospitals at short notice in response to major health crises. In 2003, during the Sars outbreak 7,000 workers in Beijing built the Xiaotangshan hospital in the northern suburbs in just a week. Wuhan authorities said the Xiaotangshan hospital, also built using prefabricated buildings, was the template for the new facility in Wuhan, being built on a 25,000 sq metre site.

The facility closed less than two months after it was judged that a decisive victory had been won against Sars in China. Building machinery, including 35 diggers and 10 bulldozers, arrived at the Wuhan site on Thursday night, with the aim of getting the new facility ready by Monday 3 February, state media reported. Earlier reports had suggested the hospital would be completed in under a week. China State Construction Engineering, one of the companies building the hospital, said on Friday it had more than 100 workers on the site. Images on state television showed a flurry of activity at the muddy site with dozens of diggers painted in various colours hard at work preparing the ground, as a stream of trucks ferried in materials and equipment. Using temporary buildings not only facilitates swift construction but it also keeps the cost down. Xinhua said the new facility was aimed at \u201calleviating the shortage of medical treatment resources and improving the ability to care for patients\u201d. Construction in Wuhan began as reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals designated for dealing with the outbreak, which has infected 830 people across China and killed 26. People who sought treatment in the city this week told the Guardian they had been turned away from hospitals, which have been inundated with patients. Facilities are reportedly running out of beds and diagnostic kits for patients who present with fever-like symptoms. At least eight hospitals in Wuhan issued public calls for donations of masks, googles, gowns and other protective medical gear, according to notices online. Administrators at Wuhan university people\u2019s hospital set up a group chat on the popular WeChat messaging app to coordinate donations. Sars, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, killed 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong in 2002-2003.",

Patients wearing masks queue for hours, waiting to be called by nurses. Staff who have worked endless shifts are forced to turn many away.

The roads are mostly deserted, and taxi drivers, fearing infection, are refusing to pick up patients from hospitals.</p> \n<p>About 10 people got off a high-speed train that pulled into Wuhan on Friday afternoon but nobody got on before it resumed its journey. \u201cI need to be with my family,\u201d said one passenger, dragging two large cases out of the station.</p> \n<p>Footage that appears to have been taken inside medical facilities, and shared on social media, shows staff unable to manage the huge influx of people.

Her mother was previously given injections at an outpatient department and sent home. Despite trying several hospitals, none were able to offer a bed.</p> \n<p>Zhang fears her father could also become ill, as he has developed a fever after visiting the hospital with her mother.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, she waited for hours to receive treatment herself, and was eventually given an anti-inflammatory injection but told supplies of cephalosporin had run out.</p> \n<p>After speaking to the head of department for infected medical staff, she was able to get a bed. \u201cI am a nurse myself, it\u2019s difficult to get myself a bed, for normal people it would be much more difficult.

Built on the site of a holiday complex once intended for local workers, it is expected to be similar to those established in Beijing in 2003, when the city faced a Sars outbreak that killed almost 800 people and reached nearly 30 countries.</p> \n<p>An article in the <a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/01/24/coronavirus-the-psychological-effects-of-quarantining-a-city/\">British Medical Journal</a> on Friday warned that the quarantine measures introduced in Wuhan and other cities are likely to substantially raise community anxiety.

      "bodyText": "In hospitals across Wuhan, the city at the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak, there is panic and despair. Patients wearing masks queue for hours, waiting to be called by nurses. Staff who have worked endless shifts are forced to turn many away. Pharmacies are running out of supplies. A lack of diagnostic tests means many people do not know for sure if their fever is the new strain of coronavirus, which has killed 26 people in China and affected more than 800. Even reaching emergency wards is a struggle, following the shutdown of public transport in the city, which has been placed in complete lockdown. The roads are mostly deserted, and taxi drivers, fearing infection, are refusing to pick up patients from hospitals. About 10 people got off a high-speed train that pulled into Wuhan on Friday afternoon but nobody got on before it resumed its journey. \u201cI need to be with my family,\u201d said one passenger, dragging two large cases out of the station. Footage that appears to have been taken inside medical facilities, and shared on social media, shows staff unable to manage the huge influx of people. In one clip, a patient lies on the floor of a crowded room, apparently having fainted. In another, a woman wearing a face mask cries out for help, saying: \u201cI have a fever.\u201d It is not possible to verify the videos. \u201cPatients are all anxious and worried,\u201d said Ms Zhang, a nurse in Wuhan, who is pregnant, and who is herself receiving treatment for a low fever. Her elderly mother is believed by doctors to have the new coronavirus, but she has not been given a diagnostic test. Her mother was previously given injections at an outpatient department and sent home. Despite trying several hospitals, none were able to offer a bed. Zhang fears her father could also become ill, as he has developed a fever after visiting the hospital with her mother. On Thursday, she waited for hours to receive treatment herself, and was eventually given an anti-inflammatory injection but told supplies of cephalosporin had run out. After speaking to the head of department for infected medical staff, she was able to get a bed. \u201cI am a nurse myself, it\u2019s difficult to get myself a bed, for normal people it would be much more difficult. The situation is the same in other hospitals in Wuhan, I heard from friends and relatives who are working in other hospitals here,\u201d she said. On the outskirts of Wuhan, diggers and bulldozers have begun work to build a new 1,000-bed hospital, which is due to open within days. Built on the site of a holiday complex once intended for local workers, it is expected to be similar to those established in Beijing in 2003, when the city faced a Sars outbreak that killed almost 800 people and reached nearly 30 countries. An article in the British Medical Journal on Friday warned that the quarantine measures introduced in Wuhan and other cities are likely to substantially raise community anxiety. This could lead to a surge in patients referred to as the \u201cworried well\u201d, as well as stigma for those inside the cordon, it said. Mr Huang, an architect, said his sister-in-law in Wuhan, who has had symptoms, struggled to get a diagnostic test \u2013 but eventually had one this week and got the all-clear. \u201cOnly when you are being isolated, and have severe symptoms, there will be a chance you can be tested,\u201d he said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough beds in hospitals.\u201d Another resident, who is British, told the Guardian he and his friends would be reluctant to go to hospital unless they were certain they had the disease. \u201cIt\u2019s the number one place to catch it,\u201d he said. Healthcare staff are working flat out to try to treat patients, said Zhang. All staff have cancelled their spring break, she said, and are taking extended shifts. In one video shared widely online, the strain placed on medical staff is clear. A doctor wearing a mask and protective googles, believed to be from Wuhan, can be seen breaking down as he speaks on the phone. \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t want to go home? Do you think I don\u2019t want to celebrate Chinese new year? \u2026 We are transferred to work in fever clinic, you think we don\u2019t care about our own safety?\u201d he says, as a colleague, also in protective equipment, tries to console him.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hope was discharged on Thursday night after test results showed he indeed had the flu.

Hope was raced to hospital with the sirens on. \u201cThey put this nebuliser on me and I was sat in the back of this ambulance with the \u2018spacemen\u2019 and steam coming out of my face as we zoomed through the city,\u201d he said. On arrival, Hope was met by another medic in protective clothing and taken to an air-locked isolation unit where he met a consultant. He remained quarantined in the room for the next 28 hours with samples of his blood, urine and phlegm being taken. \u201cThey would come in through one sealed door and leave through another. Every time they left they had to dispose of their clothing. It was a typical hospital room but I was in complete isolation. This guy came in with a chocolate mousse but he was in the full gear \u2013 it was so strange,\u201d he said. \u201cI was worried but I just tried to stay calm and focus on the fact that it was probably just flu and not the virus.\u201d Hope was discharged on Thursday night after test results showed he indeed had the flu. Having returned home, Hope says he is concerned about the friends he left behind in the capital of Hubei province. \u201cI am worried about the people in Wuhan and my friends who are still out there. They are just being told to stay in their houses and they can\u2019t leave.\u201d Hope first heard about the illness when he returned to China on New Year\u2019s Day following a Christmas break in the UK. \u201cMy friend said to me that there had been an illness in the market and that seven people were ill but it was just a passing comment and I forgot about it,\u201d he said. As the days wore on Hope started to notice a change. \u201cI got the sense that something was beginning to happen \u2013 the atmosphere had got stranger. My Mandarin isn\u2019t great but I started to notice more and more people wearing masks and so I decided to book a last-minute flight and leave,\u201d he said. Hope got the train to Shanghai the next day to catch his flight to Heathrow. He said he now realised he made a wise choice, with the city of 11 million in complete lockdown. \u201cWhen I arrived in Shanghai I knew I\u2019d made the right decision as there were just thousands and thousands of people in masks \u2013 I knew it was really bad then.\u201d Hope said he was not screened on his return to the UK on Sunday, having travelled for more than 40 hours from Hubei province, where he taught at an international school, to his home in Newcastle. \u201cI didn\u2019t get checked at all because my flight was from Shanghai, but there must be lots of people like me who have come from Wuhan but travelled from different airports in China. It is really worrying.\u201d For now, Hope is concentrating on recovering from what is, at least, not as serious an ailment as it might have been. \u201cI have had a rough few days,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the NHS seem very prepared. They have done the utmost to create a calm environment in quite an intense situation. Everyone at the hospital was amazing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Health officials have teamed up with Border Force agents and airlines to try to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the Chinese province at the centre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak. So far, tests on 14 people in the UK have come back negative as the government seeks to calm concerns over the spread of the virus. The announcement from the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, came as minsters convened for crisis talks during an emergency Cobra meeting. Chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, it was called to ensure appropriate measures were in place to deal with the virus if it does spread to Britain. However Whitty said that the threat of the virus entering the UK has not been totally eradicated as medics were still waiting for the results of checks on several other people. Samples of between 10 and 20 other suspected carriers of the virus are being analysed, the Guardian understands. On Friday night the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three instances of the virus. All had visited China. UK government officials are systematically working through every passenger who has arrived from Wuhan over the past 14 days \u2013 the incubation period for the virus \u2013 and checking up on their health. The complex task involves cooperation between airlines, the Department of Health and the Border Force: and the most recent arrivals will be checked first. While the government emphasised that the risk to the public was limited Prof Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director at Public Health England (PHE), said it was still \u201cearly days\u201d in the course of the virus, and that it is \u201chighly likely\u201d that cases would be seen in the UK. But he stressed that most of those affected abroad are making a good recovery. In an earlier interview with the Today programme, Cosford said that contingency plans were ready should cases be detected. \u201cI think it\u2019s highly likely that we will have cases in the UK, and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one,\u201d he said. Some public health experts privately fear that the public is at risk of becoming unduly worried about the virus and believe that the government or PHE should take steps to provide reassurance. There is also concern that some media outlets are exaggerating the risk posed by Chinese students. From Saturday the Department of Health and Social Care will publish figures every day for the number of suspected cases across the UK. But if a positive case is identified, the chief medical officer of whichever of the four home nations it emerges in will make that announcement. The Scottish government confirmed later on Friday afternoon that results for two of the five patients in Scotland tested for Coronavirus have come back negative, while it was understood that another patient was tested at Belfast\u2019s Royal Victoria hospital. Two of those tested in Scotland had been diagnosed with flu after travelling to Wuhan in China \u2013 the origin of the global outbreak. Downing Street said four out of five suspected cases in Scotland were believed to involve Chinese nationals.

An analysis posted online on Friday by scientists from Lancaster University, puts R0 for the new coronavirus at 3.8 and estimates that should the epidemic continue unabated, there could be 191,529 infections by 4 February. The paper also suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China. In the UK universities began taking measures to stop the spread of the virus warning students considering travelling home to China to celebrate Chinese new year that they risk being quarantined on their return. Medical experts also remained at every UK airport with information on the virus being given to passengers returning from China. Elsewhere, private schools were also gearing with contingency plans for overseas pupils who were unable or unwilling to return home for upcoming holidays. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country. While there is \u201cno immediate cause for concern\u201d the situation needs to be closely monitored, independent school groups said, adding that schools should \u201cerr on the side of caution\u201d to minimise risks to staff and students. This came as a British grandmother, Veronica Theobald, told how she was trapped in Wuhan and had been unable to return home. The 81-year-old from Lancaster, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, had not been able to go outside for more than a week for fear of falling ill. Her grandson, Kharn Lambert, who has lived in the city for five years, said she was due to fly back to the UK on Monday. However, her return was cancelled after the city was placed on lockdown.

      "bodyText": "Instead of a summary, treat yourselves to Larry Elliott\u2019s roundup of what we learned at Davos, including a rather sweet anecdote about Sajid Javid at WEF. Goodnight! Here\u2019s our news story on the clash between Christine Lagarde and Steven Mnuchin at the final WEF session: WEF is over! We\u2019re clearing out of Davos -- I\u2019ll try to post a round-up, or more news, if I can.... If not, thanks very much for reading our coverage from the World Economic Forum. There are some small signs of progress at least - even if things aren\u2019t moving as fast as needed. At today\u2019s press conference Isabelle Axelsson said climate activists had been taken more seriously this year than before \u201cI don\u2019t know how they evaluate what we say, hopefully they listen, but generally I do think they dismiss us because of our age.\u201d Axelsson added that there is too much media attention on the climate strikers: \u201cWe need the focus to be on the science.\u201d Noted! In that spirit, here\u2019s a new scientific study warning that the climate emergency will create a lot more weather disasters. Here are the five climate activists who spoke to reporters in Davos today about the climate emergency. From left to right, we have Vanessa Nakate, Luisa Neubauer, Greta Thunberg, Isabelle Axelsson and Loukina Tille: Elsewhere in Davos, former US vice-president Al Gore has hit out at \u201ccheap, destructive, extractive, exploitive business models\u201d. In a discussion about tackling plastic waste, Gore says that some firms as using \u201cdestructive practices that take advantage of the global commons\u201d.... Here\u2019s a clip of Greta Thunberg criticising world and business leaders for their lack of action.... although she expected nothing less. And here\u2019s a video clip of today\u2019s climate activists marching through Davos: The \u201cFridays For Future\u201d protests are now taking place outside the World Economic Forum in Davos. Reminder - if you missed the press conference with Greta Thunberg and fellow activists today you can watch a recording at the top of this blog. IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva cautions that the measures needed to tackle the climate emergency means that some industries will be less profitable in the future. Christine Lagarde says the key to mobilising action is to remember the old advertising maxim: There are three things that make people move -- sex, fear and greed. She\u2019s not going to address the first (this is a family liveblog, Christine), but the other two can drive action. Lagarde talks about need to price the cost of transitioning to a low carbon economy. If we do that, and we have pressure -- voluntary or no so -voluntary - we can get companies to move faster, she says. Mnuchin, though, disputes whether green measures can really be priced. We don\u2019t know how to price the risk of climate change, so we\u2019re over-estimating the cost, he claims. If you want to introduce a carbon tax, then \u201cgo ahead\u201d adds the Treasury secretary, adding that a carbon tax is \u201ca tax on hard-working people\u201d. The panel moves onto climate... and Steve Mnuchin says it is only one of several important issues. He cites health (topical, given the coronavirus crisis) and the Middle East -- Iran can\u2019t be allowed to get a nuclear weapon, he insists. Mnuchin says Donald Trump does care about clean air and water. He left the Paris Agreement because he felt it wasn\u2019t fair. There\u2019s way too many people in the developing world who do not have access to electricity. As much as we want to talk about the environmental issues ...we need to work very hard to create an environment for these people where they have better lives. Germany\u2019s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, tells Davos that his country won\u2019t take an economic hit from Brexit. It will be harder for the UK, though, Scholz warns -- warning that the City of London will be less important after Brexit. It will still be important, but the situation will be different, he says. Speaking on today\u2019s panel on the global economic outlook, Scholz warns that a country simply cannot have all the advantages of being a member of the EU while also enjoying the advantage of being outside as well. I think we will find solutions, Scholz continues, but he adds that there might not be a \u201cspecial, competitive advantage of being outside\u201d the EU. On trade, Steve Mnuchin says the UK will be at the top of the list for a free trade deal, after Brexit. Asked about the United States\u2019 trade deal plan this year, the Treasury Secretary: We\u2019ve already started the conversions with the EU. We look forward to making progress with them. On the UK, the president has been clear going back to the election that the UK is our number one ally and will be at the top of the list of trade agreements. We look forward to getting that done this year. We\u2019re encouraged. We know they also have to get a deal with the EU. ECB chief Christine Lagarde fears that Europe faces a Brexit \u201ccliff edge\u201d at the end of this year. She tells Davos that there some positive signs surrounding the global economy - with employment very low, and trade tensions easing. But the negotiations over Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU is a concern. Lagarde says: Brexit is a little bit less uncertain, but we still have that possible cliff edge in December of 2020. We don\u2019t\u2019 know exactly what the trade relationship will be. And it\u2019s a big partner for the euro area, so that\u2019s certainly a question mark. Earlier this week, UK chancellor Sajid Javid told the World Economic Forum that a comprehensive deal can be reached by December. But it\u2019s going to be tough. Yesterday, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte told Ed Conway of Sky News it was a 50:50 chance..... US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who took that nasty potshot at Thunberg yesterday, has told Davos that US government spending needs to be reined in. We look at a very robust economic outcome through 2020, Mnuchin predicted. He\u2019s sitting alongside Zhu Min, Olaf Scholz, Kristalina Georgieva, Haruhiko Kuroda, and Christine Lagarde here at WEF. Mnuchin adds that \u201cfiscal policy has worked\u201d, and predicts that Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts will pay for themselves over 10 years (some economists disagree about this, but we\u2019ll see). But looking ahead, Mnuchin says \u201cwe need to slow down the rate of growth of government spending, and lower it as a ratio basis.\u201d That might worry Americans who depend on welfare, for example. Back in the Davos congress hall, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva is talking about the global economy. She has a positive-ish message, saying: We are in a better place in January 2020 than we were in October 2019. There are three reasons: Trade tensions are receding - the signing of the US-China trade deal has raised confidence Central banks have \u2018served the world well\u2019; 49 central banks have cut interest rates 71 times The slump in manufacturing and industrial production seems to be bottoming out That\u2019s why the IMF has raised its growth forecast for 2020 to 3.3% from 3.1%. But that is still \u201csluggish\u201d, Georgieva cautions. The IM wants to see more aggressive fiscal policy, and structural reforms to create dynamism. Greta Thunberg, and her fellow activists are now going to march down the icy pavements of Davos, to conduct their regular School Strike for the climate emergency. That will allow them to lobby Davos delegates as they leave WEF and head for the railway station (although the global elite typically travel by chauffeur-driven cars). Luisa Neubauer says there is \u201cless climate denial, but more climate action denial.\u201d (hardly progress!) There is no point waiting for the crisis to come up before acting - the crisis is here now. Neubauer reiterates that she met with Siemens CEO Joe Kaiser at Davos this week, to pressure him to ditch the Adani coalmine contract (to provide rail signalling technology). We had a very good discussion here at Davos, so the dialogue is still going on. She then urges all investors, and all companies responsible for making fossil fuel projects, to heed the crisis. Our message to Joe Kaiser, and other business leaders, is that if you add up all the contracts that have been signed today on fossil fuel projects, we will be far beyond keeping temperature rises below two degrees C, she says. Neubauer says: Some, or all, of those projects need to be cancelled if we are to achieve the Paris Agreement goals. This is not a radical demand, this is a rational demand. Vanessa Nakate says she believes the leaders at Davos have heard the message from climate activists - but they\u2019re choosing to ignore it. Nakate also explains how social media has helped the climate activist movement -- by letting her get her message out across Uganda. Climate activists will continue to lobby Siemens over its involvement in the Adani coalmine in Australia, says Luisa Neubauer. Neubauer says activists have met with Siemens CEO Joe Kaiser, and explained why the mine will threaten any hopes of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees. We plan to speak at the Siemens AGM in February, Neubauer says. Kaiser has written about the struggle he had about whether to pull out of the project, before deciding not to (a good example of the problem) Q: How do you move the Davos community on, to a low-carbon future? Isabelle Axelsson says it shouldn\u2019t be up to the climate activists to find the solutions. Politicians need to listen to the science, get a plan down on paper, and implement it, she says. Q: The climate emergency isn\u2019t a big issue to India - what\u2019s your message to them, Greta? My message to India is the same as to every other country, she replies. We need to listen to the science, and we need to treat this crisis as the crisis it is. Q: How did it feel to be publicly insulted by the US president, and the US treasury secretary yesterday? Greta Thunberg replies that it had \u201cof course, no effect\u201d. Climate activists are used to such comments, she adds: We are being criticised like that all the time. If we cared about that, we wouldn\u2019t be able to do what we do. Greta Thunberg has said that the World Economic Forum has completely ignored the climate movement\u2019s demands (on fossil fuel divestment) this week. As long as we do not treat this crisis as a crisis, and as long as the facts are ignored, we will not solve this crisis,Thunberg says. We need to understand the urgency of this situation, she insists, adding: Our demands have been completely ignored, and we expected nothing less. As long as the science is being ignored, and as long as the facts are not being taken into account, leaders can continue to ignore the situation, Thunberg continues. Back in Davos, activist Isabelle Axelsson from Sweden is speaking about the climate emergency. We cannot rely on technologies that do not exist, she says (ie, world and business leaders can\u2019t assume that something will turn up to tackle rising emissions). Vanessa Nakate from Uganda says we need to look at climate justice - because we all have a story to tell about how the impact of the changing climate is affecting communities. Nakate has been camping with other activists in tents in the Arctic base camp in Davos this week - this shows we have left our comfort zones, she explains. Some instant reaction to the PMIs: Newsflash: The UK economy has returned to growth this month. That\u2019s a sign that confidence is rising following December\u2019s election, making an interest rate cut next week less likely. Markit\u2019s flash PMI, which tracks activity across the economy, has risen to 52.4, which shows growth. That\u2019s up from 49.3 in December, which signalled a contraction. Meanwhile in the markets, excitement is building ahead of the UK Purchasing Managers\u2019 survey of the British economy this month.... Greta Thunberg is giving a press conference shortly in Davos, along with fellow youth climate activists from the Fridays For Future campaign. She\u2019s joined by Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, Loukina Tille from Switzerland, Luisa Neubauer from Germany and Isabelle Axelsson from Sweden. The head of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, has a word of warning for the markets this morning: She\u2019s told Bloomberg that investors shouldn\u2019t assume that current monetary policy is locked in for the foreseeable future just because officials are focused on reviewing their strategy: She told Bloomberg TV: \u201cTo those who think it\u2019s on autopilot, that\u2019s ridiculous.... Let\u2019s look at the facts. Let\u2019s look at how the economy evolves\u201d Good morning from Davos, where the final day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway. The annual shindig of the global elite, and some of their sternest critics, is wrapping up at lunchtime today. Out on the streets, some of the corporations who took over Davos\u2019s promenade are packing up, taking down their glossy posters. But it\u2019s not back to normal yet. Inside the Congress Hall, we\u2019ll hear an update on the state of the world economy. On the panel: Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, German finance minister Olaf Scholz, IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, Bank of Japan chief Haruhiko Kuroda and ECB chief Christine Lagarde. And outside the hall, Greta Thunberg (who Mnuchin thinks should go and learn economics) will be holding a school strike to focus attention on the climate emergency. We\u2019ll also get a new healthcheck on the UK economy today, when Markit\u2019s survey of purchasing managers\u2019 is released. It will measure how businesses are faring this month, and whether there\u2019s really a Boris Bounce taking place after the election. If not, then a weak reading raises the chances of a UK rate cut next week. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of Swissquote Bank says: Today\u2019s data will give a first indication about the health of the British economy having found a certain political stability amid Johnson\u2019s solid victory in December and a way to move out of the European Union avoiding the much-feared no-deal scenario. A strong PMI read could tune down the rate cut expectations that spiked from nearly zero to 60% for the Bank of England\u2019s January meeting. Any disappointment, on the other hand, should further revive the BoE doves and pave the way for the pound to slide below $1.30 before next week\u2019s monetary policy meeting.

Scientists around the world are trying to establish how many people, on average, each infected person will pass the virus on to, a number known as R0 in epidemiology. If this number is more than one, an epidemic will grow and if less than one it will fizzle out. </p> \n  <p>An analysis <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1\">posted online on Friday</a> by scientists from Lancaster University puts R0 for the new coronavirus at 3.8 and estimates that should the epidemic continue unabated, there could be 191,529 infections by 4 February.</p> \n  <p>The paper also suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China. The analysis assumes that only 5% of infections in Wuhan have been identified, which would imply a far larger pool of people whose symptoms have been mild and who have not attended hospital. So while more people may have been infected than initially thought, on the positive side, it would imply that the majority of infections do not cause severe symptoms.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-24T16:38:09.612Z\">at 4.38pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2b12508f08e97ed2129bd6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-24T15:54:47.037Z\">3.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Chinese state television\u2019s traditional lunar new year extravaganza on Friday paid tribute to the people of Wuhan and to medical staff fighting the coronavirus crisis, urging them on to victory in the battle to defeat the outbreak, Reuters reports. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Traditionally, hundreds of millions of people gather around their televisions to watch the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, a more-than-four-hour showcase of skits, music and dance that has been a TV staple since the first edition was broadcast in 1983.</p> \n   <p>This year an extra segment was added at the last minute to what is normally a carefully planned show, slotted in early in the broadcast.

They include:</p> \n  <p><strong>What is Wuhan novel coronavirus and should I be concerned?</strong></p> \n  <p>A coronavirus is a type of virus. As a group, coronaviruses are common across the world.</p> \n  <p>Typical symptoms of coronavirus include fever and a cough that may progress to a severe pneumonia causing shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. No confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus have been detected in the UK and we currently consider the risk to the UK population to be low.</p> \n  <p><strong>How do we decide the risk level?</strong></p> \n  <p>Several factors are taken into account to determine the risk level including the number of cases, the speed at which new cases are being identified and other information about the virus such as how easily it spreads from person to person.</p> \n  <p><strong>Can we stop the virus coming to the UK?</strong></p> \n  <p>No system of checks can claim to offer absolute protection because of the incubation period of the virus. Some people might only show symptoms 14 days after exposure to an infected person. Our approach to enhanced monitoring helps us ensure that travellers from Wuhan get the right information about what to do if they become unwell.</p> \n  <p><strong>Why are we not monitoring all flights from China? And, what about people who have transferred from other flights?</strong></p> \n  <p>Plans are in place to meet any direct flights from Wuhan as experts believe this is the source of the virus. However, the enhanced monitoring of direct flights will be kept under continuous review and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"603a00c901c12b0c2986e8e5ecac6b17e94a073d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/603a00c901c12b0c2986e8e5ecac6b17e94a073d/0_175_5282_3171/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A passenger wearing a mask arrives at Heathrow\u2019s terminal 4 on Wednesday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A passenger wearing a mask arrives at Heathrow\u2019s terminal 4 on Wednesday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-24T10:56:27.133Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2abe608f08a6950eb480fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-24T09:56:47.909Z\">9.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Beijing\u2019s city government is urging people who return to the Chinese capital from areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak to stay at home for 14 days, according to local reports.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, sections of China\u2019s Great Wall near Beijing will be closed to visitors from Saturday.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-24T10:56:52.309Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2abd3c8f0879d539efe34f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-24T09:51:17.527Z\">9.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Tributes have been paid to one of the WHO\u2019s executive directors, Dr Peter Salama, who has died.

there could be a mild case.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In addition, the screening will only catch people already showing symptoms.</p> \n  <p>Dr Nathalie MacDermott, NIHR academic clinical lecturer, King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cIt is wise to implement checks at this stage given the evidence on increasing spread of the virus to other countries and across continents, but largely for the purpose of being in contact with travellers from affected regions in case they become unwell.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf they were to be unwell at the airport or become unwell in the future it will allow more prompt isolation and testing of the patient, with appropriate tracing of any people the patient may have been in contact with.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis will hopefully limit the amount of people the person may have contact with while unwell and so limit the spread of the virus.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2a2a8f8f08a6950eb47d59\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T23:25:00.111Z\">11.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Japan confirms country\u2019s second case of coronavirus strain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Japan\u2019s health ministry said it had confirmed the country\u2019s second case of a novel coronavirus strain in a man who travelled from Wuhan.</p> \n  <p>In a statement, the ministry said the man in his 40s was a resident of the Chinese city where the outbreak began and arrived in Japan on January 19.</p> \n  <p>He reported having had a fever for several days before his arrival but said his condition had stabilised by the time of his arrival in Japan.</p> \n  <p>On January 22, he reported a fever and he is now in a Tokyo hospital receiving treatment, the ministry said.</p> \n  <p>The statement added the man denied having visited the market in Wuhan identified as the source of the outbreak and said he had worn a medical mask while travelling.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2a24d38f08e97ed21293c7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T22:58:41.623Z\">10.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Fourteen people in the UK tested for coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Fourteen people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, Public Health England said.</p> \n  <p>Five people tested negative and nine are still awaiting the results.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e2a245e8f0879d539efdf9e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T22:56:10.673Z\">10.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A person in Australia has been quarantined and will undergo testing after being suspected of contracting the coronavirus, according to reports.</p> \n  <p>The person was placed into quarantine in an unnamed hospital and will have tests on Friday, a <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/person-quarantined-in-sydney-hospital-for-testing-over-suspected-case-of-coronavirus/news-story/9374f319a8d06e7920b6024942046a7b\">New South Wales Ministry of Health spokesperson told news.com.au.</a></p> \n  <p>The individual arrived on a flight to Sydney.

People were being isolated while they received treatment. </p> \n  <p>Most of the cases were of workers, handlers or frequent visitors to one food market in Wuhan city, the Huanan South China Seafood Market. On 11 January, the disease claimed its first victim, a 61-year-old man who was a regular buyer at the Huanan market. </p> \n  <p>As alarm spread, the World Health Organization said a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly outbreaks of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) could be the cause of the outbreak. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Sars. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes Mers are far more severe</p> \n  <p>The outbreak came at a particularly mobile time for Chinese people, with millions on the move to be with loved ones for the lunar new year, so it was inevitable that the virus would spread. The first case outside China was detected in Thailand on 14 January, in a woman who had travelled to the country from China. Japan confirmed its first case two days later, but as recently as last weekend \u2013 and despite a second death in China from the virus \u2013 no screening was taking place in airports in the UK or Australia. </p> \n  <p>On Tuesday US and Australian health officials announced their first domestic cases, at the same time as Chinese doctors confirmed human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus and airports around the world began introducing screening checks for visitors from affected regions. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T17:15:37.968Z\">at 5.15pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e29bce68f08a6950eb47892\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-23T15:36:20.709Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>At first minister\u2019s questions this morning, Nicola Sturgeon gave assurances that the Scottish government and its health protection agency were closely monitoring the situation.

      "bodyText": "The number of people infected by coronavirus in China has risen to 830 with 26 having died. Wuhan, the Chinese centre of the outbreak, has begun building a 1,000-bed hospital scheduled to be completed in just six days to treat victims of the epidemic amid concerns about shortages of beds and equipment. Wuhan has been eerily quiet despite the impending lunar new year after the city was effectively placed in quarantine. Tests on 14 people in the UK have come back negative but checks are being carried out on others. After the Cobra emergency committee met to discuss the threat to the UK, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, stressed that the risk to the public is low. Public Health England echoed the assessment while saying it was likely cases would emerge in the UK. The second confirmed case has been identified in the US, in the city of Chicago. The patient, a woman in her 60s had returned from Wuhan on 13 January and was tested after exhibiting symptoms. She is said to be in a stable condition. She has had limited contact with others since returning to the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but people she has had contact with are being monitored. There have been calls for a worldwide ban on wild animal markets by experts who says the sale of sometimes endangered species for human consumption is the cause both of the new coronavirus outbreak and other past epidemics. The Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which has been closed down as the source of the infection, had a wild animal section, where live and slaughtered species were on sale. The Scottish government confirmed on Friday afternoon that results for two of the five patients in Scotland tested for coronavirus had come back negative. Emphasising that the risk to the public remained low, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, said: Scotland is well prepared for these types of outbreaks \u2013 we have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and the UK was one of the first countries in the world to develop a test for the new virus. I am being kept fully informed about the precautionary steps being taken, including timely updates on the patients who are currently being tested. Three more cases have been confirmed in Hong Kong, according to AFP\u2019s correspondent there. Here are some details of what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is saying about the second case of coronavirus identified in the United States. The patient returned to the US from Wuhan on 13 January 2020, and called a healthcare provider after experiencing symptoms a few days later. The patient was admitted to a hospital, where infection control measures were taken to reduce the risk of transmission to other individuals. The patient remains hospitalised in an isolation room in stable condition and is doing well. Based on the patient\u2019s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected 2019-nCoV. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC, where laboratory testing confirmed the infection. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) are investigating locations where this patient went after returning to Illinois and are identifying any close contacts who were possibly exposed. The patient has limited close contacts, all of whom are currently well and who will be monitored for symptoms. Since returning from China, the patient has had very limited movement outside the home. The CDC added that while it considered coronavirus \u201ca serious public health threat\u201d the immediate health risk to the US public was considered low. The BMJ (British Medical Journal) has an article about the psychological effects of quarantining a city, in response to the lockdown affecting more than 20 million people in China. It says: While history reminds us that outright panic is unlikely, fear seems more certain as a consequence of mass quarantine. Anxiety within Wuhan is to be expected even without quarantine. During disease outbreaks, community anxiety can rise following the first death, increased media reporting and an escalating number of new cases. Mass quarantine is likely to raise that substantially, for multiple reasons. It says elevated anxiety may lead to a surge in patients referred to as the \u201cworried well\u201d and that stigma may affect those on the inside of the cordon. Previous incidents have seen residents of affected areas socially shunned, discriminated against in the workplace and their property attacked. Unless active steps are taken to prevent this, the official imposition of a cordon may aggravate such effects. Vigilante-imposed isolation can follow or even run ahead of official quarantine. A crucial question for how the outbreak will unfold is how contagious the virus is. Scientists around the world are trying to establish how many people, on average, each infected person will pass the virus on to, a number known as R0 in epidemiology. If this number is more than one, an epidemic will grow and if less than one it will fizzle out. An analysis posted online on Friday by scientists from Lancaster University puts R0 for the new coronavirus at 3.8 and estimates that should the epidemic continue unabated, there could be 191,529 infections by 4 February. The paper also suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China. The analysis assumes that only 5% of infections in Wuhan have been identified, which would imply a far larger pool of people whose symptoms have been mild and who have not attended hospital. So while more people may have been infected than initially thought, on the positive side, it would imply that the majority of infections do not cause severe symptoms. Chinese state television\u2019s traditional lunar new year extravaganza on Friday paid tribute to the people of Wuhan and to medical staff fighting the coronavirus crisis, urging them on to victory in the battle to defeat the outbreak, Reuters reports. Traditionally, hundreds of millions of people gather around their televisions to watch the CCTV Spring Festival Gala, a more-than-four-hour showcase of skits, music and dance that has been a TV staple since the first edition was broadcast in 1983. This year an extra segment was added at the last minute to what is normally a carefully planned show, slotted in early in the broadcast. The hosts offered their best wishes to medical staff on the frontlines and to the people of Wuhan. \u201cWe will definitely be victorious!\u201d the hosts announced in unison. After a montage showing doctors and nurses in their hospitals donning protective gear and hard at work looking after their patients, the hosts read out further exhortations. Bai Yansong, one of state television\u2019s best-known anchors, told the gala the virus segment had been prepared very shortly before the actual show. \u201cRemember that we love you, not just today but every day in the future,\u201d Bai said as the camera cut to an audience member with tears streaming down her face. Bai\u2019s colleague Kang Hui, who often reads the main evening news, said the whole nation was involved in the virus fight. \u201cThere is no predicament we cannot get over,\u201d Kang said, to stirring music against a backdrop of more scenes of medical workers in protective body suits. Here is the full statement by the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, in which he said the risk to the UK public remained low: COBR (Cobra) met today to discuss the situation in Wuhan, China, and elsewhere in Asia. I updated on the current situation, the preparedness of the NHS, and possible next steps. I am working closely with the other UK chief medical officers. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage. We have tried and tested measures in place to respond. The UK is well prepared for these types of incidents, with excellent readiness against infectious diseases. We have global experts monitoring the situation around the clock and have a strong track record of managing new forms of infectious disease. The UK has access to some of the best infectious disease and public health experts in the world. There are no confirmed cases in the UK to date. We have been carefully monitoring the situation in Wuhan, China, since the beginning of the outbreak and are now implementing our planned response. A public health hub will be set up in Heathrow from today. This consists of clinicians and other public health officials, in addition to existing port health measures. The World Health Organization has rightly responded quickly and China has introduced strong public health measures. This interactive shows where there are confirmed cases of the coronavirus: And this shows the extent of the transport shutdown in China: The person who tested positive in the US, the second person there to do so, is a woman in her 60s. She returned from Wuhan, China, on 13 January. In the UK, tests for coronavirus on 14 people in the UK have come back negative but there are checks ongoing on other people, the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said. He was speaking after a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall, chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. A second case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the United States. The only other confirmed case in the US so far is in Washington. There are suspected cases, yet to be confirmed, elsewhere. The coronavirus appears to cause similar symptoms to Sars, and seems to be capable of spreading from person to person and between cities, according to two studies published in the medical journal the Lancet. The authors caution that their findings, the first clinical data from initial cases of new coronavirus in China, involve only a small number of patients. They stress the need to maximise the chances of containing infection through careful surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the animal hosts and transmission routes to humans. In the first new study, researchers analysed the first 41 patients infected with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV admitted to hospital in the city of Wuhan between 16 December last year and 2 January. The lead author Prof Bin Cao from the China-Japan friendship hospital and Capital Medical University, China, said: Despite sharing some similar symptoms to Sars (eg fever, dry cough, shortness of breath), there are some important differences, such as the absence of upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg rhinorrhoea [runny nose], sneezing, sore throat) and intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea which affected 20-25% of Sars patients. The co-author Dr Lili Ren from the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, China, said: It is hard to understand the mortality rate associated with this new virus currently, as we are only detecting severe cases in the initial stages of the epidemic, rather than the milder or asymptomatic case. In the second paper, which is a first-of-its-kind genetic analysis, researchers studied a family of seven people who presented to hospital with unexplained pneumonia. They identified 2019-nCoV in five members who had recently visited Wuhan, and in one other family member who did not travel with them. Only a child, who was reported by their mother to have worn a surgical mask for most of the stay in Wuhan, was not infected. Importantly, another child was infected with 2019-nCoV, but showed no clinical symptoms, suggesting that individuals may be able to spread infections in the community without knowing that they are infected. Prof Kwok-Yung Yuen from the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen hospital, who led the research, said: Because asymptomatic infection appears possible, controlling the epidemic will also rely on isolating patients, tracing and quarantining contacts as early as possible, educating the public on both food and personal hygiene, and ensuring healthcare workers comply with infection control. All six patients were hospitalised in isolation and remain stable as of 20 January. Chinese military doctors are being sent in to help with efforts in Wuhan to cope with the coronavirus outbreak. Some 40 medical officers from the city\u2019s military hospital have already started work in the intensive care unit of Wuhan pulmonary hospital, the South China Morning Post reports. Staff at a military hospital held an oath-taking ceremony on Wednesday pledging they would do their best to react to the outbreak. \u201cWe all swore that we will follow the order, make sacrifices if necessary and do our jobs as required and would not be afraid to suffer or even to die,\u201d said one practitioner. \u201c[We were told that] we triumphed over Sars and we will win again this time.\u201d Panic and despair have been sweeping hospitals across Wuhan, where patients wearing masks queue for hours and pharmacies are running out of supplies. The Guardian\u2019s Rebecca Ratcliffe and Lillian Yang in Beijing have filed a piece depicting some of the increasingly challenging circumstances in the city at the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak. Even reaching emergency wards is a struggle, following the shutdown of public transport in the city, which has been placed in complete lockdown. The roads are mostly deserted, and taxi drivers, fearing infection, are refusing to pick up patients from hospitals. About 10 people got off a high-speed train that pulled into Wuhan on Friday afternoon but nobody got on before it resumed its journey. \u201cI need to be with my family,\u201d said one passenger, dragging two large cases out of the station. Footage that appears to have been taken inside medical facilities, and shared on social media, shows staff unable to manage the huge influx of people. In one clip, a patient lies on the floor of a crowded room, apparently having fainted. In another, a woman wearing a face mask cries out for help, saying: \u201cI have a fever.\u201d It is not possible to verify the videos. Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, has emerged after chairing a meeting of the British government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee, which brings together senior figures from various agencies to undertake crisis planning. \u201cThe clinical advice is that the risk to the public remains low,\u201d he said, adding that the UK\u2019s chief medical officer would be making a full statement later today. Health officials have been preparing for an outbreak that could last for months, a senior World Health Organization official in Beijing has told the New York Times. Thousands of people were eventually likely to be infected, said Dr Gauden Galea, representative of the WHO in the Chinese capital. \u201cMy own office is gearing up for a number of months. We do not expect it to disappear in a number of days.\u201d Calls for stricter outlawing of the trafficking and consumption of wild game \u2013 which has been linked to the emergence of coronavirus in Chinese cities \u2013 have been reverberating on Chinese social media. An interesting piece from Jessica Colwell on What\u2019s on Weibo, which reports on social media trends in China, reports that the Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market, which has been linked to the outbreak, has been closed down but criticism of such markets has been fierce. She writes: The hashtag \u201cSupport the banning of wild game markets\u201d (#\u652f\u6301\u7981\u7edd\u91ce\u5473\u5e02\u573a#) was topping the list of trending topics for much of Thursday and was viewed 270m times. Another hashtag, \u201cThe source of the new coronavirus is wild animals\u201d (#\u65b0\u578b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u6765\u6e90\u662f\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269#), topped the list on Wednesday and has been viewed 990m times. Online commenters are lambasting the practice of eating illegal wild game such as civet cats, the cause of the 2003 Sars virus, and bats, the suspected cause of the Wuhan coronavirus (snakes have also been suggested as a possible source of the coronavirus outbreak). Britain\u2019s public health authorities have put out these slides as part of an information campaign about the coronavirus outbreak. A British man who felt unwell after returning from Wuhan but struggled to get a doctor\u2019s appointment until revealing he had been in China has been talking to the Guardian\u2019s Nazia Parveen. Michael Hope, 45, ended up in quarantine for 28 hours, kept in a sealed room and being tested by medics in what he described as \u201cspaceman suits\u201d. \u201cI felt like ET, to be honest,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was totally, totally surreal.\u201d On Tuesday, with his symptoms having worsened after four days to \u201ca really bad chest \u2013 coughing to the point of vomiting\u201d, he had no greater concerns than his GP being busy: after he explained his condition, he was told there were no appointments available and to call back in the morning. The following day, when he managed to get a telephone consultation, he told his GP he had been unable to leave his home since he had got back from China \u2013 and events suddenly speeded up. \u201cI told them I had flu-like symptoms and that I had travelled back from Wuhan,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first the GP told me to come to the surgery and said we could both wear masks and I could stand outside the door \u2013 but then things quickly changed and I was told to stay at home, not to leave, and I would be visited instead.\u201d Read on \u2026 On the Guardian\u2019s Science Weekly podcast, Hannah Devlin has been speaking to Prof Ian Jones about exactly what a coronavirus is. We also hear from the epidemiologist Dr Rosalind Eggo about how scientists model the spread of novel viruses, often with very little information. More airports are beginning to screen passengers arriving from China, AP reports. Qatar, home to the long-haul carrier Qatar Airways, said it had installed thermal scanners at its main hub, Hamad international airport. Kuwait announced similar measures late the night before at Kuwait international airport, joining the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which on Thursday announced screenings for all passengers arriving on direct flights from China, including at Dubai international airport, the world\u2019s busiest. Kuwait\u2019s state-run news agency said isolation rooms had also been opened at Kuwait international airport for passengers suspected to have the virus. Elsewhere in the region, Bahrain said it was taking unspecified steps over the virus. China has shut down Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, which is the centre of the outbreak of the newly identified coronavirus. A scattered number of cases have been confirmed in other countries, but there are fears that during the travel and festivities accompanying lunar new year starting this weekend the virus could spread more widely. In Pakistan the Civil Aviation Authority said all passengers coming from neighbouring China would be screened for the virus, and any suspected of being infected would be kept in isolation at designated hospitals. As many as 41 flights from China land at Pakistani airports every week. Nepal has a case of coronavirus, Asian News International reports. Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, is planning to build a hospital to help treat victims of the epidemic. The template is a hospital constructed hastily in Beijing in 2003 during the Sars outbreak. The UK government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee is holding its meeting now about the outbreak. The Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, reports that ministers from the Home Office, the Foreign Office, and the departments for transport, education and communities and local government will also attend. \u201cThere remain no confirmed cases, and we\u2019re well prepared for any new diseases. All UK airports have medical experts on hand and information has been provided to all passengers returning from China,\u201d said a spokesman for the prime minister. He added that the Department for Education was checking universities\u2019 preparedness, given the likelihood that Chinese students may be travelling to or returning from home, to coincide with the new year holiday. Asked whether China had provided the UK with all the information it needed on the outbreak, he said: \u201cWe remain in close contact with the World Health Organization and international partners, including China.\u201d The prime minister, Boris Johnson, won\u2019t be attending the Cobra meeting but is expected to host a reception at Downing Street in the next hour for the lunar new year. Meanwhile, we\u2019re told by Public Health England that it is unlikely that there will be any updated figures on those being tested for the virus in the UK until at least 3pm local time. We had been led to believe that updated figures would be available at noon. China will take stricter and more targeted measures to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, Chinese state television has reported, citing a state council meeting on virus control on Friday. \u201cThe spread of the virus has not been cut off \u2026 Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency,\u201d according to state media, Reuters reported. The Chinese military has released a handbook on Pneumonia Prevention and Control of New Coronavirus Infection, which Chinese media are encouraging people to forward to their circle of friends on social media. The 16-page document comes with cartoon figures of heroic Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) figures and includes guidance on hygiene and disease prevention. Meanwhile \u2026 The British government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee will meet today to discus the coronavirus, according to the UK prime minister\u2019s spokesperson. The meeting will be chaired by the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Meanwhile, a letter from Britain\u2019s chief medical officer to clinical staff warns that the \u201cmass movement\u201d of people within and outside China associated with the upcoming lunar new year celebrations may \u201camplify transmission\u201d. The letter said anyone who was confirmed as having the virus would be transferred to an Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease centre (HCID). According to Public Health England, there are four interim Airborne HCID centres in England. These are: \u2022 Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS foundation trust. \u2022 Royal Free London NHS foundation trust. \u2022 Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University hospitals NHS trust. \u2022 Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation Trust. At the UN briefing in Geneva, a WHO spokesperson has said that it is too early to draw conclusions on how serious the outbreak is. \u201cWe may see more mild cases as surveillance intensifies. So the issue is not so much on numbers that we know will go up,\u201d he added. The WHO was getting its information from the Chinese authorities, he said, citing figures from midnight which recorded 830 cases including 25 deaths. The second confirmed case in Japan of the new coronavirus transited from Hong Kong to Japan by plane and Hong Kong\u2019s health authority needs to track the flight and passengers now, according to Wong Ka-hing, director of Hong Kong\u2019s Centre for Health Protection. Xinqi Su, a Hong Kong based AFP correspondent, reports that the patient took Cathay Dragon\u2019s KA855 from Wuhan to Hong Kong on 19 January and then transited from Hong Kong to Japan on Cathay Pacific\u2019s CX58. She quotes an emerging and zoonotic diseases expert, David Hui, as saying that Hong Kong is now at \u201cserious response level\u201d due to imported cases, but it won\u2019t be upgraded to an \u201cemergency\u201d until there are local cases and continued outbreak. He added that it was \u201cunpractical\u201d for all members of the public to keep a mask on all day. \u201cIf you are taking public transport or going to a mall with many people, I would advice you to wear a mask. You can take off the mask when you are in an office,\u201d Hui said. Thailand has confirmed its fifth case of the new coronavirus, a senior public health official said. \u201cThe patient is a 33-year-old woman from Wuhan on vacation,\u201d the deputy public health minister Sathit Patucha told Reuters, adding that she was under quarantine at Rajavithi hospital and her condition was improving. The woman arrived in Bangkok on 21 January with her daughter and visited a private hospital complaining of a fever, coughing and muscle aches before being transferred to a government hospital on 23 January, Sathit said. Her daughter tested negative for the virus. A Thai woman who contracted the virus after spending the new year in Wuhan was admitted to Nakhon Pathom hospital, 40 miles (60km) west of Bangkok, on 15 January and discharged on Friday after lab tests cleared her of the virus, the public health ministry said in a statement. Thailand currently has two patients under quarantine for the virus. McDonald\u2019s says it is suspending business in five cities in China\u2019s Hubei province, centre of the virus outbreak. Two tourists visiting Finland from Wuhan in China are suspected of being infected with the coronavirus, according to YLE, Finland\u2019s state broadcaster. The pair went to a health centre in Ivalo, northern Finland, to seek treatment for flu-like symptoms on Thursday night. Markku Broas, an infectious diseases physician at Lapland central hospital, said samples had been taken to Helsinki for analysis but he thought it was likely to be a case of the flu. \u201cThere\u2019s no major cause for concern.\u201d The situation is a \u201crapidly evolving\u201d one which is being monitored closely but the current risk to the population in the UK is low, according to a new blog on the website of Public Health England, a state body. It answers a number of questions it says many people have. They include: What is Wuhan novel coronavirus and should I be concerned? A coronavirus is a type of virus. As a group, coronaviruses are common across the world. Typical symptoms of coronavirus include fever and a cough that may progress to a severe pneumonia causing shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. No confirmed cases of Wuhan coronavirus have been detected in the UK and we currently consider the risk to the UK population to be low. How do we decide the risk level? Several factors are taken into account to determine the risk level including the number of cases, the speed at which new cases are being identified and other information about the virus such as how easily it spreads from person to person. Can we stop the virus coming to the UK? No system of checks can claim to offer absolute protection because of the incubation period of the virus. Some people might only show symptoms 14 days after exposure to an infected person. Our approach to enhanced monitoring helps us ensure that travellers from Wuhan get the right information about what to do if they become unwell. Why are we not monitoring all flights from China? And, what about people who have transferred from other flights? Plans are in place to meet any direct flights from Wuhan as experts believe this is the source of the virus. However, the enhanced monitoring of direct flights will be kept under continuous review and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary. Beijing\u2019s city government is urging people who return to the Chinese capital from areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak to stay at home for 14 days, according to local reports. Meanwhile, sections of China\u2019s Great Wall near Beijing will be closed to visitors from Saturday. Tributes have been paid to one of the WHO\u2019s executive directors, Dr Peter Salama, who has died. For clarity, Salama\u2019s death is unrelated to the coronavirus. A medical epidemiologist from Australia, he led the Health Emergencies Programme at WHO from 2016 to 2019 and has led research and published extensively on vaccine-preventable diseases, HIV, nutrition, war-related mortality and violence, refugee and emergency health, and programming in fragile states. Flights to Moscow from the Chinese city of Wuhan have been suspended over fears about the spread of the coronavirus strain, according to Interfax news agency. Earlier this week Russia\u2019s healthcare ministry described the virus as a biological hazard, with the deputy minister Sergei Krayevoy saying the virus was a \u201cstriking example\u201d of the biological threats Russia faced. The regular press briefing (livestream) from the UN\u2019s office in Geneva is just about to start and the virus is expected to feature in questions. There was some confusion in reports elsewhere about it. It\u2019s not a WHO briefing. Walt Disney Co\u2019s Shanghai Disney Resort will be closed until further notice in response to the outbreak. Here\u2019s a video explainer from the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, in which she answers some of the most common and pressing questions surrounding the outbreak. A former Mexican government minister who oversaw the country\u2019s response to the H1N1 flu virus during the aftermath in 2010 has said that containing panic around the coronavirus outbreak is as important as stemming the virus itself. Gloria Guevara, who is now president/CEO of the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC), based in London, said it could have a damaging and lasting economic impact on the global travel and tourism sector unless lessons were learned from previous viral epidemics. Analysis of previous major viral epidemics by the WTTC found that the average recovery time for visitor numbers to a destination was 19 months, but with the right response and management they could recover in as little as 10 months. Also on the theme of panic, the editor of the Lancet medical journal has tweeted: The World Health Organization\u2019s decision on Thursday not to class the virus as an \u201cinternational emergency\u201d, partly because of the low number of overseas cases, has surprised some experts. However, others have recognised that the WHO\u2019s position on declaring a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) was a \u201cfinely balanced one\u201d. That\u2019s a view taken by Sir Jeremy Farrar, a medical researcher at the medical charity the Wellcome Trust. The moment to watch out for was when the virus was transmitted among people who had not been in China, he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. Comparisons with Sars were valid, he said, but at the same time he lauded the \u201cdraconian and extraordinary\u201d measures being taken in China, which he also commended in terms of being transparent and sharing information. Elsewhere, Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds, said he was \u201cpersonally surprised\u201d that a PHEIC had not been called given similarities to Sars. \u201cHowever, it is often difficult to understand the precise criteria by which one of these is implemented \u2013 it sounds as though the committee had some differences of opinion,\u201d he said, in a statement issued by the Science Media Centre. Prof Tom Solomon, director of the UK\u2019s health protection research unit in emerging infections at the University of Liverpool, said: \u201cThe WHO\u2019s decision not to declare the novel coronavirus outbreak in China [a PHEIC] will surprise many. The number of reported cases and deaths is doubling every couple of days, and patients have now been reported from many Asian countries, as well as the Middle East and United States.\u201d China has added four more cities to its transport ban, affecting 41 million people, according to the AFP news agency. On the eve of China\u2019s lunar new year, transportation had been shut down already in at least 10 cities with a total of about 33 million people. The cities are Wuhan, where the illness has been concentrated, and nine of its neighbours in central China\u2019s Hubei province. It is \u201chighly likely\u201d that there will be cases of the virus in the UK, according to Prof Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, an arm of the NHS that has tested 14 people so far. Specialist treatment centres in various parts of the country have already been designated and authorities are focusing on providing information, with a particular focus on communities such as Chinese students. \u201cThe NHS is fully prepared for treating people. They have their specialist infectious disease centres and have identified the ones that people will be referred to,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme. Cosford added that it was \u201cvery early days\u201d in terms of saying whether the virus would be as serious as Sars and it would be wrong to jump to conclusions. The next update on figure in the UK is expected to come at midday. It was confirmed last night that two people diagnosed with flu were being tested for the virus in Scotland, where three others are also being tested on a precautionary basis. At least three of the patients are believed to be Chinese nationals. While there remain no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Scotland, the Scottish government has set up a daily incident management team with Health Protection Scotland to continue monitoring the situation as it develops. While the Scottish government would not confirm where the patients were being treated, this morning the Courier newspaper reports that two are from the Tayside region, two from Glasgow and one from Lothian. Dundee University, in Tayside, has a joint education partnership with Wuhan University. It said five members of staff had returned from a visit to Wuhan last week but that no health concerns had been raised. Aberdeen University said five of its staff members had also visited Wuhan during the outbreak, and one of those \u2013 who has a non-teaching role - is working from home as a precautionary measure. The first version of a vaccine has already entered laboratories at the global pharmaceutical firm Johnson &amp; Johnson but it will be close to year before vaccines are available publicly from drugs companies. That\u2019s according to Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Richard Hatchett, ceo of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is funding two of projects and co-funding the third to develop vaccines. Speaking in Davos, Hatchett told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that CEPI hoped the vaccines it had announced partnerships for could enter clinical trials in the summer. It would be close to a year before they were available, however, he added, and this was a very ambitious timeline. He also said that restrictions on air travel into countries such as the UK would not keep the virus out and for now the only means of responding were via public health interventions. Companies were also looking at progressing the manufacture and release of protective equipment for hospital workers and others, said Stoffels, who added: \u201cWe know that this could become a very big global epidemic.\u201d Both men said the speed of development on drugs to respond to global crises had dramatically improved in the wake of the Ebola crisis, which Stoffels described as a \u201cwake up call to the world\u201d. Singapore has confirmed two more cases of the new strain of coronavirus, its health ministry said on Friday, a day after identifying its first case of the infection that originated from China. The ministry said it expected more imported cases because of high travel volume from China, Reuters reports. Singapore\u2019s tally of confirmed cases is now three. Fewer people have been turning up at dedicated fever clinics in Wuhan, according to western reporters on the ground in the city. They include Chris Buckley of the New York Times and Tom Hancock of the FT, who has tweeted some before and after pictures of one of the hospitals he visited on Friday. Hancock suggests this is a positive development as many may not have had any serious infection and standing next to others for hours could spread infection. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog from London now. You can contact me on Twitter or flag up anything below the line here. Yichang City, also in Hubei province, is going to impose transport restrictions, according to the Global Times. In the UK, 14 people have been tested for suspected coronavirus. So far five have been cleared and nine are still waiting for test results. Public Health England has not given a breakdown of where the people were tested but Downing Street said four of the suspected cases in Scotland were believed to be Chinese nationals. Another patient is understood to have been tested at Belfast\u2019s Royal Victoria hospital. Rebecca Ratcliffe and Lillian Yang in Beijing have pulled together the latest on the chaos and despair in hospitals across Wuhan, as the lockdown spreads to encompass at least 20 million people. The official death toll stands at 26 people, most of them in Hubei province in central China, but two people have died outside of that zone \u2013 one man just outside of Beijing, and the other in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia. At least 830 people in China have been confirmed to have contracted the novel coronavirus so far. The Chinese government has locked down 11 million people in the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated, and nine other cities in Hubei province, causing chaos on the eve of the lunar new year. A new 1,000-bed hospital is being built in Wuhan specifically to deal with the coronavirus outbreak, and authorities there expect to have it completed and running by Monday. South Korea has confirmed a second case of the virus, a man in his 50s who had been working in Wuhan earlier this month. Japan has also confirmed a second case of the virus: a Wuhan resident in his 40s who arrived in Japan on 19 January. The US has confirmed one case of the virus in Seattle, while authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case. 14 people in the UK have been tested for the virus; so far, five have been cleared. Scottish authorities have tested at least six people with coronavirus symptoms. In Australia, at least six people are being monitored for signs of the virus, while public health authorities warn the world is likely to see more cases confirmed in countries outside of China in the coming days. The World Health Organization\u2019s emergency committee has concluded it\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d to declare an international public health emergency, but says the situation is still to be considered an emergency in China. \u201cIt has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one,\u201d said the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Reuters is reporting that Shanghai Disney will be closed to help prevent the spread of the virus. Cinemas will suspend their operations in Guangdong province until the end of the holiday season because of the coronavirus outbreak. Health officials in Hong Kong gave their daily press briefing about the coronavirus outbreak fully masked. In Australia, researchers at the University of Queensland are racing to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. According to AAP: The Queensland team is one of three around the world asked to plant their foot on the accelerator and use new technologies to get a vaccine on to the market fast. If they can replicate what they\u2019ve done in labs with other viruses, including related influenza and Ebola, it\u2019s possible the world could have a shield against coronavirus within six months. The team is one of three handpicked by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to fast-track the vaccine. The University of Queensland team is confident they\u2019ll get there with recently patented DNA-based molecular clamp technology. It involves using the DNA sequence of the coronavirus \u2013 released by China after the outbreak \u2013 to produce a protein that\u2019s the same as the one on the surface of the actual virus. That protein will be the essence of the vaccine, capable of generating immune system responses that protect people. \u201cBy injecting that we can get an optimal immune response in people that affords protection,\u201d explains Dr Keith Chappell, from the university\u2019s school of chemistry and molecular biosciences. Reuters reports: A total of 10 cities in China\u2019s central Hubei province have suspended some public transportation over the coronavirus outbreak, the Hubei Daily reported on Friday. Buses in cities of Chibi, Xiantao, Zhijiang, Qianjiang, Xianning, Huangshi and Enshi have suspended services. In Zhijiang city, all public venues have been shut down except hospitals, supermarkets, farmers\u2019 markets, gas stations and drug stores, it said. Indoor entertainment venues in Enshi city have also been shut down. The provincial capital Wuhan city, the centre of the outbreak, and Huanggang city have been locked down while Ezhou city has shut its train stations. \u201cIt has been splashed all over the front pages of newspapers around the world for days,\u201d writes the Guardian contributor Michael Standaert in Sichuan. \u201cBut the outbreak of coronavirus, which has left at least 25 dead and infected more than 800, has been largely missing from China\u2019s major state-run media.\u201d Friday\u2019s front page of the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist party\u2019s flagship newspaper, displayed only warm wishes for lunar new year\u2019s eve from the president, Xi Jinping, as he attended a spring festival gala at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. News of the coronavirus outbreak has also been buried during primetime CCTV news over the past two evenings, featuring as the fifth or sixth item on the daily 7pm bulletin. Read his full story here: Chinese officials have confirmed another person has died from novel coronavirus, the second person to do so outside the province of Hubei, the epicentre of the virus, bringing the official death toll to 26. The death was in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, which borders Russia and is about 1,200 miles (2,000km) from Wuhan, the local government said. 24 deaths have occurred in Hubei. Footage has emerged online of the quarantine measures being taken in China to halt the spread of the virus, including overcrowded hospitals, sick people collapsing, and barricades going up across Wuhan. State media is now reporting 26 deaths from the coronavirus in China, not 25. The People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist party\u2019s main newspaper, has called upon people who have recently been to Wuhan to isolate themselves at home, even if they don\u2019t have symptoms. The statement was made on Weibo, where people have shared panicked calls for those from Wuhan to take greater precautions to avoid infecting others. More information has been released regarding the second person to be confirmed with novel coronavirus in South Korea. Seoul\u2019s health ministry said on Friday that a South Korean man in his 50s started experiencing symptoms on 10 January while working in Wuhan, AFP reports. The man was tested upon returning to South Korea earlier this week, and was confirmed to be South Korea\u2019s second case of the virus on Thursday, the ministry said. According to a statement from the ministry, \u201cthe patient was adequately aware of the situation in Wuhan ... and cooperated well with the health authorities\u2019 requests during the monitoring period after returning home.\u201d A new 1000-bed hospital is being built in Wuhan specifically to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and authorities plan to have it running by Monday, state media outlet Changjiang Daily reports. Construction began on Thursday night with machinery, including 35 diggers and 10 bulldozers, arriving at the site. The impromptu medical facility will be created using prefabricated buildings, and is being modelled on the experience of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003. That disease killed 774 people around the world. At the time, Beijing built a hospital in its northern suburbs in just a week, the Daily said. The Australian government\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has confirmed that there are still no verified cases of coronavirus in Australia. In a press conference this afternoon, Murphy attempted to downplay the threat of the virus in Australia, saying that while there are several people who are being regularly tested for the disease, none of them have tested positive yet. Australia is prepared and has the capacity to isolate those people if necessary, he said. \u201cApproximately 25% of people who contract this infection \u2026 seem to get a more severe illness, but we do suspect there are a number of additional cases that are so mild they haven\u2019t come to our attention,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt is of concern that there are some cases outside of China, but they are small numbers and have been well-managed in their locations.\u201d He said it was likely there would be more cases confirmed outside of China in the coming days. \u201cThat\u2019s the pattern we\u2019ve observed,\u201d he said. \u201cThese things are very hard to predict and predictions are often proven to be wrong, so we\u2019re just keeping a watching brief.\u201d Murphy said he had briefed Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the minister for health, Greg Hunt, on the situation. He referenced the World Health Organisation\u2019s decision not to declare the virus an official public health emergency of international concern, but said the committee was divided on this front. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean in any way that they\u2019re not taking this seriously. They do see this as a serious issue and they are upping some of their responses,\u201d he said. That response includes sending in a \u201cspecialist team\u201d to properly identify the \u201canimal vector\u201d that caused the disease to be transmitted to humans. Some stark pictures of the lockdown experience in Wuhan have been circulating on Twitter over the last 24 hours thanks to the New York Times\u2019 Chris Buckley. Schools in Singapore are asking parents and staff to provide details of travel during the lunar new year holidays, in a measure aimed at halting the spread of coronavirus, Reuters reports. The first case of coronavirus was confirmed there on Thursday: a 66-year-old Chinese national, who lives in Wuhan and arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Monday night. Parents in Singapore have started receiving emails from schools asking them to state where their children will be travelling for holidays. \u201cIn this phase of enhanced preparedness, our schools, including Ministry of Education Kindergartens, and Institutes of Higher Learning will take measures to ensure the safety and well-being of our students and staff,\u201d a spokesperson from education ministry said. An insight, via US news network CNN, into the way the first person diagnosed with the virus in the States is being treated, and the measures being taken to isolate him and prevent the spread of the disease. Here\u2019s a handy explainer on what exactly the coronavirus is and how dangerous it could be: Canadian acrobatic troupe Cirque du Soleil has announced that its shows in Hangzhou, China are canceled due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak. The call was made in response to Chinese officials\u2019 requests to close all indoor activities with 100 or more people in attendance in order to contain the outbreak, the company said in a statement. \u201cRight now, we all have the responsibility to step up, and to do preventive activities,\u201d Cirque du Soleil head Daniel Lamarre said in the statement. Details of how cities in China are trying to control the spread of coronavirus are emerging. In Wuhan taxis are now only allowed to carry two passengers at a time. In Hubei province travel agencies have been told to suspend their tours. In Australia, New South Wales Health has confirmed it is investigating four possible cases of coronavirus in the state, according to the national broadcaster, the ABC. Health authorities in the northern state of Queensland, meanwhile, are assessing two people amid concerns they may have contracted the virus. Four others have been cleared. \u201cWe\u2019ve already tested four individuals who were suspected cases. All four came back negative,\u201d Queensland\u2019s chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young told reporters on Friday, according to the Australian Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another two suspects at the moment that we\u2019re assessing who may need testing.\u201d A bit more new information about what\u2019s happening in China. The National Health Commission said that in addition to the 830 confirmed cases, authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus, according to AFP. Out of the total 830 confirmed cases, 177 were in serious condition. 34 people have been \u201ccured and discharged\u201d. Meanwhile, the South Korean government has confirmed that country\u2019s second case of the virus. The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post is reporting today that medical staff are being infected with coronavirus at a much faster rate than previously reported. The SCMP does not identify its two sources but they dispute the Chinese Centre for Disease Control\u2019s assessment that 15 hospital staff had been infected in Wuhan city, saying 14 staff had been infected in one hospital alone. The Chinese government has been accused of downplaying the severity of the outbreak by residents who point to its repeated assurances that the virus was not serious, was \u201ccontrollable\u201d, and the fact that Wuhan has only just now been put into lockdown, even as cases of the virus have been reported in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and the United States. We\u2019re already getting a glimpse of what the Friday morning papers will look like over in the UK. Unsurprisingly, coronavirus is leading or supporting most of the coverage. \u201cIs the killer virus here?\u201d shrieks the headline on the Daily Mail. The Daily Mirror also leads with coronavirus, focusing on the six people who have been tested in Britain overnight. The Times is slightly more subdued. \u201cHow big is the threat of coronavirus?\u201d asks the Independent. High speed rail shares the Guardian front page with coronavirus and the ongoing Harvey Weinstein trial. Meanwhile the Daily Telegraph has focused on law and order, with the disease outbreak getting the prime visual slot. Hello, this is Stephanie Convery in Australia, taking over from my colleague Nadeem Badshah in London. The Chinese government has just confirmed the death toll from novel coronavirus has risen to 25, and the number of confirmed cases in the country now sits at 830, according to the National Health Commission. 14 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, Public Health England said. Five people tested negative and nine are still awaiting the results. The Scottish Government earlier confirmed that five people were being examined after presenting with symptoms of the illness, while it is understood that another patient was being tested at Belfast\u2019s Royal Victoria Hospital. 25 people in China have died from the virus, including an 80-year-old man in Hebei province, near the capital Beijing, on Wednesday \u2013 the first confirmed death outside Hubei province, in central China. The World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) emergency committee concluded it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to declare an international public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said: \u201cMake no mistake. This is an emergency in China. \u201cBut it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.\u201d Dr Tedros said 584 cases have been reported to the WHO. Universities across the UK say they are monitoring the coronavirus outbreak as one institution warned students thinking of heading home for the Chinese New Year that they would face being quarantined on their return. The University of Chester said it has notified its students currently in the UK that if they return to China for Chinese New Year they will not be readmitted without a suitable quarantine period. Japan\u2019s health ministry said it had confirmed the country\u2019s second case of a novel coronavirus strain in a man who travelled from Wuhan. The ministry said the man in his 40s was a resident of the Chinese city where the outbreak began and arrived in Japan on January 19. One person in Australia has been quarantined and will undergo testing after being suspected of contracting the coronavirus, according to reports. The person was placed into quarantine in an unnamed hospital and will have tests on Friday after arriving on a flight to Sydney, a New South Wales Ministry of Health spokesperson said. Authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case on US soil of the coronavirus virus, officials said. Brazos County, northwest of Houston, \u201cis investigating a suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),\u201d officials wrote in a statement on Facebook. \u201cThe patient traveled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated.\u201d As the death toll from the new coronavirus climbs, questions remain about how it spread to humans and how much of a threat it poses across the world. Cases have been confirmed in the US, Japan, South Korea and Thailand, while there are understood to be at least fourteen suspected cases tested in the UK, with five confirmed negative. Now, fears are growing that the increased travel expected over the upcoming Lunar New Year period could aid the spread. But just how worried should we be in the UK? - How does this compare with previous outbreaks? Several experts say the new coronavirus appears to be less severe than its predecessors. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said typical flu epidemics can kill tens of thousands of people, but that previous new coronavirus outbreaks have led to fewer deaths. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) killed about 800 people, while Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) led to about 450 deaths. Prof Hunter said: \u201cThis new strain seems to be rather less lethal than the previous two outbreaks, however this could still change. \u201cAll new outbreaks are worrying, especially in the early weeks when it is not clear how the outbreak could progress. \u201cI think it unlikely that the Wuhan coronavirus will cause a major public health issue in the UK, in large part because of our existing health system.\u201d US researchers writing in the journal JAMA also said the fatality rate appears to be lower than that of Sars or Mers. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Thursday it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to declare a public health emergency of international concern. Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said it is not clear how contagious the virus is. He said: \u201cThis is important in determining the risk of a much larger outbreak developing, with spread to people who have not travelled to Wuhan. \u201cIt is likely that the US and other countries will be considering what further measures are needed to limit the risk of more cases arriving from China.\u201d - What is the risk to the UK? England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has revised the risk to the UK population from very low to low. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK is one of the first countries to develop a test for coronavirus and the NHS is ready to respond to any cases. He added: \u201cThe public can be assured that the whole of the UK is always well prepared for these type of outbreaks and we will remain vigilant and keep our response under constant review in light of emerging scientific evidence.\u201d The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan, but has not changed its advice on other destinations which have reported cases. - Could cases be confirmed in the UK? A handful of cases have been identified abroad, including in Japan and the US, but there have been no confirmed cases in the UK. Officials from Public Health England have been monitoring direct flights from Wuhan city to the UK. Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, said the UK is not a major destination of visitors travelling out of Wuhan. But he added: \u201cBorder screening and in this case, in the UK, alerting the health system, is not 100% foolproof - there could be a mild case.\u201d In addition, the screening will only catch people already showing symptoms. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, NIHR academic clinical lecturer, King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cIt is wise to implement checks at this stage given the evidence on increasing spread of the virus to other countries and across continents, but largely for the purpose of being in contact with travellers from affected regions in case they become unwell. \u201cIf they were to be unwell at the airport or become unwell in the future it will allow more prompt isolation and testing of the patient, with appropriate tracing of any people the patient may have been in contact with. \u201cThis will hopefully limit the amount of people the person may have contact with while unwell and so limit the spread of the virus.\u201d Japan\u2019s health ministry said it had confirmed the country\u2019s second case of a novel coronavirus strain in a man who travelled from Wuhan. In a statement, the ministry said the man in his 40s was a resident of the Chinese city where the outbreak began and arrived in Japan on January 19. He reported having had a fever for several days before his arrival but said his condition had stabilised by the time of his arrival in Japan. On January 22, he reported a fever and he is now in a Tokyo hospital receiving treatment, the ministry said. The statement added the man denied having visited the market in Wuhan identified as the source of the outbreak and said he had worn a medical mask while travelling. Fourteen people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus, Public Health England said. Five people tested negative and nine are still awaiting the results. A person in Australia has been quarantined and will undergo testing after being suspected of contracting the coronavirus, according to reports. The person was placed into quarantine in an unnamed hospital and will have tests on Friday, a New South Wales Ministry of Health spokesperson told news.com.au. The individual arrived on a flight to Sydney. As the flight touched down, passengers and crew reportedly wore face masks and those who raised concerns about their health had their temperature taken. Authorities in Texas are investigating a second suspected case on US soil of the coronavirus virus, officials said. Brazos County, northwest of Houston, \u201cis investigating a suspected case of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV),\u201d officials wrote in a statement on Facebook. \u201cThe patient traveled from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated. \u201cHealth care providers were aware of public health guidance on novel coronavirus and quickly recognized that the patient met the criteria for coronavirus testing and is being kept isolated at home, while the precautionary testing is done.\u201d A blood sample from the patient has to be tested at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) before the case if confirmed. If confirmed, the patient would be the second person to be infected with the virus in the US after a man in his 30s near Seattle reported himself to authorities on January 19. He is said to be recovering well and health officials have said he will be released soon. Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has given his view on the World Health Organisation not declaring the coronavirus outbreak a global emergency. He said: \u201cThis announcement is not surprising as more evidence may be needed to make the case of announcing a PHEIC. \u201cWHO were criticised after announcing the pandemic strain of novel H1N1_2009, when the virus was eventually realised to have similar characteristics to seasonal influenza and is perhaps trying to avoid making the same mistake here with this novel coronavirus. \u201cTo estimate the true severity of this new disease requires identifying mild or asymptomatic cases, if there are any, while determining the human to human transmission rate might require more evidence. \u201cHowever, all this new evidence needs to be rapidly obtained over the next few days if the world is to be as prepared as possible, so WHO should issue a different type of alert to mobilise a full investigation.\u201d Programmes to speed up the development of vaccines against coronavirus have received a funding boost. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), partially financed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will fund three programmes with the aim being to advance nCoV-2019 vaccine candidates into clinical testing as quickly as possible. CEPI aims to develop vaccines for new and emerging diseases before they become global health emergencies. It said it has moved with great urgency to promote the development of new vaccines against the emerging threat of nCoV-2019, adding that the novel coronavirus represents the first new epidemic disease of note to emerge since CEPI\u2019s founding at Davos in 2017. Richard Hatchett, CEO of CEPI, said: \u201cGiven the rapid global spread of the nCoV-2019 virus the world needs to act quickly and in unity to tackle this disease. \u201cOur intention with this work is to leverage our work on the MERS coronavirus and rapid response platforms to speed up vaccine development. \u201cThere are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work could provide a significant and important step forward in developing a vaccine for this disease. \u201cOur aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks - which is significantly shorter than where we are now.\u201d An 18th person in China has died from the virus. The 80-year-old man died in Hebei province, near the capital Beijing, on Wednesday. It is the first confirmed death outside Hubei province, in central China. Dr Jeremy Farrar, a medical researcher and director of The Wellcome Trust, said it respects the advice of the World Health Organization\u2019s Emergency Committee to not declare a global emergency but says this must be kept under constant review. He said: \u201cCountries should act now on the recommendations made by the committee on how best to prepare and respond to this epidemic. There is no need to wait. \u201cThe decision does not change the fact that the urgent focus must remain on identifying the gaps in understanding of this virus, and on a continued robust, coordinated global public health response. \u201cThis outbreak and the speed with which this new virus has spread in China and travelled across borders, is a reminder of how vulnerable we are globally to outbreaks of infectious diseases known and unknown. \u201cTravel restrictions may be important in buying time, to signal the seriousness of the situation and may help reduce the impact, but are unlikely stop this epidemic.\u201d An Italian singer was hospitalised after showing \u201csuspected symptoms\u2019\u2019 of the coronavirus including a cough and fever. She started feeling sick after returning home from a tour of Asia that included the area of Wuhan. Tests for the virus that infected the singer, who has not been named publicly, are proceeding. \u201cThe patient is currently in contact isolation at the Infectious Diseases Department,\u2019\u2019 a note from the hospital read. \u201cShe is receiving the necessary treatments pending test results\u2019.\u201d Universities across the UK say they are monitoring the coronavirus outbreak as one institution warned students thinking of heading home for the Chinese New Year that they would face being quarantined on their return. The University of Chester said it has notified its students currently in the UK that if they return to China for Chinese New Year they will not be readmitted without a suitable quarantine period. The University of Aberdeen, which has a partnership with Wuhan University, said it was not aware of any students in Wuhan - where the outbreak is thought to have originated - who have returned from the area recently. But a spokesman said: \u201cThe university is aware of five members of staff who have visited Wuhan during the outbreak, four of whom returned to the university three or more weeks ago. \u201cThe remaining member of staff has a non-teaching role and is working from home as a precautionary measure. \u201cAdvice regarding travel precautions has been issued to staff and students in line with Government guidance.\u201d A Newcastle University spokesman said it had issued protection advice to around 300 students who have links to the Hubei province at the centre of the health scare, as well as offering support for those concerned. A spokesman said: \u201cWe have arranged a dedicated health event for any student arriving from China in the last month, ensuring they register with a doctor.\u201d Universities have followed Foreign Office advice warning people not to travel to the region affected. A spokesman for the University of Dundee said it has issued advice to students recently in China and said they should be careful if receiving items, especially food, from areas where the virus is present. It runs a joint education partnership with Wuhan University, with 34 students on the programme in Dundee who arrived in September. Five staff returned from a visit to Wuhan last week, the spokesman added. He said no health concerns have been raised among either group, adding: \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation, taking advice from the relevant agencies as to appropriate action.\u201d A spokesman for the University of Nottingham, which has a campus in the Chinese city of Ningbo, said: \u201cWe are not aware of any staff or students in the affected areas in China. \u201cHowever, the university is keeping students informed of the latest advice by UK and Chinese health authorities, including precautionary measures such as good hand and respiratory hygiene.\u201d Top experts on infectious diseases held a hastily-arranged press conference on the Coronavirus at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier today. Jeremy Farrar, of the Wellcome Trust, gave reporters a swift explanation -- about how the virus probably jumped from bats to humans at a market in Wutan, before then starting to spread between humans. The fact the virus spreads between humans through the respiratory route makes it particularly serious, Farrar explained; experts have been worrying about this happening for some time. Farrar said: \u201cWe want to keep a calm, moderated approach, but we need to take this incredibly seriously\u201d. Farfer, who says he\u2019s \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the situation, also warned against thinking of it as a China-only problem. \u201cThis will become a global issue. This isn\u2019t just a China issue, it\u2019s going to affect us all.\u201d Richard Hatchett, Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), announced that three new partnerships with vaccine producers have just been agreed. \u201cOur hope is to have these vaccines developed very rapidly and moved into human trials soon, maybe as soon as this summer,\u201d Hatchett said. Hatchett and Farrar both spoke about the importance of using non-pharmaceutical interventions, until a vaccine is developed. That includes public health measures - hand-washing, keeping people apart, masks, and travel restrictions. Farrar\u2019s hunch is that the coronavirus will have a lower mortality rate than the SARS epidemic 28 years ago, which killed 788 people. But if it spreads faster and further than SARS, and isn\u2019t controlled in time, then the deathtoll could be higher than SARS. But there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. He reminded reporters that the influenza epidemic a century ago had a low mortality rate, but killed 50m people because it spread so far. Advice from the WHO Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said 584 cases have been reported to the WHO including 17 deaths, which is lower than the previously reported figure. Some 575 of the overall cases and all the deaths reported are in China. Other cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the US and Vietnam. Ghebreyesus said it is known the virus can kill \u201calthough for most people it causes milder symptoms\u201d, adding: \u201cWe know that among those infected, one quarter of patients have experienced severe disease. \u201cWe know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that weakened their immune systems. \u201cWe know that there is human-to-human transmission in China, but for now it appears limited to family groups and health workers caring for infected patients. \u201cAt this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. \u201cThere is still a lot we don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know the source of this virus, we don\u2019t understand how easily it spreads and we don\u2019t fully understand its clinical features or severity.\u201d Ghebreyesus added it is likely that we will see more cases in other parts of China and other countries. Peter Piot, professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, believes we are at a critical phase in the outbreak. He said: \u201cRegardless of the decision not to declare this a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, intensified international collaboration and more resources will be crucial to stopping this outbreak in its tracks. \u201cNational authorities and the World Health Organisation will need to continue to monitor developments very closely. \u201cThere are still many missing pieces in the jigsaw puzzle to fully understanding this new virus which is spreading rapidly across China, and most probably around the world. \u201cThe good news is that the data to date suggest that this virus may have a lower mortality than SARS, we have a diagnostic test and there is greater transparency than decades gone by. \u201cAnd that is essential because you cannot deal with a potential pandemic in one country alone.\u201d The Boarding Schools Association (BSA) has issued guidance to its members that while there seems to be \u201cno immediate cause for concern\u201d over the coronavirus outbreak, the situation needs to be monitored carefully. It said: \u201cIn particular, schools might wish to consider planning for the eventuality that some boarders either cannot or choose not to travel home at half-term or, more likely, Easter. \u201cBSA would advise schools to consider erring on the side of caution to minimise the risk to students and staff.\u201d The guidance recommends that schools needing case-specific information contact the relevant public health authorities. The World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) emergency committee has concluded it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to declare an international public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said: \u201cMake no mistake. This is an emergency in China. \u201cBut it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.\u2019\u2019 The director-general added: \u201cI wish to reiterate the fact that I am not declaring a PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern] today should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously. \u201cNothing could be further from the truth. WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.\u201d Five people in Scotland are being tested for coronavirus as a precaution, the Scottish government said. A Scottish government spokeswoman confirmed that two people diagnosed with flu were now being tested for the virus while three others are also being tested on a precautionary basis. At least three of the patients are believed to be Chinese nationals. The spokesperson said: \u201cThere are currently no confirmed cases of coronavirus (WN Co-V) in Scotland and the risk to the Scottish public remains low. \u201cFollowing travel to Wuhan, China, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for Wuhan Novel Coronavirus as a precautionary measure only. Three further people are also undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis. \u201cAs the situation develops we will update should there be any confirmed cases of coronavirus, rather than provide a running update on cases being considered on a precautionary basis.\u201d Universities UK, the representative organisation for the sector, said: \u201cUK universities with students in affected areas have been closely monitoring the coronavirus situation as it unfolds and will follow the latest FCO advice. \u201cWe can confirm that this afternoon Universities UK International was in contact with Public Health England to discuss how we can support them in getting communications to our members.\u201d The National Union of Students also said it will continue to monitor the situation closely. Hi, I\u2019m Nadeem Badshah, taking over from my colleague Damien Gayle. Here\u2019s where we are so far: Latest official figures say the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China is at least 633, and 18 people have died. Chinese authorities have put five cities on lockdown measures \u2013 Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi and Zhijiang. The virus was first reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31 December 2019. WHO says the outbreak was caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, a broad family of infections ranging from the common cold to more serious illnesses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars). Patients report a fever, cough and other symptoms of pneumonia. Coronaviruses mostly infect animals, but can mutate and jump to humans, and then human-to-human transmission is possible. Chinese authorities have confirmed that the virus is being passed directly from human to human. It appears to have originated in a seafood and meat market in Wuhan, and preliminary research suggests the virus was passed to humans from snakes. Three people in Scotland are being tested for the virus after travelling to Wuhan. Meanwhile, the UK health secretary said authorities were well-prepared to deal with a potential outbreak. Cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand and the US. Major airports are screening international arrivals from the region. Patients in all these cases were either residents of Wuhan or recent visitors to the city. An Indian nurse working in Saudi Arabia has also been confirmed to be infected, and two Chinese citizens in Vietnam have tested positive. Beijing has cancelled a number of major public events and restricted tourist access in the city in an attempt to contain the spread of the outbreak. There are not any medicines or vaccines developed specifically to tackle the Wuhan virus but experts in Davos announced on Thursday that scientists were working on one. A spokesman for Boris Johnson said the government will keep the coronavirus situation under continuous review. Stocks fell on Wall Street in midday trading Thursday as investors worried that a deadly virus outbreak in China could continue spreading and hurt the global economy, the Associated Press reports. Banks and other financial companies led the losses. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 1.72% from 1.77% late Wednesday. Financial institutions rely on higher bond yields to set lucrative interest rates on mortgages and other loans. Bank of America fell 1.5%. Health care stocks also broadly fell. Edwards LifeSciences, which makes heart valves, slipped 5.6%. Crude oil prices slumped and weighed on energy stocks. Exxon Mobil fell 1.5%. Utilities and real estate companies held onto slight gains as investors shifted money into the safe-play sectors. Three people in Scotland are being tested for suspected coronavirus after travelling to the country from Wuhan in China, Sarah Boseley reports. A statement from the Scottish government said there were three suspect cases. \u201cFollowing travel to Wuhan, China, two people confirmed as diagnosed with influenza are now being tested for Wuhan novel coronavirus as a precautionary measure only. A third person is also currently undergoing testing on a similar precautionary basis,\u201d said a government spokesman. \u201cThere are currently no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and the risk to the Scottish public remains low.\u201d Tests are being undertaken to rule out coronavirus at a hospital in Belfast, PA Media reports. It is understood a patient did arrive at the Royal Victoria in the west of the city showing symptoms which may or may not be associated with the condition but it will be some time before results are returned. The Belfast Health Trust, which runs services in the city, was unable to make any comment. The Public Health Agency (PHA) also declined to comment. There is no suggestion at this stage that the patient has coronavirus. The Royal is Northern Ireland\u2019s largest hospital and a centre for many medical specialisms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has followed the UK foreign office in warning people to avoid all non-essential to Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. CDC raised its travel alert for the coronavirus outbreak to a level 3. The agency earlier this week said it expects to see more cases of the Wuhan coronavirus in the United States and announced plans to expand screening to airports in Atlanta and Chicago. China\u2019s Hebei provincial health authority said a patient infected with the new coronavirus has died, marking the first confirmed death outside Hubei province where the outbreak began. The Health Commission of Hebei Province said in a statement dated Thursday that the patient, 80, died on Wednesday but was not confirmed to have been infected with the virus until Thursday, Reuters reports. The death toll from the outbreak now stands at 18. Airports around the world are implementing screening checks for passengers with potential coronavirus infections. Italy received its latest direct flight from Wuhan on Thursday morning, with 202 passengers directed through a special \u201chealth channel\u201d at Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport, where they were subject to body temperature checks. The Italian health ministry had announced the special measures a day before. \u201cThe health checks arranged by the health ministry at Fiumicino airport on the 202 passengers and the crew that arrived in Rome this morning on a flight from Wuhan were all negative,\u201d Carlo Racani, the health director for the Rome airports company told ANSA. \u201cThey are all well\u201d. A number of universities in Scotland have student exchange arrangements with Chinese institutions, Libby Brooks reports. Glasgow University has a partnership agreement with the Zhongnan University of Economics and Law in Wuhan, where the current outbreak began, with 23 students currently studying at Glasgow on that programme. The university issued guidance to its students yesterday to follow the advice being issued on the Coronavirus outbreak, adding: \u201cWe are conscious that our students may have family and friends in the locality and our thoughts are with anyone who may have been affected\u201d. Dundee University also has a joint education partnership with the University of Wuhan, with 34 students currently studying in Scotland. A spokesperson for the Dundee University said: \u201cThere have been no health concerns raised among that group but we will continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d Five staff members returned from a visit to Wuhan last week, but again, the spokesperson said that \u201cno health concerns have been raised at this time\u201d. A spokesman for the University of Dundee told PA it had issued advice to students recently in China and said they should be careful if receiving items, especially food, from areas where the virus is present. Professor Juergen Haas, the specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh, who confirmed the Scottish tests, explained: \u201cHere at the University of Edinburgh we have more than 2,000 students from China and they are always coming and going back to China so we are relatively sure we will have cases in the UK from travellers coming back from China.\u201d The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has updated its advice for Britons planning to travel to China, warning against \u201call but essential travel to Wuhan.\u201d The FCO\u2019s advice, updated yesterday and still current, says: The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advise against all but essential travel to Wuhan city, Hubei Province. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak. Public Health England has offered advice to travellers. You should comply with any additional screening measures put in place by the local authorities. That Public Health England advice linked to in the above quote announced that screening measures were being put in place for passengers arriving in Heathrow from the thrice-weekly direct flights between the UK and Wuhan. The enhanced monitoring package includes a number of measures that will help to provide advice to travellers if they feel unwell. For those travelling back directly from Wuhan, this includes a Port Health team who will meet each direct flight aircraft to provide advice and support to those that feel unwell. The team will include the Principal Port Medical Inspector, Port Health Doctor, Administrative Support, and Team Leader. They will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers about symptoms and what to do if they become ill. Mandarin and Cantonese language support will be available to Public Health England (PHE) and leaflets will be available to passengers. Top experts on infectious diseases have held a hastily-arranged press conference on the Coronavirus at the World Economic Forum this afternoon, reports Graeme Wearden in Davos. Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust gave reporters a swift explanation -- about how the virus probably jumped from bats to humans at a market in Wutan, before then starting to spread between humans. The fact the virus spreads between humans through the respiratory route makes it particularly serious, Farrar explained; experts have been worrying about this happening for some time. Farrar said: We want to keep a calm, moderated approach, but we need to take this incredibly seriously Farrar, who says he\u2019s \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the situation, also warned against thinking of it as a China-only problem: This will become a global issue. This isn\u2019t just a China issue, it\u2019s going to affect us all. Richard Hatchett, Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), announced that three new partnerships with vaccine producers have just been agreed (see previous post). Hatchett and Farrar both spoke about the importance of using non-pharmaceutical interventions, until a vaccine is developed. That includes public health measures -- hand-washing, keeping people apart, masks, and travel restrictions. Farrar\u2019s hunch is that the coronavirus will have a lower mortality rate than the SARS epidemic 28 years ago, which killed 788 people. But if it spreads faster and further than SARS, and isn\u2019t controlled in time, then the death toll could be higher than SARS. But there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. He reminded reporters that the influenza epidemic a century ago had a low mortality rate, but killed 50m people because it spread so far. There\u2019s more in our Davos liveblog: Three separate research teams backed by a global coalition set up to fight epidemic diseases are to start work on developing potential vaccines against the new coronavirus that has caused a disease outbreak in China, Reuters reports. Developing new vaccines has traditionally taken up to a decade, but the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), which is funding two of the projects and co-funding the third, said the aim now is to work much faster. Its plan is to have at least one potential vaccine in clinical trials by June, offering the chance that a shot could fully developed, tested and approved for use in a year. The research will be conducted by drug and vaccine developer Moderna working with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the U.S. firm Inovio Pharma ; and a team at the University of Queensland, Australia. The new coronavirus, known as nCoV-2019, first appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan but cases have been detected as far away as the United States. It has killed 17 people and infected more than 600. Each of the three projects will test a distinct scientific approach to developing a preventative vaccine. \u201cOur aspiration with these technologies is to bring a new pathogen from gene sequence to clinical testing in 16 weeks,\u201d said Richard Hatchett, CEPI\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThere are no guarantees of success, but we hope this work could provide a significant and important step forward in developing a vaccine for this disease.\u201d But it has to be said that there are no vaccines against either SARS or MERS yet, so perhaps they are being a little ambitious. Five Chinese cities have been put on lockdown and Beijing has cancelled a number of major public events in an attempt to contain the spread of a deadly coronavirus outbreak. Authorities banned transport links from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, on Thursday morning, suspending buses, subways, ferries and shutting the airport and train stations to outgoing passengers. Later in the day, the nearby central Chinese cities of Huanggang, Ezhou and Chiba also announced traffic restrictions to prevent residents from leaving. Starting at midnight, long-distance buses, the rapid transit system, and train station in Huanggang would be shut, according to a notice from the local government. Movie theatres, internet cafes, and other entertainment venues would all stop operating. Residents should not leave the city, except for \u201cspecial reasons\u201d. What is the virus causing illness in Wuhan? It is a novel coronavirus \u2013 that is to say, a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. What are the symptoms caused by the Wuhan coronavirus? The virus causes pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another? Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed by China\u2019s national health commission, although it does not appear to be happening easily as was the case with Sars. As of 23 January the Chinese authorities had acknowledged 517 cases and 17 deaths. The virus has also been confirmed outside China, in the US, Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan. How worried are the experts? There are fears that the coronavirus may spread more widely during the week-long lunar new year holidays, which start on 24 January, when millions of Chinese people travel home to celebrate. At the moment, it appears that people in poor health are at greatest risk, as is always the case with flu. Should we panic? No. This is a very truncated version of a much more detailed coronavirus explainer running elsewhere on the site. Read more here: In case you have not been following the story of the coronavirus outbreak, here is an outline of the past three weeks of developments, since first reports began emerging from China at the beginning of the month. It is around three weeks since the first cases emerged in Wuhan, east China of an unexplained viral pneumonia, sparking fears of a recurrence of the Sars outbreak of 2002-03 that killed more than 700 people. By 5 January, 59 suspected cases of the new outbreak had been diagnosed, with the most common symptom being fever, and shortness of breath and lung infections appearing in a smaller number of cases. People were being isolated while they received treatment. Most of the cases were of workers, handlers or frequent visitors to one food market in Wuhan city, the Huanan South China Seafood Market. On 11 January, the disease claimed its first victim, a 61-year-old man who was a regular buyer at the Huanan market. As alarm spread, the World Health Organization said a newly emerging member of the family of viruses that caused the deadly outbreaks of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers) could be the cause of the outbreak. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to Sars. Some of the virus types cause less serious disease, while some like the one that causes Mers are far more severe The outbreak came at a particularly mobile time for Chinese people, with millions on the move to be with loved ones for the lunar new year, so it was inevitable that the virus would spread. The first case outside China was detected in Thailand on 14 January, in a woman who had travelled to the country from China. Japan confirmed its first case two days later, but as recently as last weekend \u2013 and despite a second death in China from the virus \u2013 no screening was taking place in airports in the UK or Australia. On Tuesday US and Australian health officials announced their first domestic cases, at the same time as Chinese doctors confirmed human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus and airports around the world began introducing screening checks for visitors from affected regions. At first minister\u2019s questions this morning, Nicola Sturgeon gave assurances that the Scottish government and its health protection agency were closely monitoring the situation. She said: I should say that the risk to the public in Scotland and, indeed, in the United Kingdom is currently classified as low, but obviously that is kept under review. Health Protection Scotland is liaising with National Health Service boards and is currently in daily contact with Public Health England and liaising daily with colleagues in the UK Department of Health and Social Care. We are also paying close attention to the decisions of and advice from the World Health Organization. Enhanced monitoring measures have been implemented for flights from Wuhan city to Heathrow. Those will involve each flight being met by a port health team, who will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers. We are considering whether any further information could helpfully be provided at Scottish airports. Obviously, the situation is evolving and we will monitor it extremely closely. The cabinet secretary for health and sport or I will ensure that parliament is appropriately updated in the days and weeks to come. Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. In the latest developments, three people in Scotland are being tested for the virus, as the World Health Organization\u2019s emergency committee meets for a second day to decide whether to categorise the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern. The head of infection medicine at the University of Edinburgh, Prof J\u00fcrgen Haas, said he believed there would be many more cases from other cities in the UK. He said three suspected cases were in Edinburgh and the other was believed to be in Glasgow. Tests are being carried out and none of the patients have yet been confirmed as having the virus. They all travelled to Scotland from Wuhan in China, where the outbreak is thought to have originated, within the past two weeks and are showing symptoms of respiratory trouble \u2013 a red flag for the virus.",

      "body": "<p>Zhu Wenyi, 21, has spent the eve of the lunar new year at home, worrying whether or not she has caught a deadly virus that has spread from her province to much of the rest of the country.</p> \n<p>Zhu, a university student, is back in her hometown of Huangshi, one of 10 cities in Hubei province, including Wuhan, that have been locked down in an attempt to contain the virus this week. She recently stayed at a friend\u2019s in Wuhan who later developed a fever, one of the virus\u2019s symptoms. The friend recovered, but Zhu is still anxious.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m so worried, I feel like I\u2019m having trouble breathing,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople accuse the Wuhan government of acting too slow. It\u2019s true, they did.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Chinese authorities scramble to restrict an illness that emerged a month ago, citizens are asking whether their government has failed them by failing to disclose information and not acting decisively or early enough.</p> \n<p>Less than a week ago, officials in Wuhan, where the virus was detected, said the mystery illness posed little danger and there was no evidence it could be passed from human to human.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But while public health officials have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/jan/23/china-coronavirus-sars-cover-up-beijing-disease-dissent\">applauded China\u2019s improvements since Sars</a>, as the outbreak widens, residents, especially in Hubei, are losing faith.</p> \n<p>\u201cBefore, I always believed what the government said.

      "bodyText": "Zhu Wenyi, 21, has spent the eve of the lunar new year at home, worrying whether or not she has caught a deadly virus that has spread from her province to much of the rest of the country. Zhu, a university student, is back in her hometown of Huangshi, one of 10 cities in Hubei province, including Wuhan, that have been locked down in an attempt to contain the virus this week. She recently stayed at a friend\u2019s in Wuhan who later developed a fever, one of the virus\u2019s symptoms. The friend recovered, but Zhu is still anxious. \u201cI\u2019m so worried, I feel like I\u2019m having trouble breathing,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople accuse the Wuhan government of acting too slow. It\u2019s true, they did.\u201d As Chinese authorities scramble to restrict an illness that emerged a month ago, citizens are asking whether their government has failed them by failing to disclose information and not acting decisively or early enough. Less than a week ago, officials in Wuhan, where the virus was detected, said the mystery illness posed little danger and there was no evidence it could be passed from human to human. China\u2019s national health commission said the situation was \u201cpreventable\u201d and \u201ccontrollable\u201d. On Monday, the number of confirmed cases suddenly tripled and a respected scientist said the virus, believed to have originated from an animal, was now being transmitted by people. Late on Friday the official death toll in China rose to 41 with more than 1,000 confirmed cases across almost every province in China, as well as South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand and Vietnam. On Friday the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three cases. \u201cThis was most definitely not \u2018preventable and controllable\u2019\u2026 all these mistakes will be borne by the common people,\u201d one internet user wrote on the microblog Weibo. This weekend the cost is being felt by millions of Chinese citizens who will be isolated and nervous on the most important holiday of the year, lunar new year on 25 January. For many Chinese, especially those working in provinces far from their hometowns, it is the only time of the year they are able to go home. Many families have cancelled plans to get together.

      "body": "<p>There are no vaccines or treatments approved for the new coronavirus, but the race is on to develop one.</p> <p>This week the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) <a href=\"https://cepi.net/news_cepi/cepi-to-fund-three-programmes-to-develop-vaccines-against-the-novel-coronavirus-ncov-2019/\">announced it would commit $11m</a> (\u00a38.4m) to three programmes led by the companies Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Moderna and the University of Queensland.</p> <p>Cepi, which is funded by several countries and philanthropic donors, was set up three years ago in the wake of the Ebola epidemic, which killed 11,000 people. Despite an Ebola vaccine (later shown to be almost 100% effective) having been in development for a decade, it was not deployed until more than a year into the epidemic.</p> <p>This time the aim is to have a viable vaccine in production within as little as 16 weeks \u2013 although testing for safety and efficacy will take longer.</p> <p>One advantage is that the new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, belongs to the same family as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), for which a vaccine was developed following the 2002 outbreak. \u201cCertainly that information will give us a head start,\u201d said Prof Brendan Wren, dean of the faculty of infectious and tropical diseases at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/corona_correct-zip/giv-3902Tg7eIgOVMRQM\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/corona_correct-zip/giv-3902Tg7eIgOVMRQM\">Graphic</a> </figure>  <p>According to Wren vaccine technology has also advanced significantly since the Sars outbreak. Traditional vaccines work by developing an attenuated version of a virus \u2013 one that looks similar enough that the body\u2019s immune system will recognise the real version in the future. But the latest efforts will use entirely different approaches. \u201cThey\u2019re all new technologies and have a lot of promise for being able to do things very rapidly,\u201d said Richard Hatchett, CEO of Cepi.</p> <p>One of the teams is working on a so-called DNA vaccine.

      "bodyText": "There are no vaccines or treatments approved for the new coronavirus, but the race is on to develop one. This week the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) announced it would commit $11m (\u00a38.4m) to three programmes led by the companies Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Moderna and the University of Queensland. Cepi, which is funded by several countries and philanthropic donors, was set up three years ago in the wake of the Ebola epidemic, which killed 11,000 people. Despite an Ebola vaccine (later shown to be almost 100% effective) having been in development for a decade, it was not deployed until more than a year into the epidemic. This time the aim is to have a viable vaccine in production within as little as 16 weeks \u2013 although testing for safety and efficacy will take longer. One advantage is that the new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, belongs to the same family as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), for which a vaccine was developed following the 2002 outbreak. \u201cCertainly that information will give us a head start,\u201d said Prof Brendan Wren, dean of the faculty of infectious and tropical diseases at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). According to Wren vaccine technology has also advanced significantly since the Sars outbreak. Traditional vaccines work by developing an attenuated version of a virus \u2013 one that looks similar enough that the body\u2019s immune system will recognise the real version in the future. But the latest efforts will use entirely different approaches. \u201cThey\u2019re all new technologies and have a lot of promise for being able to do things very rapidly,\u201d said Richard Hatchett, CEO of Cepi. One of the teams is working on a so-called DNA vaccine. The aim is to find the specific stretch of DNA that codes for the receptor on the virus\u2019 surface that allows the immune system to target it. In theory, if this DNA is injected into a person, it should enter their cells, which would start churning out proteins that look exactly like the receptor on the surface of the virus. These little floating receptors would then trigger the immune system without causing any illness. Even if a viable vaccine is found quickly, it will still need to go through further months of testing, careful decisions would need to be made about who should be vaccinated \u2013 health workers are typically the first in line. \u201cEven if you\u2019ve got a relatively rare side effect you have to worry about that if you\u2019re vaccinating millions of people,\u201d said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at LSHTM. Whether a vaccine will ever need to be deployed is an open question. Sars was brought under control with public health measures, and possibly because it mutated into a less virulent strain. The vaccine was shelved and never licensed. \u201cWhen you have a new outbreak that moves as quickly as this one has you have to use the precautionary principle,\u201d said Hatchett. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019re in a situation where you know you need a vaccine to begin making one.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Buzyn added that the cases involved people who had travelled to China and two of them were from the same family.</p> \n<p>Chinese officials shut part of the Great Wall and suspended public transport in the affected cities, stranding millions of people at the start of the lunar new year holiday amid growing anger about the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. Beijing\u2019s famous temple fairs, a tradition during lunar new year celebrations, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-spreads-in-china-with-three-cities-in-lockdown\">will not go ahead</a>, while Shanghai Disneyland announced it would also close indefinitely.

With tests still in process on several other possible cases,the health secretary, Matt Hancock, chaired a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee to ensure appropriate measures were in place should the virus reach the UK.</p> \n<p>Leaving Whitehall after the meeting, he told reporters that the risk remained low.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18778781f241d89a612826ec8830d3c58f0870e7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18778781f241d89a612826ec8830d3c58f0870e7/0_0_5429_3258/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists visiting Edinburgh Castle wear face masks</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>However chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty cautioned that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that cases would be seen in the UK.

Medical experts also remained at every UK airport with information on the virus being given to passengers returning from China.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, private schools were also gearing with contingency plans for overseas pupils who were unable or unwilling to return home for upcoming holidays. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country.</p> \n<p>In Wuhan, the city in Hubei that is the epicentre of the disease, hospitals were struggling with an overflow of patients and a lack of supplies. At least eight hospitals in the city made pleas for donations of masks, goggles, gowns and other protective medical gear. Administrators at Wuhan University People\u2019s hospital set up a group chat on the popular WeChat messaging app to coordinate donations.</p> \n<p>It is feared that the lunar new year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country and abroad, could fuel the spread of the virus.

      "bodyText": "China has expanded an unprecedented lockdown during the country\u2019s most important holiday to 13 cities and at least 36 million people, as efforts to contain the deadly new coronavirus were stepped up around the world and the first cases were reported in Europe. Restrictions on movement were widened on Friday in China in an effort to stop the spread of the disease. Late on Friday, authorities confirmed a further 15 deaths and 180 new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of fatalities to 41 people and more than 1,000 affected. Cases have been reported across South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, the United States, Thailand and Vietnam. On Friday the first cases were reported in Europe with France saying it had identified three cases. The French health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, said it was likely there would be other cases. Buzyn added that the cases involved people who had travelled to China and two of them were from the same family. Chinese officials shut part of the Great Wall and suspended public transport in the affected cities, stranding millions of people at the start of the lunar new year holiday amid growing anger about the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. Beijing\u2019s famous temple fairs, a tradition during lunar new year celebrations, will not go ahead, while Shanghai Disneyland announced it would also close indefinitely. McDonald\u2019s announced that it has also suspended its businesses in five affected cities. The developments came as: The virus claimed its first victims outside Hubei as well as its youngest victim, a 36-year-old man who was admitted to hospital in the central province earlier this month but died following a sudden cardiac arrest on Thursday. Authorities in China were racing against the clock to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease within days. The US, South Korea and Japan detected their second cases, and Singapore reported two more, for a total of three. In the UK, tests for the virus on 14 people were reported to have come back negative as the government sought to calm public concern. With tests still in process on several other possible cases,the health secretary, Matt Hancock, chaired a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee to ensure appropriate measures were in place should the virus reach the UK. Leaving Whitehall after the meeting, he told reporters that the risk remained low. However chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty cautioned that it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that cases would be seen in the UK. But he stressed that contingency plans were ready for that eventuality. British universities meanwhile began taking measures to stop the spread of the virus warning students considering travelling home to China that they risk being quarantined on their return. Medical experts also remained at every UK airport with information on the virus being given to passengers returning from China. Elsewhere, private schools were also gearing with contingency plans for overseas pupils who were unable or unwilling to return home for upcoming holidays. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country. In Wuhan, the city in Hubei that is the epicentre of the disease, hospitals were struggling with an overflow of patients and a lack of supplies. At least eight hospitals in the city made pleas for donations of masks, goggles, gowns and other protective medical gear. Administrators at Wuhan University People\u2019s hospital set up a group chat on the popular WeChat messaging app to coordinate donations. It is feared that the lunar new year holiday, when hundreds of millions of people travel across the country and abroad, could fuel the spread of the virus. A growing number of airports are introducing screening for passengers who arrive from China. China says the virus, which is from the same family of viruses as Sars, is mutating and can be transmitted through human contact. Some have questioned if the closures of airports and train stations in Wuhan on Thursday morning were introduced too late, since many residents will already have set off for the holiday. On Friday, the People\u2019s Daily, the Chinese Communist party\u2019s main newspaper, called for people who have recently been to Wuhan to isolate themselves at home, even if they don\u2019t have symptoms. Beijing is to take stricter and more targeted measures in the coming days, state television reported, without giving further details. \u201cThe spread of the virus has not been cut off \u2026 Local authorities should take more responsibility and have a stronger sense of urgency,\u201d state broadcaster CCTV said. The World Health Organization stopped short of declaring the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, but called on the global community to work together to fight the virus. Other cities, including Ezhou, Huanggang, Chibi, Qianjiang, Zhijiang, Jingmen and Xiantao have introduced similar measures. In Zhijiang city, all public venues have been shut down except hospitals, supermarkets, farmers\u2019 markets, gas stations and drug stores. Indoor entertainment venues in Enshi city have also been shut down. There is suspicion among many in China that officials may be downplaying the number of cases recorded over recent weeks, recalling the government\u2019s reluctance to disclose the full scale of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which killed almost 800 people. Some residents have set up volunteer groups to escort medical staff to and from hospitals, she said. All public transport has been suspended and taxi drivers are often reluctant to drive people to medical facilities, fearing they might be infected. People who sought treatment in Wuhan this week told the Guardian they had been turned away from hospitals, which have been inundated with patients.

The initial symptoms are similar to those of a cold and flu, and include a cough or fever. Most of the people who have died in the outbreak have been older men, but on Friday it was confirmed that a 36-year-old man had died, the youngest person yet. Footage posted on Weibo that appeared to be taken inside Wuhan\u2019s hospitals, showed overcrowded facilities that are struggling to cope.

The man filming claimed there were only four doctors on duty and that people had been waiting for several hours for treatment.

He was mostly staying indoors, he said, but friends who lived nearby had been round to visit.
