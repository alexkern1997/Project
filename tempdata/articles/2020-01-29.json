      "bodyText": "Australia has unveiled plans to evacuate some of its nationals from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, flying the most \u201cisolated and vulnerable\u201d of 600 citizens to quarantine on Christmas Island. In a joint operation with New Zealand, which has about 50 citizens in the city at the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak, Australians will be evacuated from the locked-down city on a \u201clast-in first-out\u201d basis. Christmas Island, located 2,600km from the Australian mainland in the Indian Ocean, is the site of a notorious immigration detention facility that currently houses a Sri Lankan family of four. All those who are evacuated on the charter flight will be quarantined in the detention centre for up to 14 days, the internationally recognised incubation period for the virus. The chartered Qantas flight follows the Japanese and US governments flying citizens out of Wuhan on Wednesday morning, and plans by France, Indonesia and other countries for similar evacuations. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said his government would move to extricate its citizens from Wuhan as quickly as possible. \u201cWe have taken a decision this morning to prepare a plan for an operation to provide some assisted departures for isolated and vulnerable Australians in Wuhan and the Hubei province. \u201cThis will be done subject obviously to working closely and with the authority and approval of the Chinese government.\u201d Australians evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined on Christmas Island will be asked to pay some or all of the costs of their transport and quarantine. \u201cThey will also be required to commit to making a contribution to the cost, consistent with normal arrangements in these circumstances,\u201d a government statement said. Morrison stressed there was \u201ca limited window\u201d to extricate foreign nationals, and said the last-in-first-out basis would prioritise Australians who were short-term visitors to Hubei province, and who did not have family or other support, rather than those who lived in the province or who had been there for longer periods. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly focused on the more vulnerable components of that population. That\u2019s young people, particularly infants, and those who are elderly and that would be our priority in any operation we\u2019re able to put in place.\u201d On Wednesday the death toll from the virus reached 132 in China and there are more than 5,900 confirmed cases of infection on the mainland. There have been no deaths from coronavirus outside China. Morrison said it could not be guaranteed that the Australian plane could land and evacuate the Australian and New Zealand citizens. \u201cI want to stress that \u2026 we cannot give a guarantee that this operation is able to succeed and I also want to stress very clearly that we may not be in a position if we\u2019re able to do this on one occasion to do it on another occasion. \u201cThere are many complications and many issues that we\u2019re going to have to overcome.\u201d The prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, said her government was in close contact with Chinese authorities over New Zealand nationals, and working closely with Australia. \u201cI spoke with prime minister Morrison again this afternoon and we have confirmed that we will work together on a joint Anzac-assisted departure of Australians and New Zealanders from Wuhan. \u201cSpecific details of the evacuation plan, including the medical protocols that will be applied to returning New Zealanders, and access arrangements on the ground in China, are being worked through by officials.\u201d The Australian foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said just over 600 Australians were registered as being in Hubei, which has been under a militarily enforced lockdown for nearly a week. Payne said the Australian government had upgraded its travel advice, saying Australians should reconsider their need to travel to China, and not to travel to Hubei province. The New Zealand government followed suit on Wednesday. \u201cChinese authorities have restricted travel for parts of the country and may extend these restrictions at short notice,\u201d the New Zealand advice says. \u201cTravellers may be quarantined, due to their health condition or previous location.\u201d There are five confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia \u2013 four in New South Wales and one in Victoria \u2013 but the federal chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said this number was expected to rise. He said the risk was \u201cextremely low\u201d, adding: \u201cWe want to stress that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in Australia.\u201d Authorities are still working to trace all human contact made by infected patients since they entered the country from China. Morrison said the Christmas Island immigration detention centre would be repurposed as a quarantine centre, augmented by medical and military logistics teams. Currently the detention centre is being used to house just four people \u2013 Sri Lankan couple Priya and Nades Murugappan, and their Australian-born daughters Kopika and Tharunicaa.

I therefore flag the following as issues to be considered in the wake of recent events, namely:</em></p> <ul> <li><em>The constitutional and legal framework that would allow the Commonwealth to declare a national state of emergency - with clear authorities and appropriate safeguards for Commonwealth action on its own initiative, including the deployment of our defence force;</em></li> <li><em>The legal interface with the states and territories on responsibilities when it comes to preparation for, and response to, natural disasters and emergencies of national scale; </em></li> <li><em>An enhanced national accountability for natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness.

      "bodyText": "Let\u2019s do a quick recap of what we know. Despite weather in the mid 30s, benign wind conditions on Wednesday mean the ACT Emergency Services Agency has been able to downgrade the Orroral Valley fire from watch and act to an advice level bushfire warning. The blaze began on Monday when a defence helicopter landed in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra, and accidentally sparked what authorities have called the city\u2019s \u201cmost serious\u201d bushfire threat since the city\u2019s devastating 2003 fires. Tuesday saw dramatic images of the fire approaching Canberra\u2019s southern suburbs, but conditions eased throughout the evening and the fire was downgraded from emergency level to watch and act just before midnight. The fire has now burned through 10,492ha, and earlier the ESA\u2019s incident controller, Matthew Shonk, warned conditions are expected to deteriorate in coming days. Friday and Saturday are expected to be especially challenging, with temperatures due to reach 42C and westerly and north-westerly winds increasing. Dangerous weather conditions will hit much of the east and south-east of Australia. In the coming days temperatures are expected to exceed 40C in Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne, while some places \u2013 such as Cummins in South Australia, Echuca in northern Victoria, and Griffith in inland NSW \u2013 are expected to reach 45C. ACT emergency service personnel, police and defence force members are door-knocking residents in the southern Canberra suburbs of Banks, Gordon and Conder to remind them about the importance of having a bushfire survival plan. Good news. The ACT Emergency Services Agency has downgraded the Orroral Valley fire from watch and act to an advice level. It says there is now limited activity on the eastern edge of the fire, although there is an increase in fire activity on the western side of the fire. Active fire remains on the northern side of the fireground. The fire remains out of control. \u201cFirefighters are on scene patrolling, preparing for property protection and strengthening containment lines,\u201d the ESA says. \u201cThe ACT\u2019s specialist intelligence gathering helicopter is conducting aerial surveillance. People in the area may be affected by smoke, which could reduce visibility and air quality.\u201d I\u2019ll leave Morrison there because he moves on to emissions reductions and then, of course, questions about the controversial sports grants program overseen by Bridget McKenzie. Morrison: As the years pass, though, we note that the bush grows back and fuel loads increase and people move in in still larger numbers to live in fire-prone areas and dangerous fires occur again in a cycle which we must break. We must continue to [learn] from this fire season so we are better prepared for the next one because, of course, there\u2019ll be one. Whether that be the deployment of the defence forces, local hazard reduction, access to resources such as aerial firefighting equipment, consistency of disaster recovery arrangements or resilience in the face of a changing climate. And we must learn, as I discussed only last week, from the Indigenous Australians and their ancient practices and how to improve our resilience to these threats. Morrison points to the use of Australian defence force reservists as evidence the government has responded to the crisis, but says before the next bushfire season he will look at legislative changes including giving the commonwealth the power to declare a national state of emergency. He also flags changes to the \u201clegal interface\u201d between the commonwealth and states and territories on responsibilities when it comes to preparing for and responding to natural disasters and emergencies on a national scale. Morrison also flags \u201can enhancement of a national accountability framework for natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness\u201d. \u201cThis should include the setting of targeting and transparent reporting on key actions with enhanced national standards where necessary,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be comparing apples with apples.\u201d He says that before the events of this summer the role of the commonwealth in responding to natural disasters \u201chas been limited to responding to requests for assistance for state governments\u201d. \u201cThe scale of the bushfires this season, not least their simultaneous reach across many borders, has demonstrated to me the limits of these arrangements,\u201d he says. Morrison says the events of this summer have \u201creminded us that our national security is also about our preparedness, responsiveness and resilience to the natural disasters and the environment we will live in \u2013 today, over the next decade, and well beyond\u201d. Morrison says that \u201camidst this devastation\u201d it has been \u201chumbling to see Australia as its best\u201d. In recounting the stories of their selflessness as I did on Australia Day, my message was very simple: this is the greatness of Australia. This is the strength of Australia. This is why, as a people, we always overcome and prevail. Australia is strong, but we must become even stronger. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, begins his National Press Club address by acknowledging the families who have lost loved ones throughout the bushfire season. Your sorrow hangs heavy on our nation\u2019s heart and that heart is extended also to all of those who now face the daunting task of rebuilding homes, livelihoods, businesses, and local communities. \u201cWe\u2019ll be with you for the long haul. Many Australians, as well as our loyal friends from overseas who are standing here with us, remain on those frontlines today at some 75 or so fires burning around the country. \u201cOur brave firefighters, our emergency service workers, our volunteers, our soldiers, our reservists ... our mental health specialists, local community leaders, public servants as well as the networks of civil society are engaged in all manner of very practical, helpful, loving tasks from delivering food to rescuing and supporting recovering wildlife.\u201d It\u2019s not just the ACT that will see dangerous fire conditions increase as we get closer to the weekend. In the coming days temperatures are expected to exceed 40C in Adelaide, Canberra and Melbourne, while some places, such as Cummins in South Australia, Echuca in northern Victoria and Griffith in inland NSW, are expected to reach 45C. BOM meteorologist Diana Eadie told AAP on Wednesday that a hot air mass causing scorching temperatures across large parts of Western Australia will move across the country along with an increase in humidity. \u201cAs a result we\u2019re expecting severe to extreme heatwave conditions to develop across much of the south-east of Australia,\u201d she said. Eadie said many areas would experience uncomfortable overnight temperatures, including Adelaide where it would not drop below 28C on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing those severe to extreme heatwave conditions because when you don\u2019t get those temperatures dropping off overnight, it doesn\u2019t allow the body to recover.\u201d Eadie said the heatwave would bring elevated fire dangers, peaking on Thursday in South Australia, Friday in Victoria and Tasmania, and Saturday in fire-affected areas including the ACT and southern parts of NSW. \u201cWhilst we\u2019ll see those warm temperatures and strengthening winds, it\u2019s not as dry as what we\u2019ve seen with previous events, which is why at this stage we\u2019re only forecasting severe fire dangers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite as dangerous as previous situations ... because we do have that moisture over fire-affected areas.\u201d Some Australians are ignoring potentially life saving emergency alerts during disasters because they fear they are being scammed, says Queensland University of Technology associate professor Amisha Mehta. Mehta has told AAP that emergency alerts with a link to a website are often mistaken as a scam or computer virus by younger and older people. It is the latest challenge facing emergency authorities during times of natural disasters, Mehta says. Remember when the ACT was hit by a vicious hailstorm... last week. I\u2019ve just spoken to Abrar Shabren, a forecaster from the Bureau of Meteorology, who has given me a rundown on the weather fire crews in the ACT will face in the coming days. While the temperature will rise quite steeply as this afternoon goes on, with a forecast high of 36C, quite benign easterly and south-easterly winds are expected to keep things in check. However, conditions are expected to begin deteriorating from tomorrow until Sunday. Temperatures are expected to rise to 39C on Thursday before hitting 42C on Friday and Saturday, driven by increasing westerly winds. \u201cAround midmorning to midday on Friday the winds will start becoming north-westerly and that\u2019s when that hot surge comes in,\u201d he sais. \u201cIn the beginning those winds will be light, between 10 and 15km/h then 15 to 20km/h, so not the strong winds we\u2019ve seen in previous weeks with those high pressure systems bringing in quite strong winds. \u201cBut on Saturday we will see that wind increasing on the fire grounds, so dry, hot and strong winds probably about 30, 40 and 50km/h. In the elevated areas and high peaks the wind gusts will be a bit stronger than that. \u201cThat will drop off in the evening on Saturday and then through to Sunday winds become easterly and quite light.\u201d Looks like the bulk of Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference will be about the unfolding coronavirus but he begins by calling the fires in Canberra \u201ca reminder again that we\u2019re a long way from the end of this bushfire season\u201d. The Orroral Valley fire in the ACT has now burnt through 10,079 hectares. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is about to give a press conference in Canberra. I\u2019ll let you know if he touches on plans to expand the powers of the commonwealth to respond to national emergencies, which is expected to be a key focus of his National Press Club address today. Moving briefly to South Australia, AAP reports that authorities are bracing for a day of severe fire danger with special work to be conducted on the Kangaroo Island fire ground. Earthmoving equipment, water tankers and extra fire crews are being sent to strategic locations ahead of a day of high bushfire risk. The blaze is officially contained but the Country Fire Service says crews are still finding hotspots in various areas including Blue Gum Hills, Cygnet River and Vivonne Bay. The bushfire risk on Thursday is expected to be severe with a total fire ban to be put in place as temperatures soar. Adelaide is forecast to have a top of 42C with the mercury going even higher in some regional centres. The fire has already burned through more 210,000ha and destroyed more than 50 homes along with hundreds of other buildings, crops, livestock, wildlife and infrastructure including many kilometres of fencing. It also claimed two lives. Father and son Dick and Clayton Lang were killed when their car became engulfed in flames. From Tuesday night. A lot of ACT residents are comparing this fire to the devastating 2003 blaze. Just a reminder of where we\u2019re at. On Monday, a defence helicopter landed in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra, and accidentally sparked what authorities have called the city\u2019s \u201cmost serious\u201d bushfire threat since the city\u2019s devastating 2003 fires. Tuesday saw dramatic images of the fire approaching Canberra\u2019s southern suburbs, but conditions eased throughout the evening and the fire was downgraded from emergency level to watch and act just before midnight. The fire remains active though and is travelling in a north-east and easterly direction towards the communities of Mount Tennant, Tharwa Village, Boboyan Road and Top Naas Road. The ACT Emergency Services Agency says residents in those areas need to \u201cremain vigilant\u201d. If you do not need to be in the area, \u201cit is still best for your safety to not enter or return\u201d. Residents in the southern Canberra suburbs of Banks, Gordon, Conder, Calwell and Theodore should also continue to monitor conditions. While milder conditions today are helping fire authorities the Bureau of Meteorology is predicting extremely high temperatures and low humidity that will prove challenging. Temperatures today are still tipped to reach 36C though before rising to 39C on Thursday. On Friday the mercury will increase to at top 42C. It will be 42C again on Saturday, before showers and possible storm pass through on Sunday, with a top temperature of 35C. As Luke has written, fire crews are making the most of today\u2019s milder conditions before the expected temperature rise tomorrow and on Saturday. Today ACT emergency service personnel, police and defence force members are door knocking in the southern Canberra suburbs of Banks, Gordon and Conder. It\u2019s not an evacuation \u2013 no evacuation warnings have been issued for those suburbs \u2013 but the ACT Emergency Services Agency says they\u2019ll be there to \u201canswer any questions and to help ensure residents have a bushfire survival plan\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for now. My colleague Michael McGowan will be taking over for a while. And a reminder that Scott Morrison will be addressing the National Press Club this afternoon. The ABC has reported some comments from the ACT Emergency Services Agency\u2019s incident controller, Matthew Shonk, who says authorities do not expect the fire to return to emergency level today. But Shonk says the fire is not going to be put out today or tomorrow and that conditions will worsen in coming days. \u201cWe can\u2019t sugarcoat that in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe conditions that we saw yesterday could well pop up again. \u201cThere\u2019s challenging times coming up; we\u2019re not going to get this fire out today and not tomorrow. This is a campaign fire and we\u2019ll be working for some time.\u201d The fire is about 8km south of Banks, the most southern suburb in Canberra. Fire crews are hoping to make the most of today\u2019s milder conditions. The size of the fire is 10,079ha, according to the latest update from the ACT Emergency Services Agency. Whelan on what she called \u201cdisaster tourism\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019d had a number of reports from residents in the southern suburbs of the significant amount traffic coming into the southern suburbs last evening,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would appear we have a number of people who are coming into the suburbs to check out the fire, to take photographs, to undertake what I\u2019m calling disaster tourism. \u201cPlease refrain from doing this.\u201d We are seeing some amazing photographs of the Canberra fire. Many of these photographs will have come from safe vantage points or from a person\u2019s own property. However, the ACT\u2019s emergency services agency commissioner, Georgeina Whelan, is asking people not to engage in \u201cdisaster tourism\u201d by heading to head to Canberra\u2019s southern suburbs an Instagram shot. Scott Morrison will address the National Press Club today \u2013 and excerpts of his speech indicate a key theme will be expanding the powers of the commonwealth to respond to national emergencies. First, Morrison describes the problem as he sees it: \u201cTo date, the role of the Commonwealth in responding to natural disasters has been limited to responding to requests for assistance from state governments. They judge the time and form of support needed. The scale of the bushfires this season \u2013 not least their simultaneous reach across state borders \u2013 has unequivocally demonstrated the limits of those arrangements.\u201d And then, the solution: \u201cI believe, however, there is now a clear community expectation that the Commonwealth should have the ability to respond in times of national emergencies and disasters, particularly through deployment of our defence forces in circumstances where the life and property of Australians have been assessed to be under threat. ... I therefore flag the following as issues to be considered in the wake of recent events, namely: The constitutional and legal framework that would allow the Commonwealth to declare a national state of emergency - with clear authorities and appropriate safeguards for Commonwealth action on its own initiative, including the deployment of our defence force; The legal interface with the states and territories on responsibilities when it comes to preparation for, and response to, natural disasters and emergencies of national scale; An enhanced national accountability for natural disaster risk management, resilience and preparedness. This should include the setting of targets and transparent reporting on key actions, with enhanced national standards where necessary.\u201d Morrison will also give a bit more detail on his proposal for a royal commission into the bushfires, explaining its first take will be to \u201caudit the implementation of previous [inquiries\u2019] recommendations, drawing on work that has already been done in this area\u201d. This is some incredible footage from Martin Ollman, a photographer in Canberra. The weather over the coming days is expected to be very dry and hot in Canberra, the Bureau of Meteorology says. Wednesday is tipped to reach 36C, with the city shrouded in a smoke haze. Thursday will hit 39C, with more smoky conditions, while Friday the mercury will increase to at top 42C. It will be 42C again on Saturday, before showers and possible storm pass through on Sunday, with a top temperature of 35C. The current watch and act alert for the Orroral Valley fire warns residents in Tharwa Village, Boboyan Road, Apollo Road, and Top Naas Road to remain vigilant. \u201cMonitor conditions and know what you will do if the fire threatens,\u201d the ACT Emergency Services Agency says. \u201cIf you do not need to be in this area, it is still best for your safety to not enter or return.\u201d The agency says residents in Banks, Gordon, Condor, Calwell and Theodore should continue to monitor conditions. But it notes that no properties are under threat at this time. Yesterday, a fire started by a defence helicopter which landed in the Namadgi national park, south of Canberra, sparked what authorities called the city\u2019s \u201cmost serious\u201d bushfire threat since the city\u2019s devastating 2003 fires. The Orroral Valley fire has burnt through 9,500 hectares and is expected to grow, although it is now at a watch and act level. Moderate conditions overnight allowed firefighters at the scene to strengthen containment lines. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the bushfires threatening Canberra today. I\u2019m Luke Henriques-Gomes.",

      "bodyText": "Most of the UK\u2019s leading supermarket chains are making \u201csignificant progress\u201d in reducing antibiotics in farming, but Iceland, Asda and Aldi have been named as falling behind in a new study. Iceland was found to be the only major chain to have no publicly available policies on antibiotic use in its supply chain and no strategy in place to reduce the use of the vital medicines. Asda says it does not support the routine preventive use of antibiotics, but publicly lists no restrictions on such use, other than the UK\u2019s minimum legal requirements, which campaigners say are insufficient. Aldi says publicly that it recommends that routine use should be avoided by its suppliers. \u201cMore and more supermarkets are at last collecting some data and all but Iceland have some sort of strategy in place \u2013 that is progress,\u201d said C\u00f3il\u00edn Nunan, a scientific adviser to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, which carried out the research. A similar report in 2017 found most supermarkets were falling short of best practice. The UK\u2019s other leading supermarket chains in the survey \u2013 Co-op, Lidl, Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury\u2019s, Tesco, Waitrose and Morrisons \u2013 have all put in place bans on routine preventive dosing of livestock. Waitrose was named in the study as leading the pack, with \u201cthe most comprehensive antibiotic policies\u201d. M&amp;S and Tesco were next-best. The overuse of antibiotics is linked to the rise of superbugs and can also contribute to the evolution of dangerous viruses, similar to the coronavirus. Top medics, including England\u2019s former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies, have repeatedly warned that the rampant overuse of antibiotics is threatening a global disaster, as it gives rise to resistant germs which will mean common illnesses become untreatable. A spokesperson for Iceland said the retailer was revising its policy \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d to include a ban on the routine use of antibiotics, restrictions on critically important antibiotics, and a new strategy to reduce antibiotic use among its suppliers. \u201cWe are well aware that antibiotic overuse among farmed animals is an important issue for human health [and] have an established technical policy for Iceland\u2019s own label suppliers. We have always prohibited the use of growth promoters,\u201d said the company. Aldi said it had moved to ban the preventive use of antibiotics after being contacted several months ago by the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics for the purposes of the report. Asda said it complied with UK regulations, and added: \u201cWe publish all use of antibiotics on our website each year for complete transparency.\u201d Routine preventive dosing of healthy animals with antibiotics is also linked to the rise of potentially fatal viruses. Although the coronavirus recently discovered in Wuhan may have come from wild animals, similar outbreaks of viral diseases that spread to people \u2013 such as bird flu and swine flu \u2013 have been directly linked to intensive farming. Antibiotics are not used to treat viruses, but overusing antibiotics allows farmers to keep animals much more densely packed than would otherwise be possible, and in these conditions new viruses can rapidly emerge and flourish. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the coronavirus has come from \u2013 it could have come from wild animals,\u201d said Nunan. \u201cWe do know that the way antibiotics are used in intensive farming allows more animals to be kept in close proximity and in those conditions we know viruses can evolve and spread. So there is an indirect link.\u201d The report also found that Waitrose and M&amp;S were the only supermarkets that did not permit their suppliers to use colistin, an antibiotic of last resort used to treat life-threatening infections in people.

      "body": "<p>At 89, <a href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3508-a-eulogy-to-claudia-andujar\">Claudia Andujar </a>still has her work cut out. For five decades she has photographed the Yanomami indigenous people, an Amer-Indian tribe who number 33,000 and live in 192,000 square kilometres of rainforest that straddle the borders of Brazil and Venezuela. Until the early 20th century they had lived almost entirely in isolation from the outside world, but since then disease, deforestation and climate change have taken their toll.</p> <p>The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has proved a further threat. Vehemently against legislation protecting indigenous lands, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/jair-bolsonaro-racist-comment-sparks-outrage-indigenous-groups\">last week the far-right president commented</a>: \u201cIndians are undoubtedly changing \u2026 They are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI now put all my efforts into the activism, into addressing Brazil\u2019s political situation,\u201d Andujar says as she prepares <a href=\"https://www.fondationcartier.com/en/exhibitions/claudia-andujar-lalutteyanomami\">a retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris</a>, which shows a selection from a personal collection that runs to several thousand photographs. \u201cI no longer take photographs, but use my archive to show how I saw the Yanomami. This present government has no respect for them. They have no understanding of who they are as people.\u201d</p> <p>The changing nature of Andujar\u2019s work is chronicled in the show. Though the earliest images are straight documentary, the artist notes she was always more interested in striking up a human bond with her subjects than in approaching the work with professional detachment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad8912f3460ba23099e9a333874cb59989f397bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad8912f3460ba23099e9a333874cb59989f397bd/0_0_3548_2129/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New vision \u2026 a house on the Catrimani River, Roraima, shot on infrared film in 1976.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New vision \u2026 a house on the Catrimani River, Roraima, shot on infrared film in 1976.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudia Andujar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI decided very early that I would not photograph if I felt I did not have a connection with the person whose picture I was taking,\u201d she says. \u201cDeveloping an intimacy with the individual and community came first. The photography was always secondary to that.\u201d</p> <p>Immersing herself in the culture of the Yanomami, it soon became clear that she would never represent their worldview through conventional composition. Instead, employing techniques, including double exposure, long exposures, the use of coloured filters or smearing of vaseline on the lens, Andujar started to produce a body of work a lot stranger and more faithful, she says, to the experience of the Yanomami people.</p> <p>A room of the Paris show is dedicated to the shamanic rituals that are a key aspect to Yanomami cosmology. During these ceremonies the tribe believe spirits \u2013 <em>xapiri</em> \u2013 descend on the forest leaving trails of brilliant white light in their wake. Andujar represented this by shaking her camera as she took each photograph of the convulsing, gyrating shamans. One image shows a woman with her face obscured by curling trails of smoky white light dancing across the picture\u2019s surface.</p> <p>In another, a man, naked but for streaks of body paint, lies on the ground near a burning ball of light emitting from an unknown source. A funeral ceremony, in which the deceased is encased in a woven casket hung from a tree, is photographed through an otherworldly orange filter. A group of Yanomami are shown in layered multiples, using a double exposure, a way of reflecting the rhythm, movement and intense noise of the indigenous ceremonies. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9e5856e5175d2b0a63d3ed89965713b06a316a1f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e5856e5175d2b0a63d3ed89965713b06a316a1f/0_99_2954_1773/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Total immersion \u2026 a young swimmer in the Brazilian state of Roraima, photographed in the early 70s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Total immersion \u2026 a young swimmer in the Brazilian state of Roraima, photographed in the early 70s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudia Andujar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.survivalinternational.org/articles/3512-DaviYanomami\">Davi Kopenawa</a>, a Yanomami activist and shaman, first met Andujar in 1977. \u201cIt was quite unusual for a white woman to come, a woman who wasn\u2019t a missionary especially. Claudia took her time to get to know us; she slept in our <em>shabono</em>,\u201d he says, referring to the ring-shaped wooden buildings that the Yanomami live in communally. \u201cWhen the white people invaded our land, they took us by surprise and we weren\u2019t prepared to deal with that first contact. Non-indigenous people wanted us to vanish, they wanted us to die ... It is still a dangerous battlefield out there for us, but to survive we need to confront it. These pictures are part of that.

      "bodyText": "At 89, Claudia Andujar still has her work cut out. For five decades she has photographed the Yanomami indigenous people, an Amer-Indian tribe who number 33,000 and live in 192,000 square kilometres of rainforest that straddle the borders of Brazil and Venezuela. Until the early 20th century they had lived almost entirely in isolation from the outside world, but since then disease, deforestation and climate change have taken their toll. The election of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil has proved a further threat. Vehemently against legislation protecting indigenous lands, last week the far-right president commented: \u201cIndians are undoubtedly changing \u2026 They are increasingly becoming human beings just like us.\u201d \u201cI now put all my efforts into the activism, into addressing Brazil\u2019s political situation,\u201d Andujar says as she prepares a retrospective at the Fondation Cartier in Paris, which shows a selection from a personal collection that runs to several thousand photographs. \u201cI no longer take photographs, but use my archive to show how I saw the Yanomami. This present government has no respect for them. They have no understanding of who they are as people.\u201d The changing nature of Andujar\u2019s work is chronicled in the show. Though the earliest images are straight documentary, the artist notes she was always more interested in striking up a human bond with her subjects than in approaching the work with professional detachment. \u201cI decided very early that I would not photograph if I felt I did not have a connection with the person whose picture I was taking,\u201d she says. \u201cDeveloping an intimacy with the individual and community came first. The photography was always secondary to that.\u201d Immersing herself in the culture of the Yanomami, it soon became clear that she would never represent their worldview through conventional composition. Instead, employing techniques, including double exposure, long exposures, the use of coloured filters or smearing of vaseline on the lens, Andujar started to produce a body of work a lot stranger and more faithful, she says, to the experience of the Yanomami people. A room of the Paris show is dedicated to the shamanic rituals that are a key aspect to Yanomami cosmology. During these ceremonies the tribe believe spirits \u2013 xapiri \u2013 descend on the forest leaving trails of brilliant white light in their wake. Andujar represented this by shaking her camera as she took each photograph of the convulsing, gyrating shamans. One image shows a woman with her face obscured by curling trails of smoky white light dancing across the picture\u2019s surface. In another, a man, naked but for streaks of body paint, lies on the ground near a burning ball of light emitting from an unknown source. A funeral ceremony, in which the deceased is encased in a woven casket hung from a tree, is photographed through an otherworldly orange filter. A group of Yanomami are shown in layered multiples, using a double exposure, a way of reflecting the rhythm, movement and intense noise of the indigenous ceremonies. Davi Kopenawa, a Yanomami activist and shaman, first met Andujar in 1977. \u201cIt was quite unusual for a white woman to come, a woman who wasn\u2019t a missionary especially. Claudia took her time to get to know us; she slept in our shabono,\u201d he says, referring to the ring-shaped wooden buildings that the Yanomami live in communally. \u201cWhen the white people invaded our land, they took us by surprise and we weren\u2019t prepared to deal with that first contact. Non-indigenous people wanted us to vanish, they wanted us to die ... It is still a dangerous battlefield out there for us, but to survive we need to confront it. These pictures are part of that. She was able to show them, show us, to the people of the city.\u201d Born in Switzerland in 1931, Andujar was raised in Oradea, a border town that has switched between Romania and Hungary. Her parents separated when she was nine. In 1944, as the German army closed in on the town, her mother took her to Switzerland, leaving her father, Siegfried, behind. He, and his entire extended Jewish family, perished in Auschwitz and Dachau. This, Andujar says, lies behind the affinity she felt with the Yanomami. \u201cI want to help the Yanomami to survive like my family did not. I think my work is dependent on the suffering of my childhood. My friends from school all died in Auschwitz. Everyone. Nobody, nobody survived.\u201d Kopenawa agrees Andujar\u2019s childhood holds the key to her relationship with the Yanomami. \u201cWhen the people of the world waged war against each other, Claudia suffered a lot. But that gave her the experience that is required to take images of the Yanomami.\u201d After the war, Andujar moved first to New York, before settling in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1955. \u201cI was conscious that I was looking for something that was missing from my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI never forced the relationship with the Yanomami, but there was something within me that was searching for a connection or purpose that they provided.\u201d The longest of her repeated trips living with the tribe was over a year.

A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese citizens arrived in Tokyo from the Chinese city early this morning while an aircraft with around 200 US citizens onboard, including staff from the local US consulate, left the city overnight for the United States as the death toll from the outbreak climbed to 132. There are also nearly 6,000 people infected in China, more than the number who caught Sars during the 2003 outbreak that killed 770 around the world. One of the Japanese evacuees, steel company worker Takeo Aoyama, said he was relieved to be home but was concerned about 400 compatriots still in the city.

Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza set up an Australian Open semi-final showdown with fellow former world No 1 Simona Halep as they both look to add a third grand slam to their haul. There is anger and frustration across rugby league after the sport\u2019s governing body, the Rugby Football League, sanctioned Catalans Dragons\u2019 move for the controversial Australian Israel Folau on a one-year deal. Saracens have been plunged deeper into turmoil after they were docked a further 70 points to ensure they will finish bottom of the table. But England\u2019s players insist they have now dealt with the \u201celephant in the room\u201d despite the latest sanction doled out to the Premiership club. And LeBron James has made his first public comments since the death of his fellow Los Angeles Laker, Kobe Bryant, on Sunday. Business The iPhone 11 propelled Apple to record revenues for the final three months of last year, with the tech company posting $91.8bn in quarterly revenue thanks to $56bn in iPhone sales. But it warned that the coronavirus outbreak could disrupt supply of its best-selling product, which is manufactured in China.

The Express says \u201cAndrew: I will talk to the FBI\u201d and the Sun leads on tributes for Nicholas Parsons: \u201cMissing Parsons\u201d.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cThe Foreign Office is urgently exploring options for British nationals to leave Hubei province.

It is intended as a simplified version of the report published today by the NCSC. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/28/labour-says-government-claim-to-be-reversing-beeching-rail-cuts-meaningless-live-news?page=with:block-5e3028ce8f086a28115a0de3#block-5e3028ce8f086a28115a0de3\">12.32pm.)</a></p> <p>In the blog Levy specifically covers the claim that there is no distinction between core and non-core in 5G. He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Claim 2. There\u2019s no distinction between core and edge in 5G</p> <p>This is covered in <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/blog-post-security-complexity-and-huawei-protecting-uks-telecoms-networks\">the previous blog</a>, so I\u2019m not going to delve into huge detail here, but it remains untrue. In previous networks, sensitive functions were grouped together in a couple of locations we called \u2018core\u2019. In 5G they are spread out a bit more, but sensitive functions are still sensitive functions and you can put your arms round them \u2013 for example, we list them in the guidance published today. Remember, in 5G you need lots of smaller basestations as well as big ones, and the small ones will be on lampposts, bus shelters and other places that aren\u2019t secure from physical interference by bad guys.</p> <p>So, if your network design means that you need to run really sensitive functions processing really sensitive data (i.e. core functions) on an edge access device on top of a bus stop, your choice of vendor is the least of your worries and you probably shouldn\u2019t be designing critical national infrastructure. The international standards that define what a 5G network actually is allow you to do all sorts of things, and some of those things could lead to security or operational risks that can\u2019t be mitigated. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to do them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T15:03:18.788Z\">at 3.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3044de8f086a28115a0f22\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T14:29:01.146Z\">2.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Sean Spicer</strong>, who was press secretary to President Trump during Trump\u2019s first six months in office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/1222163323535482880\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not sure how something like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Huawei?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Huawei</a> can have a \u201climited\u201d role in building the next version of the UK\u2019s telecom infrastructure:  U.K. Allows Huawei to Build <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/5G?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#5G</a> Networks, in Break with U.S.<br>Via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/business?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@business</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2q30Hc1pog\">https://t.co/2q30Hc1pog</a></p>&mdash; Sean Spicer (@seanspicer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/seanspicer/status/1222163323535482880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e303d0c8f0811db2faecc32\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T13:58:23.519Z\">1.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour criticises government for failing to develop 'home-grown alternatives to Huawei'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tracy Brabin</strong>, the shadow culture secretary, has issued this statement on the Huawei decision on behalf of the Labour party.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Tories refused to take our technological sovereignty seriously and failed to invest in home-grown alternatives to Huawei.

This will seek to attract established vendors who are not present in the UK, supporting the emergence of new, disruptive entrants to the supply chain, and promoting the adoption of open, interoperable standards that will reduce barriers to entry.</p> <p>The recommended cap of 35% will be kept under review to determine whether it should be further reduced as the market diversifies.</p> <p>Today\u2019s decision marks a major change in the UK\u2019s approach that will substantially improve the security and resilience of our critical telecoms networks. It will see the government roll out the most stringent set of controls ever \u2013 including new standards with tough underpinning legislation to raise the security and quality of the entire 5G and gigabit-capable networks.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:23:46.236Z\">at 12.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3023568f08e1332473857e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:05:27.189Z\">12.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson gives green light for Huawei 5G infrastructure role</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here is my colleague <strong>Heather Stewart</strong>\u2019s story about the Huawei announcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/28/boris-johnson-gives-green-light-for-huawei-5g-infrastructure-role\">Boris Johnson gives green light for Huawei 5G infrastructure role</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Chinese state-owned tech firm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/huawei\">Huawei</a> has been designated a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d but will be given the opportunity to build non-core elements of Britain\u2019s 5G network, the government has announced.</p> <p>The company will be banned from the \u201ccore\u201d, of the 5G network, and from operating at sensitive sites such as nuclear and military facilities, and its share of the market will be capped at 35%.</p> <p>\u201cWe are clear-eyed about the challenge posed by Huawei, which we today confirm is a high-risk vendor,\u201d said a Whitehall source.</p> <p>But the source insisted a \u201cmarket failure\u201d meant there was little alternative in the short term.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3022d98f0811db2faecac3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T12:03:13.719Z\">12.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The government Huawei announcement is out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1222127645397344256\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING:<br><br>Boris Johnson has given green light to allow Huawei to build non-core parts of 5G network<br><br>* Huawei designated high-risk vendor<br><br>* It faces a market share cap of 35%<br><br>* UK will work with US to encourage alternative providers<br><br>Brace for backlash form US...</p>&mdash; Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1222127645397344256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>More details soon ...</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3020728f08e1332473854d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-28T11:56:43.228Z\">11.56am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This morning <strong>Christopher Pincher</strong>, a Foreign Office minister, has been attending an EU general affairs council meeting in Brussels.

The Huawei case is actually worse than that, because whereas British or American companies have independent lives of their own, a country like China does not.

      "bodyText": "The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has defended the government\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese tech firm Huawei to build non-core elements of the UK\u2019s 5G network, despite designating it a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d. He was speaking in the House of Commons, where many senior Conservatives expressed reservations about the announcement - although with less vehemence than yesterday, when some MPs may have thought they had a still had a chance of getting the government to change its mind. Leading Republicans in Washington have criticised the government\u2019s decision. Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, said it amounted to a \u201cmajor defeat\u201d for the US. (See 12.38pm.) Tom Cotton, a Republican senator, described the decision as like allowing the KGB to build the UK\u2019s telephone network during the cold war. (See 3.29pm.) Administration officials said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the move. (See 1.52pm.) But President Trump has not yet commented on it personally. He has been tweeting today, but not on this. The independent migration advisory committee has rejected a full shift to an Australian points-based system, publishing detailed research which gives a picture of how a reformed immigration system might look after Brexit and the ending of freedom of movement for EU nationals. Negotiations on the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU will start on 3 March, more than a month after the UK\u2019s departure from the bloc, the Guardian can reveal. Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has said that if the SNP wins next year\u2019s Holyrood elections, they will have a mandate to hold a second independence referendum. He was speaking on a visit to the Scottish parliament where he also said: What I want to do is to make the case going into that election that actually neither the status quo nor independence is the right way forward. And what we need is - whether you call it federalism or much more meaningful devolution - a different constitutional settlement. That\u2019s the argument I want to make. I\u2019m here to discuss that with colleagues. Boris Johnson\u2019s government spent \u00a346m on a \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d campaign in October, but demonstrated little evidence it left the public better prepared, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has found. The Scottish government failed to properly monitor and evaluate billions of pounds\u2019 worth of privately financed contracts to build roads, schools and hospitals, two public spending watchdogs have said. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Mark Warner, the US senator and the ranking Democrat on the senate intelligence committee, has put out this statement about the UK\u2019s Huawei/5G decision. While I am disappointed by the UK\u2019s decision to continue allowing insecure vendors like Huawei into their network, the United States remains committed to working with the UK and other key allies to build more diverse and secure telecommunication options that provide competitive alternatives to Huawei. Working together must be our priority in the coming months. From my colleague Dan Sabbagh From my colleague Heather Stewart Jonathan Djanogly, a Conservative, says if there is a security breach, Huawei should have to pay the cost of having its own equipment replaced. Raab says that in those circumstances a criminal offence would have been committed, not just a breach of contract. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says he is \u201cbaffled\u201d by this decision. He says he does not think there is a distinction between core and periphery in 5G. Raab says he does not agree. He says there is a difference. (That is what the National Cyber Security Centre says too. See 2.58pm.) Raab says there was a risk that banning Huawei could trigger trade retaliation. But that is not why this decision was taken, he says. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative, says he does not necessarily welcome the decision, but he understands it. He says the government should set up a review to see what lessons can be learnt. Raab says this has been a failure of government, and of Western governments. He says the government has set out plans to ensure that it does not find itself in this position again. President Trump has sent out his first tweets of the day. But he is not saying anything about Huawei (so far). Instead he is complaining about Fox News being biased against him ... Crispin Blunt, another Tory former chair of the foreign affairs committee, says the intelligence and security committee should consider this issue. And he says the government should tell the Chinese they expect reciprocity. Raab says that is an important point about the relationship with China. Tom Tugendhat, the Tory MP who chaired the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament, asks if the 35% cap covers the new market, or the existing market. Raab says the government papers explain how the 35% cap works. It is roughly equivalent to existing market share, he says. Labour\u2019s Barry Sheerman says there are businesses who think their intellectual property is being stolen by the Chinese every time they put it on the internet. Bob Seely, a Conservative, asks for an assurance that MPs will be able to debate on what constitutes a high-risk vendor. And he says non trusted vendors should be built out of the system. Raab says there is already a definition of a high-risk vendor. Liam Fox, the former Tory international trade secretary, asks if the concern in Washington is about the UK\u2019s ability to mitigate the risks of Huawei, or about the UK sending a message to other countries about Huawei being acceptable. Raab says the UK and the US start from a different place. He says the government asked Washington if it could propose an alternative. He says the Americans did not have an answer on that point. This is from Jon Sopel, the BBC\u2019s North America editor, on the Tom Cotton quote. See 3.29pm. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden asks if at any point the US has linked this decision to the chances of the UK getting a trade deal. Raab says the Americans have not done this to his knowledge. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, says he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by this decision. He says defending in cyber networks is always a matter of catch-up. He says Huawei will always be in the periphery. Does Raab accept that China is a threat? And will the government try to drive Huawei out of the network for good? Raab says it is important to assess the nature of the risk. The government is doing that. He says an outright ban would be a \u201cvery blunt tool\u201d to deal with a very specific problem. Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative former defence secretary, says this decision is \u201cregrettable\u201d. David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary, says Huawei should have been banned from the 5G network. This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Ben Riley-Smith. He is quoting Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas. Julian Lewis, a Tory former chair of the defence committee, says Huawei is not independent of the Chinese state. Raab says the relationship between Huawei and the Chinese state has been central to the analysis of the threat it poses. Dominic Raab is responding to John Nicolson. He says an outright ban, of the kind proposed by the SNP, would not remove the firm from the British telecoms network, it would not encourage diversification of supply, and it would increase costs for business. The SNP\u2019s John Nicolson says the government has opted for the \u201ccheapest, least secure option\u201d. He says using Huawei is not safe. Under Chinese law, firms have to cooperate with the state, she says. He says, with 5G, the peripheral network communicates with the core. He says malware can be hard to detect. He says countries like Australia have chosen to block Huawei. That may turn out to be the right choice, he says. He says the UK government has taken the wrong choice. Theresa May, the former PM, says she commends the government for this decision. When she was PM, she was reportedly planning to come to the same decision on Huawei and 5G. She says it is essential that five eyes partners work with the UK to ensure that there is more market diversification, so that in future governments are less reliant on Huawei. Raab commends May for the work on this issue that took place when she was PM. Raab is responding to Thomas-Symonds. He says intelligence sharing will not be put at risk, and never will be. High risk vendors have never been involved in intelligence networks, and never will be, he says. And Andrew Parker, head of MI5, has said that he does not think intelligence sharing with the US will be at risk from this decision. Thomas-Symonds says a rush by the government to throw itself into the arms of President Trump to get a trade deal must not govern everything it does. He says the UK has had to choose between just three 5G vendors. What can be done to ensure more are available, he asks. He says 5G will be transformational. It will shape the economy of the future, he says. But the government first said the UK would be a global leader in this in 2017, he says. He asks Raab to explain how there won\u2019t be a risk to communication channels used for intelligence. He asks for an explanation of the difference between core and periphery in 5G. (See 2.58pm for an answer.) And he asks when the new regulations will be brought to the Commons. Nick Thomas-Symonds, a shadow Home Office minister, is responding for Labour. He says there has been too much \u201cdither and delay\u201d. This decision should have been made earlier, he says. Raab says there will be nothing in the plans that will stop the government sharing highly-classified intelligence, either within the UK or with five eyes intelligence partners (ie, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand). Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is making a Commons statement about the Huawei/5G decision. He says the government will do nothing to undermine UK security, or the security of its allies. He says the UK has conducted the best analysis of what needs to be done to keep 5G secure. And he says it has a better understanding of the threat posed by Huawei than any other country, he says, because it has been monitoring Huawei already for years. Summarising the review published by the National Cyber Security Centre (see 12.32pm and 2.58pm), he says the planning to introduce what will be among the stronger regulations for 5G in the world. He says the government will legislate to limit the role of Huawei in 5G. And it will take steps to ensure that there is more diversity in the market, so that the government in future is not so dependent on Huawei. He sums up some of the factors that will be taken into account when deciding if a 5G suppliers is high risk. Here is a question from BTL (below the line). I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have the technical knowledge to answer that, but Ian Levy, technical director at the National Cyber Security Centre, does understand this stuff and he was written a blog today explaining the risk that \u201chigh-risk vendors\u201d like Huawei pose to the 5G network, and what can be done to mitigate the risk. It is intended as a simplified version of the report published today by the NCSC. (See 12.32pm.) In the blog Levy specifically covers the claim that there is no distinction between core and non-core in 5G. He says: Claim 2. There\u2019s no distinction between core and edge in 5G This is covered in the previous blog, so I\u2019m not going to delve into huge detail here, but it remains untrue. In previous networks, sensitive functions were grouped together in a couple of locations we called \u2018core\u2019. In 5G they are spread out a bit more, but sensitive functions are still sensitive functions and you can put your arms round them \u2013 for example, we list them in the guidance published today. Remember, in 5G you need lots of smaller basestations as well as big ones, and the small ones will be on lampposts, bus shelters and other places that aren\u2019t secure from physical interference by bad guys. So, if your network design means that you need to run really sensitive functions processing really sensitive data (i.e. core functions) on an edge access device on top of a bus stop, your choice of vendor is the least of your worries and you probably shouldn\u2019t be designing critical national infrastructure. The international standards that define what a 5G network actually is allow you to do all sorts of things, and some of those things could lead to security or operational risks that can\u2019t be mitigated. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to do them. This is from Sean Spicer, who was press secretary to President Trump during Trump\u2019s first six months in office. Tracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary, has issued this statement on the Huawei decision on behalf of the Labour party. The Tories refused to take our technological sovereignty seriously and failed to invest in home-grown alternatives to Huawei. As a result they\u2019re in the ludicrous position of having to choose between the UK\u2019s security concerns and our infrastructure needs. Despite years of dithering, the government still can\u2019t tell us how it will restrict Huawei\u2019s access to sensitive parts of the network. It must now give specific reassurances to workers and businesses that a 35% market cap will not stop 5G becoming widely available by 2027, as planned \u2013 and that it will support communities whose access to 5G will be delayed by this decision. The statement does not say what a Labour government would have done faced with the same dilemma. Instead it makes a version of the time-honoured opposition argument: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have started from here.\u201d From CNN\u2019s national security correspondent Kylie Atwood Here is some more US reaction to the Huawei decision. This is from Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman from New York. Industry leaders have said the salary threshold recommended in the report from the migration advisory committee - \u00a325,600, not \u00a330,000 as previously proposed - is still too high. The Food and Drink Federation, whose members rely heavily on EU citizens to staff food production sites including meat processing factories, unattractive to many British workers, said this was \u201ca step in the right direction\u201d but urged the government to \u201cconsider going further still by adopting the \u2018growing rate\u2019 system outlined. EU nationals currently make up a quarter of the 430,000-strong workforce in food and drink manufacturing and many businesses will be recruiting under immigration rules for the first time, said the FDF. London First, which represents some of the capital\u2019s biggest employers, said the MAC could have gone further and proposed a \u00a320,000 threshold, which \u201cwould have ensured we could keep the economy at full strength\u201d, it said. The Federation of Small Businesses said: \u201cFSB research shows that four-in-five small employers that hire staff into jobs classed as mid-skilled do so into roles with salaries less than \u00a330,000. This includes positions in sectors such as engineering and IT.\u201d And Universities UK said it remained concerned about its post-Brexit ability to recruit lab technicians, language assistants and other researchers from the EU even with the proposed salary threshold. \u201cWe are also concerned that standard salary levels in higher education sectors would no longer be recognised, meaning it will be harder to attract international talent into key lecturer roles,\u201d Alistair Jarvis, its chief executive, said. Turning away from Huawei, negotiations on the UK\u2019s post-Brexit relationship with the EU will start on 3 March, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. Here is an analysis of the Huawei decision from Dan Sabbagh, the Guardian defence and security correspondent. Nick Timothy, who was co-chief of staff to Theresa May when she was prime minister until the 2017 general election, has criticised the Huawei decision. From the BBC\u2019s security correspondent Gordon Corera According to a YouGov poll, members of the public are more likely to be against using Huawei to build the 5G infrastructure than in favour by a margin of three to one. But almost half of the public do not have a view, the poll also suggests. And this is from Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher, on the Huawei decision. By \u201cthis seems to be happening\u201d, he means he is commending the government for stressing what it is doing to mitigate the Huawei risk, he says. Tom Tugendhat has now posted an eight-part thread on Twitter explaining some of his concerns about the Huawei decision. And here is his conclusion. Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative MP who chaired the foreign affairs committee in the last parliament, and Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, were two of the backbenchers most critical of Huawei when MPs debated the issue in the Commons yesterday afternoon. Now the decision has been formally announced, they have restated their opposition to the plan. These are from LBC\u2019s Theo Usherwood and ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt. Huawei has welcomed the UK government\u2019s decision. This is from its vice-president, Victor Zhang. Huawei is reassured by the UK government\u2019s confirmation that we can continue working with our customers to keep the 5G roll-out on track. This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future. It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market. We have supplied cutting-edge technology to telecoms operators in the UK for more than 15 years. We will build on this strong track record, supporting our customers as they invest in their 5G networks, boosting economic growth and helping the UK continue to compete globally. We agree a diverse vendor market and fair competition are essential for network reliability and innovation, as well as ensuring consumers have access to the best possible technology. Newt Gingrich, a leading Republican and a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s Huawei decision as \u201cmajor defeat\u201d for the US. Jeremy Wright, the former culture secretary, told BBC News that he thought Boris Johnson\u2019s decision on Huawei was a \u201csensible compromise\u201d. Here is the 30-page report (pdf) from the National Cyber Security Centre containing its analysis of security threats to the telecommunications sector. It has been published today alongside the announcement. And here is its conclusion. Our threat analysis highlights that our telecoms sector is potentially vulnerable to a range of cyber-risks. This analysis is backed up by evidence generated from security testing of telecoms networks and by security incidents. In this paper, we have outlined the NCSC\u2019s approach to assessing the cyber risk to the telecoms sector, and our recommendations for reducing and managing this risk. While the risks are complex and interlinked, the NCSC has identified that it is feasible to manage these risks and by doing so, increase confidence in the telecoms services on which the nation relies. Here is a statement from Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, about the Huawei/5G decision. She said: We want world-class connectivity as soon as possible but this must not be at the expense of our national security. High-risk vendors never have been and never will be in our most sensitive networks. The government has reviewed the supply chain for telecoms networks and concluded today it is necessary to have tight restrictions on the presence of high-risk vendors. This is a UK-specific solution for UK-specific reasons and the decision deals with the challenges we face right now. It not only paves the way for secure and resilient networks, with our sovereignty over data protected, but it also builds on our strategy to develop a diversity of suppliers. We can now move forward and seize the huge opportunities of 21st century technology. Here is her news release in full. And here is a written ministerial statement from Morgan to peers giving more details of the government\u2019s plans to legislate to limit the involvement of so-called \u201chigh-risk vendors\u201d like Huawei in the 5G network. Here is an extract from the culture department news release. Ministers today determined that UK operators should put in place additional safeguards and exclude high-risk vendors from parts of the telecoms network that are critical to security. High-risk vendors are those who pose greater security and resilience risks to UK telecoms networks. The prime minister chaired a meeting of the national security council (NSC), where it was agreed that the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) should issue guidance to UK telecoms operators on high-risk vendors following the conclusions of the telecoms supply chain review. This advice is that high-risk vendors should be: \u2022 Excluded from all safety-related and safety-critical networks in critical national infrastructure \u2022 Excluded from security critical \u2018core\u2019 functions, the sensitive part of the network. \u2022 Excluded from sensitive geographic locations, such as nuclear sites and military bases. \u2022 Limited to a minority presence of no more than 35% in the periphery of the network, known as the access network, which connect devices and equipment to mobile phone masts. As part of the review, the NCSC carried out a technical and security analysis that offers the most detailed assessment in the world of what is needed to protect the UK\u2019s digital infrastructure. The guidance sets out the practical steps operators should take to implement the government\u2019s decision on how to best mitigate the risks of high risk vendors in 5G and gigabit-capable networks. The government will now seek to legislate at the earliest opportunity to put in place the powers necessary to implement this tough new telecoms security framework. The government is certain that these measures, taken together, will allow us to mitigate the potential risk posed by the supply chain and to combat the range of threats, whether cyber-criminals, or state-sponsored attacks. The review also highlighted the need for the UK to improve the diversity in the supply of equipment to telecoms networks. The government is now developing an ambitious strategy to help diversify the supply chain. This will seek to attract established vendors who are not present in the UK, supporting the emergence of new, disruptive entrants to the supply chain, and promoting the adoption of open, interoperable standards that will reduce barriers to entry. The recommended cap of 35% will be kept under review to determine whether it should be further reduced as the market diversifies. Today\u2019s decision marks a major change in the UK\u2019s approach that will substantially improve the security and resilience of our critical telecoms networks. It will see the government roll out the most stringent set of controls ever \u2013 including new standards with tough underpinning legislation to raise the security and quality of the entire 5G and gigabit-capable networks. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart\u2019s story about the Huawei announcement. This is how it starts. The Chinese state-owned tech firm Huawei has been designated a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d but will be given the opportunity to build non-core elements of Britain\u2019s 5G network, the government has announced. The company will be banned from the \u201ccore\u201d, of the 5G network, and from operating at sensitive sites such as nuclear and military facilities, and its share of the market will be capped at 35%. \u201cWe are clear-eyed about the challenge posed by Huawei, which we today confirm is a high-risk vendor,\u201d said a Whitehall source. But the source insisted a \u201cmarket failure\u201d meant there was little alternative in the short term. The government Huawei announcement is out. More details soon ... This morning Christopher Pincher, a Foreign Office minister, has been attending an EU general affairs council meeting in Brussels. It is the last scheduled EU meeting that a British minister will be attending while the UK remains a member. As he arrived Pincher said that he would deliver the message that \u201cas we leave the EU we will always be allies, partners and friends\u201d. He said: I\u2019m here to reassert to my EU friends and colleagues that, though we are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe. Our shared history, our shared values, our commitment to security and prosperity continue as equals - sovereign equals. Here are some of the more interesting articles and tweets on the Huawei/5G story that I\u2019ve seen this morning. Gordon Corera, the BBC\u2019s security correspondent, explains the dilemma facing the government in a blog. Here\u2019s an extract. The US has taken a hard line because it knows the UK decision has global significance. Many other countries are going through similar debates right now. Like the UK, they would like to use Huawei because it is cheap but fear the security risks and the wrath of the US. If the UK approves the use of Huawei many of them may use that as cover to follow suit. Few others though have the technical experience of monitoring Huawei that the UK has built up. The global perspective goes to one of the wider long-term risks. Some people ask how we have got to a position where we are needing to even consider using Chinese technology. The answer is because Western countries failed to think strategically about protecting or nurturing their own full spectrum telecoms industry over the last two decades. Companies went bust or were taken over. Meanwhile Beijing pursued a focused long-term strategy to become a leader in the technology. Jack Blanchard in his London Playbook briefing for Politico Europe includes some good analysis of the Huawei issue. Here is an extract. What No. 10 really thinks: My colleague Annabelle Dickson reports this is ultimately a trade-off that Downing Street is prepared to make. She says today\u2019s big decision on Huawei reflects the new strategic thinking inside No. 10, where senior officials prioritize potentially revolutionary advances in technology over the marginal gains of increased transatlantic trade. \u201cFormer ministers and officials who are familiar with the mind-set of Johnson and his top adviser Dominic Cummings say privately that modern tech infrastructure is much more important to the pair\u2019s vision for the U.K.\u2019s future economy than trade with the U.S., welcome as a quick deal would be,\u201d she reports. Read the quotes: \u201cIf you are Dom and the PM, you know in 10 years we want to be a high-tech Silicon Valley across the whole of the U.K.,\u201d says one government official who has worked closely with both men. \u201cWe need high-speed internet across the country to do that. That is more important than getting slightly cheaper meat.\u201d The official continues: \u201cWhile trade deals are a Tory MP obsession \u2026 Dom would come from the school of thought that the point of trade deals and leaving the EU is to make your own domestic market more dynamic and more responsive.\u201d Charles Moore in the Daily Telegraph (pawyall) says the Huawei virus is more of a threat than the coronavirus. He says: Imagine the situation the other way round. Would China allow a British or American company to get itself near the heart of its secret systems? Of course not. The Huawei case is actually worse than that, because whereas British or American companies have independent lives of their own, a country like China does not. Huawei is an arm of the Chinese state, and Beijing would never allow it otherwise. That state remains, despite all the reforms, a one-party, totalitarian system. Indeed the present condition of the Chinese Communist party seems to be reverting in its leadership cult, its ultra-secrecy and its hostility to exterior powers to the mindset of the Chairman Mao era. The headlines just now are all about the dangers of the coronavirus coming out of China. The Huawei virus will infect us much more widely and far longer if we let it. Mike Butcher, editor-at-large at TechCrunch, has posted a Twitter thread on the story. It starts here. Here are his conclusions. And this is from the BBC\u2019s technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones. Here is the full text of the migration advisory committee\u2019s report (pdf). It runs to 278 page. There is also an annex (pdf) running to 103 pages. According to a survey for ConservativeHome, almost 80% of Conservative party members think the government should ban the Chinese firm Huawei from playing a role in the 5G network. ConservativeHome surveys are normally seen as reliable guide to opinion in the party. Boris Johnson is in such a strong position with his party, having just won the election with a near-landslide, that he can afford to take a decision opposed by almost four out of five of his party members. But it is unusual for a prime minister to have quite so little support from the membership on a major policy decision. It is all very well having political capital in the bank, but once you start using it up, the stock does diminish. Ministers are in Downing Street now for the national security council meeting that will decide whether Huawei can build the UK\u2019s 5G network. Here are some of the arrival pictures. According to the Washington Post, three Republican senators have written to the British national security council urging them not to let Huawei play a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. In their letter Marco Rubio, Tom Cotton and John Cornyn said: This letter represents a genuine plea from one ally to another. We do not want to feed post-Brexit anxieties by threatening a potential US-UK free trade agreement when it comes to congress for approval. Nor would we want to have to review US-UK intelligence sharing. The facts on Huawei are clear. We hope that your government will make the right decision and reject Huawei\u2019s inclusion in its 5G infrastructure. The suggestion that, if the UK refuses to block Huawei, congress may block the proposed UK-US trade deal was also made by the former Trump adviser Tim Morrison in an interview yesterday. But these interventions from Washington do not seem to be working. The NSC is meeting this morning, and it is expected to approve Huawei playing some role in the 5G roll-out. Boris Johnson implied as much yesterday. Here are the latest figures on Labour leadership nominations from @CLPNominations, a respected Twitter account. Here is my colleague Amelia Gentleman\u2019s story about the migration advisory committee\u2019s report. And this is how her story starts. The independent migration advisory committee does not recommend a full shift to an Australian points-based system in research giving the first detailed insight into how a reformed immigration system might look after Brexit and the ending of freedom of movement for EU nationals. In a report published on Tuesday, the independent committee, which provides research-based advice to the government, recommends a mixed system, which would rely on a minimum salary threshold for those people coming to the UK with a job offer, and a points-based system for those coming to the UK without a pre-arranged job. \u201cTalented individuals\u201d would be able to apply for a work visa under the points-based system. Its recommendations would reduce levels of immigration, the size of the UK population and total GDP. \u201cWe expect the changes to very slightly increase GDP per capita, productivity and improve public finances, though these estimates are more uncertain,\u201d the report states. The migration advisory committee is recommending that the post-Brexit immigration salary threshold should be cut from \u00a330,000 (the level proposed by the government when Theresa May was PM) to \u00a325,600, the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith reports. At this stage in the electoral cycle (just after a big election win for the governing party, and with the opposition in the middle of a leadership election), opinion polls don\u2019t count for much. But if you do want to know what the polls are saying, the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley has the latest figures from YouGov. Boris Johnson\u2019s government spent \u00a346m on a \u201cGet Ready for Brexit\u201d campaign in October, but demonstrated little evidence it left the public better prepared, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has found. My colleague Rajeev Syal has the full story here. Boris Johnson and his ministers want to improve regional connectivity, in particular rail travel in the north of England, and today Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is announcing outline proposals to reopen two rail lines: the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne Line in Northumberland, and the the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. As with the government plans for \u201c40 new hospitals\u201d, there is no firm commitment to go ahead with the work; just a seed-funding commitment to explore the idea. My colleague Gwyn Topham\u2019s story about the plan is here. As a relatively minor transport announcement, that\u2019s fine, but Shapps is facing criticism today because he is presenting this as part of a plan, first announced during the general election campaign, to reverse the 1960s Beeching cuts that closed more than 4,000 miles of track and more than 2,000 stations (in the era when mass car ownership was taking off, making rail less competitive). Shapps first floated this idea during the general election campaign. In a highly crowded field, this was seen as one of the most misleading tweets of the general election, because it implied that the Beeching cuts might to totally or largely reversed, when in fact \u00a3500m would only pay for a few miles of new track. The government is still giving that impression today. The press release from the Department for Transport says Shapps is making an announcement that \u201cwill that will drive forward the reversal of the controversial Beeching cuts\u201d. Labour says today\u2019s promise is \u201cmeaningless\u201d without much more substantial investment. In a statement Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: The funding pledged by the government would reopen just 25 miles of railway. The Conservatives claim to have been reversing Beeching cuts since 2017 despite not reopening an inch of track. Investing in the railway is a fantastic policy but this is meaningless without a serious funding commitment of billions of pounds. The timing of this announcement is also suspicious and seems designed to distract from the imminent collapse of the Northern rail franchise. Later we will get a much more significant investment announcement from the government - the decision about Huawei. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the national security council to decide whether Huawei will be allowed a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. 10am: The migration advisory committee publishes a report on how an Australian-style points-based immigration system could work in the UK. 11.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. Afternoon: Ministers are due to make oral statements in parliament about the Huawei decision. Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, is expected to make the statement in the Lords, but it is not clear yet who will address the Commons. 2.45pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, chairs a meeting of the joint ministerial committee, which includes ministers from the devolved administrations, in Cardiff to discuss Brexit. 3.35pm: Lord Berkeley, former deputy chair of the Oakervee review of HS2, gives evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Bolton testimony could devastate Trump\u2019s fragile defence The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has reportedly told his Republican caucus that they do not yet have enough votes to block testimony from witnesses, including John Bolton, at Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. The president\u2019s legal team wrapped up their opening arguments on Tuesday, but his defence could unwind should the former national security adviser repeat at trial the claim reportedly made in his book: that Trump told him he was withholding aid to Ukraine for domestic political purposes. Pompeo rant. Trump on Tuesday praised his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for his tirade against the NPR reporter who had challenged him on Ukraine during an interview. \u201cYou did a good job on her,\u201d the president said. Trump unveils Middle East plan with no Palestinian support Trump has at last revealed his administration\u2019s vision for peace in the Middle East, a 181-page document that delivers many of Israel\u2019s historic demands without any support from the Palestinians, to whom it offers a limited state with borders significantly diminished from those offered in the 1993 Oslo peace agreement. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was in Washington to see the plan unveiled, and described Trump as \u201cthe greatest friend that Israel has ever had in the White House\u201d. Palestinian response. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, called the deal a \u201cconspiracy\u201d that \u201cwill not pass\u201d. But the cause of Palestine no longer stirs deep passions across the Arab world, as Martin Chulov reports. Netanyahu indicted. As he celebrated with Trump in DC on Tuesday, Netanyahu was being formally indicted on corruption charges by a court in Israel. He denies any wrongdoing. US airlifts hundreds out of Wuhan in coronavirus evacuation The US and Japan have airlifted hundreds of their citizens from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, as officials said the death toll had risen to 132 and the number of confirmed cases in China reached 5,974: more than during the 2003 Sars epidemic. The British are expected to begin their own airlift as early as Thursday, while Australia and New Zealand have announced a joint plan to evacuate their citizens and keep some quarantined for up to 14 days on the remote Christmas Island. Human transmission. Germany has confirmed the first known human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus in Europe, where a man was infected by a colleague who had travelled to China but showed no symptoms at the time of the transmission.

The Pentagon says 50 US service members have now been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury as a result of a recent Iranian missile strike on their base in Iraq. Trump originally claimed the 8 January attack had not injured any US troops.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

      "bodyText": "Britons returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 14 days. Officials are considering taking passengers to a military base once they arrive home, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said. Advice from Public Health England published on Tuesday told UK citizens returning from Wuhan to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, as is the advice with other flu viruses, and to call NHS 111 to inform them if they have recently travelled to the city. Flights taking Britons back home from the coronavirus-hit Chinese province of Hubei could begin on Thursday as urgent plans for a major evacuation were put in place. Passengers may be asked to sign a contract before they board the plane saying they agree to being placed in quarantine, the DHSC said. Anyone who does not wish to sign could be asked to stay. The health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: \u201cWe are working hard to get British nationals back from Wuhan. Public safety is the top priority. Anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.\u201d Ministry of Defence sources said the option of quaranteening returnees at a military facility was under consideration if politicians deemed it was necessary. No facility had selected yet, they added, although conversations were ongoing between the Department of Health, the Foreign Office and the ministry. The advantage of using a base is that Britons returning from China could be flown in by a charter to a secure location where appropriate medical staff would be on hand, possibly to transfer people to specialist hospitals if needed. But such a drastic option would be most likely be deployed only in the last resort. The Foreign Office is warning against all but essential travel to the country because of the outbreak of the disease, and British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China with immediate effect. Britons in the city of Wuhan had until 11am (3am GMT) to contact the UK consulate telling them if they wished to leave \u2013 it is thought at least 200 British citizens want to return. A British teacher in Wuhan said UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights and that a number of Britons had arranged to return home, with some scheduled on a flight at 7am on Thursday. The Foreign Office said it might become more difficult for British nationals in other provinces to leave and advised them to \u201cmake decisions based on their own personal circumstances\u201d over whether to evacuate. The British embassy in Beijing warned that transport to get UK citizens out \u201cmay happen quickly and with short notice\u201d.

France was the first European country to report a case, while four cases have been confirmed in Germany. The United Arab Emirates has also confirmed its first cases of the virus, in a family who recently returned to the country from Wuhan. Australian officials announced plans to evacuate some of its nationals from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province, with plans to quarantine them in the Christmas Island immigration detention centre for up to 14 days \u2013 the incubation period for the virus. In the UK, the DHSC has given the all-clear to 97 people but scientists predict the virus may have entered the country. More than 1,400 people have returned from Wuhan since 10 January.

The country\u2019s national health commission said on Wednesday that the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus rose by 26 on Tuesday, with almost all of the new cases in Hubei province. The governor of Hubei said the city of Huanggang, one of more than a dozen in the province under virtual lockdown, was suffering an especially severe outbreak, with 324 cases and five deaths.</p> \n<p>Unicef said it had <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-ships-6-metric-tons-supplies-support-chinas-response-novel-coronavirus\">shipped six tonnes of respiratory masks and protective suits</a> to Shanghai to protect health workers. \u201cThis coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s executive director, Henrietta Fore. \u201cWe may not know enough about the virus\u2019s impact on children or how many may be affected \u2013 but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key.

The Sars outbreak killed more than 770 people globally, including 349 in mainland China. The death rate from Sars, caused by a more virulent member of the coronavirus family than the Wuhan strain appears to be, was more than 10%.

      "bodyText": "Japan and the US have airlifted hundreds of their citizens from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, as officials in China said the death toll from the disease had risen sharply overnight to 132, with nearly 1,500 new cases in the country, bringing the total number of people diagnosed to nearly 6,000. A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Two showed symptoms of pneumonia following scans, but a coronavirus diagnosis has not been confirmed, hospital representatives said. Two more have been admitted to hospital. Seven others with symptoms such as coughs and fever will undergo tests. The rest of the passengers were sent home with instructions to stay in and not mix with people for 14 days. The Japanese authorities have dispatched a second plane to Wuhan to collect more of the 450 nationals awaiting evacuation. Pressure is mounting on China to control the spread of the disease. The country\u2019s national health commission said on Wednesday that the total number of deaths from the flu-like virus rose by 26 on Tuesday, with almost all of the new cases in Hubei province. The governor of Hubei said the city of Huanggang, one of more than a dozen in the province under virtual lockdown, was suffering an especially severe outbreak, with 324 cases and five deaths. Unicef said it had shipped six tonnes of respiratory masks and protective suits to Shanghai to protect health workers. \u201cThis coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s executive director, Henrietta Fore. \u201cWe may not know enough about the virus\u2019s impact on children or how many may be affected \u2013 but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key. Time is not on our side.\u201d The total number of confirmed cases rose to 5,974 \u2013 overtaking the 5,327 confirmed cases in mainland China during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic. The Sars outbreak killed more than 770 people globally, including 349 in mainland China. The death rate from Sars, caused by a more virulent member of the coronavirus family than the Wuhan strain appears to be, was more than 10%. So far, the death rate among confirmed cases of coronavirus is 2%, and may be less if there are many mild cases that do not end up in hospital, as experts believe. The first cases in the Middle East were reported in the United Arab Emirates. Four members of a Chinese family who had been in Wuhan and arrived in the UAE on 16 January for a visit were confirmed to have the virus. One member of the family sought medical help, reporting feeling unwell, a week after their arrival. Officials in the US, meanwhile, said a chartered plane had landed in Anchorage, Alaska, with about 240 US citizens onboard, including staff from the US consulate in Wuhan. The plane was to make a refuelling stop in Alaska before flying on to southern California, but passengers were to be re-screened in Anchorage for the virus, and hospitals were prepared to treat or quarantine people who may be infected. British Airways said it had suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China after British authorities warned against \u201call but essential\u201d travel to the country. The airline\u2019s website shows no direct flights to China were available in January and February. \u201cWe apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,\u201d BA said in an statement. Air France suspended its three weekly flights to Wuhan last week, but as of Wednesday morning said it was maintaining its 23 weekly flights to Beijing and Shanghai. Cathay Pacific, which is based in Hong Kong, said it would gradually reduce capacity by 50% or more on its routes to mainland China from Thursday through to the end of March, while Indonesia\u2019s Lion Air said it was halting all its flights to and from China. Other airlines said they were reducing their China services. Australia said on Wednesday it would help \u201cvulnerable or isolated\u201d citizens leave Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, and quarantine them on Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean that is home to a detention centre for asylum seekers. Britain is finalising plans to repatriate citizens from in and around Wuhan. The Department of Health has said it will quarantine those who return for 14 days, possibly at a military facility. That is a change in the line from the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who said on Monday in the House of Commons that returnees would be asked to stay at home and \u201cself-isolate\u201d for two weeks. The change may come in response to protests by Britons in Wuhan, who said the advice was confusing and objected that they were being asked to make their own way back from the airport, which would mean coming into contact with many other people.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Families have spoken out about the prospect of being split up during the evacuation process.

      "bodyText": "The British government is urgently pressing Beijing to allow dual nationals to leave China after public outcry over families being split up during the coronavirus evacuations. Only British passport holders who do not also hold Chinese nationality are being allowed to leave. The British embassy in Beijing is urging the Chinese to let dependents of British nationals and British-Chinese dual nationals leave too. \u201cOur priority is to keep British nationals and their family members together and we have urgently raised this with the Chinese authorities,\u201d a Foreign Office spokesperson said on Wednesday. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, raised the issue of dual nationals with his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday, but the Chinese government has maintained its stance. Families have spoken out about the prospect of being split up during the evacuation process. Sindy Siddle travelled with her husband, Jeff, and nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, to Hubei province to spend the lunar new year with her family. The family, from Prudhoe, Northumberland, are now facing their \u201cworst nightmare\u201d as Sindy has been told she will not be allowed on the evacuation flight as she has a Chinese passport. Jeff Siddle said: \u201cHaving to leave Sindy in China would be the worst thing that anyone could be put through. How am I going to tell Jasmine that her mum has to stay behind?\u201d Natalie Francis, 31, a teacher from York, was told that her three-year-old son, who has a Chinese passport, would not be allowed to leave. Chinese authorities have imposed the same restrictions on other countries evacuating citizens out of the country, including the US. China does not recognise dual nationality, meaning any citizen who wants to get a passport from another country is supposed to give up their Chinese one. Many people unofficially hold two passports by acquiring a second nationality without informing the Chinese authorities. But in recent years, driven partly by an anti-corruption campaign, there have been greater official efforts to crack down on dual nationals. Official advice from the UK\u2019s Foreign Office says: \u201cIf you are British and Chinese, you are likely to be regarded by the Chinese authorities as a Chinese citizen, even if you travel to China on a British passport. If you enter China on a Chinese passport, we may not be able to help you if you have a problem.\u201d Along with the US, Japan also began evacuating citizens out of the region on Wednesday. Meanwhile, British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China. Some other commercial airlines are still operating out of airports in the country, but with Hubei province in lockdown, people in that area have no option for leaving other than evacuation flights. UK officials have confirmed that evacuated Britons will be placed in quarantine for 14 days upon their return.",

      "body": "<h2>ED DEVILS</h2> \n<p>There is so much stuff to be righteously angry about these days. That thing someone somewhere said online that doesn\u2019t exactly chime with your worldview. The colour of your passport that the evil EU has always allowed us to change if we could be bothered. Or the disdainful manner with which big clubs like Liverpool treat the FA Cup, while lower-league purists like Brentford make eight changes in order to prepare for a do-or-die clash with Nottingham Forest that if, say, they lost 1-0, would leave them in fifth place in the Championship, exactly where they were when they started. Ooh, the sheer arrogance of that Klopp/EU mandarin/guy on internet forum. Fume!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/fans-attack-home-ed-woodward-manchester-united\">Police investigating after fans attack home of Manchester United's Ed Woodward</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But just imagine supporting a club that hasn\u2019t won a major European trophy for 979 days, is one match away from the Milk Cup final, is still in with a shout of winning both the FA Cup and Big Vase and is suffering such a bad season they\u2019ve plummeted as low as fifth in the Premier League, a competition they\u2019ve won 13 times in its first 27 seasons? Yes, we\u2019d be parping hot steam from both lugs too. Though whether The Fiver would go so far as the \u201clarge group\u201d of Manchester United fans who popped round Ed Woodward\u2019s house and hoyed a flare over his gate while chanting he\u2019s \u201cgoing to die\u201d is another matter altogether. For a start, we\u2019d already changed into our jim-jams and made a nice mug of Horlicks. Nah, not going out.</p> \n<p>Setting aside the fairly clear moral boundaries of this story, the timing of the attack seems a little odd to The Fiver. For a start, in Bruno Fernandes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/transfer-latest-bruno-fernandes-manchester-united-medical-steven-bergwijn-signs-spurs\">they\u2019re extremely close to signing</a> their first decent midfielder since Roy Keane left for the pundit\u2019s chair on MUTV all those years ago, while Woodward seems to have got shot of Marcos Rojo, bound for Estudiantes, which has surely got to count for something. Then later on, it\u2019s quite feasible that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side could win at Manchester City like they did last month, force a penalty shootout, and make their first domestic cup final since the sepia-toned misty memories of May 2018. Because when all\u2019s said and done, it\u2019s a Manchester derby and City are still City.</p> \n<p>Having said all that, there\u2019s also a chance that City could run up a cricket score, like they threatened to do at Old Trafford in the first leg. In which case we advise fuming United fans to go straight home, change into their favourite onesies, and stay in for the rest of the night. Read about Brexit, log on to Twitter, do anything that\u2019ll keep yourself relatively calm.</p> \n<h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live\">Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Manchester City 3-1 Manchester United (agg: 6-2) in the Milk Cup</a>.</p> \n<h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> \n<p>\u201cI showed them the video of me playing and they said they didn\u2019t realise that at this age you can display such skills, movement and flexibility\u201d \u2013 meet Eez Eldin Bahder, 74, the world\u2019s oldest professional footballer \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/jan/29/meet-eez-eldin-bahder-74-worlds-oldest-professional-footballer-video-report\">and you can watch his moves here in this video montage of his skills</a>.

Not for buying the book \u2013 thanks! \u2013 but for backing my underdog writer status against \u2018lit\u2019 behemoth, Mr Cribbins. It\u2019s the magic of the cup, lads!\u201d \u2013 Robi Polgar.</p> \n<p>\u201cRe: Robi Polgar \u2013 I bought one, too. You keep it up!\u201d \u2013 Hanif Khan.</p> \n<p>\u201cRecent Fiver letters reminded me of when I used to watch the mighty, sadly defunct, Formby FC in their North West Counties home matches at Victoria Park. Nicknamed \u2018The Squirrels\u2019, what music did the team come out to? Anything by Dr Drey. The crowd went nuts (it\u2019s spelt \u2018Dre\u2019 \u2013 Fiver hip-hop Ed)\u201d \u2013 Tim Cole.</p> \n<p>\u201cI fully sympathise with your readers who avoid saying \u2018squirrel\u2019. As a Bristolian ex-pat who has spent the last 35 years trying to suppress my accent to avoid ridicule, this is one of the words I avoid at all costs as it\u2019s impossible for me to say it without sounding like Adge Cutler.

      "bodyText": "ED DEVILS There is so much stuff to be righteously angry about these days. That thing someone somewhere said online that doesn\u2019t exactly chime with your worldview. The colour of your passport that the evil EU has always allowed us to change if we could be bothered. Or the disdainful manner with which big clubs like Liverpool treat the FA Cup, while lower-league purists like Brentford make eight changes in order to prepare for a do-or-die clash with Nottingham Forest that if, say, they lost 1-0, would leave them in fifth place in the Championship, exactly where they were when they started. Ooh, the sheer arrogance of that Klopp/EU mandarin/guy on internet forum. Fume! But just imagine supporting a club that hasn\u2019t won a major European trophy for 979 days, is one match away from the Milk Cup final, is still in with a shout of winning both the FA Cup and Big Vase and is suffering such a bad season they\u2019ve plummeted as low as fifth in the Premier League, a competition they\u2019ve won 13 times in its first 27 seasons? Yes, we\u2019d be parping hot steam from both lugs too. Though whether The Fiver would go so far as the \u201clarge group\u201d of Manchester United fans who popped round Ed Woodward\u2019s house and hoyed a flare over his gate while chanting he\u2019s \u201cgoing to die\u201d is another matter altogether. For a start, we\u2019d already changed into our jim-jams and made a nice mug of Horlicks. Nah, not going out. Setting aside the fairly clear moral boundaries of this story, the timing of the attack seems a little odd to The Fiver. For a start, in Bruno Fernandes they\u2019re extremely close to signing their first decent midfielder since Roy Keane left for the pundit\u2019s chair on MUTV all those years ago, while Woodward seems to have got shot of Marcos Rojo, bound for Estudiantes, which has surely got to count for something. Then later on, it\u2019s quite feasible that Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side could win at Manchester City like they did last month, force a penalty shootout, and make their first domestic cup final since the sepia-toned misty memories of May 2018. Because when all\u2019s said and done, it\u2019s a Manchester derby and City are still City. Having said all that, there\u2019s also a chance that City could run up a cricket score, like they threatened to do at Old Trafford in the first leg. In which case we advise fuming United fans to go straight home, change into their favourite onesies, and stay in for the rest of the night. Read about Brexit, log on to Twitter, do anything that\u2019ll keep yourself relatively calm.

Not so sure about the goalkeeper, mind. FIVER LETTERS \u201cDear Nick Dent (Tuesday\u2019s Fiver letters), I love you and I want to have your baby. Not for buying the book \u2013 thanks! \u2013 but for backing my underdog writer status against \u2018lit\u2019 behemoth, Mr Cribbins. It\u2019s the magic of the cup, lads!\u201d \u2013 Robi Polgar. \u201cRe: Robi Polgar \u2013 I bought one, too. You keep it up!\u201d \u2013 Hanif Khan. \u201cRecent Fiver letters reminded me of when I used to watch the mighty, sadly defunct, Formby FC in their North West Counties home matches at Victoria Park. Nicknamed \u2018The Squirrels\u2019, what music did the team come out to? Anything by Dr Drey. The crowd went nuts (it\u2019s spelt \u2018Dre\u2019 \u2013 Fiver hip-hop Ed)\u201d \u2013 Tim Cole. \u201cI fully sympathise with your readers who avoid saying \u2018squirrel\u2019. As a Bristolian ex-pat who has spent the last 35 years trying to suppress my accent to avoid ridicule, this is one of the words I avoid at all costs as it\u2019s impossible for me to say it without sounding like Adge Cutler. See also, \u2018world\u2019 and \u2018burglary\u2019\u201d \u2013 Bill Gallagher. \u201cAs an old git, I can confirm that GLC (Tuesday\u2019s Fiver) stands for Greater London Council. On the plus side, Menace have already done an anthem for when it all goes wrong for the poor lad\u201d \u2013 Louise Wright. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Bill Gallagher, who wins a copy of The Blizzard: The Best of the First Five Years, signed by editor and Fiver colleague Jonathan Wilson.

Arsenal have borrowed Flamengo defender Pablo Mar\u00ed, with an option to buy him this summer if he\u2019s any good. \u201cI\u2019m delighted... this is one of the world\u2019s best clubs,\u201d he parped. David Moyes reckons West Ham might not be in such a precarious financial state if they stopped buying players with no resale value. \u201cI want to stop the idea that always what we\u2019re doing is just buying someone to fill the gap,\u201d honked the Hammers\u2019 No 1 gap-filling boss. Chelsea want a piece of Dries Mertens. A 4-0 defeat by Salford convinced Cambridge United to hoof Colin Calderwood through the door marked Do One, while Firewall FC have given Paul Hurst the boot, too. And apropos of nothing, here\u2019s Stuart Baxter \u201ctraining\u201d a Halmstads player hard back in the day. STILL WANT MORE?

The SNP case was strengthened by team discipline (various MPs making the same point). These were moments when Johnson faced forceful challenge.</p> \n  <p>He is also facing an acute dilemma over HS2. At least three MPs asked about it, and he fobbed them off each time with a reply about the government announcement about HS2 being made very soon. But it was clear from the commotion in the Commons that Conservative MPs are split over this, and not afraid to say so.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/1222498071088467973\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rare bit of life at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMQs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PMQs</a> as one Tory MP urges Johnson 'to get HS2 done'. \"NOOOO!\" yell some fellow Tory MPs</p>\u2014 Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/1222498071088467973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 29, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tnewtondunn/status/1222499378956578817\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tory MPs now openly barracking each other over HS2 during <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PMQs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PMQs</a>.

That is partly because Corbyn\u2019s own MPs are indifferent to what he is saying, and partly because Corbyn seems to have even less interest than he ever used to in mastering the theatrics of PMQs. That is not to say he wasn\u2019t talking sense; he was, and it was clear from listening to him that he is better informed about the Middle East and international human rights (a lifelong passion for him) than Johnson is (despite Johnson being a former foreign secretary).

He has been a member of the parliament since 1999. In an interview on the Today programme this morning he made two valedictory claims - both of which are highly questionable.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage claimed that Brexit would mark the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d for the EU. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think, two years down the road, there\u2019ll be a big debate going on in many other countries about what kind of Europe do people want.</p> \n   <p>Do they want a Europe of trading co-operation or a Europe run by these institutions in Brussels, and I think the UK\u2019s departure really will mark the beginning of the end of this European project.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This claim is dubious because polling evidence suggests that support for EU membership remains very high - <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/brexit-eu-survey-italy-ireland-portugal-eurosceptic-poll-a8888126.html\">it\u2019s over 80% in most member states </a>- and that pro-EU sentiment on the continent has actually gone up since the UK voted to leave in 2016. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/08/brexit-pmqs-boris-johnson-corbyn-to-tell-eu-chief-at-first-meeting-that-trade-deal-wont-be-based-on-alignment-live-news?page=with:block-5e15db3a8f087e8308e6ab0d#block-5e15db3a8f087e8308e6ab0d\">In a recent speech in London</a> <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the European commission president, said Brexit had strengthened unity amongst the EU27. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One consequence of the Brexit vote has been to strengthen the unity and the faith in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> as a project for the common good. The truth is that Brexit has highlighted the value of being together in today\u2019s ever more unsettled world.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When Farage was asked in his interview about polling showing that support for EU membership had risen across Europe since Brexit, he said that was just because people had seen the UK \u201cmake such a Horlicks\u201d of leaving.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Farage claimed the UK would get a good trade deal from the UK because it was in \u201can enormously powerful position\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we\u2019re in an enormously powerful position.</p> \n   <p>There is now genuine fear in this building I\u2019m in this morning [Farage was speaking to Today from Brussels] about Brexit and here\u2019s what the fear is, particularly coming from the Germans - they\u2019re very scared that we will become more competitive than they are.</p> \n   <p>The whole single market is based on this premise of a level playing field - it is actually anti-competitive by its very nature, and I think that is a very strong card for us to play because, after all, we still buy an awful lot of German motor cars.</p> \n   <p>I think the truth of it is, if we negotiate tough in this next round, we will come out at the end of the year with something pretty reasonable.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is just the latest iteration of the long-running claim that pressure from German BMW manufacturers and Italian Prosecco producers will ensure the EU offers the UK easy access to the single market after Brexit. So far it has turned out to be a poor guide to EU negotiating behaviour because EU leaders have been more interested in protecting the integrity of the single market than in featherbedding BMW.

The government announced yesterday that it plans to legislate to ensure that \u201chigh risk vendors\u201d (ie, Huawei) can only run 35% of the 5G network. Legislation means votes, and voting means backbenchers have leverage (because the main opposition parties, Labour and the SNP, are also very critical of this decision on national security grounds). On Newsnight last night <strong>Sir Iain Duncan Smith</strong>, the former Conservative party leader, said that there would have to be \u201cmodification\u201d to the government\u2019s plans and that the 35% threshold was too high.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1222294363100848130\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI\u2019m absolutely convinced, and everyone thinks so too, that China is a direct threat in cyberspace.\u201d<br><br>MPs have criticised the government\u2019s decision to allow Huawei involvement in the UK's 5G network.<br><br>Tory MP <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MPIainDS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MPIainDS</a> says he wants to see the firm \"out of the system\"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Newsnight?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Newsnight</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/qH87uz1LOf\">pic.twitter.com/qH87uz1LOf</a></p>\u2014 BBC Newsnight (@BBCNewsnight) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1222294363100848130?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>And on the Today programme this morning <strong>Damian Green</strong>, the former first secretary of state, also said that he wanted to see the 35% figure driven down in a future vote. Asked how much support the rebels might have from Tory backbenchers for such a plan, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, one of the things that that frankly surprised me was the breadth of the opposition to the current stance of the government on the Conservative back benches. </p> \n   <p>We don\u2019t know yet, when push comes to shove and votes happen, how many people will actually put their heads above the parapet. But certainly it\u2019s very widespread.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The government has a majority of 80, and Green conceded that that meant roughly 40 MPs would need to rebel for the government to be at risk of defeat. But he did not rule this out.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There did appear to be very widespread opposition from members old and new, on the left and right of the party, so there\u2019s there was very widespread, strong unease about the way the government is going on this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Green\u2019s intervention confirmed the very point he was making. While Duncan Smith is on the right of the party, Green himself is firmly on the Tory left. New MPs may be more reluctant to rebel than old ones, of course, and the government could make concessions over the 35% target to appease its critics, but it can\u2019t go too far without driving Huawei out of the 5G market, which would defeat the point of the announcement made yesterday.

      "bodyText": "MEPs have voted overwhelmingly to approve the withdrawal agreement, clearing one of the last remaining hurdles in the process that will see the UK leave the EU on Friday night. The outcome of the vote was never in doubt, but the debate was nevertheless at times passionate and moving. Nigel Farage was reprimanded by the chair after he and fellow Brexit party MEPs waved mini union jacks after his speech, in which he denounced the EU as anti-democratic, before some of them left en masse for the bar. But most British MEPs who spoke expressed deep sadness about Brexit, with many of them predicting that one day the UK would decide to return. (See 4.37pm, 5.01pm, 5.04pm, 5.09pm and 5.16pm for some examples.) This marks a contrast with Westminster, where there is almost no one arguing publicly that Brexit will be reversed. Jess Phillips floated this idea briefly, stepped back within 24 hours, and is now out of the Labour leadership contest for good. Boris Johnson has said he will celebrate Brexit on Friday in a \u201crespectful\u201d way. Speaking during his \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook, in response to a question about he would mark Brexit on Friday, he said: What I will be doing is, in common with everybody else, I will be making a dignified exit from the European Union.I will be celebrating in a way that I hope is respectful of the scale of the event, that does justice to the astonishing feat that Britain has accomplished but also is mindful of everybody\u2019s feelings about what we are doing. It is a great moment for our country, it is a moment of hope and opportunity but it is also, I think, a moment for us to come together in a spirit of confidence. Rebecca Long-Bailey has received the third union nomination she needs to be guaranteed a place on the final ballot of members for the Labour leadership. (See 5.24pm.) The final nomination came from the Fire Brigades Union. The Scottish government has narrowly won a vote to keep the EU flag flying over the Edinburgh parliament building after Brexit, despite being accused of undermining the impartial status of Holyrood\u2019s governing body. Boris Johnson has lavished praise on Donald Trump\u2019s vision for Middle East peace, after Jeremy Corbyn criticised the plan for failing to gain the support of any Palestinians. Boris Johnson is facing a possible rebellion over his decision to allow China\u2019s Huawei to build part of Britain\u2019s 5G infrastructure. The British government is urgently pressing Beijing to allow dual nationals to leave China after public outcry over families being split up during the coronavirus evacuations. The future of the privatised rail system was thrown into further doubt on Wednesday as the government announced the renationalisation of the struggling Northern rail franchise. That\u2019s all from me for today. And for the rest of the week, I\u2019m afraid, because I\u2019m away for the next two days. Thanks for the comments. Here are some quotes from the European parliament debate. From Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator What is in fact threatening Britain\u2019s sovereignty most - the rules of our single market or the fact that tomorrow they may be planting Chinese 5G masts in the British islands? ... It is sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, has twice given its blood to liberate Europe ... In the last couple of days I have received hundreds of mails from British citizens saying they desperately want to stay or return ... So this vote is not an adieu, this vote, in my opinion, is only an au revoir. From Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission No new partnership will bring back the benefits of being part of the same union but we have the duty to seek the best for the British and for the European people in a post-Brexit world. To our British friends and many - perhaps not all - but many of our British MEPs here in the room, I want to use the words of the famous British poet George Eliot. She said, \u2018Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depth of love\u2019. We will always love you and we will never be far, long live Europe. From Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader I\u2019m hoping this begins the end of this project. It\u2019s a bad project, it isn\u2019t just undemocratic it\u2019s anti-democratic ... There is a historic battle going on now across the West - in Europe, America and elsewhere. It is globalism against populism. And you may loathe populism, but I\u2019ll tell you a funny thing - it\u2019s becoming very popular. And it has great benefits. No more financial contributions, no more European Court of Justice, no more common fisheries policy, no more being talked down to, no more being bullied, no more Guy Verhofstadt. From Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator We are going to continue in the year that comes, this current year with the same spirit, the same objectivity, without any aggression by firmly, however, defending the interests of the union and its member states. Going beyond Brexit the UK will remain there. It will remain a close partner when it comes to the economy. It will be an ally as it always has been and it will be a friend. Here is video of MEPs signing Auld Lang Syne. This week\u2019s Guardian Politics Weekly podcast is out. Heather Stewart rings in the end of an era as Brexit seems all but done. She chats to Jennifer Rankin, Andrew Fisher and James Kirkup about what Britain will look like after 31 January. Plus, the panel discuss whether the Labour leadership candidates are focusing on the right issues. From the BBC\u2019s Scotland editor, Sarah Smith From Jaume Duch, spokesperson for the European parliament David Sassoli, president of the parliament, says MEPs have voted to approve the withdrawal agreement. Now the European council must conclude the formalities tomorrow. He quotes Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered by a far-right terrorist during the referendum campaign. There is more that united us than divides us, he says. MEPs have approved the withdrawal agreement by 621 votes to 49. Now MEPs are singing Auld Lang Syne. MEPs are now taking the vote. Barnier has switched to English for his final comment. He says, at this moment of new beginning, he would like to wish the UK well. Barnier says it is possible to be a European over and above being a patriot. That can give additional force to national patriotism, he says. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is concluding the debate. He says it has been a moving debate. The EU respected the UK vote to leave, he says. He thanks the contribution made by British MEPs. Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy, a French MEP in the EPP group, says friendship with the UK should continue after Brexit. But Brexit is also a warning, he says. He says the EU must show that it serves all its citizens. Back in the European parliament Martin Horwood, a Lib Dem MEP, says, in various European languages, before ending in English, \u201cwe will be back.\u201d Turning away from the debate in the European parliament for a moment, Rebecca Long-Bailey has now secured the third nomination she needs from a Labour affiliate organisation to ensure that she will be on the final ballot for party members. The final nomination came from the Fire Brigades Union. That means she, Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy are now all guaranteed a place on the final ballot. Emily Thornberry is still struggling to get the nominations she needs. In a statement Long-Bailey said: I am absolutely delighted to be nominated for leader by the FBU. Heroic firefighters put themselves at risk to protect us every day, and their union embodies the values of our movement. The FBU has been critical to the development of our key policies. We\u2019ve worked closely together on public ownership, and they were crucial to securing the manifesto commitment to repealing anti-trade union laws. Vangelis Meimarakis, a Greek MEP, says the EU must ensure that this does not become a historic mistake for the EU. It must learn from what caused Brexit. Theresa Griffin, a Labour MEP, says young people should \u201ckeep the faith that one day we will come back\u201d. Esther de Lange, a Dutch MEP and member of the EPP group, says Boris Johnson did not really care what happened with Brexit. But she says the vote is an example of what happens when the media does not tell the truth. She says democracy needs defending; that is the lesson that needs to be taken from Brexit. Laura Huhtasaari, a Finnish MEP, says Friday will be a great moment. It will strike a blow against corporate elites. She ends by telling the Brexit party MEPs: \u201cI love you guys.\u201d Aileen McLeod, an SNP MEP, says she will vote against the withdrawal agreement, in accordance with the wishes of the Scottish people. She ends by saying she hopes the parliament will \u201cleave a light on for Scotland\u201d. Luisa Porritt, a Lib Dem MEP, says she will vote against the withdrawal agreement on behalf of hyer London constituents who voted remain. She says the only person celebrating this outside the UK are people who want to damage the country. She says young Brits will one day lead the campaign to rejoin. Anthea McIntyre, a Conservative, says she speaks as the proud daughter of a solider who fought at D-Day. The UK may be leaving the EU, but we remain Europeans, she says. Molly Scott Cato, the Green party MEP, starts her speech by saying that she feels she is about to cry. Now is not the time to campaign to return to rejoin the EU, she says. But she says it is important to keep the hope alive. She ends: I hold in my heart the knowledge that one day I will be back in this chamber, celebrating our return to Europe. As she finishes she gets emotional and tearful. She gets a loud and long standing ovation. It is a moving moment. Back in the European parliament Naomi Long, the Alliance MEP from Northern Ireland, says she will vote against the withdrawal agreement. That is to express her constituents\u2019 opposition to Brexit. She says she will never agree with this \u201cinsular, isolationist and reckless course of action\u201d. But she says she wants to thank Michel Barnier for ensuring that the withdrawal does not involve a hard Brexit. She ends by saying she expects Brexit to be reversed. \u201cGoodbye for now,\u201d she says. Fishing communities fear they will be \u201csold out\u201d in Brexit negotiations and do not believe government promises that the UK will take back control of British waters, representatives of coastal communities have said. Many believe the sector will be used as leverage in the upcoming talks and are concerned that Boris Johnson\u2019s government will buckle under pressure to make a trade off for other sectors including financial services. \u201cThere is a real genuine danger that they will be sold out and are facing into this with a fair degree of scepticism,\u201d said Luke Pollard the shadow environment secretary at a parliamentary event organised by the fishing industry this afternoon. They have every right to be afraid, there is a real risk they will be sold out and the promises made by the government will not be delivered. He was speaking a day after the government vowed that the automatic right of EU vessels to fish in British waters would be ended under proposals for a new fishing law. Matt Carthy, a Sinn Fein, says much work remains to be done to in the trade talks. He says Sinn Fein will protect Ireland\u2019s interests, which could be best served by Irish reunification. He says the Conservatives do not have a mandate to speak for any part of the island of Ireland. Antonia Maria Rinaldi, an Italian MEP from the rightwing League, says Michel Barnier has been the worst negotiator ever. Bill Newton Dunn, a Lib Dem MEP, says the main parties in Westminster have not told the public the truth about the country. The truth is that the UK is a European country, not a superpower. He says some UK politicians claimed the EU was only about free trade. But it was not, he says. It was always about more than that. He ends by calling for the establishment of a European FBI. The vice president of the parliament chairing this afternoon\u2019s session Mairead McGuinness, not Martina Anderson, as I wrongly stated earlier. I\u2019m sorry about that. Geoffrey Van Orden, the leader of Conservative MEPs, says it is in the interests of both sides to get a good trade deal. After Brexit the UK will still be a leading power in Europe. He says he wants the UK and the EU to have friendly relationship. He ends by thanking European parliament staff. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Jill Evans says, despite her best efforts, she has failed to get Welsh accepted as an official language in the parliament. She addresses MEPs in Welsh for a bit. Returning to English, she says the UK is leaving now. \u201cBut we will be back,\u201d she says. Caroline Voaden, leader of the Lib Dems in the European parliament, says Brexit is the result of a divide in one of the UK\u2019s older political parties. The Conservatives should have split years ago, she says, but could not because of the political system. One advantage of Brexit is that it might focus attention on the system\u2019s flaws. Labour\u2019s Richard Corbett says more than half of voters at the UK general election voted for parties promising a second referendum on Brexit. He predicts that public opinion will continue to move against Brexit. And he says the catchphrase in British public opinion next year will be \u201cBrexit isn\u2019t working.\u201d Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is speaking now. He says he is not particularly happy with the withdrawal agreement. But Boris Johnson has promised that there will be no level playing field, he claims. (Actually, it is more complicated than that. Ministers say they will not commit to remaining aligned with the EU. But they have refused to say to what extent they may decide to remain aligned voluntarily.) Farage says the EU has been very good at getting people to vote again. But the UK is too big to bully, he says. He says he became an outright opponent of the EU project. Both in Ukip, and the Brexit party, we love Europe. We just hate the European Union. He says the EU is not just undemocratic. It is anti-democratic. It is run by people who cannot be held to account by the electorate. He says the debate in the world is one between globalism and populism. He says populism is becoming popular. He says Brexit party MEPs will wave their flags. Farage and his Brexit party MEPs wave small union jacks. Mairead McGuinness, vice president of the parliament who is in the chair, asks them to put them away. (Waving flags is against the rule.) A few of them do three cheers. McGuinness tells the Brexit party MEPs to take their flags with them as they go. Some of them seem to be leaving now. UPDATE: I\u2019ve corrected this post because originally it named the vice president in the chair as Martina Anderson, not Mairead McGuinness. Martin Schirdewan, from the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, says the UK might not be the last country to leave the EU. He says the EU must put people first. Daniel Hannan, the Conservative MEP, says after the 1975 vote Eurosceptics in the UK accepted the decision to stay in the EU. But after Maastricht the mood changed. It became clear that the EU was turning into a quasi-state, with a flag and a president etc. If at any point the UK had been able to have a trade-only association, it would have stayed. He says if David Cameron had got any repatriation of power in February 2016, the UK would have stayed. The EU is \u201closing a bad tenant, but gaining a good neighbour\u201d, he says. Philippe Lamberts, co-head of the Green group in the parliament, says there is a reason why people have turned against the EU. It is because too many policies serve the interests of the few, not the many. The EU must fix this if it wants to avoid another Brexit, he says. It should ensure that all policies serve the interests of the vulnerable. And policies should respect nature too, he says. Nathalie Loiseau, a representative of the Renew group in the European parliament (and the former French Europe minister), is speaking now. She says she is speaking in English because she wants to address the British. She says they will be missed. The European parliament will ensure that citizens\u2019 rights are respected, she says. Addressing Brexiters, she says now they will have no one to blame but themselves. They won\u2019t be able to blame Brussels. But if they think Brexit will weaken the EU, they are wrong, she says. Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, head of the socialist group in the European parliament, is speaking now. She says, if the British people ever decide to return, the EU arms will always be open to them. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin Manfred Weber, head of the centre-right European People\u2019s party group, is speaking now. He says he regrets the fact Brexit is happening. He says it was the UK\u2019s decision to rule out an extension to the post-Brexit transition. He implies this is a mistake. We want to have the best agreement, not the quickest one. He also says that MEPs will not allow any cherry picking in the trade deal. Von der Leyen says she wants to achieve the best for young students who want to study abroad. She ends by quoting George Eliot. \u201cOnly in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love.\u201d We will always love you and we will never be far. Long live Europe. Von der Leyen says the EU is considering a zero tariff, zero quota free trade agrement. But for this to happen there must be a level playing field, she says. She says the EU will not expose its companies to unfair competition. She says the trade off is simple: the closer the UK stays to EU rules, the better the access to the single market will be. She says British car firms recently asked the UK government to stay aligned to EU rules. This is in both sides\u2019 interests, she says. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, is speaking now. She pays tribute to contribution made by Britons to the EU, in the commission and in the parliament. She says the EU will be vigilant in monitoring power-sharing in Northern Ireland. She says she wants to be very clear; she wants the EU and the UK to remain good friends and good partners. They have a lot in common, she says. They both believe climate change must be tackled as a matter of urgency. Verhofstadt says he has had hundreds of citizens from Britons wanting to stay in the EU. He says he is not sure what to say to them. But he says what the EU must do is ensure that when the UK returns to the EU, as he is sure it will, it must return to an effective union. He says: This vote is not an adieu. This vote is only, in my opinion, an au revoir. Verhofstadt says some people blame the EU because it did not offer enough to David Cameron in his renegotiation. But he says his view is that the Brexit process started many years ago, when it started offering countries opt-outs. He says that led to countries only accepting the advantages of the union, not the disadvantages too. Verhofstadt says MEPs have to consider the causes of Brexit. He says the UK voted for Brexit to get sovereignty. But it has to consider what sovereignty it will have if it has to plant Chinese telecommunications equipment all over the country. Verhofstadt says today is not a vote in favour of the principle of Brexit. It is a vote against a hard Brexit, and against a disorderly Brexit, he says. If he could vote on Brexit, he would vote against. He says what is happening is that \u201ca country that liberated us\u201d twice is leaving. MEPs in Brussels have finally started the debate on the EU withdrawal agreement. Originally the debate was meant to start at 2pm, but various other items came up first. Guy Verhofstadt, who has been the parliament\u2019s lead spokesman on Brexit, is speaking now. He says he wants to pay tribute to British MEPs - at last, the majorithy of them. They have broad wit, charm, intelligence - at least some of them, he says. And they have brought stubbornness too, he says. MEPs applaud. From the Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will chair a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee at 4.30pm, Downing Street said. In the European parliament the debate on the withdrawal agreement has not quite started yet. We\u2019ve had various procedural interventions first. The government has lost a legal challenge against high court rulings that it unlawfully discriminated against severely disabled people who were moved on to universal credit (UC), the Press Association reports. In a unanimous judgment, the court of appeal upheld two earlier rulings that people who previously received disability benefits had been less favourably treated as a result of moving on to the controversial benefits scheme. Two severely disabled men who had to apply for UC when they moved to a different local authority area won a declaration that they had been unlawfully discriminated against in June 2018. Here is Richard Burgon, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, has posted this on Twitter about President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin The European parliament is now debating the EU withdrawal agreement. There is a live feed here. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has posted this on Twitter ahead of his speech. Rebecca Long-Bailey, another Labour leadership candidate, did not take part when there was a Commons vote on building a third runway at Heathrow in June 2018. But today she has posted this on Twitter, signalling her clear opposition to the plan. Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry, the other three remaining leadership candidates, all voted against Heathrow expansion in 2018. Jess Phillips, who was in the contest before withdrawing last week, voted in favour. Sir Keir Starmer, another Labour leadership candidate, says he would only nominate people to sit in the House of Lords if they were prepared to sign a declaration promising to vote for its abolition. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary and Labour leadership candidate, has issued her own statement about President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan. She says it is an abomination. Ian Murray, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, has received endorsements of sorts from both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Brown formally says is is backing Murray. The Blair statement does not go quite that far, although that may be an acknowledgement of the fact that, given Blair\u2019s standing with Labour party members (62% of them have an unfavourable view of him), a proper Blair endorsement would be a mixed blessing. This is from the Tony Blair Institute. And here is a statement from Brown. He said: It is a privilege to be patron of Scientists for Labour. I know Ian Murray to have been committed to and directly involved in supporting investment in science in our country, not least because of his association with Edinburgh University and in particular its science campus at King\u2019s Buildings. I think that as a candidate whom I support for the deputy leadership he can ensure that the next Labour manifesto will give the priority to science and innovation that scientists deserve and is the best way forward for our country. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has told reporters that the US is still considering whether or not to restrict intelligence sharing with the UK in the light of the Huawei decision. Speaking to reporters on his flight to the UK, he also suggested that Washington is still hoping that the UK might change its mind. These are from the Washington Post\u2019s John Hudson. This is what Pompeo said when asked about the prospect of Washington reducing intelligence sharing. He said: We\u2019ll have to see what they actually do and importantly how they implement what they\u2019ve laid out. We\u2019ve had a chance to review what they\u2019ve said about it, so for now we have to see what that means from an execution and implementation perspective. It\u2019s pretty complex. There is also a chance for the United Kingdom to relook at this as implementation moves forward. In the European parliament the debate on the withdrawal agreement has not started yet. MEPs are marking the Holocaust Remembrance Day first. MEPs are about to start debating the EU withdrawal agreement. There is a live feed here. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin in Brussels Boris Johnson claimed that the Scottish government\u2019s plan for Edinburgh to be able to decide immigration policy for Scotland was \u201cfanciful and deranged\u201d. This is what he said when asked Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, asked about this at PMQs. Johnson said: I think the idea of having a Scottish-only visa with a border at Berwick and ... inspection posts, I think this is absolutely fanciful and deranged. Blackford replied: Nobody\u2019s suggesting such a thing and that just confirms the prime minister doesn\u2019t have a clue. Unlike the prime minister, experts back the Scottish government\u2019s proposals. The Scottish government\u2019s proposals will boost Scotland\u2019s population, grow our economy and protect public services. The UK\u2019s government\u2019s policies threaten to plunge our working age population into decline. We were told we would have the most powerful devolved parliament in the world, we were told we would be an equal partner in the family of nations. Will the prime minister now read the Scottish Government\u2019s proposal, listen to the evidence and deliver a tailored migration policy for Scotland? From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg UPDATE: Subsequently Downing Street said the decision would not come tomorrow. The Northern rail franchise is to be renationalised, the government has announced, with the state operator of last resort taking over the running of the struggling network from 1 March, my colleagues Gwyn Topham and Lucy Campbell report. Here are some lines from the post-PMQs briefing from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s spokesman. Boris Johnson\u2019s line at PMQs about the Scottish parliament not debating education for two years sounded very effective when he made it. (See 1.10pm.) But, according to the SNP\u2019s Ross Colquhoun, it wasn\u2019t quite true. Scotland has not broken apart from the UK yet, but the faultline seems to be getting bigger and in the Commons every week that crack is on display at PMQs. Boris Johnson seems to give more thought to countering Ian Blackford\u2019s arguments than Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s, and today he scored a good hit with a point about the Scottish parliament not debating education (where the SNP\u2019s record has been poor) for the last two years. But his jibe only served to highlight the fact that on the substance - Scotland being disadvantaged by not being able to set its own immigration policy, despite its immigration needs being quite different to England\u2019s - Blackford was right. The SNP case was strengthened by team discipline (various MPs making the same point). These were moments when Johnson faced forceful challenge. He is also facing an acute dilemma over HS2. At least three MPs asked about it, and he fobbed them off each time with a reply about the government announcement about HS2 being made very soon. But it was clear from the commotion in the Commons that Conservative MPs are split over this, and not afraid to say so. By contrast, Johnson is not facing much challenge at the moment from Corbyn. That is partly because Corbyn\u2019s own MPs are indifferent to what he is saying, and partly because Corbyn seems to have even less interest than he ever used to in mastering the theatrics of PMQs. That is not to say he wasn\u2019t talking sense; he was, and it was clear from listening to him that he is better informed about the Middle East and international human rights (a lifelong passion for him) than Johnson is (despite Johnson being a former foreign secretary). Corbyn was also right to expose the government announcement last week about no longer funding coal projects abroad with aid money as essentially cosmetic (because funding for oil and gas projects continues). But Caroline Lucas made this point with more passion and punch (see 12.21pm), and on the Middle East, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, Corbyn may have been right, but he did not inspire the house. That is not to say these issues aren\u2019t important; it is just that if you feel they are important, you should find a way of conveying that. It\u2019s not easy, but effective politics never is. UPDATE: The Johnson claim about the Scottish parliament and education may have sounded like an effective jibe, but the SNP has pointed out that it is not actually true. See 1.21pm. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, is making an announcement. He says he is setting up a new system. If he takes a decision against the strong advice of clerks, the clerk will have the right to place a copy of his advice in the Commons library. This system is modelled on the \u201cministerial direction\u201d system that allows civil servants, if they feel they are being ordered to go ahead with a spending plan that cannot be justified, to insist on being given a written \u201cministerial direction\u201d. It does not stop ministers doing what they want, but it serves as an incentive against rogue decision making. Hoyle\u2019s announcement is a response to the controversy generated by John Bercow when he over-ruled advice from his clerk, and effectively tore up the Commons rulebook, to allow a vote on an amendment opposed by Brexiters. Speaker announces plan to reduce prospect of officials\u2019 advice being ignored on procedural rulings. Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader at Westminster, says many people are not happy about Brexit. Will Johnson meet Plaid Cymru to discuss Wales\u2019 prospects after Brexit. Johnson says he agrees on the need for unity, but Wales voted for Brexit. Johnson repeats the point about the HS2 announcement coming shortly. An MP asks if the BBC is a mortal enemy of the Conservative party, or a much-prized national institution. That is a reference to what Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, used to say about the BBC. Johnson says the BBC is a much-prized institution. It is not a mortal enemy, he says. The SNP\u2019s Richard Thomson asks if Johnson will commit to keeping the UK in the Erasmus+ student exchange programme after Brexit. Johnson says nothing in Brexit will stop students being able to pursue their hopes and dreams around the EU. Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier asks what Johnson is going to do now to ensure there are more GPs. She says just training more is not good enough, because that takes years. Johnson says the government is training 6,000 more GPs. The SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan asks Johnson if he agrees that protecting Scotland\u2019s care sector with tailor-made immigration policies are more important than his ideological obsession with cutting immigration. Johnson claims existing plans take into account Scotland\u2019s needs. The DUP\u2019s Gregory Campbell asks if Johnson backs plans for pensions for innocent victims of violence in Northern Ireland. Johnson says the principle that victims must not be to blame for what happened must be maintained in these negotiations. Andy Carter, a Conservative, asks if the government will hire more doctors. Johnson says it will. This is the party of delivery and decision and democracy, he says. Labour\u2019s Karl Turner says seafarers are expected to work for less than the minimum wage. Will Johnson meet MPs to discuss this? Johnson says he accepts this is a serious issue, and he is happy to take this up. He says the transport secretary will convene a meeting. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, asks Johnson if he agrees the government should avoid hypocrisy. She says the government is putting \u00a32bn into fossil fuel programmes abroad. Johnson says spending on climate change projects has been doubled, and the government is not spending a penny more on coal projects. The SNP\u2019s Angela Crawley says Scotland should have the power to decide its own immigration policy. Johnson says he has the highest respect for Scotland and its people. But he has less respect for the SNP, he says. Johnson says the government is considering whether and how to proceed with HS2. An announcement will be made \u201cvery shortly\u201d. Labour\u2019s Sarah Champion asks if Johnson will make paying for sex illegal. Johnson says he is willing to look at this idea. Andrea Jenkyns, a Conservative, says in Yorkshire Brexiters will be celebrating Brexit on Friday. Johnson says he wishes them well in at the Brexit bash. Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, says Michael Gove once said Scotland would be able to decide its immigration policy after Brexit. On Monday the Scottish government published immigration plans. He asks Johnson why he objects to model three in the plan. Johnson says the idea of having a Scotland-only visa is \u201cfanciful\u201d. Whatever the document says on the page Blackford referred it, it won\u2019t say who would pay for it, he says. Blackford says the Scottish plans have wide support. They would boost Scotland\u2019s population, improve its economy and protect public services. Scotland was told it would be an equal partner. Will Johnson accept this plan? Johnson says his points-based immigration system will help the whole of the UK. He says the Scottish parliament has not had a debate on education for two years. Yet today it is debating flying the EU flag, he says. Sally-Ann Hart, a Conservative, asks for an asssurance that Hastings and Rye, her constituency, will not be overlooked in the PM\u2019s levelling up programme. Johnson says Hastings will benefit from the government\u2019s infrastructure programme. Corbyn says 100,000 people died in Yemen last year alone. When the PM goes to Saudia Arabia later this year, will he make it clear that any trade deal will be dependent on improvements in human rights? Johnson says Corbyn is a supporter of the Iranian regime, which has exacerbated the situation in Yemen he claims. He says the government will continue to support human rights. Corbyn says he has defended human rights around the world, including in Iran and Russia. He says prisoners in Saudia Arabia are being tortured. Britain is at a crossroads, he says. He says the signs are that Johnson wants to sell out this country, and the NHS, in a trade deal with President Trump. When will Johnson stand up for the fight against climate change, and promote peace? Johnson says Corbyn stood up for Tehran, and for President Putin when he poisoned people in Britain. Corbyn wants to abolish the armed forces, he says. And he does not support Nato, he says. He says his government is standing up for efforts to educate girls around the world. Corbyn says Johnson voted against action on climate change on every occasion before be became PM. He says President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan is not a peace plan. When Johnson meets Mike Pompeo, will he call for a genuine peace plan? Johnson says this problem has bedevilled the world for years. He says this plan is a genuine peace plan, and it could lead to a two-state solution. Corbyn says he has met Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Palestinian authority many times. He asks if Johnson will stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia while the crisis in Yemen continues. Johnson says Corbyn should be supporting the British negotiator trying to bring both sides together. Jeremy Corbyn starts with a tribute to a solider who died this week, and to Nicholas Parsons. He says COP26 will be one of the biggest tests for the UK after Brexit. Should the UK be financing oil and gas projects across the world? Johnson says the UK will continue to compaign against carbon emissions around the world. The government has just banned the use of aid money for coal projects. Corbyn says the government is still financing other carbon projects. The government is currently on track to meet the net zero carbon target by 2099, he says. Johnson says the UK has reduced CO2 emissions by 42%, while the economy has grown. Johnson says he wants to assure people that the UK will have the access to the best technology available. But it won\u2019t do anything to imperil intelligence cooperation with the US either. The SNP\u2019s Carol Monaghan says the UK was a beacon of hope during the second world war for Jews. But when the government rejected the Dubs amendment, the beacon dimmed. Will the government devolve power over immigration to Scotland? Boris Johnson says the UK can be proud of its record on refugees. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Boris Johnson is due to hold another \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook this afternoon at 5pm. For a taste of what to expect, it is worth watching this video he posted on Twitter yesterday. Newsnight\u2019s Lewis Goodall posted a good thread on Twitter factchecking Johnson\u2019s comments. It starts here. As British MEPs arrived in the European parliament in Brussels this morning, they were greeted by a sign above the chamber could be seen reading: \u201cIt\u2019s not goodbye, it\u2019s au revoir.\u201d As the Press Association reports, the message had been put up by the S&amp;D, a coalition of socialist parties. Here are the main points from Lisa Nandy\u2019s LBC phone-in. Nandy said Twitter had created \u201creal problems\u201d for the left because it gave activists a misleading view of what the public thought. She said that she had taken Twitter off her phone. She explained: I\u2019ve taken it off my phone, which means I\u2019m slightly clueless about some of the things that people keep asking me about in the Westminster bubble. But it is a lovely place to be [ie, off Twitter]. To be honest, if you start thinking that all of that is real [ie, Twitter], that\u2019s where you get into real problems. And that has been a bit of a problem for the left in recent years. We spent a lot of time in this sort of hothouse of social media, particularly Twitter, when most of the country, if they are on social media, seem to be on Facebook. And we talk among ourselves. And we think that we are doing well when we\u2019re not. And we think we\u2019re doing badly when we\u2019re not. And we just haven\u2019t learnt how to understand the public. And we should be out there amongst the public if we really want to understand what\u2019s happening. She said that the government\u2019s support for President Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. She said that, as someone who had been vice chair and then chair of Labour Friends of Palestine, she was \u201chorrified\u201d by the plan because it could end any prospect of a two-state solution. Referring to a Foreign Office statement describing the plan as \u201ca serious proposal\u201d, she said that was \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. She went on: As the UK government, we have a history in the Middle East, we had a role to play in creating these problems in the first place. And to not stand up now, when we can see the implications of what the Trump administration is doing, is really, really disgraceful. Britain has got to find its voice again. Q: People are calling Nandy blue Labour. Why is that? Nandy says the only time she has rebelled recently in the Commons was when the party was backing tax cuts for the wealthy. So in that regard she is to the left of Jeremy Corbyn, she says. Q: What is your view of Trump\u2019s Middle East peace plan? Nandy says she is \u201chorrified\u201d by it. It closes of any hope of a two-state solution, she says. She says that is bad for Israel. She says Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said the Trump plan should be taken seriously. \u201cThat is disgraceful,\u201d she says. And that\u2019s it. The phone-in is over. Q: Which part of the party does the rancour come from most? Nandy says she has friends in every part of the Labour party. It is family to her. There are people in parliament she is good friends with, despite not agreeing with them much on policy. Q: Can you get Momentum and centrists dads to march alongside each other? Yes, says Nandy. She says the two groups did work together during the election campaign. She says if people in the Labour party are \u201cjust anti\u201d, that will kill the Labour party. Q: I find your comment about Catalonia offensive. Why did you say what you said? Nandy says she did not say that the Spanish government was taking the right approach to Catalonia, as the caller claims. She says her words were wilfully distorted by the SNP. She says the point she was making was that Labour had not been able to counter arguments made by Scottish nationalists. She says she was talking about the peaceful struggle for social justice in Catalonia. Of course she was not defending the police treatment of separatists in Catalonia, she says. She says her remark was distorted by the SNP. The SNP have done this over and over again, she says. They exploit the politics of grievance. She claims that that is because the SNP do not want to talk about her record. O\u2019Brien asks the caller where he got the idea that Nandy had endorsed violence. He says he cannot see how anyone got that idea from what she said in her Andrew Neil interview, unless they were told that by the SNP. The caller says he is not claiming that Nandy endorsed violence. Nandy says Labour supported the idea of having a Brexit referendum. But it had not made the case for EU membership before the campaign began. The campaign was lost before it started, she says. The FT\u2019s Jim Pickard has tweeted these about his Labour story. (See 10.13am.) And here\u2019s an extract from his story (paywall). Labour\u2019s official report into its worst electoral defeat for 80 years has exonerated leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying it would be \u201cunrealistic\u201d not to blame the result on Brexit. The report was written by election co-ordinators Andrew Gwynne and Ian Lavery and was circulated on Tuesday at a meeting of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee (NEC). The document concluded there was \u201cno easy way for Labour to address the Brexit issue\u201d given how it divided voters, according to party officials who have seen it. The authors briefly considered the possibility that Mr Corbyn\u2019s leadership and radical manifesto could have played a role in the epic defeat. But they said this was not the case, arguing neither had been a problem in the 2017 general election, when the party made large electoral gains. \u201cIt is unlikely that radicalism per se was the problem in a country looking for change,\u201d the report said. Mr Corbyn, far from being a weak or divisive leader, was instead the victim of four years of unrelenting attacks on his character, they wrote. This was an \u201cassault without precedent in modern politics\u201d, they said. Q: Jim Pickard in the FT today says the Labour report into the election says Jeremy Corbyn can be exonerated for what happened. Do you agree? Nandy says no one can be exonerated for what happened. Lisa Nandy, a Labour leadership candidate, is holding a phone-in on LBC now. James O\u2019Brien is presenting. Nandy says she has not been planning this for years. She did not want to be Labour leader from the age of nine. And she has not been planning a bid for the last two years. But she did enter the contest to win, she says. She says she is not here just to broaden the debate. You can do that as an MP. Q: Why did Labour lose? Nandy says the two factors mentioned most were Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn. But, beyond that, there are other reasons why Labour has been losing working class support for years. Q: But why did people feel that the Conservative party instead? Nandy says the \u201cnastiness and divisions and infighting\u201d did not help. But she says most people are not on Twitter. Q: And you are off it now? Nandy says she has taken if off her phone. She says that is lovely. She says she thinks Twitter has become a problem for the left, because it gives a misleading view of what people think. She says it is not even representative of social media, because there are more people on Facebook. Nandy says Twitter has become a problem for the left, because it gives activists a misleading view of what people think. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been holding a press conference in Brussels. Here are some of the highlights, from my colleague Jennifer Rankin, the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp, LBC\u2019s Christian Mitchell and Sky\u2019s Adam Parsons. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, will attend his last debate in the European parliament as an MEP this afternoon. He has been a member of the parliament since 1999. In an interview on the Today programme this morning he made two valedictory claims - both of which are highly questionable. Farage claimed that Brexit would mark the \u201cbeginning of the end\u201d for the EU. He said: I think, two years down the road, there\u2019ll be a big debate going on in many other countries about what kind of Europe do people want. Do they want a Europe of trading co-operation or a Europe run by these institutions in Brussels, and I think the UK\u2019s departure really will mark the beginning of the end of this European project. This claim is dubious because polling evidence suggests that support for EU membership remains very high - it\u2019s over 80% in most member states - and that pro-EU sentiment on the continent has actually gone up since the UK voted to leave in 2016. In a recent speech in London Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said Brexit had strengthened unity amongst the EU27. She said: One consequence of the Brexit vote has been to strengthen the unity and the faith in Europe as a project for the common good. The truth is that Brexit has highlighted the value of being together in today\u2019s ever more unsettled world. When Farage was asked in his interview about polling showing that support for EU membership had risen across Europe since Brexit, he said that was just because people had seen the UK \u201cmake such a Horlicks\u201d of leaving. Farage claimed the UK would get a good trade deal from the UK because it was in \u201can enormously powerful position\u201d. He said: I think we\u2019re in an enormously powerful position. There is now genuine fear in this building I\u2019m in this morning [Farage was speaking to Today from Brussels] about Brexit and here\u2019s what the fear is, particularly coming from the Germans - they\u2019re very scared that we will become more competitive than they are. The whole single market is based on this premise of a level playing field - it is actually anti-competitive by its very nature, and I think that is a very strong card for us to play because, after all, we still buy an awful lot of German motor cars. I think the truth of it is, if we negotiate tough in this next round, we will come out at the end of the year with something pretty reasonable. This is just the latest iteration of the long-running claim that pressure from German BMW manufacturers and Italian Prosecco producers will ensure the EU offers the UK easy access to the single market after Brexit. So far it has turned out to be a poor guide to EU negotiating behaviour because EU leaders have been more interested in protecting the integrity of the single market than in featherbedding BMW. In an interview broadcast on Monday Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (PM) said he thought the UK was in a relatively weak position in the trade talks in comparison with the EU. Brexit is getting closer and closer, and now the instrument of ratification - the document that legally formalises the UK\u2019s withdrawal - has been signed and deposited with the EU. Here is Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, signing it. And here is Sir Tim Barrow, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the EU, handing it in. Boris Johnson is now facing the threat of his first Commons rebellion since the general election, over his decision to let the Chinese firm Huawei play a role in building the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure. Conservative MPs expressed their concerns in the Commons yesterday and, although they were not quite as outspoken as some were when the same topic was discussed on Monday, talk of a revolt is firming up. The government announced yesterday that it plans to legislate to ensure that \u201chigh risk vendors\u201d (ie, Huawei) can only run 35% of the 5G network. Legislation means votes, and voting means backbenchers have leverage (because the main opposition parties, Labour and the SNP, are also very critical of this decision on national security grounds). On Newsnight last night Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative party leader, said that there would have to be \u201cmodification\u201d to the government\u2019s plans and that the 35% threshold was too high. And on the Today programme this morning Damian Green, the former first secretary of state, also said that he wanted to see the 35% figure driven down in a future vote. Asked how much support the rebels might have from Tory backbenchers for such a plan, he said: Well, one of the things that that frankly surprised me was the breadth of the opposition to the current stance of the government on the Conservative back benches. We don\u2019t know yet, when push comes to shove and votes happen, how many people will actually put their heads above the parapet. But certainly it\u2019s very widespread. The government has a majority of 80, and Green conceded that that meant roughly 40 MPs would need to rebel for the government to be at risk of defeat. But he did not rule this out. There did appear to be very widespread opposition from members old and new, on the left and right of the party, so there\u2019s there was very widespread, strong unease about the way the government is going on this. Green\u2019s intervention confirmed the very point he was making. While Duncan Smith is on the right of the party, Green himself is firmly on the Tory left. New MPs may be more reluctant to rebel than old ones, of course, and the government could make concessions over the 35% target to appease its critics, but it can\u2019t go too far without driving Huawei out of the 5G market, which would defeat the point of the announcement made yesterday. This is definitely one for the chief whip\u2019s \u201cproblems\u201d folder. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Lisa Nandy, a candidate for the Labour leadership, holds a phone-in on LBC. 10am: MPs start voting in elections for select committee chairs. The ballot closes at 4pm, and the results will be announced at some point after that. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 2pm (UK time): MEPs debate the EU withdrawal agreement. The vote will come at 5pm. 2pm: The National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations (NFFO) and the Scottish Fishermen\u2019s Federation hold an event in parliament to lobby MPs. Around 5pm: Johnson is expected to hold a \u201cPeople\u2019s PMQs\u201d on Facebook. Afternoon: Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, arrives in London for talks with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, today, and with Johnson tomorrow. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "As the UK government prepares to airlift hundreds of British nationals out of Wuhan in response to the coronavirus outbreak, the Guardian answers five key questions for those stranded in the country. How can British nationals arrange to be evacuated from China? The government has chartered a flight to airlift British nationals out of Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, and there are expected to be about 200 people onboard. The flight was due to depart on Thursday morning, but the evening before it emerged it would be delayed as permission had not yet been granted by Chinese authorities. It is open to all British nationals in the Hubei province, but anyone showing signs of illness will not be allowed to board. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have advised any British nationals in the area who need assistance to contact their 24/7 helplines on +86 (0) 10 8529 6600 or (+44) (0)207 008 1500. Although a deadline for registering for evacuation was in place for 11am on Wednesday, the FCO is urging any nationals still looking to leave the country to get in touch. Will those with dual nationality, or family members of British nationals, be allowed to evacuate? Under Chinese restrictions, only British passport holders who do not hold Chinese nationality are permitted to leave through the evacuation. China does not recognise dual citizenship, and official government advice states that if you are British and Chinese, you are likely to be considered a Chinese citizen by the Chinese authorities. The FCO said the British Embassy in Beijing was urgently pressing the Chinese authorities to allow dependents of British nationals and British-Chinese dual nationals to leave. However, Beijing has restated its position and other countries, including the US, have only been allowed to take mono-nationals. What about people in other parts of China? The current plan is for evacuation from Wuhan airport only. Some commercial airlines are still operating out of other airports across China, although British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China. The Foreign Office said it might become more difficult for British nationals in other Chinese provinces to leave and said they should \u201cmake decisions based on their own personal circumstances\u201d over whether to evacuate. How can people get to the airport? Many roads in Hubei province are blocked as the Chinese authorities try to control movement and stop the spread of the virus. Some citizens have been told they will need a diplomatic note in order to pass through roads and reach the airport, but the FCO was unable to confirm what support is in place to help people with this. What will happen to people once they arrive back in the UK? All Britons returning from Wuhan will be quarantined for 14 days once they return to the UK. They will be placed in isolation units with medical care, which government sources said could potentially be a military base. Those who have already returned from Wuhan have been advised to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people, and to call NHS 111 to inform them if they have recently travelled to the city.",

But Dowling\u2019s son lives on the other side of the city, south of the Yangtze river which intersects it, and, with the entire city on lockdown, there is no means of travel to reach the airport. </p> <p>The Foreign Office, Dowling said, is not helping Britons with their travel through Wuhan. He told the Guardian: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[My son] did phone up the Foreign Office for advice. They told him to go to the local police station to ask for transport. He did that and the police told him to phone the embassy.</p> <p>On the group chat [on social media between British nationals in Wuhan] this is a constant theme with it sounds like quite a number of them not at all sure how they are going to get to the airport. </p> <p>I have just spoken myself to the FCO and the person there was still saying that as far as he knew there was not meant to be any assistance in reaching the airport other than to send [Britons in Wuhan] an email to show to the road blocks. </p> </blockquote> <p>The Guardian has contacted the Foreign Office for comment. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e31bc248f08e133247393f9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T17:14:53.681Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fa110e1c3588647971fcce0a52d87e2ad2867129\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa110e1c3588647971fcce0a52d87e2ad2867129/414_519_1077_1347/800.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organisation (WHO) health emergencies programme at a news conference in Geneva on the coronavirus situation\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organisation (WHO) health emergencies programme at a news conference in Geneva on the coronavirus situation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Balibouse/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The World Health Organisation\u2019s emergencies chief says China is taking \u201cextraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge\u201d because of the virus outbreak, the <strong>Associated Press</strong> reports.<br></p> <p> Dr Michael Ryan said the epidemic remains centred in the city of Wuhan and in Hubei province but that information is being updated and is changing by the hour.

The death rate for SARS, a related virus, was about 10%.</p> <p>However, the few instances of the new virus spreading between people in countries beyond China, including Germany, are of great concern, Ryan added. He said that is part of the reason why the UN health agency\u2019s director-general has reconvened a coronavirus expert committee to meet Thursday. It will assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency. </p> <p>Ryan made his comments to reporters on Wednesday after returning from a trip to Beijing to discuss the new virus with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders.</p> <p>To date, about 99% of the nearly 6,000 cases are in China.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T17:15:17.530Z\">at 5.15pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e31b6248f086a28115a1bd3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T16:50:34.630Z\">4.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p> A plane evacuating 201 Americans from the Chinese city at the centre of the virus outbreak has arrived at a southern California military base after everyone onboard passed a health screening test in Anchorage, where the aircraft had stopped to refuel, the <strong>Associated Press</strong> reports.</p> <p>The jet landed shortly after 8am local time at March Air Reserve Base about 60 miles (96km) east of Los Angeles.

There is now very good scientific evidence that the incubation period before symptoms appear can be as long as 14 days. In addition, there is some limited evidence of spread from people who are not yet showing symptoms. Both of these issues highlight the need for quarantine. Although there are appropriately some concerns raised about the human rights issue, these need to be considered in the light of the wider risk to the population of the potential spread of the virus. Restricting person-to-person contact is the most effective way of preventing this spreading.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the level of coronavirus infection, it makes sense to quarantine and test people being evacuated form Wuhan City. But we might lose sight of the fact that the outbreak seems more widespread than that and at some time, probably soon, a decision will have to be made about all Britons located in Hubei province and China in general, especially if the virus outbreak continues to escalate. If these people also need to be brought back, then the task in hand would probably become unmanageable.</p> <p>The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than Sars. The reasons for this are unclear, but clearly the larger the outbreak grows the more difficult it becomes to contain it using usual infection control measures \u2013 identifying then isolating infected people and tracing and monitoring their contacts.</p> <p>At the moment, virus that has been exported from China to other countries has not led to significant onward transmission, although the identification of infected individuals in some of those countries that have not had direct contact with China is concerning as it reminds us that the virus has the capability of being passed on.</p> <p>There are still too many unknowns \u2013 the true scale of the problem, the frequency of symptom-less infection, the amount of transmission that occurs by people with and without symptoms, the extent at which infected individuals have travelled and their destination \u2013 to be certain. It is certainly possible for this virus to become widespread and eventually become just another circulating human respiratory virus, but it\u2019s still very early days and with little onward transmission in other parts of the world, this might not happen. If this scenario did play out, however, then we need to get a better handle on the relative frequency of severe disease and death so that healthcare structures are able to deal with it.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T15:27:30.415Z\">at 3.27pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e31a06a8f086a28115a1a91\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-29T15:13:10.403Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Damien Gayle</strong> here, taking over the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin, who has finished for the day. </p> <p>If you have come across coronavirus news you think we need to look at, please do drop me a line.

      "bodyText": "The official death toll in China from coronavirus has risen to 132, with 5,974 cases confirmed, overtaking the number of people infected in the mainland by the Sars epidemic in 2002-3. In the UK 130 people have been tested for coronavirus, with all results negative, according to the latest update from the Department of Health and Social Care. British nationals are due to be repatriated from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, on Thursday morning. However, with the city on lockdown, fears have been raised that many may not be able to reach the airport. Finland, the United Arab Emirates and Tibet confirmed their first cases of coronavirus, while a fourth case was confirmed in France and a sixth in Australia. British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China, following travel advice from the Foreign Office that warned against all but essential travel to the country due to the coronavirus outbreak Evacuation flights from Wuhan to Japan and the United States have taken place, repatriating about 200 Japanese and 200 US nationals. The World Health Organisation\u2019s emergency committee will meet again on Thursday, the third time in a week, to evaluate whether the new coronavirus spreading from China constitutes an international emergency. Fears have been raised that many of the British nationals registered for the evacuation flight from Wuhan tomorrow morning may not actually be able to make it to the airport to catch the plane. The Guardian was contacted by Robert Dowling, from Nottingham, whose 22-year-old son is in Wuhan and had been due to get the flight. But Dowling\u2019s son lives on the other side of the city, south of the Yangtze river which intersects it, and, with the entire city on lockdown, there is no means of travel to reach the airport. The Foreign Office, Dowling said, is not helping Britons with their travel through Wuhan. He told the Guardian: [My son] did phone up the Foreign Office for advice. They told him to go to the local police station to ask for transport. He did that and the police told him to phone the embassy. On the group chat [on social media between British nationals in Wuhan] this is a constant theme with it sounds like quite a number of them not at all sure how they are going to get to the airport. I have just spoken myself to the FCO and the person there was still saying that as far as he knew there was not meant to be any assistance in reaching the airport other than to send [Britons in Wuhan] an email to show to the road blocks. The Guardian has contacted the Foreign Office for comment. The World Health Organisation\u2019s emergencies chief says China is taking \u201cextraordinary measures in the face of an extraordinary challenge\u201d because of the virus outbreak, the Associated Press reports. Dr Michael Ryan said the epidemic remains centred in the city of Wuhan and in Hubei province but that information is being updated and is changing by the hour. Many of those affected experience only a mild illness and estimated that the death rate is at about 2%, he said. The death rate for SARS, a related virus, was about 10%. However, the few instances of the new virus spreading between people in countries beyond China, including Germany, are of great concern, Ryan added. He said that is part of the reason why the UN health agency\u2019s director-general has reconvened a coronavirus expert committee to meet Thursday. It will assess whether the outbreak should be declared a global emergency. Ryan made his comments to reporters on Wednesday after returning from a trip to Beijing to discuss the new virus with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other senior government leaders. To date, about 99% of the nearly 6,000 cases are in China. A plane evacuating 201 Americans from the Chinese city at the centre of the virus outbreak has arrived at a southern California military base after everyone onboard passed a health screening test in Anchorage, where the aircraft had stopped to refuel, the Associated Press reports. The jet landed shortly after 8am local time at March Air Reserve Base about 60 miles (96km) east of Los Angeles. Ground crew dressed in white protective clothing approached the aircraft shortly after it landed and three charter-style buses parked near the plane. Federal and local public health officials scheduled a media briefing for later in the morning. All the passengers had already undergone two health screenings in China and were screened twice more in Anchorage by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. One passenger received medical attention for a minor injury that happened before boarding the airplane in China, Dr Anne Zink, Alaska\u2019s chief medical officer, told reporters after the plane left. A major international summit on biodiversity set to take place in China next month is under threat because of the coronavirus outbreak, Patrick Greenfield reports. The Chinese government and the United Nations are now considering postponing the planned negotiations for a Paris-style agreement on biodiversity, which had been due to take place between 24 and 29 February. Biodiversity experts and government policy makers were set to meet in Kunming, Yunnan to discuss plans to protect a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land by 2030. The United Nations told the Guardian that they are reviewing the in consultation with the Chinese government, the WHO and other agencies. The British government is urgently pressing Beijing to allow dual nationals to leave China after public outcry over families being split up during the coronavirus evacuations, reports my colleague Jess Murray. Only British passport holders who do not also hold Chinese nationality are being allowed to leave. The British embassy in Beijing is urging the Chinese to let dependents of British nationals and British-Chinese dual nationals leave too. \u201cOur priority is to keep British nationals and their family members together and we have urgently raised this with the Chinese authorities,\u201d a Foreign Office spokesperson said on Wednesday. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, raised the issue of dual nationals with his Chinese counterpart on Tuesday, but the Chinese government has maintained its stance. The World Health Organization\u2019s emergency committee will meet on Thursday, the third time in a week, to evaluate whether the new coronavirus spreading from China constitutes an international emergency, the WHO said. \u201cThe committee will advise the director general on whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), and what recommendations should be made to manage it,\u201d the WHO said in a statement issued in Geneva before a news briefing by senior WHO expert Mike Ryan on his return from China. The emergency committee, composed of 16 independent experts, twice last week declined to declare a global emergency. But today, the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who recently returned from a trip to China, tweeted that he would reconvene the committee to discuss whether such a declaration was now warranted. Sudan suspects that two of its citizens who returned to the country from China are infected with the new coronavirus, the information minister told Reuters. One of the pair, a man and a woman, had been in the region of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the virus, said Faisal Saleh. Both are under medical checks. We will update if there is any further information or a confirmation on whether the pair are infected. Finland has announced its first confirmed case of coronavirus, in a tourist from Wuhan who was visiting Lapland, the Helsinki-based Swedish language paper Hufvudstadsbladet reports. The patient has been quarantined at Lapland\u2019s central hospital in Rovaniemi after developing symptoms and seeking medical help. About 15 people may have been exposed to the infection. Mika Salminen, the director of Finland\u2019s institute of health and welfare said: It was expected that illness cases related to tourism would also occur in Finland. The risk is still small that the disease is spreading in Finland, so you do not have to worry We have prepared for any cases in Finland. The healthcare and laboratories have ready-made business models. The hospitals are prepared to investigate and treat coronavirus infections in isolated conditions A fourth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in France, Le Parisien reports. The patient is a Chinese tourist from Hubei province of about 80 years old, according to details released at a press conference on Tuesday. The man was in intensive care at a Paris hospital. France was the first European country to confirm coronavirus infections, with three confirmed diagnoses announced last Friday. More British scientists have been giving their reactions to the news that Britons evacuated from Wuhan will be placed in a 14-day quarantine. Prof Mark Harris, Professor of Virology, University of Leeds: The plans for an organised quarantine of people evacuated from Wuhan makes much more sense than a proposal that people would quarantine themselves. There is now very good scientific evidence that the incubation period before symptoms appear can be as long as 14 days. In addition, there is some limited evidence of spread from people who are not yet showing symptoms. Both of these issues highlight the need for quarantine. Although there are appropriately some concerns raised about the human rights issue, these need to be considered in the light of the wider risk to the population of the potential spread of the virus. Restricting person-to-person contact is the most effective way of preventing this spreading. Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham: Given the level of coronavirus infection, it makes sense to quarantine and test people being evacuated form Wuhan City. But we might lose sight of the fact that the outbreak seems more widespread than that and at some time, probably soon, a decision will have to be made about all Britons located in Hubei province and China in general, especially if the virus outbreak continues to escalate. If these people also need to be brought back, then the task in hand would probably become unmanageable. The rapidity of this outbreak is startling and certainly much more rapid than Sars. The reasons for this are unclear, but clearly the larger the outbreak grows the more difficult it becomes to contain it using usual infection control measures \u2013 identifying then isolating infected people and tracing and monitoring their contacts. At the moment, virus that has been exported from China to other countries has not led to significant onward transmission, although the identification of infected individuals in some of those countries that have not had direct contact with China is concerning as it reminds us that the virus has the capability of being passed on. There are still too many unknowns \u2013 the true scale of the problem, the frequency of symptom-less infection, the amount of transmission that occurs by people with and without symptoms, the extent at which infected individuals have travelled and their destination \u2013 to be certain. It is certainly possible for this virus to become widespread and eventually become just another circulating human respiratory virus, but it\u2019s still very early days and with little onward transmission in other parts of the world, this might not happen. If this scenario did play out, however, then we need to get a better handle on the relative frequency of severe disease and death so that healthcare structures are able to deal with it.\u201d Damien Gayle here, taking over the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin, who has finished for the day. If you have come across coronavirus news you think we need to look at, please do drop me a line. As usual, you can contact me via my Twitter account \u2013 @damiengayle \u2013 or via email on damien.gayle@theguardian.com. 130 people have tested negative in the UK for coronavirus, according to the latest update from the Department of Health and Social Care. The UK has asked the European Union for help to repatriate its citizens from Wuhan \u2013 two days before the country leaves the bloc. Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, the European commissioner for crisis management, listed the countries that have requested help from the EU at a press conference this afternoon. The list includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and the UK. A 21-year-old British student in Beijing has been told she cannot leave her dorm room for 12 days after returning from a trip to Wuhan. Georgia, who is at Tsinghua University, arrived in Wuhan on 12 January and returned to Beijing on 23 January after spending a few days in Dalian. She is showing no symptoms of the coronavirus but is quarantined to her room until 3 February. She said: \u201cWhen I left Wuhan no one was really wearing a mask. Some people were even under the impression that the situation was getting better. The university wanted me to move to a centralised isolation building on campus, but I have type 1 diabetes so asked to stay in my room so I could access a fridge. I\u2019m not allowed to leave and have to call the dormitory manager twice a day with my temperature, but the university has been wonderful and provides free meals which are delivered to my door.\u201d The sudden change in activity levels and a diet that consists almost purely of rice is starting to take a toll on my diabetes management. The isolation paired with the constant high sugar levels has made it difficult, but I understand that it\u2019s essential and I\u2019m grateful for the care I\u2019ve been shown.\u201d Here\u2019s some reactions from scientists in the UK to the news that British nationals will be evacuated from Wuhan and quarantined for 14 days. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: The quarantine will be precautionary. Over 100 tests have been carried out in the UK so far with all of them negative for coronavirus infection. However, this new restriction may reflect the increase in cases in China over the last 24 hours, and ongoing concern about cases coming into the UK and the potential for person-to-person transmission.\u201d Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: This is a different type of coronavirus, compared with what we saw with Sars, so it will behave a little differently. Here, there have been more cases in China, but so far with a lower death rate than the Sars outbreak. A pandemic is typically called by the World Health Organization after there has been sustained transmission across many countries. Though there have been cases reported in several countries now, we\u2019re not quite at that stage of sustained transmission yet. A British teacher in Shanghai, who asked the Guardian to remain anonymous, is staying in China after he was unable to get a visa for his young daughter. \u201cWe were unable to get out and now airlines are shutting down flights. We are safely back in our apartment and trying to relax and make the best of the situation. We have food to last around two weeks but obviously we are a little concerned. \u201cWe\u2019ve got two small children and with the situation rapidly changing we are becoming more and more isolated. I think this raises many questions about the British government\u2019s policies on family and citizenship. It\u2019s incredibly hard to stay as a family and be mobile internationally if you\u2019re in a \u2018mixed citizenship\u2019 family. We will only leave if we can go together.\u201d Japan and the US have airlifted hundreds of their citizens from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, as officials in China said the death toll from the disease had risen sharply overnight to 132, with nearly 1,500 new cases in the country. A government-chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese nationals arrived in Tokyo from Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Officials said four of the passengers \u2013 a woman and three men \u2013 had coughs and fevers and had been taken to a hospital in separate ambulances for treatment and further tests. Two of the four showed symptoms of pneumonia following scans, but a coronavirus diagnosis has not been confirmed, hospital representatives said. Officials in the US said a chartered plane had landed in Anchorage, Alaska, with about 240 US citizens onboard, including staff from the US consulate in Wuhan. More details have come through about the German plans for evacuation and quarantine. The health minister, Jens Spahn, said he expected the federal government to reach an agreement with authorities in the state of Hesse in the next few hours to get an evacuation of German citizens from China under way. Spahn said Germany wanted to fly out citizens in the province of Hubei as quickly as possible but wanted to ensure the evacuation was well prepared before evacuees were transported to Frankfurt. \u201cWe are therefore in close contact with the Hessian authorities to come to a solution between the federal government and authorities there and I assume that we will succeed in that in the next few hours so that the plane can take off quickly,\u201d he told reporters. \u2022 This entry was amended on 31 January 2020. It previously stated that Frankfurt was the capital of Hesse. This has been removed. China watchers have picked up on the way discontent with the authorities is rumbling \u2013 and finding an outlet online. Chenchen Zhang, a lecturer at Queens University Belfast, points out that legal authorities took issue with apparent punitive measures taken against some people for allegedly spreading false information. That intervention was followed up by a post on Weibo, the Chinese microblogging website, saying the eight people were \u201ccriticised and educated\u201d rather than being \u201cpunished\u201d. Cue criticism from the public \u2026 The French drugmaker Sanofi has said it is postponing all its events in China and has asked employees to stop all travel to and from Wuhan and Hubei province in China. The company said it had no plans to repatriate French employees from China over the spread of the new coronavirus. Germany\u2019s health ministry has said quarantine plans will be put in place for people returning from China on evacuation flights, according to Reuters. Germany\u2019s health minister says he expects agreement on evacuation within hours. At least four cases have been confirmed in Germany, making it the second European country to report cases after France. Lufthansa is waiting before it follows the example of British Airways in suspending flights to China. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation very closely,\u201d a Lufthansa spokesman told Deutsche Welle. All flights to and from China are running on schedule though the airline said it had observed a \u201cslight reluctance to book\u201d. Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, is facing questions on social media after maintaining a relatively low profile in the media over the past week. His tweet about people returning from China being isolated for 14 days prompted a query from Clare Wenham, an assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, about the legal implications of the government\u2019s policy. Others informed Hancock that the government\u2019s response was \u201cpathetically slow\u201d and criticised \u201cconfusing messaging\u201d. The FT\u2019s Tom Hancock, in China, contrasts the UK policy to that of the US. Unicef has shipped 6 metric tons of supplies, including respiratory masks and protective suits, to support China\u2019s response to coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis coronavirus is spreading at a breakneck speed and it is important to put all the necessary resources into halting it,\u201d said Unicef\u2019s executive director Henrietta Fore. \u201cWe may not know enough about the virus\u2019s impact on children or how many may be affected, but we do know that close monitoring and prevention are key. Time is not on our side.\u201d Unicef said it was working closely with the Chinese authorities, including the commerce ministry and the National Health Commission, as well as the World Health Organization (WHO). Beijing is normally buzzing with people at this time of year, but fears of a virus outbreak have kept many indoors and at home, AP reports. Cultural landmarks such as the Great Wall and Forbidden City have closed their doors to visitors, while shopping malls have reduced their operating hours and only a handful of restaurants have remained open for customers. British passengers returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan could be asked to sign a contract before they board the plane saying they agree to being placed in quarantine. Anyone who does not wish to sign could be asked to stay. It is thought at least 200 British citizens want to return. The Foreign Office admitted it could become more difficult for British nationals in other provinces to leave and advised them to \u201cmake decisions based on their own personal circumstances\u201d over whether to evacuate. The British embassy in Beijing warned that transport to get UK citizens out \u201cmay happen quickly and with short notice\u201d. Kazakhstan is suspending all passenger travel to and from neighbouring China, Reuters reports. The Kazakh government said on Wednesday that buses to and from China had already been halted, passenger trains will stop on 1 February and all flights will be suspended from 3 February. The government has also suspended issuing visas to Chinese citizens. Kazakhstan has refused to host the Asian Water Polo Championships next month or serve as a substitute host for the tennis Fed Cup qualifying event that was initially scheduled to take place next week in Dongguan, China. The former Soviet republic of 19 million has not registered any cases of the new virus. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, just tweeted that British nationals will be \u201csafely isolated\u201d for 14 days. Britons returning from coronavirus-hit Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 14 days, most likely at a facility on a military base, PA Media reports, citing UK government sources. Here\u2019s a a simple explainer on the coronavirus, answering questions on the symptoms caused by the virus, how is it transmitted from person to person, and at what point should someone see a doctor. Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care are advising those who have returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. Travellers who have returned should call NHS 111 to inform them of their recent travel to the city Yvonne Doyle, medical director at PHE, said: Isolating yourself from other people, like you would with other flu viruses, is in step with the best scientific and expert advice on how to stop the coronavirus from spreading. This means taking simple, common sense steps, such as staying at home and avoiding close contact with other people as much as possible. Virgin Atlantic will continue to operate its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai, the company said. Passengers are able to rebook or obtain a refund free of charge. The airline said in a statement: \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation regarding coronavirus and will always follow guidance as set out by relevant authorities. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland China, excluding Hong Kong. \u201cFor customers who have booked to travel to China, including Hong Kong, and would like to discuss their travel plans further, we would invite them to contact our customer care team via our SMS messaging system, on +44 (0)7481 339184. The team are happy to assist with any inquiries.\u201d Here\u2019s a report by Guardian reporter Jessica Murray and Michael Standaert on a British family trapped in the centre of the coronavirus outbreak being split up in coronavirus evacuations. A Chinese national has been confirmed to have novel coronavirus in Queensland, Australia. The 44 year old Chinese national, who is currently stable, but isolated in the Gold Coast University Hospital, is from the city of Wuhan. The relevant authority will be releasing more information at a press conference tomorrow. Dr Jeannette Young, the chief health officer in Queensland, has said the authorities are closely with the hotel where the Chinese women\u2019s national football team and their support staff are currently staying. the team were in the city of Wuhan on 22 January. \u201cWe are working closely with the hotel and the 32 individuals concerned \u2013 who are all well and not showing symptoms \u2013 and we have Queensland Heath staff present at the hotel,\u201d Young said. \u201cThe hotel is in the process of alerting other guests and staff and making suitable arrangements.\u201d Young added: \u201cWe want to reassure the public, no one else in this hotel, including staff, is at risk.\u201d The Chinese get creative to beat boredom: As the UK government finalises plans to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, one British man has spoken of his distress at not being able to leave immediately with his Indonesian wife. Nick House, who lives in the city with his Indonesian wife and two British children, told Sky News: \u201cWe would like to be out of here. The man on the other end of the phone said, \u2018Yes, you are on the list, but unfortunately your wife probably won\u2019t be able to get on the plane because she doesn\u2019t have a visa at the moment\u2019. \u201cI won\u2019t leave without my wife, so essentially the government are leaving three British people here for the sake of one seat on a plane.\u201d The US, Japan, and Turkey are evacuating their citizens on Wednesday from Wuhan, which is at the epicentre of the new virus outbreak, as health authorities report the number of confirmed cases has jumped to 5,974. According to a report by AP Media, the Turkish ambassador, Emin Onen, told the broadcaster NTV that Turkey had made the necessary applications to Chinese officials to evacuate 32 citizens, adding that none of them had been diagnosed with the virus. \u201cWe are in touch with all our citizens,\u201d Onen said. \u201cWe will bring them back as soon as possible \u2026 with a medical or similarly equipped plane. There will be certain quarantine conditions when they land in Turkey.\u201d The United Arab Emirates on Wednesday confirmed the first cases in the Middle East of the new coronavirus. Doctors are treating a family that had just come from a city at the epicentre of the outbreak, AP Media reports. The UAE\u2019s state-run WAM news agency made the announcement citing the health and prevention ministry, but did not provide details on where the family lived nor where they were receiving treatment. It also remains unclear how the family left Wuhan and made it to the UAE. China shut down Wuhan\u2019s airport and other transportation in the city last Thursday to stop the spread of the virus. The lockdown has since expanded to include 17 cities with more than 50 million people in all. Emirati officials are taking \u201call the necessary precautions in accordance with the scientific recommendations, conditions and standards approved by the World Health Organization\u201d, the ministry said. \u201cThe general health condition is not a cause for concern.\u201d The UK culture secretary, Baroness Morgan, hopes BA\u2019s decision to suspend all flights to China would give \u201cmore impetus\u201d for the government to make plans to evacuate Britons from the region. Morgan told BBC Breakfast: The Foreign Office will be working with staff on the ground to identify UK nationals. We will get people home as soon as we can, as soon as we can make arrangements. Obviously, today\u2019s decision by British Airways provides more impetus to the government to make other plans and communicate those. The health system is well-prepared. We are not aware of any confirmed cases of the virus here in the UK but we do have the expertise to look after people, to treat and to test should that become necessary. The Chinese women\u2019s national football team has been quarantined in Queensland after arriving on Wednesday morning. The Australian Associated Press reports that the team, who were were in the city of Wuhan on 22 January, will be required to stay at their inner-city hotel until 5 February over fears that members may have the deadly coronavirus. New restrictions being enforced by the state government require anyone returning from Wuhan to self-isolate for a fortnight after leaving the central Chinese city. Britain is finalising plans to evacuate its nationals from the coronavirus-hit Chinese province of Hubei. Flights taking Britons back home could begin as early as Thursday, PA Media reports. The deadline for those in the city of Wuhan and surrounding areas to contact the British consulate expressing their wish to leave passed at 3am UK time (11am local time). Flights evacuating Britons could begin as early as Thursday, according to a British teacher in Wuhan city. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the liveblog from my colleague Ben Doherty. British Airways has suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China, following travel advice from the Foreign Office that warned against all but essential travel to the country due to the coronavirus outbreak. BA.com, the airline\u2019s website, shows no direct flights to China are available in January and February, Reuters reports. \u201cWe apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,\u201d BA said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. \u201cCustomers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on BA.com.\u201d Indonesia has no cases of coronavirus. But, according to its foreign ministry, 243 Indonesian nationals are in Hubei, about 100 of those in Wuhan. Indonesian students in the city have said they want to get out, but can\u2019t. \u201cThe Indonesian government has to take quick and appropriate measures to ensure the evacuation of Indonesian citizens who are currently in Wuhan,\u201d Golkar party parliamentarian Christina Aryani told the Jakarta Post in a statement. \u201cLeaving our citizens there is just the same as letting them wait their turn to get infected.\u201d As the UK prepares to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, some of the logistical and bureaucratic challenges of extracting people from a city under lockdown are emerging. One Briton in Wuhan, who did not want to be quoted, told the Guardian: We have no way to get through roadblocks to the airport. That has to be applied for through London then getting word back for the OK from local government here. British Airways has suspended bookings on its website for direct flights from London to Beijing and Shanghai until March, after warnings over travel to China due to the coronavirus outbreak. BA.com, the airline\u2019s website, shows no direct flights to China are available in January and February. A spokeswoman for the airline said on Wednesday it was \u201cassessing the situation\u201d. Britain on Tuesday advised against \u201call but essential\u201d travel to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak. The sixth coronavirus case in Australia has been confirmed by Victoria\u2019s chief officer, Dr Brett Sutton. The man in his 60s became unwell on 23 January, having recently travelled to Wuhan. He presented to a doctor and was referred to the Monash Medical Centre, where he was tested for the virus. Sutton said the man had since returned home, where he was in isolation. The man\u2019s family is being monitored. Some have exhibited symptoms, but none has returned a positive test. Australian health officials have stressed that they have not seen any evidence of human-to-human transmission of the 2019-nCoV novel coronavirus in Australia. \u201cThe man was mostly at home and had isolated himself when unwell but he had gone out to a restaurant called The House of Delight for a short period of time,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThat restaurant has been followed up with and those who were there at the same time, whose contact details we have, we are following up with. \u201cBut obviously that restaurant is OK to go to now. People don\u2019t need to avoid that area or indeed anywhere else people have been, even if infectious at the time.\u201d After a sell-off on Monday and Tuesday, markets in Asia Pacific have bounced back today. The ASX200 benchmark index in Sydney closed 0.5% higher and the Nikkei in Tokyo wound up 0.71% to the good. South Korea, which was battered on Tuesday, was also higher. \u201cStock markets across the Asian region have reclaimed a portion of yesterday\u2019s losses,\u201d Kyle Rodda, at IG Markets in Melbourne, said, \u201cas volatility subsides slightly, on the back of diminishing angst among market participants regarding the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d \u201cThe psychology is simple enough \u2026 markets react most aggressively to brand new information. Of course, this isn\u2019t to say this issue will go away any time soon. \u201cBut the initial shock of needing to price in this new coronavirus risk into markets has certainly subsided, with additional information about the matter now having a diminishing impact.\u201d The flight carrying 240 American citizens from Wuhan has just landed in Anchorage, Alaska, after a journey of nine-and-a-half hours. Those passengers will now fly on to March Air Force Base in California. Tibet, the last place on China\u2019s mainland that had not recorded a case of coronavirus, has now reported its first suspected case. A 34-year-old man who travelled to Tibet by train from Wuhan has been placed in quarantine. A sixth case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Australia. A man in his 60s tested positive Wednesday morning in Melbourne. He had recently travelled to Wuhan. Health officials are monitoring his close contacts. The man\u2019s case is the second in Melbourne, Australia\u2019s second-largest city. The others are in hospitals in Sydney. Hello, Ben Doherty taking over our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s early in the UK, but there is news for Britons stuck in Hubei and their families. The UK is finalising plans to bring back Britons from Hubei province after advising Britons there to ring dedicated 24-hour helplines before 3am UK time on Wednesday to register their desire to be evacuated. Officials estimate up to 200 citizens currently there will want to return to the UK. Flights taking Britons back home could begin as early as Thursday, according to a British teacher in Wuhan city who said UK citizens were being given details of forthcoming flights. On Tuesday evening the Foreign Office updated its advice to warn against all but essential travel to mainland China following the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIf you\u2019re in this area and able to leave, you should do so,\u201d it said. The UK\u2019s move to evacuate its citizens follows flights chartered by the Japanese government and the US. The flight to Tokyo landed Wednesday morning, with four on board taken to hospital, while the US-government flight is set to land in Alaska in about 20 minutes from now (a little before 6.30am GMT). Australia and New Zealand have announced plans for an evacuation mission, quarantining their citizens on the remote Australian territory of Christmas Island. Other countries, such as France and Indonesia, have also announced their intentions to evacuate their citizens from Hubei. Germany now has four confirmed cases of coronavirus, the second European country to report cases after France. The first case of coronavirus in the United Arab Emirates \u2013 and thus the Middle East region \u2013 has been confirmed by state media, according to Reuters. The state-run news agency WAM announced the case earlier today, citing the UAE health ministry. According to the report, the person had been in Wuhan, but did not provide any further information. Education minister Dan Tehan said some schools and states had \u201cgone further\u201d than the official government advice when deciding how to treat children who have returned from China or from overseas. He said that the official advice, as determined by experts, was still enough and what was recommended. \u201cWe think schools should follow the medical advice. Some schools have decided togo further than that. That is their individual right to be able to do that. Some states have taken a more cautious approach. But our view is we should follow the medical advice provided by our experts here in Australia and internationally. \u201cWe\u2019ve said that we will constantly monitor that advice and provide updates on it on a regular basis. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here doing this afternoon.\u201d Health minister Greg Hunt says the government does not intend to use enforcement powers to make people stay at home in quarantine. He is also asked about the choice of Christmas Island as a quarantine site. \u201cThe choice of the Christmas Island was made on the basis of the ability to establish quickly [and] to provide the capacity to deal with all those who were likely to arrive. \u201cSecondly, one of the things that is very important is that we have full and absolute protection for Christmas Islanders. I\u2019ll leave the circumstances to home affairs and to foreign affairs\u201d. As to whether the evacuated Australians from Wuhan could leave the detention centre, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to home affairs.\u201d He adds that a surgical mask \u2013 not a thicker P2 mask \u2013 is fine for the general public. Surgical masks are \u201cperfectly adequate\u201d even for medical assessment of patients, and P2 masks are only needed for those treating confirmed cases. \u201cThe prevailing advice is surgical masks are perfectly adequate for the clinical assessment of a suspected case and their examination. \u201cWhere P2 masks are important is when you\u2019re collecting the diagnostic specimen and anyone collecting the diagnostic specimen is provided with a P2 mask. The GPs are seeing a lot of people who don\u2019t have this disease and they just need some protection and a surgical mask on the patient and a surgical mask on the GP, and all of our expert advice suggests that\u2019s adequate. \u201cIt\u2019s not adequate if you\u2019re [treating a] proven case in hospital who is coughing and we know they have a virus.\u201d Murphy says that Australia\u2019s Health Protection Principal Committee (HPPC) is aware of a case, in Germany, where somebody without symptoms transmitted the disease. However, he said this was rare. \u201cHPPC still deserves most infections are transmitted by people who have symptomatic disease. That is a very important statement. \u201cThere\u2019s no other real strong evidence of transmission in symptom who is pre-symptomatic but any evidence we need to take action upon. \u201cWe believe that the nature of coronaviruses is they generally are only infectious when symptomatic. That\u2019s what we saw with SARS and MERS. All the evidence from China suggests nearly all of the cases are only infectious when they\u2019re symptomatic.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has announced that all Australians who have had contact with people with coronavirus, or visited Hubei province, should stay at home and be quarantined for 14 days. He says this policy is \u201chighly precautionary\u201d. Health minister Greg Hunt said this was an update to the official advice. \u201cContacts of any confirmed coronavirus cases now must be isolated in their home following exposure,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cReturned travellers who have been in the Hubei province of China must also be isolated in their home for 14 days after leaving Hubei province other than of course seeking medical care. \u201cGiven the substantially lower number of cases in China reported outside of Hubei province, we do not currently recommend self-isolation for travellers from other parts of China or from other countries.\u201d The Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has said he is in talks with China to evacuate Malaysians from Wuhan, Reuters reports. There are 78 Malaysians currently in Wuhan, he said. The mayor of Christmas Island \u2013 the Australian territory in the Indian Ocean where evacuated Australians will be quarantined \u2013 has said the decision will create \u201ca leper colony\u201d. Prime minister Scott Morrison announced earlier today that Australia and New Zealand were trying to organise an evacuation of citizens in Wuhan. If successful, the people will be taken to Christmas Island and potentially quarantined for 14 days. Mayor Gordon Thomson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation this would \u201ccreate a convict settlement for innocent people. Now we\u2019ll be a leper colony. These ideas were abandoned in the mid-20th century.\u201d A family of Tamil asylum seekers from the Queensland town of Biloela are also currently on the island. Priya and Nadesalingam, and their Australian-born children, Kopika and Tharunicaa have been held there since August as they challenge their deportation. Christmas Island has been the site of an Australian immigration detention centre that was closed in September 2018. In February 2019, the government announced it would be re-opened, and then closed, to the cost of $185m. Papua New Guinea has banned all travellers from entering the country from \u201cAsian ports\u201d, according to Agence France-Presse. In a note to airlines and boat operators, the ministry of immigration said \u201call citizens originating from the Asian ports will be refused entry to the country effective today\u201d. The ministry also announced that Papua New Guinea\u2019s only official land border \u2013 with Indonesian-controlled Papua province \u2013 would be shut from Thursday. No cases of coronavirus have been reported in Papua New Guinea, but the country\u2019s health service is already buckling under the weight of underfunding and rampant public health problems. Papua New Guinea is one of only a handful of countries where polio is still endemic, leaving doctors and the United Nations scrambling to revive long-lapsed vaccination programmes. Papua New Guinea residents returning from Asian countries will be held in quarantine for 14 days. \u201cThis is a preventative measure taken to ensure the spread of the coronavirus that is rapidly spreading in the world is minimised,\u201d immigration and border security minister Westly Nukundi Nukundj said. The evacuation flight from Wuhan to the United States has been rerouted to land at a US air force base, rather than an airport. The plane, carrying 240 Americans, left Wuhan this morning. It was scheduled to land at Ontario international airport in southern California, 56km (35 miles) from Los Angeles. But Curt Hagman, the chairman of the San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors, announced on Twitter it would now be diverted to March Air Force Base, roughly 35 miles east of Ontario. The flight, operated by American cargo airline Kalitta Air, left Wuhan\u2019s Tianhe airport today at 4.54 in the morning local time. It will stop at Anchorage in Alaska for refuelling, and then fly on to California. Passengers will be screened for the virus in Anchorage, and could be quarantined in California for up to two weeks by the US Centers for Disease Control. Ontario had been designed by the US government to receive Americans repatriated in case of an emergency. \u201cWe were prepared, but the state department decided to switch the flight to March Air Force Base,\u201d Hagman said. Data from publicly available flight tracking site Flightaware shows that the flight will land in Anchorage in one hour. In Beijing, Reuters reports that a pharmacist has been fined 3 million yuan (US $434,530) for artificially inflating the price of masks sixfold during the coronavirus outbreak. An administrative penalty notice has been issued to the Beijing Jimin Kangtai Pharmacy for sharply raising the price of N95 masks, the Beijing municipal market regulator said in a statement on its website. The store raised the price of a box of 3M brand masks to 850 yuan while the online price was just 143 yuan, state television said. Since Thursday, the regulator has investigated 31 price violation cases, it said. In Shanghai, the municipal market regulator has ordered the closure of a drug store that sold sub-standard masks, the city government said. The regulator has asked the store to refund buyers and dispose of unsold ones, it said on its official account on the Weibo app. Here\u2019s one of the ambulances carrying a Japanese patient to hospital. Four Japanese citizens who were evacuated from Wuhan have been taken to hospital with a cough and fever, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. Associated Press reports that the patients are a woman in her 50s and three men whose ages range from their 30s to 50s. They were taken to a Tokyo hospital on separate ambulances for treatment and further medical checks. 206 evacuees arrived on Wednesday morning in Tokyo, after they were airlifted out of Wuhan in Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier, Japanese officials said that no people on board had the virus. Passengers on the flight were wearing masks and underwent temperature checks before boarding and while on the plane. Plans were made for all of the evacuees to be treated and quarantined depending on their test results. In South Australia seven people are awaiting coronavirus tests, but the department of health says the likelihood of them having the disease is \u201clow\u201d. Three people who were previously tested came back with the all-clear. In Melbourne, our reporter Else Kennedy has just been to a media conference with Australian researchers who have recreated the novel coronavirus in a lab \u2013 the first time this has been done outside China. The team at Melbourne\u2019s Peter Doherty Institute worked through the night from the early hours of Saturday morning until Monday to grow and sequence the virus. \u201cThis is one step, a piece in the puzzle that we have contributed,\u201d said virus identification laboratory head Dr Julian Druce. The lab-grown virus was developed from the first infected patient to be identified in Australia, and will be shared with laboratories globally. \u201cHaving the real virus means we now have the ability to actually validate and verify all test methods, and compare their sensitivities and specificities,\u201d Druce said on Wednesday. The virus is expected to generate an antibody test, which allows detection of the virus in patients who haven\u2019t displayed symptoms. The institute\u2019s deputy director, Dr Mike Catton, said it would help develop a more realistic picture of how the virus was tracking. \u201cAn antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,\u201d Catton said. In finance news, the Hong Kong stock market has slumped off the back of coronavirus fears, but the rest of Asia was up. As of an hour ago (02.30am GMT), the Hang Seng was down 2.6%, but Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 was up 0.5%. Chinese markets however, are still closed. Agence France-Presse reports that Hong Kong investors returned from the Lunar New Year break to \u201ca global panic over the deadly coronavirus, though most other Asian markets were lifted by bargain-buying after recent losses\u201d. \u201cHealthy US data reinforced hopes for the global economic outlook and supported a rally across US and European markets, which provided a strong lead for Asia, while a record earnings report from Apple also helped the mood. \u201cAmong the worst-hit sectors on global trading floors are firms linked to travel and tourism, as big-spending Chinese tourists stay at home with Beijing clamping down on people\u2019s movement.\u201d In Hong Kong, the airline Cathay Pacific lost more than 3%, casino operator Galaxy Entertainment lost more than 6% and property giant New World Development lost more than 4%. Some pictures here of Chinese construction workers building an emergency hospital that is urgently being set up in Wuhan. The Huoshenshan hospital is scheduled to open on 3 February. Another, the Leishenshan hospital, is being constructed nearby to a similar schedule. The government is livestreaming the construction of the site. Journalist Rebekah Holt has said she has spoken to the Tamil family from Biloela now detained on Christmas Island. \u201cThey have not been told by staff about centre being used for quarantine purposes. My call was the first they knew of it.\u201d For some background on the case, read here: In Tokyo, passengers from the evacuation from Wuhan have spoken to media. Takeo Aoyama, who works for Nippon Steel Corp, and Takayuki Kato, who works for Intec, said they felt relieved but also exhausted, Associated Press reports. Kato said he was \u201cshocked when all transportation systems were suspended. That\u2019s when the situation drastically changed.\u201d Aoyama said many people who wished to go home to Japan were still in Wuhan, including workers at a Japanese supermarket chain staying open to supply food. The news that Christmas Island will be used to potentially quarantine Australians with the coronavirus has led to renewed calls for the government to release a family of Tamil asylum seekers from Biloela currently detained there. Priya and Nadesalingam, and their Australian-born children, Kopika and Tharunicaa had fled the Sri Lankan civil war, and lived in the Queensland town of Biloela since 2014. The government moved to deport the family in 2018, and they have been held in detention as a court assesses various legal challenges. They have been held on the remote Christmas Island \u2013 a former immigration detention centre \u2013 since August. The petition to bring them Home to Bilo has since received 260,000 signatures. Today it was updated, in light of the plan to use Christmas Island in the Wuhan evacuation. \u201cWe at the Home to Bilo campaign would like to extend our thoughts to those currently caught in the coronavirus outbreak,\u201d the petition says. \u201cWe understand that Christmas Island will be used as a quarantine area for Australians being evacuated from Wuhan and Hubei province. \u201cWe will be monitoring the situation to ensure that Priya, Nades, Kopika and Tharunicaa are not put at risk during this process. \u201cWe have repeatedly called for Priya, Nades, and their two young daughters to be returned to mainland Australia. Their ongoing detention on Christmas Island has isolated and traumatised this young family. This new development confirms that the most appropriate place for them is in their home, Biloela.\u201d Our correspondent Rebecca Ratcliffe has spoken to dual British and American citizen Nick, who is a teacher in Wuhan and who is among up to 200 people waiting to be evacuated. He called the Foreign and Commonwealth Office crisis line earlier this morning and was asked if he would be prepared to leave his wife behind, because she is Indonesian and doesn\u2019t currently have a UK visa. They have two children, aged nine and 12, also in Wuhan. \u201cHe said that she would probably not be able to get on the plane,\u201d said Nick. \u201cI feel like we are being hung out to dry\u201d. Other Britons who have Chinese partners fear their wives or husbands will also be unable to get on the plane. It is not clear how many people will be given a seat on the flight, which is also likely to be carrying consulate staff. Some British people in Wuhan have been receiving calls and told that there will be a flight tomorrow, others are still waiting for news. AFP reports that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in China reached 5,974 on Wednesday, overtaking the number of people infected in the mainland by the Sars epidemic in 2002-3. There were 5,327 confirmed cases in mainland China during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome epidemic. That outbreak killed more than 770 people globally, including 349 in mainland China. To recap, so far today: The official death toll in China has risen to 132, with 5,974 cases confirmed 240 American citizens, and 200 Japanese citizens have been airlifted out of Wuhan this morning. The Japanese plane landed in Tokyo two hours ago, with no passengers infected, according to officials. The US plane is scheduled to land in Anchorage, Alaska in 4 hours, and will then fly to Ontario, California. Australia and New Zealand will attempt to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan and the Hubei province. Australia has told citizens to reconsider travel to the entire country of China. Three more people have been infected in Malaysia, taking their total to seven. Australian scientists have become the first in the world, outside of China, to replicate the coronavirus in a lab. Malaysia has confirmed that seven people have the coronovirus, three more than yesterday, according to Reuters. The three new cases are a 4-year-old girl, a 52-year-old man and the mother of two children confirmed infected earlier, the health ministry said in a statement. All seven people are Chinese citizens. Authorities said the mother had initially tested negative and had stayed in Malaysia to take care of her children - grandsons of a 66-year-old man who tested positive in Singapore for the coronavirus last week. Separately, Malaysia\u2019s communications regulator said it has detained one person accused of spreading fake news on the coronavirus. The person was arrested over a Facebook post that contained false information on the outbreak, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said. Malaysia this week imposed a temporary ban on Chinese nationals arriving from Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. In that press conference, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison also announced that the government would distribute 1 million masks around Australia. However, the chief medical officer stressed that the masks are only necessary for people travelling through China, and for doctors and nurses. \u201cThe masks are for patients with the relevant travel history and symptoms and their doctors who are assessing them, we\u2019re not recommending the general Australian public wear masks or take protection,\u201d he said. The masks are being sent to pharmacists via the Primary Health Networks, Morrison said. But \u201cbushfire responses have depleted some of those stocks in various places\u201d. Our correspondent Michael Standaert in Sichuan, writes that there have been no real updates of an evacuation among British citizens in Wuhan. This comes amidst the US and Japanese airlifts this morning, and the announcement of an attempted Australian evacuation a few minutes ago. \u201cThe biggest problem for everyone now is how to get to the airport. They are supposed to provide their own transport and that\u2019s nearly impossible for some since there are no taxis, no ride hailing available, no buses.\u201d The prime minister is asked whether he has been briefed on the virus\u2019s potential economic impact on Australia. \u201cWe share a concern, particularly in the wake of the bushfire crisis, of the impact on our tourism industry and related things. And that is obviously of concern to us. \u201cBut to be honest, right now, my focus is on people\u2019s health and their wellbeing. And these issues will be addressed in time when a clearer picture emerges.\u201d Morrison says that parents should follow the advice of NSW Health and the chief medical officer when it comes to sending kids to school. \u201cMy kids went back to school this week as many other kids have. \u201cI understand the issues and concerns that parents would have. Being one of them myself. And that is why it is important to take the advice, and I think the chief medical officer today has set out the situation very soundly.\u201d Morrison is asked if he can estimate how many people could be evacuated. He says it is too early to know. \u201cAt this stage we are simply saying that we are putting plans in place.\u201d New Zealand \u201chas a much smaller number of people impacted than Australia\u201d, he says. He says some of the Australians in Wuhan may have lived there for some time. \u201cThere are some people who will be there for some time and effectively have been living there for some period of time. We are talking about [evacuating] people who are there not in those circumstances, those who don\u2019t have support structures in that place.\u201d Foreign minister Payne is asked how long it will take for the Chinese government to approve an evacuation. \u201cWe must be prepared to be patient as this process is undertaken. Australia is not the only country seeking diplomatic support and clearances for these activities. But we are seeking permission from the Chinese authorities as I indicated in my opening remarks.\u201d There are 600 Australians in Hubei province who have reached out either for advice or assistance, foreign minister Marise Payne says. The focus of the evacuation is on \u201cisolated and vulnerable Australian citizens\u201d, she says. That means the young and the elderly, Morrison said earlier. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, is now speaking. He stresses that \u201cthere is no evidence of human to human transmission in Australia\u201d. \u201cWe have tested a large number of Australians with a relevant travel history and relevant symptoms and a great majority of those have been negative,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of the 5 cases in Australia are in a stable condition. The World Health Organisation have estimated that only 20% of people with this condition have a severe disease. \u201cThe majority of people have a mild disease and still most of the deaths are in people who are older and the Chinese are reporting them to have comorbidity...And we want to stress that there is no evidence of human to human transmission in Australia\u201d \u201cThe risk is extremely low\u201d. The potential evacuation will be conducted in partnership with New Zealand, Morrison says. \u201cI spoke again to Prime Minister Ardern today.\u201d Qantas has offered to provide the evacuation flight. On Christmas Island, the medical checks, and potential quarantine will be conducted by Ausmat (Australian Medical Assistance Teams). The defence force will also be deployed. \u201cI also want to stress that for Christmas Island, we will be ensuring there will be support provided directly to the Christmas Island community completely separate and quarantined from the support that is being provided in the quarantine zone,\u201d Morrison says. Australia has upgraded its travel advice to reconsider all travel to China \u2013 and will be providing \u201cassisted departures\u201d to elderly and young Australians in Wuhan and Hubei province. Prime minister Scott Morrison has described the coronavirus as \u201ca serious and evolving situation\u201d in a press conference in Canberra. \u201cThe travel advice has been upgraded to reconsider all travel to China \u2013 the entire nation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have taken a decision this morning to prepare a plan for an operation to provide some assisted departures for isolated and vulnerable Australians in Wuhan and the Hubei province.\u201d The evacuated Australians will then be quarantined in Christmas Island for up to 14 days. But that is not for certain, and dependant on the medical advice. \u201cWe cannot give a guarantee that this operation is able to succeed,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I also want to stress very clearly that we may not be in a position if we\u2019re able to do this on one occasion to do it on another occasion.\u201d The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, is now providing an update on the virus, speaking in Canberra. And more detail on that flight. According to public flight tracker FlightRadar24, the plane left Wuhan at 4:47 in the morning local time, and landed at Tokyo Haneda airport at 8:41 in the morning, Tokyo time \u2013 which was roughly one hour ago. A chartered plane carrying about 200 Japanese nationals evacuated from Wuhan arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday morning, according to Japanese media reports. The passengers, who were examined by four medical professionals during the flight, will be asked to stay at home for two weeks and be on the lookout for symptoms, Kyodo news agency said. The Japanese foreign ministry, however, said none of the passengers was infected with the coronavirus, according to Kyodo. A total of about 650 Japanese have asked to be evacuated from Wuhan. A second charter flight bound for Wuhan is expected to leave Tokyo on Wednesday evening, with additional flights to follow. The first plane arrived in Wuhan on Tuesday night carrying emergency relief supplies including 15,000 masks, 50,000 pairs of gloves and 8,000 protective glasses, the foreign ministry said. The death toll in mainland China has now risen to 132 \u2013 per official health commission figures. This morning Australian scientists have become the first in the world, outside of China, to replicate the coronavirus in a lab \u2013 in what they hope could lead to a vaccine. Researchers at Melbourne\u2019s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity recreated the virus from an infected patient. It will be shared with expert laboratories working closely with the World Health Organisation in Europe, along with laboratories across Australia. It will also help assess the effectiveness of trial vaccines. Chinese officials had released the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus which first surfaced in its Hubei province in December. Australian chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the creation of the live virus was significant, particularly for providing controls for tests and speeding up an antibody test. \u201cIt\u2019s a very significant development and it\u2019s very, very positive,\u201d he told ABC Radio. Five people are being treated in Australian hospitals for the virus, with four of those cases in NSW alone. The death toll in China has now risen to 131 people, according to the updated coronavirus tracker from Tencent News. There are now also 5515 confirmed cases and 6973 suspected cases. And, as the US airlift out of Wuhan continues, Japan today has confirmed it too will evacuate 200 of its citizens. According to the Kyodo news agency, a chartered plane has departed the city early this morning, and is scheduled to arrive at Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport. In total, around 650 Japanese nationals have requested an airlift out of Wuhan. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to take every possible measure to bring home all people hoping to come back to Japan,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told lawmakers on Tuesday, according to Jiji Press. Officials are aboard the plane to monitor passengers during the return flight, but there are no plans to isolate those arriving from Wuhan. The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea was due to do the same. Several other countries were assessing their options. Canada said 126 of its citizens live in the Wuhan area and it is consulting with allies and considering its options for getting them home. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the novel coronavirus originating from Wuhan in China. This morning, the US has begun its first evacuation of citizens from Wuhan itself, in the Hubei province, where thousands of people have been affected. The US state department confirmed to the Associated Press that 240 Americans \u2013 including diplomats and other citizens \u2013 have been airlifted out of the city, and will be flown to Anchorage in Alaska, and then to Ontario in California, 56 kilometres (35 miles) from Los Angeles. Data from publicly available flight tracking site Flightaware shows that a flight operated by American cargo airline Kalitta Air left Wuhan\u2019s Tianhe airport today at 4.54 in the morning local time, and is due to touch down in Alaska in 6 hours from now. According to AP, all Americans will be screened for the virus in Anchorage, and could be quarantined in Ontario for up to two weeks by the US Centers for Disease Control. David Wert, a spokesman for the county of San Bernardino, said they were \u201cpreparing for that eventuality just in case\u201d. Wert said that Ontario International Airport was designated a decade ago by the U.S. government to receive repatriated Americans in case of an emergency overseas. Airport personnel have trained for such an occasion but the repatriation from China would be the first time the airport is used for this purpose, he said. In Ontario, the area where passengers will be taken is removed from passenger terminals and other public areas at the airport, the county said.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hancock sought to ease public concern about the spread of the disease by stating that those returning to Britain would be quarantined and receive medical attention. \u201cWe are working hard to get British nationals back from Wuhan,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1222473851545817088\">he tweeted</a>. \u201cPublic safety is the top priority.

      "bodyText": "After a small pause (the intrepid reporter had the microphone upside down, but we\u2019ll preserve his blushes) we have the final question: Q: Do you have sympathy with savers who have suffered from low interest rates? Monetary policy is a \u201cblunt but powerful tool\u201d, Powell replies, and the Fed uses it to keep inflation low and employment high. He points out that many, many people benefit from low interest rates -- and you won\u2019t hear many people on low and moderate incomes pleading for higher rates. They want the economy to keep growing. But ..... he \u201cabsolutely\u201d sympathises with those who are reliant on savings for their income. But if you also own a home or equities (like many wealthier pensioners) you have benefited from higher asset prices. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference! Here\u2019s a clip of America\u2019s top central banker talking about the coronavirus: Q: US stock market levels are very high - are you concerned? Jay Powell says the Fed looks at a range of financial conditions, including leverage in the financial and non-financial sectors, debt levels, and asset price levels. We do see asset prices as \u201csomewhat elevated\u201d he says - but not at \u201cextreme levels\u201d. But funding levels, another key issue, are very stable. Q: How might the coronavirus outbreak affect China\u2019s ability to deal with its bad debts? Jay Powell says China had a significant problem with debts. It decided to tackle those high debt levels a few years ago - which was one of the causes of the global slowdown. Powell agrees that the coronavirus will have \u201csome effect on the Chinese economy\u201d at least in the short term. There may not be an immediate bounce from the US trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Powell cautions. He sees a \u2018wait and see\u2019 attitude among American businesses, so there\u2019s no \u201cdecisive\u201d recovery in manufacturing. Q: Does climate change pose a system-wide risk to financial stability? It\u2019s certainly possible over the long-term, Powell replies, but ultimately the issue must fall to elected officials. But he agrees that the Fed must ensure the financial system is prepared to withstand climate change. So yes, it\u2019s part of its role -- but the Fed can\u2019t take on responsibility for the whole issue. Q: So why haven\u2019t you joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, with over 40 other central banks? Powell says the Fed has attended meetings, and will probably join in the future. Q: Various US companies are closing factories, bringing staff home or seeing supply chain disruption due to the coronavirus. So what impact could it have on US growth, and is it a significant risk to the global economy? Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell says the coronavirus is a very serious issue, which has already caused significant human suffering. It is likely to cause some disruption to growth in China, and globally, he predicts. But it is \u201cvery uncertain\u201d how far it will spread within China and to its neighbours, and thus what the impact will be. As such, Powell won\u2019t speculate, but he does add: Of course we are very carefully monitoring the situation. He also suggests that the global economy appeared to be picking up, due to easing trade tensions, the lower risk of a no-deal Brexit, and signs of manufacturing bottoming out. On the US economy, Powell says the labour market is still performing well.... and it\u2019s a \u201cbit surprising\u201d that wages haven\u2019t risen faster. Hmmm.... Powell is giving (well, reading out) a long answer on the Fed\u2019s repo operation (buying short-term treasury bills with new money). He\u2019s basically saying the Fed will keep running the programme until it has build up \u2018ample reserves\u2019 - of at least $1.5tn. Q: But aren\u2019t you worried that the markets think your repo operation is QE, and are trading accordingly? Powell says the goal is simply to deliver effective monetary policy. It\u2019s not the same as a broad asset-purchase programme (ie QE), and it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s moving markets. Onto questions, and Powell confirms that the Fed has tweaked its language on the inflation target. It now states clearly that it wants to see inflation at 2%, not merely near it. Jay Powell (who may have a touch of the sniffles) says US inflation should move closer to the 2% target in coming months. We are determined to avoid inflation running persistently below 2%, he insists. He then confirms that the Fed will keep running its repo operations until April, but will \u2018slow\u2019 these purchases over time. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is giving a press conference now. He confirms that the Fed has left interest rates on hold today, adding that monetary policy is well purposed to serve the US economy, create jobs and get inflation on target (it\u2019s currently 1.5%, below the 2% target). Powell blames sluggish growth abroad, and trade tensions, for weak business investment and manufacturing. But uncertainties remain, he adds, and there are risks to the outlook -- including the coronavirus outbreak. Another small change -- the Fed has decided to keep lubricating the plumbing of the US financial system for a few more months. This repo scheme, in which the Fed buys hundreds of billions of dollars of short-term bonds, was meant to expire in January - but will now run until April. The Fed insists it is simply providing liquidity, not stimulating the system.... but many investors have compared it to quantitative easing programmes launched after the crisis. And indeed, the scheme appears to have pumped up the stock markets (just like QE did). The Fed has made a small technical tweak - raising the interest rate it pays banks on their excess reserves. That\u2019s meant to keep interest rates within the Fed\u2019a 1.5%-1.75% target. There\u2019s no mention of the coronavirus in the Fed statement. That suggests the central bank isn\u2019t too worrked about the epidemic, says Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade: The FOMC decision failed to turbocharge market reaction and the fact the Fed didn\u2019t mention anything Coronavirus made it clear for investors that the Fed isn\u2019t worried. Gold traders were hoping that perhaps the Fed will mention the economic impact of this virus but the absence of these comments kept bulls out of this trade. Understandably, there\u2019s not much market reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision (which Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McKee has astutely dubbed a \u2018nothing-burger\u2019). The Dow Jones industrial average is up 166 points, or over 0.5%, at 28,889, having been 133 points higher just before the decision was announced. The Fed also sounds upbeat about the state of the US economy, saying: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.... The statement, explaining why US interest rates remain on hold, is online here. Today\u2019s decision is unanimous -- every Federal reserve policymaker decided to do nothing this month. And the FOMC\u2019s accompanying statement looks nearly identical to December\u2019s offering. As before, it says US jobs gains are solid while inflation is below target. One tweak -- the committee says household spending is rising at a \u2018moderate rate\u2019 (last month, it was \u2018strong\u2019). But it also reiterates that business fixed investment and exports remain weak. NEWSFLASH: The Fed has left US interest rates unchanged, at 1.5%-1.75%. Melissa Davies, Economist at Redburn, agrees that the Fed will be cautious today, partly due to the health crisis in China: \u201cTonight\u2019s FOMC meeting should not bring any headline changes to interest rates. Indeed, with coronavirus having taken the wind out of the sails of hopes for a sustained bounce in global commercial activity in early 2020, and some particularly poor US manufacturing surveys of late, the FOMC has plenty of reason to strike a dovish tone. It\u2019s nearly time for the first US interest rate decision of 2020 - but don\u2019t expect many fireworks. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its benchmark Fed Funds rate unchanged, at 1.5% to 1.75%. Following three cuts in the second half of 2019, the Fed is effectively on hold - waiting to see how the economic data plays out. Although trade tensions have eased, the coronavirus crisis is a new threat to global growth - so central bankers will remain cautious. Coronavirus worries have kept a lid on the London stock market today. The FTSE 100 index has closed just 2 points higher at 7,483 - still 100 points down this week after Monday\u2019s troubles. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames the risk of a Chinese slowdown: The market rebound petered out on Wednesday afternoon, investors struggling to justify the gains in the face of the latest coronavirus news. Probably the most relevant headline came from Chinese government economist Zhang Ming, who warned that the country\u2019s first quarter growth may fall under 5% as the virus spreads, with the forecast based on a mid-February peak for the outbreak. Given investors freaked out as China\u2019s GDP dropped to 6.0%, a reading more than 1% under that is a potential nightmare. Time for a quick recap, as investors await the Federal Reserve interest rate decision in four hours time. Concerns over the coronavirus continue to weigh on market today. A top Chinese economists has warned that the outbreak could cause more economic damage than Sars in 2003. Hong Kong\u2019s stock market tumbled as it reopened after the Lunar New Year. The Hang Seng fell almost 3%, with property companies and gambling firms based in Macao leading the rout. European markets, though, are calmer after two days of volatility. A swathe of companies have been cutting their activity in China, with several airlines including British Airways freezing flights. Car firms, such as Toyota, are leaving factories suspended until mid-February. Apple\u2019s share price has hit a new alltime high, after beating Wall Street forecasts again. It\u2019s now worth a sizzling $1.4tn, as much as every company on Germany\u2019s DAX 30. UK house pries have risen, as political uncertainty eases (somewhat). Rail operator Northern has been nationalised, after the government lost patience with its shoddy service. There are reports that American Airlines and Lufthansa are now cancelling their services to China, following British Airways\u2019 lead this morning. Apple\u2019s stock surge means the company is worth over $1.4tn -- more than every company on Germany\u2019s DAX index combined (as flagged earlier). Amanda Lyons, investment manager, GAM, has delved into last night\u2019s numbers -- and concluded that not everything is as rosy as you\u2019d think. She points out that strong iPhone sales drove the strong revenue growth -- probably existing iPhone users shifting to the new, more expensive, iPhone 11s. With iPhone still accounting for over 60% of total revenue it shows how much the company still relies on this product for growth and that outperformance elsewhere is not enough to fuel future growth. But service revenue growth missed expectations, at 17% per year. Although Services revenue is impressive, it is intricately liked to Product sales. In the earnings release (and again on the call), Apple highlighted that the installed base has reached 1.5bn devices. It is hard to see that this segment can grow to become the driver of the company and overtake the iPhone. And what about Apple\u2019s TV? \u201cAlmost no colour was given regarding the Apple TV+ launch; in its current form, it does not feel that TV+ will be the new Netflix. Its content offering is significantly lighter than competitors and is relying on gaining subscribers through the service being bundled for free for a year with the purchase of any Apple hardware. Without significant investments in content, it is hard to see many of those \u2018free\u2019 subscribers converting to paid subs at the end of the year. Boom! Apple\u2019s share price has hit a new record high, at the start of trading in New York. Apple has gained more than 2% to above $326 per share, which means it has more than doubled in the last year. The tech giant is cheering investors after reporting a 9% jump in revenues to $91.8bn last night, a record. This lifted net earnings to $22.2bn (also a record). Boeing has taken another big hit from the 737 Max crisis. The US aircraft maker has doubled the likely cost of fixing the problem, to over $18bn, in its new financial results today. This has dragged Boeing into its first annual loss since 1997. More here: Oil has now unrallied -- as traders take claims of an attack on Saudi facilities in their stride. Back in the markets, the oil price is rallying following reports of an attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities. Not much detail yet, but Brent crude rallied by over 1.2% to $60.25 per barrel. Back in the UK, another rail operator has been taken out of private hands into the tender care of the government. Northern Rail, which operates services (badly) in the North of England will be nationalised on the first of March. The government has run out of patience over the litany of problems - from cancelled trains and carriage shortages to faulty ticket machines and a lack of drivers. Passengers have also been unimpressed that it has still used the old Pacer trains -- constructed from busies in the 1980s, and due to be phased out years ago. It should be a popular decision: Here\u2019s the story: Newsflash: A Chinese government economist has warned that the Wuhan coronavirus may cause more economic damage than the SARS epidemic. Zhang Ming, an economist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (part of Beijing\u2019s State Council) predicted that China\u2019s annual growth rate could drop below 5% in January-March quarter. The official target is 6%; some economists have predicted that the economy could actually shrink during the quarter, as firms halt production and transport links are shuttered. Writing in Caijing magazine, Zhang said the coronavirus\u2019s economic impact could be \u201csignificantly bigger\u201d than Sars, which slowed growth back in 2003. That is based on the forecast that the outbreak, which began in Wuhan\u2019s meat market late last year, will peak in mid-February and end by April. For comparison, Pantheon Economists estimates that SARS dragged China\u2019s quarterly growth rate down to 1.8% in April-June 2003, from an average of 2.8%. Zhang also predicted that Beijing could pull on the stimulus levers to prevent the economy weakening -- perhaps by cutting interest rates or encouraging banks to lend more money (by cutting the amount of capital they have to hold). Just in: Fast food giant McDonalds has beaten Wall Street forecasts, achieving more than 100 billion dollars of annual sales for the first time. The burgers, fries, salads and fizzy pop provider has posted a 5.9% jump in sales in the last quarter, better than expected and the strongest result since 2010. For 2019 as a whole, systemwide sales increased 4% to $100.2 billion. McDonald\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski says: \u201c2019 marked a year of significant milestones for McDonald\u2019s - including surpassing $100 billion in Systemwide sales and achieving our highest global comparable sales growth in over a decade.\u201d The long grind of job cuts at banking group Lloyds continues today. Banking union Accord has announced that Lloyds is cutting almost 80 jobs, as part of a drive to close 56 branches this year. It affects 31 Lloyds, 10 Halifax and 15 Bank of Scotland branded branches, the union said, with many staff being redeployed. Ovo Energy, which recently joined the ranks of Britain\u2019s biggest energy firms, has now also joined the ranks of firms fined by the regulator. Ovo\u2019s sin was to send inaccurate bills, or no statement at all, to over 500,000 customers over several years. Readers with long memories may be surprised to hear that Greece can now borrow at an interest rate just below zero. Yes, investors are prepared to pay Athens for the privilege of buying its debt -- at least the short-term bonds, repayable in six months. Athens also saw solid demand for its first 15-year bond, which went on sale yesterday. Investors placed bids worth almost \u20ac19bn for the \u20ac2.5bn bond on offer, as Greece continues to slowly recover from its debt crisis. Financial analysts have been hiking their price targets for Apple, after it beat expectations yesterday with its strong profit and revenue growth. Fair enough. Except...shouldn\u2019t Wall Street\u2019s finest minds have expected such a good performance, given they\u2019ve been watching Apple so closely? Here\u2019s a great chart showing how Apple\u2019s share price has rocketed since Steve Jobs was lured back to run the company 23 years ago. Jobs\u2019 return in 1997 is one of the great \u2018what ifs\u2019 of business. Had he not returned to revive the company, on $1 per year, would we ever have had the iMacs, the iPod or the iPhone? Would Apple have moved into media, with iTunes, or pioneered smartphones with the App Store? Would Apple be worth more than $1 trillion today? Surely not. More likely it would have continued to slide into relative obscurity, losing money despite a loyal army of desktop fans devoted to its Mackintosh machines. Back in the UK, house prices have risen as the market shakes off some of its recent lethargy. Average house prices rose by 0.5% during January, Nationwide reports. This lifts the annual rate of housing inflation to 1.9%. This might bolster the argument that the Conservative\u2019s election win has lifted some economic uncertainty, ungumming the economy. Lucy Pendleton, of estate agents James Pendleton, says: \u201cSparks were flying after the election but this month the housing market has ignited, with the Boris Bounce providing the match. \u201cA year ago the annual growth rate was just 0.1%. This step change in house price growth is being driven by a resurgence of demand and, with it coming before we\u2019ve even left the EU, is clearly significant. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s Chief Economist, sounds more cautious, saying: \u201cJanuary saw a further modest pick-up in annual UK house price growth to 1.9%, from 1.4% in December. This follows twelve 12 successive months in which annual price growth had been below 1%. \u201cIndicators of UK economic activity were fairly volatile for much of 2019, but the underlying pace of growth slowed through the year as a result of weaker global growth and an intensification of Brexit uncertainty. More here: Over at the Hong Kong harbour, Bloomberg\u2019s Alex Longley reports that things are unusually quiet - a bad sign for the economy as it tries to clamber out of recession. More reaction to the slowdown in eurozone money supply: Apple\u2019s shares have jumped 2% in after-market trading, following its record-break profits and revenues last night. That lifts its market capitalisation to over $1.4 trillion, tightening its place as the world\u2019s most valuable tech company (only Saudi Aramco is worth more). Astonishingly, this is more than Germany\u2019s 30 largest listed companies who make up the DAX index. The DAX is worth a combined $1.36tn, including software giant SAP ($162bn), chemicals firm Linde ($111bn), engineering company Siemens ($108bn), and insurance group Allianz ($100bn). Allianz\u2019s chief economist, Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl, says it\u2019s a warning sign to Europe: In a worrying sign, money supply growth in the eurozone has slowed. The European Central Bank reports that growth in broad money slowed to 5% last month, from 5.6% in November. Growth in the narrower M1 measure (how much currency is circulating) also slowed -- indicating a cooling of economic growth. European stock markets have just opened a little higher, as investors resist hitting the panic button (yet, anyway). The Stoxx 600 index of Europe\u2019s top companies has risen by 0.5%, with gains in Spain, Italy, France and Germany. In London the FTSE 100 has risen by 6 points, or 0.1%. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale sums up the mood: The virus outbreak marches on but markets are trying hard not to over-react. Treasury yields are back up a bit, most Asian equity indices are back up a bit, though the Hang Seng is playing catch-down as it re-opens. Commodity prices are rising slightly today, as traders try to calculate the impact of the virus outbreak on the global economy. Copper, nickel and zinc all rose, recovering some of their recent losses. Yesterday, a basket of metal prices hit its lowest level since early 2017: After a rough day, the Hang Seng index closed 2.8% lower. That\u2019s a bad start to the new year, but frankly the rout could have been worse, given anxiety over the coronavirus. Here\u2019s a nice summary of the economic impact of the coronavirus, from the BBC\u2019s Victoria Fritz: Here\u2019s our main liveblog on the coronavirus outbreak - which has now claimed at least 132 lives: Japanese car maker Toyota has announced it will leave its Chinese factories closed until February 9th, extending the usual New Year shutdown. Reuters has the details: Toyota, which runs plants in regions such as the northern city of Tianjin and the southern province of Guangdong, said the closures after the Lunar New Year holidays were in line with transport lockdowns in some places, and as it assesses its parts supply situation. That\u2019s another sign of the economic damage that the virus outbreak is causing; several carmakers including Nissan, Honda and PSA Group are also withdrawing staff from China. British Airways has just suspended all its flights to mainland China, underlining how the virus crisis will hit businesses around the globe. It says: \u201cWe apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority. Customers due to travel to or from China in the coming days can find more information on BA.com.\u201d While Hong Kong stocks slumped, other Asian markets had a better day. Australia, South Korea and Japan all gained around 0.5%, as traders grasped onto hopes that the outbreak will be contained. Shares in medical mask-makers continue to surge, as the public try to protect themselves from the Wuhan coronavirus. The biggest fallers on the Hang Seng today were two Hong Kong real estate firms, Hang Lung Properties (-6.3%) and Country Garden Holdings (-5.7%).Demand for their properties will surely be knocked by the coronavirus outbreak. They were followed by two Macao casino operators Sands China (-5.3%) and Galaxy Entertainment Group (-5.2%). Their betting operations will suffer from the clampdown on travel between the City and mainland China (Macau is an autonomous region, across the Pearl River Delta from Hong Kong). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Returning to the office after a holiday is rarely fun. But Hong Kong investors have suffered a hefty dose of back-to-work blues today as trading resumed after the Lunar New Year break. Stocks tumbled across the Hang Seng index, as traders responded to the coronavirus outbreak. Every stock lost ground in a wave of selling, driving the index down to a seven-week low. Consumer goods companies, energy firms and financial stocks led the sell-off, on concerns that the virus crisis will hurt Hong Kong\u2019s economy -- which is already in recession after months of pro-democracy protests. In late trading, the Hang Seng is down 807 points, or 2.9%, at 27,141 -- wiping out all the gains posted since mid-December. It\u2019s the worst start to a New Year since 2016 (the Year of the Pig); Jeffrey Chan Lap-tak of Oriental Patron Financial Group explains why the Year of the Rat has begun badly: \u201cThe Wuhan coronavirus has been spreading around the world. It will affect market sentiment in the near term, as the disease will hit the tourism and retail industries of Hong Kong,\u201d \u201cThese sectors have already been hit hard by the eight-month-long anti-government protests.\u201d But while Hong Kong played catch-up, other markets are looking a little calmer today amid hopes that the coronavirus outbreak could peak soon. Traders are also encouraged by strong results from Apple after Wall Street closed last night. The tech giant posted record revenues and profits for the last quarter, justifying the doubling of its share price over the last year. My colleague Julia Carrie Wong reports: Sales of the iPhone 11 propelled Apple to all-time record revenues and profits for the final three months of 2019, a strong performance that comes amid concerns over the impact of the coronavirus on the Chinese economy. Apple\u2019s $91.8bn in quarterly revenue topped analyst expectations thanks to $56bn in iPhone sales. The strong performance marks a rebound for the company, which suffered a rare setback in holiday sales one year ago. CEO Tim Cook reported strong demand for iPhones, and for the company\u2019s newer wearable technology. He also said Apple was \u201cclosely following the development of the coronavirus\u201d, amid worries that its supply chain could be disrupted. Also coming up today The US central bank meets to set interest rates today. The Fed probably won\u2019t cut borrowing costs, despite ongoing pressure from Donald Trump, but it could pave the way to ease later this year. Fed chair Jay Powell may also talk about the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy, which comes just as trade war tensions are easing. It\u2019s also a big day for US corporate news, with McDonalds, Boeing, Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla all reporting results. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US trade balance for December 7pm GMT: US Federal Reserve interest rate decision 7.30pm GMT: Fed chair Jerome Powell holds press conference",
