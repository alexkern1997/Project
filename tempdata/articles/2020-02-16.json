It comes as China\u2019s National Health Commission announced the death toll inside the country had risen to 1,665, with 68,500 infections. The US embassy in Japan announced on Saturday that more than 400 US nationals would be flown home from the quarantined Diamond Princess, currently docked in the port of Yokohama, south of Tokyo. The US embassy said in a letter to passengers that, based on the high number of confirmed coronavirus cases, passengers and crew members were considered to be \u201cat high risk of exposure\u201d. US charter flights are expected to arrive on Sunday. Hong Kong, which has 330 citizens on board, said it will offer nationals an evacuation flight. The Canadian government also confirmed late on Saturday that it had chartered a plane to bring it citizens who are passengers on the ship home. Canadian passengers who exhibit symptoms of the coronavirus infection will not be permitted to board the flight and will instead be transferred to the Japanese health care system to receive appropriate care, the government said. After arriving in Canada, the passengers will undergo a 14-day period of quarantine, the statement added. The Diamond Princess has been stuck in Japan after a passenger who had disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus. The Australian embassy in Tokyo emailed citizens aboard the cruise ship to say the federal government was also examining options to assist Australians. The embassy told citizens it understood it was a \u201cvery stressful\u201d situation for them and that Australian medical officers were working closely with Japanese authorities to support them. The British government has faced mounting pressure to evacuate its citizens, with one passenger, David Abel, who had been livestreaming from the ship, saying on Saturday that he had \u201cgiven up on anybody in the UK\u201d. Seventy new cases were confirmed on the cruise liner on Sunday according to Japan\u2019s minister of health, labor and welfare, Katsunobu Kato, taking the number of cases on the ship over 350. \u201cSo far, we have conducted tests for 1,219 individuals. Of those, 355 people tested positive. Of those, 73 individuals are not showing symptoms,\u201d Kato said. Passengers have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February, after measures were introduced to try to stop the spread of the disease onboard. The quarantine is due to end on Wednesday, though it is not clear if the emergence of new cases will prompt such restrictions to be extended. There is also growing concern over possible infections among people who disembarked from the MS Westerdam in Cambodia on Friday, after it was confirmed that one passenger, who later flew to Malaysia, tested positive for the virus. The 83-year-old woman flew from Cambodia to Malaysia with 144 others from the ship on Friday. The woman\u2019s husband tested negative for the disease, Malaysia\u2019s health ministry said. The ship\u2019s owner, Holland America, said: \u201cWhile the first results have been reported, they are preliminary at this point and we are awaiting secondary testing for confirmation.\u201d Cambodian authorities called on Malaysia to review its test results. The ship had been turned away by five countries, despite having no reported sickness on board at the time. Around 68,500 people in mainland China are now confirmed to have been infected with the coronavirus, and 1,665 people have died from Covid-19, China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Sunday. The figures included a further 142, in the 24-hours to midnight on Saturday, and a further 2,000 new confirmed cases. The daily total of new cases represented a drop for the third day in a row, but researchers have advised caution. The dip in reported numbers follows a spike last week when Hubei province changed the way it was counting cases of the virus. Facing criticism over Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, president Xi Jinping said in a speech reported by state media on Saturday evening that he had given instructions on fighting the disease as early as 7 January. The admission has fuelled questions over why the potential dangers of the virus were not conveyed fully to the public at an earlier date. Most reports of the disease remain concentrated in Hubei, where the outbreak began, but cases have been confirmed across Asia, Australia, the US, Europe and, mostly recently, Africa. Four deaths have occurred outside mainland China \u2013 in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and France. France\u2019s health minister, Anges Buzyn, said: \u201cWe have to get our health system ready to face a possible pandemic propagation of the virus, and therefore the spreading of the virus across France.\u201d Her comments followed the death of a 80-year-old Chinese man at a Paris hospital. Robin Thompson, an expert in mathematical epidemiology at Britain\u2019s University of Oxford, said that with nearly 50 cases in Europe, a death was not surprising. \u201cThe most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn\u2019t been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The first cohort of Australian evacuees are set to leave quarantine on Christmas Island on Monday, with no reported cases of the new coronavirus among the 277 Australian citizens and permanent residents held on the island. A government-chartered evacuation flight brought 241 Australians from Wuhan on 3 February, with another 36 arriving two days later, via a New Zealand government charter through Auckland, that left China on 5 February. All of those evacuated from Wuhan, where the Covid-19 disease first emerged, have been required to stay in quarantine, in the almost empty Christmas Island detention centre, for 14 days from the date of leaving mainland China. Inside the centre, evacuees have been kept isolated in small family or social groups, to limit the spread of any potential outbreak. Three possible cases of coronavirus have been tested among the cohort inside the detention centre. All have come back negative for the disease. Possible cases were isolated from all other evacuees inside the centre while tests were undertaken, but have since rejoined other evacuees. On Monday, three chartered flights were set to leave the remote island, returning all those from the first group home. Contrary to the federal government\u2019s earlier statements, Australians will not have to make their own way home from Perth \u2013 but will be flown to Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and other capital cities. Earlier this month, the government also backtracked on plans that evacuees would have to pay $1,000. The first flight from Christmas Island is scheduled to leave at 8am local time, with others following in two-hour increments, but all are subject to weather and delays. The first flight will take passengers to Port Hedland, then to Sydney and Canberra, arriving in Sydney and Canberra in the evening. The second flight will go to Adelaide and Melbourne, touching down in Victoria just before midnight, local time. The third will fly to Perth and then Brisbane. Australians who arrived in the second cohort to Christmas Island are also on track to leave on Wednesday morning. Prof Yan Zhang, an academic at Western Sydney University who was on the first evacuation flight from Wuhan, said he was \u201cvery excited\u201d to return home and see his wife and daughters. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to all staff from Ausmat [Australian Medical Assistance Teams], the Australian army and other departments for their kindness, caring and unconditional support during our 14-day quarantine period. \u201cI thank my wife and daughters \u2013 they talked to me every day to make sure I was OK here. I also thank my university colleagues and friends for their caring and support.\u201d Australian company AusDiagnostics, which is providing the testing equipment and kits for the medical teams inside the Christmas Island detention centre, said that the testing process has been \u201crelatively straightforward\u201d. After a phone call on the Friday before evacuees arrived, AusDiagnostics rapidly had equipment and testing kits shipped to Darwin, where it was flown to the island on a Hercules C-130 military aircraft. \u201cAs well, one of our staff members volunteered to travel with the equipment, and to go into quarantine, to help train the medical staff and assist with testing,\u201d managing director Prof Keith Stanley said. \u201cThat was a great act of service to the community.\u201d AusDiagnostics, based in Sydney but with offices around the world, developed a test for Covid-19 as soon as the virus was sequenced. The advantage of having testing equipment and kits on the island means that the results of a test for a suspected case can be returned within \u201cthree or four hours\u201d, Stanley told Guardian Australia, rather than samples having to be sent to a mainland hospital, where the turnaround might be two days. Faster results mean that isolation of suspected cases \u2013 within the quarantine facility \u2013 can be managed much more effectively. He said the test for the Covid-19 is \u201crelatively straightforward\u201d and \u201cmuch the same as a doctor would do for influenza in the winter\u201d. A swab is taken from a patient\u2019s nose or throat and then the nucleic acid from that sample is tested for the coronavirus, as well as other illnesses. \u201cOur process looks for specific sequences which are characteristic of a particular virus. We developed a test for this specific coronavirus, but our process also tests for the standard winter coronavirus, Mers, the Middle East coronavirus, and Sars.\u201d Stanley said the two key assessments of any new viral outbreak were infectivity and mortality. Covid-19 appeared to be \u201cquite infectious\u201d, Stanley said, meaning early triaging and quarantining of suspected patients was vital, but that the mortality rate was still not clear, though it has been posited at being about 2%, \u201cnothing like as bad as Sars and Mers\u201d. \u201cYes we need to have precautions such as quarantining, but most people who have this infection would only experience symptoms something like a common cold.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Chinese professor Xu Zhangrun, who published a rare public critique of President Xi Jinping over China\u2019s coronavirus crisis, was placed under house arrest for days, barred from social media and is now cut off from the internet, his friends have told the Guardian.</p> <p>Xu\u2019s passionate attack on the government\u2019s system of controls and censorship,<a href=\"http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/viral-alarm-when-fury-overcomes-fear\" title=\"\"> </a><a href=\"http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/viral-alarm-when-fury-overcomes-fear\" title=\"\">Viral Alarm: When Fury Overcomes Fear</a>, was published this month \u2013 a rare, bold expression of dissent from the liberal camp under Xi\u2019s rule.</p> <p>A friend of Xu\u2019s who spoke on Sunday on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals said police placed Xu under house arrest soon after he returned to Beijing from his lunar new year break at his home town in Anhui province.</p> <p>\u201cThey confined him at home under the pretext that he had to be quarantined after the trip,\u201d the friend said. \u201cHe was in fact under de facto house arrest and his movements were restricted.\u201d</p> <p>During those days, at least two people stood guard in front of his house around the clock and a car with a signal box was parked in front of his residence. Security agents also went into his house to issue warnings to him, the friend said.</p> <p>Those restrictions were lifted late last week, but his internet connection has been cut off since Friday, the friend added.</p> <p>\u201cHe tried to get it mended but found out that his IP [internet protocol address] has been blocked. He lives on the outskirts of Beijing and is far away from shops and other services. Under the current [coronavirus] situation, things are very difficult for him.\u201d </p> <p>Friends say that since publication, Xu\u2019s account has been suspended on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, and many have been unable to get in touch with him for days. His name has been scrubbed from Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog, with only articles from official websites several years ago showing up on the country\u2019s biggest search engine, Baidu. Calls to his mobile phone went unanswered on Sunday.</p> <p>Phone calls to the Ministry of Public Security also went unanswered on Sunday. The staff member who answered the phone at Changping branch of Beijing Public Security Bureau said she had no knowledge of Xu.</p> <p>Another friend who also spoke on the condition of anonymity had managed to correspond with him through text messages but said his situation was worrying. \u201cI fear he might be under surveillance,\u201d said this friend. \u201cHe has not directly responded (to my queries) but just told me not to worry.\u201d</p> <p>When Xu published his essay, he warned that he was likely to be punished. He said he had already been suspended from teaching and had \u201cfreedoms curtailed\u201d over critiques <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/world/asia/chinese-law-professor-xi.html\" title=\"\">published nearly a year earlier.</a></p> <p>\u201cI can now all too easily predict that I will be subjected to new punishments; indeed, this may well even be the last piece I write,\u201d he wrote at the end of his latest essay.</p> <p>Xu\u2019s criticism of the country\u2019s leadership came shortly before a widespread debate on freedom of speech convulsed the country. The death on 7 February of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/li-wenliang-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-profile\" title=\"\">whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang</a>, who had tried to warn colleagues about the virus but was reprimanded and silenced by security forces, triggered an outpouring of grief and anger and an unusual public discussion about censorship.</p> <p>\u201cLi\u2019s death has thoroughly exposed the ills of the party\u2019s governance and control; this has a huge impact on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Hong Zhenkuai, an independent historian who is currently working outside China, as a visiting scholar at Tokyo University.</p> <p>The mechanisms that normally constrain Chinese journalists have also eased slightly, with some of the most powerful stories about life in quarantined Wuhan and the latest news about the evolution of the outbreak coming from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/opinion/coronavirus-china-news-journalism.html\" title=\"\">mainland newsrooms</a> like that of magazine<a href=\"https://www.caixinglobal.com/\" title=\"\"> Caixin</a>.</p> <p>But public anger over censorship, and the particular circumstances of a national emergency, should not be mistaken for any fundamental change within the Chinese Communist party, which has been honing its ability to control the national conversation for decades, activists and intellectuals say.</p> <p>In a further reminder of the government\u2019s strict controls, two citizen journalists who were reporting from the epicentre of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak have vanished this week, <a href=\"https://qz.com/1801361/wuhan-virus-citizen-journalists-fang-bin-chen-qiushi-go-missing/\" title=\"\">apparently detained.</a></p> <p>The Chinese military surgeon who exposed the government\u2019s cover-up of the Sars outbreak in 2002-2003 has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/sars-whistleblower-doctor-under-house-arrest-in-china-family-confirms-jiang-yangyong\" title=\"\">under de facto house arrest</a> since last year, the Guardian revealed this month. Detention came after he wrote to the top leadership asking for a reassessment of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no space for speech freedom in China now,\u201d said Hong. \u201cThe impacts on the individuals are multi-faceted. Economically, they would cut off your livelihood [academics get fired, writers can\u2019t publish and no one dares hire you]. You would get sidelined by mainstream society, you\u2019d lose friends and, worse than that, you might lose your personal freedoms, so a number of intellectual elites have chosen to leave China.\u201d</p> <p>Since he took power in late 2012, Xi has tightened ideological control and suppressed civil freedoms across the nation, reversing a trend under his predecessor to give Chinese media some limited scope to expose and report regional corruption and lower-level officials\u2019 misdeeds.</p> <p>Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership.</p> <p>Under Xi\u2019s crackdown on speech and academic freedoms, a number of prominent liberal intellectuals, journalists, rights lawyers and NGO workers have either been silenced, jailed or escaped abroad.</p>",

A friend of Xu\u2019s who spoke on Sunday on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals said police placed Xu under house arrest soon after he returned to Beijing from his lunar new year break at his home town in Anhui province. \u201cThey confined him at home under the pretext that he had to be quarantined after the trip,\u201d the friend said. \u201cHe was in fact under de facto house arrest and his movements were restricted.\u201d During those days, at least two people stood guard in front of his house around the clock and a car with a signal box was parked in front of his residence. Security agents also went into his house to issue warnings to him, the friend said. Those restrictions were lifted late last week, but his internet connection has been cut off since Friday, the friend added. \u201cHe tried to get it mended but found out that his IP [internet protocol address] has been blocked. He lives on the outskirts of Beijing and is far away from shops and other services. Under the current [coronavirus] situation, things are very difficult for him.\u201d Friends say that since publication, Xu\u2019s account has been suspended on WeChat, a Chinese messaging app, and many have been unable to get in touch with him for days. His name has been scrubbed from Weibo, a Twitter-like microblog, with only articles from official websites several years ago showing up on the country\u2019s biggest search engine, Baidu. Calls to his mobile phone went unanswered on Sunday. Phone calls to the Ministry of Public Security also went unanswered on Sunday. The staff member who answered the phone at Changping branch of Beijing Public Security Bureau said she had no knowledge of Xu. Another friend who also spoke on the condition of anonymity had managed to correspond with him through text messages but said his situation was worrying. \u201cI fear he might be under surveillance,\u201d said this friend. \u201cHe has not directly responded (to my queries) but just told me not to worry.\u201d When Xu published his essay, he warned that he was likely to be punished. He said he had already been suspended from teaching and had \u201cfreedoms curtailed\u201d over critiques published nearly a year earlier. \u201cI can now all too easily predict that I will be subjected to new punishments; indeed, this may well even be the last piece I write,\u201d he wrote at the end of his latest essay. Xu\u2019s criticism of the country\u2019s leadership came shortly before a widespread debate on freedom of speech convulsed the country. The death on 7 February of whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who had tried to warn colleagues about the virus but was reprimanded and silenced by security forces, triggered an outpouring of grief and anger and an unusual public discussion about censorship. \u201cLi\u2019s death has thoroughly exposed the ills of the party\u2019s governance and control; this has a huge impact on people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Hong Zhenkuai, an independent historian who is currently working outside China, as a visiting scholar at Tokyo University. The mechanisms that normally constrain Chinese journalists have also eased slightly, with some of the most powerful stories about life in quarantined Wuhan and the latest news about the evolution of the outbreak coming from mainland newsrooms like that of magazine Caixin. But public anger over censorship, and the particular circumstances of a national emergency, should not be mistaken for any fundamental change within the Chinese Communist party, which has been honing its ability to control the national conversation for decades, activists and intellectuals say. In a further reminder of the government\u2019s strict controls, two citizen journalists who were reporting from the epicentre of China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak have vanished this week, apparently detained. The Chinese military surgeon who exposed the government\u2019s cover-up of the Sars outbreak in 2002-2003 has been under de facto house arrest since last year, the Guardian revealed this month. Detention came after he wrote to the top leadership asking for a reassessment of the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement. \u201cThere is no space for speech freedom in China now,\u201d said Hong. \u201cThe impacts on the individuals are multi-faceted. Economically, they would cut off your livelihood [academics get fired, writers can\u2019t publish and no one dares hire you]. You would get sidelined by mainstream society, you\u2019d lose friends and, worse than that, you might lose your personal freedoms, so a number of intellectual elites have chosen to leave China.\u201d Since he took power in late 2012, Xi has tightened ideological control and suppressed civil freedoms across the nation, reversing a trend under his predecessor to give Chinese media some limited scope to expose and report regional corruption and lower-level officials\u2019 misdeeds. Even within the Communist party, cadres are threatened with disciplinary action for expressing opinions that differ from the leadership. Under Xi\u2019s crackdown on speech and academic freedoms, a number of prominent liberal intellectuals, journalists, rights lawyers and NGO workers have either been silenced, jailed or escaped abroad.",

      "body": "<p>Afew years ago, the World Health Organisation published <a href=\"https://www.who.int/activities/prioritizing-diseases-for-research-and-development-in-emergency-contexts\">a list of pathogens</a> which it said needed urgent scientific attention. All were viruses, none had known treatments or vaccines, and all had the potential to trigger pandemics that could kill thousands \u2013 just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/10/diseases-epidemic-research-outbreaks-ebola\" title=\"\">Ebola</a> and swine flu did earlier this century.</p> <p>The viral dangers outlined in WHO\u2019s list included <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/18/nipah-fearsome-virus-that-caught-the-medical-and-scientific-world-off-guard\" title=\"\">Nipah disease</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/lassa-fever-has-killed-more-than-100-in-nigeria-latest-figures-show\" title=\"\">Lassa</a> and Rift Valley fevers. Crucially, after much discussion, WHO experts later decided to add a new condition to this menu of maladies: Disease X.</p> <p>Disease X referred to \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d, said WHO. Humanity should now be working to seek out and tackle such mystery ailments, it added \u2013 though it was assumed they would remain remote threats for some time.</p> <p>This hope now looks forlorn with the sudden emergence of the respiratory disease <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-covid-19-wuhan-china\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a>, which has rapidly acquired most of the characteristic of a Disease X.

      "bodyText": "Afew years ago, the World Health Organisation published a list of pathogens which it said needed urgent scientific attention. All were viruses, none had known treatments or vaccines, and all had the potential to trigger pandemics that could kill thousands \u2013 just as Ebola and swine flu did earlier this century. The viral dangers outlined in WHO\u2019s list included Nipah disease, as well as Lassa and Rift Valley fevers. Crucially, after much discussion, WHO experts later decided to add a new condition to this menu of maladies: Disease X. Disease X referred to \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d, said WHO. Humanity should now be working to seek out and tackle such mystery ailments, it added \u2013 though it was assumed they would remain remote threats for some time. This hope now looks forlorn with the sudden emergence of the respiratory disease Covid-19, which has rapidly acquired most of the characteristic of a Disease X. It is caused by a virus for which there is no vaccine or treatment and has already spread to 25 countries since first appearing in China two months ago. Very soon it may be officially labelled a pandemic, an epidemic gone global. The question is: was enough done to prepare the world for the emergence of Disease X, given that such a prospect had already been earmarked as a realistic risk? And what lessons do we now need to learn in a world that will certainly see further appearances of others? These points have been stressed by Bill Gates, the billionaire philanthropist. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d he warned some time ago. A sufficiently deadly one will have the impact of a nuclear war, added Gates, who has urged authorities to stockpile antiviral drugs and therapies in preparation. Such approaches are backed by other experts who argue that, while the US, UK and EU may have strong, well-funded health services, poorer nations in Africa and Asia \u2013 where new disease outbreaks are most likely to occur \u2013 have health services that are often poorly funded and close to breaking point. \u201cThis is not going to be the last outbreak of a previously unknown disease,\u201d said Professor Trudie Lang, of Oxford University. \u201cWe have to strengthen the research capabilities of nations where new diseases emerge but which currently have the poorest ability to respond to the emergence caused by these viruses.\u201d Many WHO initiatives are aimed at providing improved health networks in these countries, said Lang, but more still needs to be done. \u201cWe have to seize the moment.\u201d This point was backed by Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. \u201cWorld health authorities have spent a lot of time and money making plans for dealing with the next major outbreak, which was assumed would be an influenza pandemic.

      "body": "<p>Oh good, there goes another lifelong ambition. To spend my old age upon a cruise ship. Unlike the others (living in a hotel by the age of 30, declining a British honour, taking full control of my personal grooming), this is an ambition I\u2019ve chosen to back out of with dignity, rather than having it cruelly removed by age and cash.</p> <p>Here is what I used to imagine cruises were like \u2013 and please picture the following as if they are medium-format prints hand-tinted by a nostalgic raver. A series of ballrooms, connected by mirrored corridors. Buffets as long as the M1, with a separate room for puddings. Swimming pools heated to a rich chlorinated blood, monogrammed towelling robes, and the very gentlest scent of Poirot. Cabins that feel like luxury live-work spaces, where the gentle rock of the ocean soothes passengers to sleep in a hushing lullaby. Very good karaoke. Everything dense and velvet, and radiating contradictory glamour \u2013 old Hollywood cut through with the louche punkiness of a Divine gif. Then, at every stop, a new type of holiday: safari on Monday, ruins on Tuesday, the beach on Friday. The idea that one could simply lie there in a turban and let experiences come to you, thrills me.</p> <p>But then, of course, I learned the truth. As I type, the 2,666 passengers onboard the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-60-more-cases-on-cruise-ship-as-depression-sets-in\" title=\"\">Diamond Princess </a>cruise ship off the coast of Yokohama are still confined to their cabins, as 130 have tested positive for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a>. Those in windowless cabins are being allowed out in shifts to take air once a day, the rest of the time presumably lying quite still on their bunks and wondering if this is death, or this. Another cruise ship \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/05/cruise-ships-quarantined-over-coronavirus-in-pictures\" title=\"\">World Dream</a> \u2013 has been quarantined in Hong Kong after three former passengers caught the virus. A third, the Royal Caribbean\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-royal-caribbean-cruise-bans-chinese-nationals\" title=\"\">Anthem of the Seas</a>, has docked in New Jersey while people are tested, and a British-American owned liner, the Westerdam, has been turned away by Japan, just in case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These liners seem to take on the illness of their passengers, lurching tearfully across the sea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Cruise ships are notoriously effective disease incubators, with vast floating norovirus outbreaks common. Vomit sloshes across the polished decks, passengers groan their bodies from lounge to toilet, stopping only to finger a Danish. Like mythological ghost ships, adrift and occasionally alight, these cruise liners seem to take on the illness of their passengers, lurching tearfully across the sea, sickness rippling behind them.</p> <p>And bad things happen on boats.

      "bodyText": "Oh good, there goes another lifelong ambition. To spend my old age upon a cruise ship. Unlike the others (living in a hotel by the age of 30, declining a British honour, taking full control of my personal grooming), this is an ambition I\u2019ve chosen to back out of with dignity, rather than having it cruelly removed by age and cash. Here is what I used to imagine cruises were like \u2013 and please picture the following as if they are medium-format prints hand-tinted by a nostalgic raver. A series of ballrooms, connected by mirrored corridors. Buffets as long as the M1, with a separate room for puddings. Swimming pools heated to a rich chlorinated blood, monogrammed towelling robes, and the very gentlest scent of Poirot. Cabins that feel like luxury live-work spaces, where the gentle rock of the ocean soothes passengers to sleep in a hushing lullaby. Very good karaoke. Everything dense and velvet, and radiating contradictory glamour \u2013 old Hollywood cut through with the louche punkiness of a Divine gif. Then, at every stop, a new type of holiday: safari on Monday, ruins on Tuesday, the beach on Friday. The idea that one could simply lie there in a turban and let experiences come to you, thrills me. But then, of course, I learned the truth. As I type, the 2,666 passengers onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Yokohama are still confined to their cabins, as 130 have tested positive for coronavirus. Those in windowless cabins are being allowed out in shifts to take air once a day, the rest of the time presumably lying quite still on their bunks and wondering if this is death, or this. Another cruise ship \u2013 the World Dream \u2013 has been quarantined in Hong Kong after three former passengers caught the virus. A third, the Royal Caribbean\u2019s Anthem of the Seas, has docked in New Jersey while people are tested, and a British-American owned liner, the Westerdam, has been turned away by Japan, just in case. Cruise ships are notoriously effective disease incubators, with vast floating norovirus outbreaks common. Vomit sloshes across the polished decks, passengers groan their bodies from lounge to toilet, stopping only to finger a Danish. Like mythological ghost ships, adrift and occasionally alight, these cruise liners seem to take on the illness of their passengers, lurching tearfully across the sea, sickness rippling behind them. And bad things happen on boats. In HBO\u2019s Succession, the Waystar Royco empire\u2019s cruise ship division spent years covering up onboard deaths and sexual assaults. While the Roy family dance around their canap\u00e9s to try and make the scandal disappear, the scale of the ships, the distance from shore, the abstracted nature of such crimes is part of what allows them to elegantly ignore the lives destroyed. It\u2019s no coincidence that their fictional awfulness happened at sea \u2013 there\u2019s been a host of mysterious deaths and disappearances on cruise ships. A website called cruisejunkie.com charts passengers and crew overboard \u2013 the current figure since 1995 is 361. In a piece investigating the 2011 disappearance of crew member Rebecca Coriam, the journalist and documentary filmmaker Jon Ronson talked to the founder of the lobby group International Cruise Victims about his theories of \u201cmurder, negligence and cover-ups\u201d and his claims that the sexual crime rate is 50% higher than in the average American city. \u201cYou\u2019re on a ship,\u201d Kendall Carver told Ronson. \u201cThere\u2019s no police.

I\u2019d like to pretend that I\u2019ve been brave, but it wouldn\u2019t be true. I found the outbreak four streets away of a virus that had at that point killed hundreds of people in China alarming. The anxiety I felt came in waves, sending my maternal protectiveness into overdrive.</p> <p>My response to Covid-19 was an almost overwhelming desire to scoop up my two-year-old daughter Astrid and nine-month-old son Xavier and keep them safe. My fears were exacerbated because my son has a heart condition which makes him vulnerable. And I\u2019m a solo mum, so there\u2019s no spare adult on hand in an emergency. Our family moved to Hove a year ago, lured by the sea and the wonderful community where children are in and out of each other\u2019s houses all the time. I wanted Astrid and Xavi to feel safe playing out as they grew up. I didn\u2019t expect to face this. But it\u2019s the strength of our community that has saved me in my worst moments of panic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pragmatism took over: we were running short on nappies and bread</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m lucky that I bumped into Emma, a nurse living on my street, who reminded me, kindly, that I was calm about common flu, despite it being more prevalent. That another neighbour, Lisa, reassured me she was sure it was under control. That my phone buzzed with people checking in, and my mum offering help. That my brother and sister-in-law repeatedly explained that I was miscalculating risk. That my friend Lucinda sent sweets in case we were told to self-isolate. That my MP Peter Kyle has been brilliant, measured and present, chatting to residents rather than letting fears grow in the silence: acknowledging constituents\u2019 worries and calming panic.</p> <p>At the nursery where my children go twice a week and take trips to the beach, park and forest, staff created \u201ccorona policy\u201d. They took time to reassure me how swiftly they\u2019d tell parents if someone was asked to self-isolate, and contacted Public Health England to ask about extra measures to protect Xavi.</p> <p>Concerned parents of older children have been keeping them at home, with a total of nine schools across the region authorising absences because of having a pupil or teacher in isolation. A neighbour told me that at one local school, which has been surrounded by media since Tuesday, nine out of 30 children were in reception class on Thursday, while classes for older children were about half full.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/what-is-coronavirus-symptoms-covid-19-wuhan-china\">What is coronavirus and what should I do if I have symptoms?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The parents I spoke to felt the schools were doing a good job of educating pupils about the virus, teaching children to cough and sneeze into their arms rather than hands and high-five with elbows to avoid spreading germs. One asked children to bring in hand sanitiser and tissues, while another\u2019s assembly included the CBeebies doctors\u2019 explanation of why coronavirus may not be as scary as it sounds. Depressingly, yet another school had to write to parents and pupils warning that racism towards the Chinese community in its classrooms would not be tolerated.</p> <p>As last week wore on, my panic eased. I don\u2019t know whether it was the lull in new confirmed cases locally, or my body being too tired to sustain the heightened anxiety. Pragmatism took over: we were short on nappies and bread. I was relaxed enough to take my children to the park and shops, but I delayed a non-urgent hospital appointment for my son, to be extra safe.</p> <p>My neighbour told me her daughter and a group of pals had organised a collection for their classmate, the daughter of recovered coronavirus victim Steve Walsh. The whole family have tested negative, but last week she was still in isolation. They\u2019ve bought her a Brighton and Hove Albion T-shirt with her name embroidered on it, ready for when she returns to school.</p> <p>So now I\u2019m following the example of a group of primary-school children whose empathy and bravery I admire, and trying to be less scared. Because worry isn\u2019t helping to keep any of us safe. </p>",

They took time to reassure me how swiftly they\u2019d tell parents if someone was asked to self-isolate, and contacted Public Health England to ask about extra measures to protect Xavi. Concerned parents of older children have been keeping them at home, with a total of nine schools across the region authorising absences because of having a pupil or teacher in isolation. A neighbour told me that at one local school, which has been surrounded by media since Tuesday, nine out of 30 children were in reception class on Thursday, while classes for older children were about half full. The parents I spoke to felt the schools were doing a good job of educating pupils about the virus, teaching children to cough and sneeze into their arms rather than hands and high-five with elbows to avoid spreading germs. One asked children to bring in hand sanitiser and tissues, while another\u2019s assembly included the CBeebies doctors\u2019 explanation of why coronavirus may not be as scary as it sounds. Depressingly, yet another school had to write to parents and pupils warning that racism towards the Chinese community in its classrooms would not be tolerated. As last week wore on, my panic eased. I don\u2019t know whether it was the lull in new confirmed cases locally, or my body being too tired to sustain the heightened anxiety. Pragmatism took over: we were short on nappies and bread. I was relaxed enough to take my children to the park and shops, but I delayed a non-urgent hospital appointment for my son, to be extra safe. My neighbour told me her daughter and a group of pals had organised a collection for their classmate, the daughter of recovered coronavirus victim Steve Walsh. The whole family have tested negative, but last week she was still in isolation. They\u2019ve bought her a Brighton and Hove Albion T-shirt with her name embroidered on it, ready for when she returns to school. So now I\u2019m following the example of a group of primary-school children whose empathy and bravery I admire, and trying to be less scared. Because worry isn\u2019t helping to keep any of us safe.",

      "body": "<p>Why must things change, I wonder? Why can\u2019t they just be the same for ever? It is a common grievance, and one of the main factors that drove the pro-Brexit vote. Thankfully, soon \u201cthings\u201d will be able to go back to being \u201clike they were\u201d. A Clarks Commando shoe, with white dog muck in the treads, will moon-stomp on a Remoaner\u2019s face \u2013 for ever.</p> <p>Words, however, have a habit of changing their meanings, and the fact that I am submitting this week\u2019s column from a medical isolation tent at an undisclosed emergency location proves their fluid nature. Bear with me. Imagine, for example, that I were to come into work and say: \u201cHello. I am gay today!\u201d Once, not long ago, everyone would have assumed I meant I was happy. But the word \u201cgay\u201d officially transitioned to meaning \u201chomosexual\u201d on 5 July 1960, its new coinage minted by Benny Hill in the Tommy Steele vehicle <em>Light Up </em><em>the Sky!</em>, a Brechtian comedy about a man trying to get his wedding cake iced by a recidivist Northern Irish baker.</p> <p>The last people to use the word \u201cgay\u201d to mean \u201chappy\u201d were the Flintstones, who were still promising viewers a \u201cgay old time\u201d as recently as 1966. To be fair, <em>The Flintstones</em> was set between 9000 and 2000 BCE, so it is possible they intended to hold up a mirror to the prehistoric attitudes of the era, while not necessarily endorsing them, like how \u201cthe ironic standup comedy of \u2018The Wokefinder General\u2019\u201d (\u00a9 Sarah Vine, <em>The Daily Mail</em>, 2020) Ricky Gervais does.</p> <p>By the 80s, however, the word \u201cgay\u201d was an insult in some circles. Indeed, when asked, by <em>Metal Mania</em> magazine in 1986, if he would ever use keyboards in a song, Anthrax\u2019s drummer, Charlie Benante, said: \u201cNo. That is gay.\u201d In 1990, I found myself in a music shop watching an instruction video in which Benante explained how some drums were in fact gay. Then, in 1992, I accidentally saw Anthrax live. They had a massive clock on stage, but its speeding hands, intended to illustrate humanity\u2019s race to oblivion, got stuck at 4pm, leaving Anthrax thrashing furiously and for ever in an eternal tea-time time-loop. Which was gay.</p> <p>Today, liberal values have been inculcated into society so thoroughly, only the drummer from Anthrax would still use the word \u201cgay\u201d as an insult, and even then only to a musical instrument. The best way to insult homosexuals today is to call them \u201cbumboys\u201d, as we have learned from the sterling work of our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-A-Bob-For-Big-Ben\u2019s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Johnson.</p> <p>Like the word \u201cgay\u201d, the word \u201cCorona\u201d has changed its meaning too. When I thought of \u201cCorona\u201d as a child, I did not think of a planet-ravaging virus. I thought of a colourful range of Welsh carbonated soft drinks, sold in bottles with 10p returnable deposits, and delivered direct to our door by the be-aproned Corona Man himself, And he was a jolly ruddy-faced tradesman, not an embodiment of global viral doom.</p> <p>The Corona Man would park his yellow flatbed truck in the communal car park, and scamper along our row of terraced houses with his basket of joy-inducing psychedelic fizz-milk. But the Corona factory in south Wales closed in 1987, after a eulogy from Tom Jones, who drank an entire bottle of dandelion and burdock and then retched The Last Post in burps into the microphone. It was the Corona Man, incredibly, who taught me how to ride a bike, taking pity on me as I fumbled and fell on the shared grass out front, and perhaps eyeing my obviously single mother, like a tartrazine Robin Askwith. Within a few months of The Corona Man\u2019s brief weekly instruction, I stopped crying and I was stable in the saddle. I was 28 years old. I\u2019m joking, of course.</p> <p>As the 70s shifted into the 80s, Corona\u2019s fortunes wavered, and the humiliating outfits the Corona Man was forced to wear on his Corona round reflected the company\u2019s desperation. In 1979, he delivered dressed as a giant bottle of Corona, his eyes peeping mournfully through tiny slits. By the end, he waddled round in a rubber fat-suit, his face painted bright orange like the anthropomorphised bubbles in the company\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nue8j_52M6Q\" title=\"\">Let\u2019s Get Fizzical</a>\u201d adverts, and The Corona Man was too ashamed to meet my gaze, despite our former intimacy. I got my fizz fix from cider now, and left for university, never to return. Deliveries ceased.</p> <p>Last week, a man came up to me after a standup show in Sheffield. He said he had lived, as a child, in the room I once lived in, in the house where I grew up, after my mum moved to Worcestershire. I suddenly felt humbled. After two-and-a-half hours of pretending to be someone, and something, else, I knew that this stranger would be able to locate me, socially and historically, and that he knew exactly who I really was.</p> <p>\u201cDid the man still deliver Corona when you were there?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe virus?\u201d the stranger said, \u201csomeone delivered a deadly virus to your home? What do you mean?\u201d A mild panic ensued at the merchandise table and people reached for their hand sanitisers before hurrying away. \u201cNo. Corona!\u201d, I shouted, \u201cCorona. A man gave it me every week and I drank loads of it. He\u2019ll be dead by now I expect.\u201d</p> <p>This, to be fair, only added to the confusion, and suddenly I found myself spirited away by insistent health officials in protective clothing.

The self-governing island has banned entry to Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China and suspended most flights to its giant neighbour. Many schools have also extended their lunar new year holiday to late February to curb the spread of the virus. Reuters contributed to this report.",

An 83-year-old American passenger has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/woman-let-off-cruise-ship-in-cambodia-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">since tested positive for the disease after travelling on to Malaysia</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The world's longest serving prime minister, the 67-year-old assumed power in 1985. Born in Kampong Cham, Cambodia, the former member of the Khmer Rouge defected and fled the country in 1977 to fight against Pol Pot's tyrannical regime. He returned to the country as minister of foreign affairs when a new government was installed in 1979, and was 33 when he subsequently became PM.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>After eight years at the helm he lost the 1993 elections, but refused to accept the result, ultimately becoming \"second prime minister\" alongside Prince Norodom Ranariddh of the Funcinpec party. He then seized control in a coup in 1997. He has since led the Cambodian People's party to successive victories in elections which have been frequently criticised by international monitors.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>In September 2017 Hun Sen had opposition leader Kem Sokha arrested on treason charges, and Cambodia\u2019s supreme court dissolved his Cambodia National Rescue party. Hun Sen went into the discredited 2018 election campaign unopposed, and t<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/29/cambodia-hun-sen-re-elected-in-landslide-victory-after-brutal-crackdown\">he CPP won every single seat in parliament after a brutal crackdown</a>.</p>\n    <p>Hun Sen has said he wishes to remain in power until 2028, and his recent moves have appeared to position Cambodia closer to China\u2019s orbit of power. Deals with a Chinese company to build Dara Sakor international airport in a remote corner of the country, as well as a deep port capable of hosting large naval vessels, have raised suspicions that China will use the locations for military purposes. Hun Sen says they are intended to build a global logistics hub that will transform the economy.</p>\n    <p>Supporters argue that he has bought relative peace, stability and prosperity to a country ravaged by decades of civil war and genocide. However, the human rights record of the Cambodian government has been criticised. In recent cases, Kem Sokha&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/10/cambodia-opposition-leader-kem-sokha-released-from-prison\">spent 12 months in detention followed by house arrest</a>&nbsp;before his trial began, Australian film-maker James Ricketson was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/australian-film-maker-james-ricketson-sentenced-to-six-years-jail-in-cambodia\">initially sentenced to six years in jail for espionage</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/09/cambodian-man-jailed-insulting-king-facebook-posts-lese-majeste-law\">a court jailed a man for three years for insulting the king on Facebook</a>.</p>\n    <p><b>Martin Belam</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOnly 20 passengers had their tests done.

In November, Drum, the MP for the Victorian seat of Nicholls, said the financial assistance from the federal government meant the centre was \u201cstaying open, end of story\u201d, claiming \u201cthere are no conversations about shutting the place down\u201d. But despite the financial injection, residents from the 40-bed home have been relocated and employees made redundant, with the home shutting its doors last week.</p> <p><strong>A three-year-old Australian girl held in al-Hawl camp in Syria will likely lose her fingers to frostbite</strong>. Amirah is one of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/17/three-year-old-australian-girl-in-syrias-al-hawl-camp-may-lose-fingers-to-frostbite\">47 Australian children</a> being detained in the sprawling detention camp for the family members of Islamic State fighters, as the north-east of Syria endures a bitterly cold winter. Amirah\u2019s five-month-old brother Yahya, who was born in the camp, is also malnourished. An older brother died before the family reached the camp. Other Australian children in the camp are reported to be suffering developmental disorders, diarrhoea, seizures, rickets and asthma. The youngest child in the Australian group is less than two months old.</p> <p><strong>Questions are being raised over a decision to let cotton farms harvest first rainfall in years.</strong> New South Wales bureaucrats <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/17/questions-raised-decision-cotton-farms-harvest-rainfall\">sought urgent advice from major cotton farmers</a> about how recent rainfall might damage their water harvesting infrastructure, in an apparent effort to justify giving them the green light to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/12/nsw-green-light-to-irrigators-to-harvest-rainfall-angers-downstream-residents\">retain the first rainfall in over a year</a>, rather than letting it flow downstream.

Top stories The Coalition gave an \u201cunprecedented\u201d $400,000 grant to the administrators of a now-closed aged care home in the electorate of Nationals MP Damian Drum, prompting Labor to question why other financially stressed providers have missed out. In November, Drum, the MP for the Victorian seat of Nicholls, said the financial assistance from the federal government meant the centre was \u201cstaying open, end of story\u201d, claiming \u201cthere are no conversations about shutting the place down\u201d. But despite the financial injection, residents from the 40-bed home have been relocated and employees made redundant, with the home shutting its doors last week. A three-year-old Australian girl held in al-Hawl camp in Syria will likely lose her fingers to frostbite. Amirah is one of 47 Australian children being detained in the sprawling detention camp for the family members of Islamic State fighters, as the north-east of Syria endures a bitterly cold winter. Amirah\u2019s five-month-old brother Yahya, who was born in the camp, is also malnourished. An older brother died before the family reached the camp. Other Australian children in the camp are reported to be suffering developmental disorders, diarrhoea, seizures, rickets and asthma. The youngest child in the Australian group is less than two months old. Questions are being raised over a decision to let cotton farms harvest first rainfall in years. New South Wales bureaucrats sought urgent advice from major cotton farmers about how recent rainfall might damage their water harvesting infrastructure, in an apparent effort to justify giving them the green light to retain the first rainfall in over a year, rather than letting it flow downstream. On 7 February the government announced it would restrict the harvesting of overland flows throughout the northern Murray-Darling Basin for the first time, because it was \u201cin the public interest\u201d. But within days, the government had lifted the ban for two valleys and part of a third. Australia The first cohort of Australian evacuees are set to leave quarantine on Christmas Island on Monday, with no reported cases of the new coronavirus among the 277 Australian citizens and permanent residents held on the island. Nationals leader Michael McCormack has declared he will lead the party to the next election, dismissing suggestions he will stand down within the next two years to ensure stability within the Coalition. Labor is accusing the government of shortchanging rural areas through the $150m sports fund, which was overwhelmingly spent in marginal seats during the election campaign. The world A woman let off a cruise ship in Cambodia has tested positive for coronavirus. Scores of passengers who left the MS Westerdam, which had been at sea for two weeks after leaving Hong Kong on 1 February, have since travelled on to other destinations. Meanwhile the US is set to evacuate hundreds of American passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Japan, as local health authorities said a further 70 people onboard had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total to 355. And a taxi driver has died from the coronavirus in Taiwan, marking the first such death on the island and the fifth fatality outside mainland China. In US political news, Kellyanne Conway has claimed Trump is the victim of a politicised justice system, Michael Bloomberg has insisted he is a \u201cchampion for women in the workplace\u201d, and Pete Buttigieg is \u201cnot going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh.\u201d Britain and the European Union are going to rip each other apart in talks over a future trade deal, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has predicted, while also holding out hope that UK defence co-operation with Europe will continue. The jury at Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial in New York will begin deliberations on Tuesday, with the world\u2019s media and the expectations of the #MeToo movement bearing heavily upon them. Recommended reads Australian researchers are pondering the link between a rare venom and cat allergies. A recent study involving the incredibly cute but atypically venomous dreamy-eyed slow loris speculates the allergic reactions cats can trigger in humans are a defence mechanism that they unwittingly evolved to fend off enemies. The University of Queensland\u2019s Bryan Fry sequenced the protein contained in the slow loris venom and used a computer program to compare it to all other known protein sequences. The cat allergen was the closest match. \u201cThere is one image from the bushfire crisis that I am still not able to shake,\u201d writes Angela Williams. \u201cWhat haunts me is the image of the prisoners locked in at Lithgow Correctional Centre when others were evacuated from the path of a fire last year. My fears come from experience: I\u2019ve been to prison twice for the same crime, committed in 1996. They are fears I\u2019d met in the old sandstone cells at Berrima where I asked a guard what to do if there was a fire in the cell, and he said \u2018break out or burn\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe way we currently handle workplace harassment isn\u2019t working and it isn\u2019t fair,\u201d writes Aimee Cooper. \u201cOne of the most frustrating things about my job is knowing just how strong our legal protections are, then seeing how rarely they are brought to life. Our equality laws are meaningless if they are not complied with, relied upon or enforced.\u201d Listen What happens when the taps run dry? Dozens of Australian towns have now run out of drinking water. Residents like Fleur Magick Dennis, a Wiradjuri woman from the rural NSW town of Euchareena, have been forced to cart water by truck and are living with severe water restrictions. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sustainable way to live. I\u2019m just really worried about our future at the moment,\u201d she says in today\u2019s episode of The Frontline, a major multimedia series from Guardian Australia, is about everyday Australians who are already living with the effects of the climate emergency. Sport It\u2019s a brave supporter that suggests a trip to the A-League to their partner on Valentine\u2019s Day. Richard Parkin is one such supporter. \u201cThe idea of trekking to an outdoor theatre during this Australian summer and placing your emotions in the hands of a football team like Adelaide United is as bold a gamble as booking a review-less modern fusion restaurant or chancing your mate\u2019s cousin\u2019s band at the corner pub.\u201d \u201cWhat a series, what a game, what a run chase, what a crick in the neck from repeatedly watching the ball sail through the Centurion skies,\u201d writes Barney Ronay, as England chase down South Africa and the T20 series. Media roundup \u201cThe number of asylum seekers who arrive by plane has reached a new peak in a flashpoint over border control, leaving Australia with almost 50,000 people who are yet to be deported after having their claims rejected,\u201d the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The ABC\u2019s Four Corners reveals \u201ca top Catholic boys\u2019 school is facing accusations of a culture of cover-up, after revelations its principal and dean of sport gave references for a now-convicted child sex offender but gave no support for the student during the court process.\u201d Backpackers are set to be granted special visas to help rebuild infrastructure destroyed in the bushfires, the Australian reports. Coming up The evacuees from Wuhan taken to Christmas Island over coronavirus fears are set to return to mainland Australia. The federal court will hold an interlocutory hearing on a challenge to the deportation of one of the members of the Biloela family to Sri Lanka. The family are being held on Christmas Island. A judgment is expected in the ABC\u2019s challenge over AFP raids on its offices in Ultimo.

There is also growing concern over possible infections among people who disembarked from the MS Westerdam in Cambodia on Friday, after it was confirmed that one passenger, who later flew to Malaysia, tested positive for the virus. The 83-year-old woman flew from Cambodia to Malaysia on Friday with 144 others from the ship. The woman\u2019s husband tested negative for the disease, Malaysia\u2019s health ministry said. The ship had been turned away by five countries, despite having no reported sickness onboard at the time.",
