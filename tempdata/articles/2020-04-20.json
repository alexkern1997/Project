      "body": "<p>In early January, Hu Aizhen, 65, heard that a new coronavirus had emerged in her home city, Wuhan. She was not worried \u2013 officials said it was not contagious \u2013 so she went about her days as usual and prepared for the lunar new year at the end of the month.</p> <p>Just before the city was put under lockdown, Hu developed pneumonia symptoms. After days of waiting and searching for a hospital, she was tested for the virus. Her result was negative, but tests at the time were known to be inaccurate and she showed obvious signs of the virus. Nevertheless, she was refused treatment by six hospitals.</p> <p>Hu, who had always been healthy, stayed at home for 10 days, unable to drink or eat, while her health deteriorated. When she took a further turn for the worse, her son tried to get her to a hospital in another district but police stopped them. Under lockdown orders they could not cross into another district. Her son, desperate, shouted at the traffic officers: \u201cAre you not people?\u201d</p> <p>When Hu was finally admitted to a hospital on 8 February, she was struggling to breathe. The doctor ordered another test, but it was too late. She regained consciousness briefly, asking her son to pour her some water. Then she died.</p> <p>Hu\u2019s son is now suing the Wuhan municipal government for allegedly concealing the seriousness of the virus, among other complaints, according to court documents prepared by Funeng, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/staff-of-changsha-funeng-ngo-hong-kong-arrested-in-southern-china\">public welfare NGO</a> based in Changsha. Hu\u2019s son is among a small but significant group of residents seeking answers, compensation or simply an apology from officials who took weeks to notify the public of the threat from a virus that went on to claim the lives of at least 4,000 people in China, according to government figures, most of them in Wuhan.</p> <p>Other cases include a civil servant suing the Hubei provincial government, a mother petitioning for officials to be punished after watching her 24-year-old daughter die of the virus, and a son who rushed his quickly fading mother to a hospital in the suburbs of Wuhan where he was able to get her admitted to intensive care. When he went to pick up supplies for her, he received a phone call from the hospital. His mother had died.</p> <p>\u201cNone of this would have happened if they had told us. So many people would not have had to die,\u201d said a relative involved in one of the lawsuits. Another said: \u201cI want an answer. I want those responsible to be punished under the law.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bc781c0f8ce63be2f416b7dc3d193ae84a4ef69\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bc781c0f8ce63be2f416b7dc3d193ae84a4ef69/0_195_1536_922/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zhang Hai, who died from coronavirus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhang Hai\u2019s father, Zhang Lifa, who died on 1 February from coronavirus in Wuhan, aged 76.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Family handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the outbreak spread in China, with thousands of confirmed cases a day at its peak, public anger reached levels not seen in decades, posing a serious threat to the ruling Chinese communist party. When the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/chinese-inquiry-exonerates-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang</a> died from the virus in February, censors could not keep up with the flood of outrage online. It was a moment some compared to the outpouring over the death of Hu Yaobang that precipitated the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.</p> <p>A little more than two months on, the resentment is much less visible. Accounts like Hu Aizhen\u2019s have been replaced by positive stories of the country coming together to defeat the virus, sending needed supplies to the rest of the world and fighting malicious attacks from the US and other countries blaming Beijing for the outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are easily led by propaganda,\u201d said Shi, a human rights activist based in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. \u201cAs the epidemic situation has improved and the propaganda machine works, there has been a reversal. Now people are saying the strong leadership of the party is a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>As Wuhan and the rest of the country slowly return to normal, authorities are carefully monitoring those who might harbour resentment. Zhang Hai, 50, whose father died from the virus in February, was part of a WeChat group of more than 100 people who lost relatives to the virus.</p> <p>In late March they were told they could retrieve their loved ones\u2019 remains from funeral homes. No more than five could go together at one time, and they had to be accompanied by a local government representative. Zhang refused to go. Later, the group\u2019s host was called in by the police and the WeChat group was deleted.</p> <p>\u201cNow everyone is trying to be very careful,\u201d said Zhang, who is calling for the government to issue an apology. \u201cI know a lot of families who are incredibly angry.\u201d</p> <p>Tan Jun, a civil servant in Yichang in Hubei province, filed a complaint this month accusing the Hubei provincial government of concealing the outbreak, according to copies of the lawsuit posted online. Tan confirmed the lawsuit but declined to be interviewed. Other residents in Wuhan who spoke to the Guardian said they had been intimidated by local police and forced to promise not to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cPeople must take responsibility. As a resident of Hubei, I believe it is necessary to stand up and call on the Hubei government to take responsibility,\u201d Tan said, according to an article posted on several WeChat accounts that has <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/_lUMee0j2VLaQiHQHSGPYQ\">now been deleted</a>.</p> <p>While authorities in Beijing have punished local officials by replacing them \u2013 what observers say is an age-old tactic for deflecting blame from the central government \u2013 residents say this is not enough.</p> <p>\u201cThat is not accountability. That is switching hats,\u201d said another resident who is suing her hospital. She says she contracted the virus in January but was not officially diagnosed until much later. In hospital she watched people around her die, including a woman in the next bed. Recently she learned that a classmate of hers who got sick around the same time had passed away.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was laying in bed thinking I might soon die, I thought: how did this happen?\u201d she said. \u201cRegular people have limited access to real information. We rely on the government. We believe what the government says.\u201d</p> <p>Dissent has spread in other ways. Dozens of shop owners at a shopping mall in Wuhan demonstrated this month, demanding rent reductions after months of not being able to open their stores. In Yingcheng, a city west of Wuhan, residents put under lockdown protested against the high prices for food imposed by community management. One of the protesters, Zeng Chunzhi, has reportedly <a href=\"https://wqw2010.blogspot.com/2020/04/blog-post_38.html?spref=tw\">been detained</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have been awakened. That\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Xie Yanyi, a rights lawyer based in Beijing. He has filed a request for information from the government, including the origins of the virus and reasons for the delay in informing the public of the outbreak. \u201cThe issue is they have not yet found their role or what actions to take. That still needs time,\u201d he said, acknowledging that such people are the minority. \u201cIt may not be many people, but history shows that it is the few who change society and who change history.\u201d</p> <p>In Wuhan, most residents are relieved that the worst of the epidemic appears to be over as they watch other countries struggle to contain it. Employees wait in lines outside of office buildings to have their throats swabbed, to make sure they do not have the virus before going back to work.</p> <p>On the riverbank in Hankou district, a couple kiss in front of what has become a nightly light show of skyscrapers lit up with congratulatory messages. Many residents say they appreciate what their country has done for them.</p> <p>The chance that cases such as Hu\u2019s will be accepted and go to court are not high, according to Yang Zhanqing, a co-founder of Funeng. More likely, those involved will be intimidated or harassed. But in some cases, especially determined plaintiffs can get compensation, which is one form of apology.</p> <p>\u201cThese cases apply pressure on the government and help more people understand their rights and the government\u2019s responsibility,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThis is also a way of documenting history, letting more people know the truth, and not just the government\u2019s version of what happened in Wuhan.\u201d</p>",

No event in the coming days would generate a gathering to compare. The game would draw people from across the Puget Sound area, and maybe beyond.</p> \n   <p>In the end, the match went on. Two days after the public health department wrote on Facebook, \u201cWe are making a recommendation to postpone or cancel events greater than 10-50 people,\u201d officials in King County allowed a soccer match to be held with 33,000 fans, squeezed together.</p> \n   <p>How that happened is captured in hundreds of pages of emails exchanged among federal, state and local officials, as well as executives from the Sounders, Seahawks, Mariners and XFL Dragons.

Emphasis ours:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our supply-chain group has worked around the clock to secure gowns, gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators. These employees have adapted to a new normal, exploring every lead, no matter how unusual. <strong>Deals, some bizarre and convoluted, and many involving large sums of money, have dissolved at the last minute when we were outbid or outmuscled, sometimes by the federal government.</strong> Then we got lucky, but getting the supplies was not easy.</p> \n   <p>A lead came from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member. After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker\u2019s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds \u2013 more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers \u2013 we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. <strong>I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected.</strong></p> \n   <p>Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a recap of Sunday\u2019s major news lines: New York mayor De Blasio asks if Trump is telling city to \u2018drop dead\u2019 over Covid-19. Mayor of city at center of coronavirus outbreak says not enough is being done to help finances of areas struck by pandemic. Governors: Trump making \u2018delusional\u2019 comments on testing and restrictions. State leaders say they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s three-phase program to ease stay-at-home orders without widespread testing. Cuomo: \u2018If the data holds, we are past the high point\u2019. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, says the total number of Covid-19 hospitalizations is down to 16,213, marking the sixth consecutive day that number has dropped. Questions mount over Christian group behind Central Park Covid-19 hospital. Facility run by Trump ally Franklin Graham\u2019s organization requires staff to sign statement opposing gay marriage Trump is asked whether he is inciting violence by calling for people to liberate states. \u201cThey\u2019ve got cabin fever,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to get back. They want their life back. Their life was taken away from them. And you know, they learned a lot during this period. They learned to do things differently than they have in the past and they\u2019ll do it hopefully until the virus has passed. And when the virus passes, I hope we\u2019re going to be sitting next to each other at baseball games, football games, basketball games, ice hockey games. I hope we\u2019re going to be sitting next to each other. The Masters is going to have 100,000 people, not 25 people waching at the course.\u201d He adds: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many American flags at a rally as I\u2019ve seen at these rallies. These people love our country. They want to get back to work. Trump is asked why he is reading and showing clips full of praise for himself at a time when more than 22 million Americans are unemployed and more the 40,000 have died as a result of the coronavirus. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m standing up for the men and women that have done such an incredible job,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing is about me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re never going to treat me fairly, many of you. And I understand that. I got here with the worst, most unfair press treatment they say in the history of the United States for a president. They did say Abraham Lincoln had very bad treatment, too.\u201d That one is actually true. Remember about a half hour ago when Trump played that excerpt from the New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s press briefing only to complain the clip wasn\u2019t long enough and the good parts were left out? We\u2019re in luck. Someone on his team has gone and found the complete footage. The lights have gone down again and we\u2019re watching Cuomo\u2019s remark that no one in New York was denied a ventilator if they needed Trump is asked what advice he would give to the many protesters who are against the government\u2019s restrictions. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to protest,\u201d he says, adding that \u201csome governors have gone too far\u201d. He says he watched footage of the protests and was happy they were all practicing social distancing, which is very much not true. Trump is in full stream-of-consciousness mode, very much in the spirit of his campaign rallies. He says the coronavirus has taught the nation an important lesson about the \u201csupply chain\u201d and the need to not have to rely on other countries in times of crisis. He then spends a few minutes criticizing trade policies with hard words for Nafta and the World Trade Organization. \u201cI want to read something I saw on television,\u201d he says, before reading his own tweet from 19 Feburary off a large printed page. And now the lights go down and Trump plays an excerpt from the New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s press briefing earlier today. After some initial technical difficulties, Cuomo\u2019s words ring through the briefing room: \u201cThese were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilization and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner and I\u2019m the first person to say it. We needed help and they were there.\u201d After Trump returns to the dais, he complains the clip wasn\u2019t long enough and the good parts were left out: \u201cDo you want to put the rest of it up or do you not have it? I just think it\u2019s good because it\u2019s bipartisan.\u201d After spending a few minutes reading from a Wall Street Journal op-ed praising his response to the pandemic, Trump points to the declining trajectory in new cases in the Seattle, Detroit, New Orleans, Indianapolis and Houston metro areas as \u201cmore evidence that our aggressive strategy is working\u201d. \u201cWho ever heard of a thing like this?\u201d he asks, circling back to familiar talking points. \u201cWe would\u2019ve had millions of people die if we didn\u2019t do this. Millions of people.\u201d Donald Trump opens today\u2019s coronavirus task force press briefing by saying they are \u201cclose to a deal\u201d with Democrats on the latest relief bill for small businesses and workers, which could be resolved as soon as tomorrow. He then says 4.18 million Americans have been tested for the coronavirus. \u201cThat\u2019s a record anywhere in the world,\u201d Trump says. \u201cMore total tests than all the following nations combined: France, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, India, Austria, Australia, Sweden and Canada.\u201d Trump says there is a \u201ctremendous capacity\u201d for testing before showing off a medical swab, likening it to a Q-tip. \u201cWe have ordered a lot of them,\u201d he said, but notes that some states \u201cdon\u2019t know where they are\u201d. Then a return to what\u2019s become a recurring motif over the past few days: \u201cWe are now the king of ventilators,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have so many ventilators.\u201d New York City mayor Bill de Blasio ramped up the rhetroic in his campaign for increased federal funding for US cities during the coronavirus crisis during his press briefing on Sunday, asking Donald Trump whether his administration was \u201cgoing to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead?\u201d As the Guardian\u2019s Edward Helmore reports: De Blasio\u2019s dramatic language came during his press conference on Sunday, after he warned last week that he planned to cut a further $2bn from the city\u2019s municipal services budget due to the economic downturn. He said the city was likely to lose at least $7.4bn in tax revenue over the current and next fiscal year. De Blasio has criticized the $2tn coronavirus relief package that Trump signed last month, saying New York only received $1.4bn from the stimulus, compared with around $58bn for the airline industry. He has called for the next package, which congressional and administration leaders say they are \u201cclose\u201d to reaching a deal on, to include tens of billions for states, cities and municipalities. The mayor had harsh words for the president, claiming both he and the vice-president, Mike Pence, have ignored his overtures on the stimulus funds. On Sunday, De Blasio sent a message to the administration that echoed a New York newspaper headline during the city\u2019s bankruptcy crisis of the 1970s. \u201cThere was that famous Daily News cover that said \u2018Ford to City: Drop Dead,\u2019\u201d De Blasio said. \u201cSo my question is, Mr Trump, Mr President, are you going to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead? Which one is it?\u201d \u201cPresident Trump, what\u2019s going on? Cat got your tongue?\u201d De Blasio continued. \u201cYou\u2019re usually really talkative. You usually have an opinion on everything. How on earth do you not have an opinion on aid to American cities and states?\u201d A sensational investigation co-published today by ProPublica and the Seattle Times shows how officials in the first US state to be hit by Covid-19 struggled to send the public a clear, consistent message in the early days of the pandemic, bowing to a professional soccer team\u2019s desire to host a game with 33,000 spectators despite urgent warnings from the health department for a ban on large gatherings. On March 6, at 2:43 p.m., the health officer for Public Health \u2014 Seattle &amp; King County, the hardest-hit region in the first state to be slammed by COVID-19, sent an email to a half-dozen colleagues, saying, \u201cI want to cancel large group gatherings now.\u201d The county\u2019s numbers \u2014 10 known deaths and nearly 60 confirmed cases as of late morning \u2014 were bad and getting worse. Many local events had already been called off for fear of spreading the coronavirus. Oyster Fest. The Puget Sound Puppetry Festival. A Women\u2019s Day speaker series at the Gates Foundation. King County had ordered a stop to in-person government meetings unless they were considered essential. The health officer, Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, was to the Seattle area what Anthony Fauci would become for the country, the doctor at the microphone, dispensing guidance. Under Washington law, Duchin also had authority to make his wish an order. Duchin sent his email 28 hours before the Seattle Sounders, defending MLS champions and one of the league\u2019s biggest draws, were to host a match at CenturyLink Field. No event in the coming days would generate a gathering to compare. The game would draw people from across the Puget Sound area, and maybe beyond. In the end, the match went on. Two days after the public health department wrote on Facebook, \u201cWe are making a recommendation to postpone or cancel events greater than 10-50 people,\u201d officials in King County allowed a soccer match to be held with 33,000 fans, squeezed together. How that happened is captured in hundreds of pages of emails exchanged among federal, state and local officials, as well as executives from the Sounders, Seahawks, Mariners and XFL Dragons. Those records, obtained by ProPublica and The Seattle Times, show how one meeting would beget another, one email would beget a dozen more, all while the virus was taking rapid hold. The most recent count of Covid-19 cases in Washington totals 11,802 infections and 624 deaths, according to the state\u2019s Department of Health. In a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine as part of its ongoing Covid-19 Notes series, the chief executive of a Massachusetts hospital accuses the federal government of running an effective PPE blockade that\u2019s prevented the delivery of critical equipment to states in need. Emphasis ours: Our supply-chain group has worked around the clock to secure gowns, gloves, face masks, goggles, face shields, and N95 respirators. These employees have adapted to a new normal, exploring every lead, no matter how unusual. Deals, some bizarre and convoluted, and many involving large sums of money, have dissolved at the last minute when we were outbid or outmuscled, sometimes by the federal government. Then we got lucky, but getting the supplies was not easy. A lead came from an acquaintance of a friend of a team member. After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker\u2019s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds \u2013 more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers \u2013 we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal. Two semi-trailer trucks, cleverly marked as food-service vehicles, met us at the warehouse. When fully loaded, the trucks would take two distinct routes back to Massachusetts to minimize the chances that their contents would be detained or redirected. Hours before our planned departure, we were told to expect only a quarter of our original order. We went anyway, since we desperately needed any supplies we could get. Upon arrival, we were jubilant to see pallets of KN95 respirators and face masks being unloaded. We opened several boxes, examined their contents, and hoped that this random sample would be representative of the entire shipment. Before we could send the funds by wire transfer, two Federal Bureau of Investigation agents arrived, showed their badges, and started questioning me. No, this shipment was not headed for resale or the black market. The agents checked my credentials, and I tried to convince them that the shipment of PPE was bound for hospitals. After receiving my assurances and hearing about our health system\u2019s urgent needs, the agents let the boxes of equipment be released and loaded into the trucks. But I was soon shocked to learn that the Department of Homeland Security was still considering redirecting our PPE. Only some quick calls leading to intervention by our congressional representative prevented its seizure. I remained nervous and worried on the long drive back, feelings that did not abate until midnight, when I received the call that the PPE shipment was secured at our warehouse. A number of US governors from both sides of the aisle, including Virginia Democrat Ralph Northam and Maryland Republican Larry Hogan, have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures. As the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe and Edward Helmore report: Many state leaders have said they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s recommended three-phrase programme to ease stay-at-home restrictions without a robust and widespread system of testing in place. Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US should conduct more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the New York Times reported. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN on Sunday that claims by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were \u201cjust delusional\u201d. \u201cWe have been fighting for testing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have enough swabs, believe it or not. For the national level to say that we have what we need, and really to have no guidance to the state levels, is just irresponsible, because we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Maryland, Virginia and Washington DC are still seeing increasing cases even as the epicenter of the US outbreak, New York, has started to see some declines. Boston and Chicago are also emerging hot spots with recent surges in cases and deaths. \u201cThe administration I think is trying to ramp up testing, they are doing some things with respect to private labs,\u201d said Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland during a CNN interview. \u201cBut to try to push this off, to say the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren\u2019t doing our jobs, is just absolutely false.\u201d Tyson Foods, one of the world\u2019s largest meat processors, has faced criticism after cases were linked to one of its plants in Waterloo, Iowa. \u201cMy personal opinion is that it should be closed,\u201d the Black Hawk county sheriff, Tony Thompson, told the Des Moines Register on Friday. \u201cI think we need a hard boot, reset on that plant. I think we need to be able to sort out and cull the herd between the haves and the have-nots there. I think we need to deep-clean that facility and I think we need to restart that plant on a clean slate.\u201d That news was followed on Sunday by a CNN report that another plant in Tennessee had recorded 90 positive tests for Covid-19. The company says workers are required to wear face coverings during shifts and have their temperatures taken at the start of each shift. A spokesperson for Tyson also said cleaning is a priority. \u201cWe have team members dedicated to constantly wiping down and sanitizing common areas. In some cases, this additional cleaning involves suspending a day of production,\u201d the spokesperson said on Sunday. Donald Trump has started his afternoon by declaring the US \u201cthe king of ventilators\u201d. Several state governors have said they need more help from the federal government with Covid-19 testing in an effort to curb the pandemic. However, the president thinks he\u2019s on the right course, while implying the onus was on governors rather than the federal government to ramp up testing. \u201cJust like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the \u201cKing of Ventilators\u201d, other countries are calling asking for help-we will!), I am right on testing,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cGovernors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!\u201d On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday, Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, said the FDA had not paid enough attention to companies \u201cputting a slightly different formula together\u201d for tests. \u201cI could probably double, maybe even triple testing in Ohio virtually overnight\u201d if the FDA considered such options, DeWine said. The Miami Herald has reported on a problem facing one public hospital: agencies trying to headhunt staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. From the Herald\u2019s report: Staffing agencies have mounted attempts to poach the public hospital\u2019s most crucial workers, even as the novel coronavirus upends operations and mashes its bottom line, with estimated losses of $25 million per month going forward under the status quo. Plantada, who helps manage ventilators for critically ill COVID-19 patients, said the offers \u2014 as high as $7,000 per week plus room and board \u2014 are both aggressive and enticing. But she has no plans for leaving. \u201cWe want to support our community,\u201d Plantada said. \u201cMost of the therapists down here, that is our priority: sticking by and being here for everybody else.\u201d You can read the full report here. The Boston Celtics\u2019 Jaylen Brown, who one NBA executive once described as \u201ctoo smart\u201d for the league or \u201chis own good\u201d is one of the most interesting athletes in the US (and not too bad a player either). He\u2019s never been shy of criticizing the current administration either and has written an op-ed for the Guardian on the Covid-19 outbreak. He\u2019ll also be on CNN tonight at 7.45pm ET to discuss the topic with Wolf Blitzer. Here\u2019s an extract from his column today: America\u2019s lack of medical resources is barefaced, and the number of unemployment claims is at an all-time high. I understand the urge to protect your closest loved ones. However, if you have the means, I urge you to extend a hand to a neighbor or friend who may be less fortunate. As I write this more than 30,000 people have lost their lives in the US alone. Of those heart-wrenching numbers, the percentage of African Americans and people of color is both alarming and disproportionate. You can read the full article below: With Joe Biden effectively confirmed as the Democrats\u2019 candidate for this year\u2019s presidential election, the results of Wyoming\u2019s Democratic presidential caucus don\u2019t matter too much. Especially when Wyoming has the smallest population of any US state and only 21.6% of the state voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. But, nevertheless Biden won the state\u2019s Democratic presidential caucus on Sunday. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press: Joe Biden has won Wyoming\u2019s Democratic presidential caucus, which had been postponed for two weeks and scaled back to just mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic, state party officials said on Sunday. The results come less than two weeks after Sanders dropped out and endorsed Biden, who is the only candidate still actively seeking the Democratic nomination. Voting began when it was still a two-candidate race. Biden beat Sanders 72% to 28%. A total of 15,428 votes were cast. The Wyoming Democratic Party announced the results after tabulating votes Saturday and auditing the results overnight. What was originally to be a combination of in-person caucusing, drop-off and mail-in vote tabulation on April 4 was scaled back to just drop-off and mail-in and finally just mail-in voting. Thousands of protesters gathered at the Michigan state capitol last week in response to what they viewed as an overly strict stay at home order by Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Some protesters chanted \u201cLock her up\u201d and demonstrations also took place in Ohio, Maryland and Texas. Whitmer, a Democrat, has extended the stay at home order until 30 April and defended her policy on Sunday, saying it was helping save lives. As of Sunday morning, more than 2,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Michigan, the third highest number of deaths for any state in the US. Michigan ranks 10th among US state\u2019s by population. \u201cYou know my stay-home order is one of the nation\u2019s more conservative, but the fact of the matter is, it\u2019s working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten. And that means we\u2019re saving lives,\u201d Whitmer told CNN on Sunday. \u201cWho among us wouldn\u2019t rather forgo jet skiing or boating right now if it\u2019s going to save your grandparent or your neighbor\u2019s life and that\u2019s precisely what the tradeoff is at the moment.\u201d Louisiana\u2019s governor, John Bel Edwards, sounded a note of cautious optimism during a press briefing on Sunday. His state has been one of the worst affected by Covid-19 with only four other states recording more deaths from the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re in much, much better place today than we thought we were going to be,\u201d Edwards said. He added that Louisiana has recorded a drop in the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital and fewer people are using ventilators. There were 29 deaths in the state from Coronavirus announced on Sunday. \u201cNow the number of cases and the number of deaths are lower than they have been for the last number of days, that\u2019s a good thing, but I would caution everybody that typically on Sunday the numbers go down,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a function of when the labs report and so forth, so what we would like to see is a continued downward trajectory tomorrow and Tuesday and on through the week.\u201d He also warned that life will not return to normal until a vaccine is released for Covid-19. Most experts believe a vaccine is at least a year away. \u201cAs always, I want to remind everyone that it\u2019s going to take all of us working together and for some period of time to defeat this virus, get back to life as normal,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to see that for a while and I suspect we won\u2019t fully see it until after there\u2019s a vaccine that\u2019s administered to the entire population.\u201d Australia\u2019s former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has released a memoir and the Guardian has published extracts detailing his relationship with Donald Trump, who he describes as a \u201cbully\u201d. Turnbull was in power from 2015 to 2018 and is perhaps most famous in the US for a clash he had with Trump over an agreement, signed off by Barack Obama, for the States to take in refugees originally heading for Australia. He then details what happened when Trump pushed back: Trump is a natural isolationist. Whether it was east Asia or the Middle East, Trump\u2019s perspective was thoroughly dystopian. Everyone hated each other, had done for centuries and wasn\u2019t going to change. So the less the US had to do with them the better. After we\u2019d had our one-on-one discussion and the media had left us, Donald suggested we ask [Turnbull\u2019s wife] Lucy and Melania to join us. Melania was found first and Donald described the refugee deal. By now he knew, just as I had told him, there were no security risks among the refugees. \u201cMelania, do you know, Malcolm has 2,000 of the worst terrorists in the world locked up on a desert island and that fool Obama agreed to take them. Can you believe that? And now Malcolm has talked me into taking them too! He got me to do something I promised never to do! He is a tough negotiator!\u201d Melania smiled, faintly and mischievously. \u201cJust like you, Donald,\u201d she said. The subject of an incandescent row a few months before was now something to make light of. It was just another deal. You can read a more detailed extract here: \u201cThe president is right when he gets up there and says the models had many more people dying,\u201d Cuomo says of the statewide efforts that kept infections and deaths far below the CDC\u2019s mid-March estimates of twice the nation\u2019s hospital capacity. \u201cThis is a great success story ... [but] don\u2019t go backwards.\u201d Cuomo is then asked about President Trump\u2019s tweet from moments ago: \u201cGreat,\u201d Cuomo says, taking a slightly more diplomatic tack than on Friday when he responded to a different Trump tweet with a scathing 16-minute rebuke. \u201cStates must do their part and the federal government must do its part. Perfect. That\u2019s what\u2019s called partnership.\u201d Cuomo announces a plan for an \u201caggressive\u201d statewide antibody testing program, saying they will be able to sample thousands of people in the coming weeks and promising the data will provide \u201cthe first true snapshot of what we\u2019re truly dealing with\u201d. \u201cThat will tell us for the first time, what percent of the population has actually had the coronavirus,\u201d he says. \u201cAny plan that is going to start to reopen the economy has to be based on data, which means it has to be based on testing.\u201d The state\u2019s Department of Health will run the testing, but Cuomo stressed that cooperation with the federal government will be essential to helping with the supply chain and coordinating with private labs. New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the total number of Covid-19 hospitalizations is down to 16,213, marking the sixth consecutive day that number has dropped. \u201cIf the data holds, we are past the high point and all indications,\u201d Cuomo says during his daily coronavirus briefing from Northwell Health\u2019s Feinstein Institute for Medical Research on Long Island. \u201cAt this point we are on a descent. Whether or not that descent continues depends on what we do.\u201d Other key metrics including the three-day average of the hospitalization rate, ICU admissions and number of intubations are all down, the governor says. Another 507 people died of coronavirus across the state yesterday \u2013 the lowest that figure has been in several days \u2013 bringing the overall death toll to 13,869. \u201cIt\u2019s no time to get cocky and it\u2019s no time to get arrogant,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWe still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do. This virus has been ahead of us every step of the way. We have been playing catch-up from day one in this situation, so it is no time to relax.\u201d Vice president Mike Pence claimed the US has \u201csufficient capacity\u201d for testing for any state to go to phase one level of reopening in an NBC interview aired on Sunday morning. State governors have said a shortage of testing, and a lack of help from the federal government to ramp up testing, are among the most significant hurdles in easing stay-at-home restrictions. Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US cannot safely reopen unless it conducts more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the New York Times reported this weekend. Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, insisted testing had been a focus of the administration \u201cfrom the very beginning\u201d and walked away from Donald Trump\u2019s claim last week that executive branch authority alone would determine when social-distancing guidelines could be lifted and businesses reopened. \u201cJust so we\u2019re very clear, when the president outlined his guidelines for opening up America, we laid out a plan for both \u2013 for when and how we thought it was best according to our best scientists and advisors for states to be able to responsibly and safely reopen,\u201d Pence said. Downplaying reports of rifts between federal and state approaches to curbing the pandemic, Pence said that \u201cat the president\u2019s direction, we\u2019ll continue to play our role\u201d and would maintain \u201ca full partnership with governors around the country\u201d. Pence disputed claims that the federal government, which is currently conducting 150,000 tests a day, had acceded responsibility for testing to individual states. This was, he said, \u201cthe reason why the president early on brought in this vast array of commercial labs that took us from 80,000 tests one month ago to now four million tests as of yesterday.\u201d Several state governors have claimed that Washington has rejected calls to co-ordinate testing at a national level. \u201cAdmiral Brett Giroir of the US Public Health Service spends all of his time coordinating testing deployment and resources deployment from FEMA,\u201d Pence added. \u201cI want the American people to know ... we will continue to do that.\u201d The vice president said that the White House planned to \u201cmake clear\u201d to governors in a conference call on Monday that \u201cif states around the country will activate all of the laboratories that are available in their states, we could more than double that overnight and literally be doing hundreds of thousands of more tests per day.\u201d Pence continued: \u201cThere is a sufficient capacity of testing across the country today for any state in America to go to a phase one level, which contemplates testing people that have symptoms of the coronavirus and also doing the kind of monitoring of vulnerable populations in our cities, in our nursing homes, that we ought to be watching very carefully for outbreaks of the coronavirus.\u201d On ABC\u2019s This Week with George Stephanopoulos, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx gently endorsed President Trump\u2019s decision to suspend funding to the World Health Organization by saying the first country struck by a pandemic has a \u201chigher moral obligation\u201d for communication and transparency. \u201cIt\u2019s always the first country that get exposed to the pandemic that has a \u2013 really a higher moral obligation on communicating, on transparency, because all the other countries around the world are making decisions on that,\u201d Birx said, when asked if it was \u201cfair to blame the WHO for covering up the spread of this virus\u201d. She added: \u201cAnd when we get through this as a global community, we can figure out really what has to happen for first alerts and transparency and understanding very early on about \u2026 how incredibly contagious this virus is.\u201d Trump announced the decision to halt funding to WHO on Tuesday pending an investigation into its response to the coronavirus pandemic, accusing the group of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the virus\u201d. Birx appeared to corroborate Trump\u2019s timeline on Sunday, saying: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until the beginning of March that we could all fully see how contagious.\u201d Today marks 25 years since the Oklahoma City bombing, the second deadliest act of terrorism on US soil after the 9/11 attacks. On April 19 1995, a truck bomb was detonated in Oklahoma City by a right-wing extremist and US army veteran, killing 168 people and injuring hundreds more. Bill Clinton, who was president at the time, paid tribute to the victims and their families. He added: \u201cAs we face another unprecedented challenge, we should repeat the promise we made to Oklahoma City in 1995 to all Americans today: we have not lost each other, we have not lost America, and we will stand together for as many tomorrows as it takes.\u201d In Washington, where the first US death linked coronavirus was reported in February, the state\u2019s governor Jay Inslee said there has been \u201ca lot of good news\u201d but that it was not out of the woods yet. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to bend the curve down, and the reason we\u2019ve been able to do this is we\u2019ve made decisions based on data, based on science, based on some of the best geneticists and epidemiologists in the world here at the University of Washington and other labs. \u201cThe problem is those who still have not got the curve going down. We want to make sure we wrestle this beast to the ground.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports: Washington governor Jay Inslee has again criticized Donald Trump\u2019s support for protests against stay-at-home measures, saying on Sunday that such messaging from the US president was \u201cdangerous\u201d. His fresh criticism comes two days after he accused Trump of \u201cunhinged rantings\u201d in tweets that called for the \u2018liberation\u2019 of certain Democratic-led states that have imposed that measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. \u201cI don\u2019t know any other way to characterise it,\u201d Inslee told host George Stephanopoulous on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cTo have an American president encourage people to violate the law, I can\u2019t remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing. And it is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.\u201d Protests have grown around the country in recent days, and Inslee has been arguably the most vocal governor to speak out against Trump, who sent the \u201cliberate\u201d Tweets Friday attacking state leaders in Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia for maintaining stay-at-home restrictions as he announced guidelines for reopening the country. In the case of Virginia, the president also claimed, without evidence, that citizens\u2019 Second Amendment rights were \u201cunder siege\u201d after governor Ralph Northam signed into law tighter firearms restrictions a week earlier. Inslee said: \u201cIt is doubly frustrating to us governors because this is such a schizophrenia, the president is basically asking people, \u2018Please ignore Dr Fauci and Dr Birx [White House task force medical advisers], please ignore my own guidelines that I set forth,\u2019 because those guidelines made very clear\u2026 that you cannot open up Michigan today, or Virginia, under those guidelines. You need to see a decline in the infections and fatalities. And that simply has not happened yet.\u201d Inslee added: \u201cWe hope there could be a restoration of leadership in the White House rather than hobbling our national efforts to protect people from this terrible virus.\u201d In her interview with ABC News this morning, House speaker Nancy Pelosi also cautioned against overplaying the significance of protests against stay-at-home measures that have been taking place in states including Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia, this week. She said the protests and Donald Trump\u2019s support for the demonstrators amounted to \u201ca distraction\u201d from failures in the White House response to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t exaggerate the protests across the country. There are some in some places, largely where there\u2019s a Democratic governor. But I think of it largely as a distraction and the president\u2019s embrace of it as a distraction from the fact that he has not appropriately done testing, treatment, contact tracing, and quarantine.\u201d As the Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reports, Trump and rightwing media have supported the demonstrators but they appear to represent a minority opinion: Democratic house speaker Nancy Pelosi has dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s almost daily attacks on her and other members of the Democratic leadership during the coronavirus crisis, saying she does not \u201cpay that much attention\u201d to the president\u2019s tweets against her. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, he\u2019s a poor leader. He\u2019s always trying to avoid responsibility and assign blame.\u201d Pelosi also restated her concerns about how the president will handle the next phase of the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that he\u2019s going to act on the set basis of what he\u2019s acted before. It\u2019s a hoax. It\u2019s magically going to disappear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not based on science. This isn\u2019t magical. This is scientific.\u201d Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, also says the tea leaves look good for a small business deal this week. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful we can come to an agreement tonight, or early tomorrow morning,\u201d he told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, adding that he and House speaker Nancy Pelosi have been in discussions \u201calmost 24/7\u201d with treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin. \u201cMany of the things we have asked for, on the banking side, on the testing side, the hospital side, they\u2019re going along with,\u201d he said. \u201cTesting is the key, every expert says it. We will not be able to get the economy going full pledge unless we have testing,\u201d Schumer said, noting that Democrats had proposed $30bn in the so-called \u2018Covid 2\u2019 bill to fund manufacturing and supply chains, more widespread and free testing, and contact tracing. One interesting footnote to Schumer\u2019s conversation with Tapper: he was asked about reports that progressive New York congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez had not ruled out a primary challenge for his New York Senate seat. \u201cI\u2019m totally focused on this Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the epicenter. And I\u2019ve found throughout my career, you do your job well and everything else works out OK.\u201d Tapper also wanted to know if reports that an additional $1 trillion or more will be needed in the next government stimulus package are accurate. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d Mnuchin said, adding that \u201canother $300bn should be sufficient to reach almost everybody.\u201d Mnuchin was also defensive about the roll-out of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website allowing taxpayers to log on and check the status of their stimulus money, worth up to $3,400 for a family of four. The website was beset with problems at launch and many who had hoped to upload direct deposit details for quicker payment were greeted with error messages. Mnuchin said more than 40 million taxpayers had accessed the site successfully, and five million had been able to upload details. Others who are eligible will receive a paper check, controversially with Donald Trump\u2019s name on it. Reports this week suggested the vanity project would hold up the checks. Apparently, there is a difference between having Trump\u2019s name merely printed on the checks, and having the president sign them, which Mnuchin said he rejected because that would have caused delays. \u201cThat was my idea,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is the president and I think it\u2019s a terrific symbol to the American public.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports: On CNN\u2019s State of the Union, host Jake Tapper points out that Sunday marks 50 days since the first coronavirus death was recorded in the US. His first guest was treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been under fire since the first round of government stimulus money for business, some $340bn, was exhausted inside two weeks. Some of the money went to successful large companies, while many small businesses received nothing. Mnuchin concurs with Pelosi that a new funding deal is close, and tells Tapper it could be signed off by the middle of this week. He says he\u2019s going to make sure that smaller operators are taken care of this time. \u201cThat\u2019s something we did correct already,\u201d he said, pointing out the average loan was $250,000. \u201cThere were some big businesses, but the majority is going to small businesses. I know there\u2019s other people who are still waiting in line and we\u2019re going to try to make sure all the banks get to them quickly in this next batch of money.\u201d He said he had had discussions with congressional leaders including Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, and that: \u201cWe\u2019re very close to a deal today.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hoping the Senate can reach an agreement tomorrow and the house can take it up on Tuesday, Wednesday we\u2019ll be back up and running.\u201d According to a new NBC/WSJ poll, a majority of Americans are concerned that states may start re-opening too soon. The poll found that 58% of interviewees were worried the US would move too quickly to ease stay-at-home restrictions, causing further spread and more deaths from the coronavirus, while it found that 32% were more worried the US would take too long to loosen them and hurt the economy. The White House last week issued its guidelines for governors on the criteria for re-opening their states after imposing stay-at-home orders to curb the spread of coronavirus. But the guidelines were still full of unanswered questions on how the plans would work. Good morning live blog readers US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she believed lawmakers are very close to a deal on approving extra money to help small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re close,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview with ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d broadcast on Sunday. \u201cI think we\u2019re very close to an agreement.\u201d The Associated Press reports: An agreement would end a stalemate that has lasted more than a week over President Donald Trump\u2019s request to add $250 billion to a small-business loan program. Congress set up the program last month as part of a $2.3 trillion coronavirus economic relief plan, but it has already run out of money. Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer say they favor more money for small businesses but also want more coronavirus response funds for state and local governments and hospitals, as well as food assistance for the poor. \u201cWe want to make sure that it\u2019s reaching all of America\u2019s small businesses. And we also want to make sure that it\u2019s operating in a community where our police and fire, our health care workers, our doctors, nurses, our teachers, are being compensated for and not fired,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re asking for the additional funds in the package, as well as for hospitals so that we can do testing, testing, testing.\u201d Governors of hard hit states such as New York and New Jersey have said they need more federal funding to significantly ramp up testing capacity.",

She is rumoured to be the brains behind Kim\u2019s carefully constructed public image, at home and abroad. In return, she enjoys the absolute confidence of her brother, a leader capable of ordering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/12/north-korea-jang-song-thaek-executed\">execution of his own uncle</a> for alleged treason.</p> <p>As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 with Pyongyang continuing to insist it has not recorded a single case \u2013 Kim Yo-jong\u2019s ascendancy continues.</p> <p>Last month, she made her first public statement, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/kim-jong-uns-sister-calls-south-korea-a-frightened-dog\">condemning the South</a> as a \u201cfrightened dog barking\u201d after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North.

      "bodyText": "From producing an ashtray during a cigarette break en route to a nuclear summit to issuing a statement in praise of the US president, Kim Yo-jong has become the single most important figure in the North Korean regime after her brother, the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. Since representing Kim at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Yo-jong has not only acquired prestigious titles within the ruling Workers\u2019 party. She is rumoured to be the brains behind Kim\u2019s carefully constructed public image, at home and abroad. In return, she enjoys the absolute confidence of her brother, a leader capable of ordering the execution of his own uncle for alleged treason. As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 with Pyongyang continuing to insist it has not recorded a single case \u2013 Kim Yo-jong\u2019s ascendancy continues. Last month, she made her first public statement, condemning the South as a \u201cfrightened dog barking\u201d after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North. And in March, she publicly praised Donald Trump for sending Kim a letter in which he said he hoped to maintain good bilateral relations and offered help in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. The publication of political statements in Kim Yo-jong\u2019s name underlines her central role in the regime, according to Youngshik Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei University\u2019s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. \u201cIt is revealing that Kim Jong-un permitted her to write and announce a scathing statement about South Korea in such a personal tone,\u201d Bong said. \u201cHe is clearly ready to allow his sister to become his alter ego.\u201d But Yo-jong, who accompanied Kim to his two summits with Trump, apparently paid a price when his nuclear diplomacy suffered a setback. Last weekend, she was reinstated to the party\u2019s powerful politburo, according to the state Korean Central News Agency, just over a year after she had reportedly been removed from the position and told to keep a low profile following the failure of the Hanoi denuclearisation summit. And she has not escaped the attention of US officials, who in 2017 placed her and other North Korean officials on a blacklist for \u201csevere human rights abuses\u201d. Internationally, Yo-jong has been a visible presence throughout the regime\u2019s high-stakes diplomatic process with Washington and Seoul. At home, she has performed the role of propagandist-in-chief, burnishing Kim\u2019s reputation as head of the dynasty that has ruled North Korea for three generations. \u201cShe has direct access to and strong influence on Kim Jong-un,\u201d said Leonid Petrov, a North Korea specialist and senior lecturer at the International College of Management in Sydney. \u201cShe is not associated with his purges or military brinkmanship, but knows all about them.

      "body": "<p>Donald Trump has been accused of using another White House coronavirus task force briefing to broadcast a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise.</p> \n<p>The US president dimmed the lights and played two selectively edited videos on screens behind the briefing room podium featuring Cuomo, whose state has been hardest hit by the deadly pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat the federal government did, working with states ... was a phenomenal accomplishment,\u201d the governor said in the first clip. \u201cThese were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilisation, and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner, and I\u2019m the first to say it. We needed help and they were there.\u201d</p> \n<p>But the films were played just two days after Cuomo, who has emerged as one of the most prominent Democrats during the crisis, eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. \u201cFirst of all, if he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. \u201cSecond, let\u2019s keep emotion and politics out of this and personal ego if we can because this is about the people and our job and let\u2019s try to focus on that.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/bill-de-blasio-donald-trump-coronavirus-covid-19-budget\">New York mayor De Blasio asks if Trump is telling city to 'drop dead' over Covid-19</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cuomo acknowledged that Trump had moved quickly to increase hospital capacity, but said he was wrong to claim the city\u2019s Javits Center, a convention facility converted to a hospital, had not been used, pointing out that 800 people had gone through. The projected number of patients \u201cwere the president\u2019s projections\u201d, he added.</p> \n<p>Exasperated, Cuomo went on: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to help on testing. I said 11 times, I said the one issue we need help with is testing. He said 11 times: \u2018I don\u2019t want to get involved in testing, it\u2019s too complicated, it\u2019s too hard.\u2019 I know it\u2019s too complicated and too hard. That\u2019s why we need help. I can\u2019t do an international supply chain.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe wants to say: \u2018Well I did enough.\u2019 Yeah, none of us have done enough. We haven\u2019t, because it\u2019s not over ... We have a lot more to do and no one can do the posture of \u2018Just say thank you for what I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m now out, I\u2019m not doing anything else. I\u2019ve done my part.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>The pair of New Yorkers exchanged barbs on Twitter but, at Sunday\u2019s briefing, Trump was only eager to bask in Cuomo\u2019s praise. After the first video was shown, he chided his staff: \u201cThey left out the good part. Good job, fellas ... You want to put the rest of it up, or do you not have it?\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI just think it\u2019s so good for people because it\u2019s bipartisan. This is not about Democrats, Republicans. This is about a thing that hit our country, the likes of which has never happened to us before.\u201d</p> \n<p>The second clip was duly played later in the briefing. And earlier Trump had read aloud from a Wall Street Journal column praising him. A CNN reporter asked, with more than 22 million Americans unemployed and the death toll now above 40,000, \u201cis this really the time for self-congratulations?\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump retorted: \u201cYou\u2019re CNN, you\u2019re fake news ... You don\u2019t have the brains you were born with.\u201d</p> \n<p>Media reports suggest Trump is ready to transition from crisis mode to a new phase focused on economic recovery and his re-election.</p> \n<p>For his part, Cuomo issued two pointed tweets on Sunday evening. One said: \u201c\u2018Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\u2019 \u2014 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\u201d The other thanked health care, hospital and nursing home workers, and said: \u201cYou are heroes. #NewYorkTough.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s publicity stunt also drew direct criticism. Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, tweeted: \u201cBeyond being another taxpayer-funded campaign ad, this video clip also makes Trump look exceedingly weak. The video casts Cuomo as Trump\u2019s boss giving him a performance appraisal. (If only!).\u201d</p> \n<p>The president also sought to downplay the national testing shortage, despite governors\u2019 complaints that they lack sufficient capacity to safely reopen their economies.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has been accused of using another White House coronavirus task force briefing to broadcast a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise. The US president dimmed the lights and played two selectively edited videos on screens behind the briefing room podium featuring Cuomo, whose state has been hardest hit by the deadly pandemic. \u201cWhat the federal government did, working with states ... was a phenomenal accomplishment,\u201d the governor said in the first clip. \u201cThese were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilisation, and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner, and I\u2019m the first to say it. We needed help and they were there.\u201d But the films were played just two days after Cuomo, who has emerged as one of the most prominent Democrats during the crisis, eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. \u201cFirst of all, if he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. \u201cSecond, let\u2019s keep emotion and politics out of this and personal ego if we can because this is about the people and our job and let\u2019s try to focus on that.\u201d Cuomo acknowledged that Trump had moved quickly to increase hospital capacity, but said he was wrong to claim the city\u2019s Javits Center, a convention facility converted to a hospital, had not been used, pointing out that 800 people had gone through. The projected number of patients \u201cwere the president\u2019s projections\u201d, he added. Exasperated, Cuomo went on: \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t want to help on testing. I said 11 times, I said the one issue we need help with is testing. He said 11 times: \u2018I don\u2019t want to get involved in testing, it\u2019s too complicated, it\u2019s too hard.\u2019 I know it\u2019s too complicated and too hard. That\u2019s why we need help. I can\u2019t do an international supply chain. \u201cHe wants to say: \u2018Well I did enough.\u2019 Yeah, none of us have done enough. We haven\u2019t, because it\u2019s not over ... We have a lot more to do and no one can do the posture of \u2018Just say thank you for what I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m now out, I\u2019m not doing anything else. I\u2019ve done my part.\u2019\u201d The pair of New Yorkers exchanged barbs on Twitter but, at Sunday\u2019s briefing, Trump was only eager to bask in Cuomo\u2019s praise. After the first video was shown, he chided his staff: \u201cThey left out the good part. Good job, fellas ... You want to put the rest of it up, or do you not have it?\u201d He added: \u201cI just think it\u2019s so good for people because it\u2019s bipartisan. This is not about Democrats, Republicans. This is about a thing that hit our country, the likes of which has never happened to us before.\u201d The second clip was duly played later in the briefing. And earlier Trump had read aloud from a Wall Street Journal column praising him. A CNN reporter asked, with more than 22 million Americans unemployed and the death toll now above 40,000, \u201cis this really the time for self-congratulations?\u201d. Trump retorted: \u201cYou\u2019re CNN, you\u2019re fake news ... You don\u2019t have the brains you were born with.\u201d Media reports suggest Trump is ready to transition from crisis mode to a new phase focused on economic recovery and his re-election. For his part, Cuomo issued two pointed tweets on Sunday evening. One said: \u201c\u2018Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.\u2019 \u2014 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\u201d The other thanked health care, hospital and nursing home workers, and said: \u201cYou are heroes. #NewYorkTough.\u201d Trump\u2019s publicity stunt also drew direct criticism. Walter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, tweeted: \u201cBeyond being another taxpayer-funded campaign ad, this video clip also makes Trump look exceedingly weak. The video casts Cuomo as Trump\u2019s boss giving him a performance appraisal. (If only!).\u201d The president also sought to downplay the national testing shortage, despite governors\u2019 complaints that they lack sufficient capacity to safely reopen their economies. And he became visibly angry when questioned why he had still been holding campaign rallies in February rather than warning Americans about the virus. Challenged repeatedly by Weijia Jiang of CBS News, he demanded: \u201cWho are you with? ... nice and easy, nice and easy, just relax ... Keep your voice down, please. Keep your voice down.\u201d Touting his partial travel restrictions on China, he insisted: \u201cYou should say, \u2018Thank you very much for good judgment.\u2019\u201d Away from the virus, Trump was questioned on whether he would consider pardoning allies Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, who were caught in the justice department\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cThe top of the FBI was scum,\u201d he complained bitterly. \u201cThey\u2019re human scum.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Residents in Nova Scotia are struggling for answers after a lone shooter killed 16 people, including a police officer, in the deadliest rampage in modern Canadian history. Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Sunday that Gabriel Wortman, a 51-year-old denturist, had been taken into custody but was later pronounced dead following a standoff at a gas station near the capital of Halifax. It was not clear how Wortman died but police later issued a statement saying that Nova Scotia\u2019s serious incident response team said it was investigating an event in which RCMP officers \u201cdischarg[ed] their firearms\u201d at a suspect. According to property records, Wortman owned and operated a denture clinic in the city of Dartmouth, across the water from Halifax. In 2014, he appeared in local media after donating dentures to a cancer survivor. Neighbours of Wortman, who owned three properties in Portapique, a small coastal community where the rampage appears to have begun on Saturday night, were shocked by the news. \u201cVery, very shocked to think that someone we\u2019ve known for so long, a good neighbour, a helpful neighbour, very kind, would ever think of doing such a tragedy,\u201d Lillian MacCormack told CTV News. \u201cWe never know what others go through in life that makes them make certain decisions,\u201d Scott Balser, a former classmate of Wortman, wrote on Facebook. \u201cI am by no means defending his actions this weekend.\u201d David George Crockett told the Toronto Sun that Wortman had once fixed his teeth at his home in Portapique. \u201cI\u2019m very surprised,\u201d Crockett said in a brief interview. \u201cI never thought he would do something like that. \u201cFrom what I knew of him, he was quiet, gentle and very easy to talk to \u2026. He was very nice. He kidded around a little bit. He seemed normal, not like someone who would do something like this.\u201d Tom Taggart, a lawmaker who represents the Portapique area in the municipality of Colchester, told the CBA he did not know Wortman well, but spoke to him a few times when he telephoned about municipal issues. He described knowing Wortman\u2019s \u201clovely big home\u201d in Portapique. He said Wortman owned a few other properties and was believed to divide his time between Portapique and his business in Dartmouth. A photograph of his high school year book said his future \u201cmay include being an RCMP officer\u201d. Police have not yet determined a clear motive for the shootings, but suggested the killings had a degree of premeditation and that Wortman acted alone. \u201cI believe at the beginning there was an initial motivation and then I think it turned to randomness,\u201d RCMP commissioner Brenda Lucki said on Sunday evening. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure and we\u2019re going to have to do a lot of work on finding the motivation ... a lot of background, profiling type of events and a lot of crime scene processing.\u201d She also said that police did not believe the incident was terror-related. One unusual detail was that Wortman was disguised as a police officer and had mocked up a car to make it look like a police vehicle. On Sunday morning, police in Nova Scotia tweeted out an image of the car that Wortman was believed to be using. \u201cThe fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,\u201d RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather said, adding that Wortman did not appear to know a number of the victims. On Sunday evening, police confirmed that constable Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the force, was among the victims. With the province already in lockdown in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus, police said the community would be hit hard by the attack. \u201cWhat has unfolded overnight and into this morning is incomprehensible and many families are experiencing the loss of a loved one,\u201d said commanding RCMP officer Lee Bergman. According to police, Wortman\u2019s rampage began shortly before midnight on Saturday in Portapique, culminating in a manhunt that lasted for more than 12 hours. Residents heard gunfire and began to see police gathering on the streets. They were then told to lock their doors and seek shelter in their basements. One woman said she had come across two burning police vehicles while out driving on Sunday morning. One man said he saw at least three separate fires but police did not confirm if the fires were related to Wortman. \u201cThere was one officer we could see on scene and then all of a sudden, he went running toward one of the burning vehicles,\u201d Darcy Sack told the CBC. \u201cWe heard gunshots,\u201d she said, adding that one police officer looked to have been injured. Following a chase along a busy highway, Wortman was apprehended around midday at a gas station in Enfield just outside the city of Halifax. Lisa and Laurie George, both residents of Portapique, told Global News in Halifax that at approximately 11pm on Saturday they saw flames nearby, eventually seeing three separate fires in the area. The couple said that a large group of police quickly arrived in response, followed by gunshots before RCMP told them to go home. Another neighbour told the Toronto Sun that he and Wortman had been friends until they fell out over a piece of property. The neighbour, who declined to give his name, said Wortman had burned an old shed that contained some property that belonged to the neighbour but declined to give any further details of the dispute.",

      "bodyText": "Queensland has reacted angrily to news that the New South Wales treasurer, Dominic Perrotet, is considering offering a rival rescue package to Virgin Australia, provided it moves its headquarters to the new airport being built at Badgerys Creek in western Sydney. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she would continue to fight to keep Virgin in Queensland because of its importance to the state\u2019s tourism industry. Queensland\u2019s state development minister, Cameron Dick, told NSW to \u201cback right off\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more dangerous than Queenslanders with their backs to the wall \u2026 we will stop at nothing to ensure the headquarters of Virgin remains in Queensland,\u201d Dick said. Queensland has offered the company $200m if it remains in Brisbane. Virgin\u2019s Bowen Hills headquarters has 1,200 workers and there are 5,000 Virgin employees in Queensland. Perrottet told Sky News on Sunday night the NSW government was considering offering support and pointing to the \u201caerotropolis\u201d being built at Badgerys Creek. \u201cVirgin should have their headquarters for both Virgin and Tiger in Sydney,\u201d Perrottet said. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, confirmed her state\u2019s interest on Monday morning. \u201cIf there are other opportunities [where] the NSW government can support businesses re-tooling or looking at other opportunities to set up their head office here in NSW, we are open to all of those things.\u201d Berejiklian said she would not provide any further detail on the possible move, including if NSW support would be contingent on the federal government also backing the bailout. \u201cI don\u2019t want to provide any more details than that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut just to say that as a government our focus remains very strongly on protecting jobs.\u201d Neither state is likely to be able to offer enough support unless help is forthcoming from the federal government, which has so far balked at bailing out one company. So far federal assistance to both Virgin Australia and Qantas has been limited to underwriting a very limited resumption of services. The Queensland offer is conditional on a $1.4bn injection from federal coffers that will not be forthcoming. The federal opposition has called on the Morrison government to bail out Virgin, saying that failure to do so could be even more expensive, as many of the employees would end up on jobseeker payments. Labor\u2019s spokesperson on transport, Catherine King, said Australia needed a strong two-airline policy. \u201c I cannot understand why Scott Morrison is so intransigent \u2013 16,000 people depend on Virgin,\u201d she said. Private equity outfits, namely BGH Capital, are rumoured to be circling Virgin, while Chinese players China Southern Airlines, East Airlines and Air China are reportedly considering a tilt. However, any prospective buyer is likely to keep its powder dry until the nation\u2019s second-largest airline enters voluntary administration to get the best deal possible.",

What determines whether it spreads to become a pandemic, like Sars-Cov-2, or burns out rapidly, in a remote location? What does \u201csuccess\u201d mean, in viral terms? These are questions on many peoples\u2019 minds, as they wonder what else might be out there. Could the next pandemic be 50 times as bad as this one? Is the lethality of viruses a grim lottery, with mere luck separating us from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/07/we-learned-four-valuable-lessons-from-ebola-they-can-help-us-fight-the-coronavirus\">something like Ebola</a> sweeping the Earth?</p> <p>In fact, viruses generally have to follow certain rules if they want to get ahead. Stealth is critical, because these pathogens are unable to thrive and reproduce alone. Instead, they invade host cells and rely on them to, first, decode their genetic information to produce components for new virus particles, next, assemble those components, and finally, release new viruses to infect more cells. If this process causes tissue damage that leads to organ failure, the virus risks perishing along with its host.</p> <p>That\u2019s why \u201cnightmare\u201d viruses \u2013 like those with 90% mortality \u2013 thankfully aren\u2019t always very successful. To survive and thrive, a virus must operate like a spy in enemy territory, skilled at passing its genetic material from cell to cell without alerting the host\u2019s immune response.</p> <p>Viruses responsible for mild to moderate respiratory infections frequently fall into this category. They include respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parainfluenza/index.html\">human parainfluenza viruses</a>, rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US estimates that adults have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/features/rhinoviruses/index.html\">two to three colds a year</a>, and children have even more, but colds pose little threat to people with healthy immune systems. As we now know only too well, Sars-Cov-2 is far more of a menace, because it can cause severe acute respiratory syndrome in some patients, which may lead to between <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30165-X/fulltext\">1% and 7%</a> mortality.</p> <p>A successful spy must be a master of disguise, and so it is with viruses: if they want to evade recognition by immune cells, they must change their protein coat frequently. This is achieved via tiny alterations in their genetic material called mutations. The Goldilocks principle applies here: if the mutations are too subtle, the viral coat will be easily identified by existing antibodies, whereas if they are too drastic they might simply inactivate the virus. The mutations that allow viruses to fly under the radar fall somewhere in between. Influenza viruses, which use rapidly evolving ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material, are experts at this game.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\">History teaches us</a> that influenza mutations can result in pandemics with millions of deaths, so we\u2019ve learned to keep a watchful eye on them. As flu evolves over the months, virologists respond by producing seasonal vaccines that remain effective \u2013 for a time, at least.</p> <p>Coronaviruses have RNA genomes too, but they are very large. That means that there are many more opportunities for mutations to go wrong \u2013 from the virus\u2019s point of view. As a result, they have developed a sort of \u201cproof-reading\u201d mechanism that edits out mutations \u2013 meaning that they change a lot less rapidly than flu does. This is good news for us, and for vaccine development. But we still need more information to determine just how long a vaccine might be effective for.</p> <p>How does a virus go on to achieve world domination? Getting from A to B is of the essence. Sars-Cov-2 rides droplets propelled by coughs and sneezes to board a new host. This is a more effective route of transmission than that used by non-respiratory viruses like Ebola, and its efficiency is increased if the virus particles are more stable and can survive on surfaces outside the body. This is why keeping a safe distance from each other and isolating patients is so useful in preventing new infections. Sars-Cov-2 also has a lipid-containing coat, so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/science-soap-kills-coronavirus-alcohol-based-disinfectants\">thorough handwashing with soap</a>, which breaks down fats, can stop it in its tracks.</p> <p>It should be increasingly clear that to end the pandemic and keep Covid-19 outbreaks to a minimum, we need to seriously upgrade our spyware.

We also need trained and well-equipped doctors and nurses to safely look after infected people, and scientists to help design effective treatments.</p> <p>We need to fund these heroes well, and keep their kit up to date, and we need structures and public health strategies in place to promote hygiene, contain outbreaks and prevent transmission.

      "bodyText": "Ed Newman walked to the podium with the calm confidence of a soldier and welcomed us with humility. His audience was 20 virology researchers preparing to lead groups in universities around the UK in 2016. Newman, then a Porton Down-based virologist for Public Health England, had seen more action than all of us combined. He shared photos of his travels in African villages ravaged by some of the most dangerous viruses that face humanity. Pop-up labs set up in tents, with \u201cclean\u201d areas on one side for DNA sequencing equipment to confirm virus infection, and patient areas to the other side, hosting beds with seriously ill people. Fascinating, how a tiny piece of genetic information wrapped in a protein coat can cause such devastation.

Some colleagues quote zombie apocalypse movies as inspiration for entering the field, and it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a certain macabre thrill in studying these terrible pathogens. But there are really only a few viruses able to kill us within days of infection. Newman spent much of his career hunting haemorrhagic fever viruses that fit that description: Ebola and Marburg are both contagious via contact with infected bodily fluids and cause bleeding and organ failure, with mortality rates of up to 90% and 88% respectively.

The advice has been drawn up by the Help for Heroes charity, initially for staff at the Nightingale emergency hospital that opened in east London this month, in the belief that NHS staff are experiencing levels of emotional intensity similar to that on the battlefield. Carole Betteridge, a former navy nurse who ran a field hospital at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, said the understanding of traumatic stress had changed dramatically over the past 20 years and lessons could be shared.

      "body": "<p>In the first week of March, New York\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thearmoryshow.com/\">Armory Show</a> opened on schedule, as it has done for the past 26 years. Despite coronavirus concerns, gallerists and collectors from across the globe packed Piers 90 and 94 on the West Side of Manhattan for <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/armory-show-2020-1794207\">one of the ritziest art fairs in the calendar</a>. Big sales were made \u2013 a painting by the superstar contemporary <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/market/price-check-2020-armory-show-1793946\">painter Kehinde Wiley went for $280,000</a> (\u00a3220,000) \u2013 and the organisers congratulated themselves on not surrendering to the fearmongers (\u201cNew Yorkers are strong,\u201d concluded the fair\u2019s director, Nicole Berry). Aside from the absence of air-kissing and the prevalence of hand sanitiser, it was hard to spot anything amiss.</p> <p>Only a month later, the Armory Show looks like the last days of the Roman Empire. Days after it closed, European countries had gone into lockdown. Art fairs elsewhere were <a href=\"https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/here-are-all-the-art-fairs-that-have-been-cancelled-or-postponed-due-to-coronavirus\">being cancelled by the dozen and auctions postponed</a>. By mid-March, galleries worldwide had locked their doors; haemorrhaging income, many started <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/drumbeat-of-steady-museum-layoffs-1826637\">furloughing or laying off staff</a>. New York itself has become the epicentre of the North American outbreak. And Pier 90 is now famous for a grimmer reason: it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/comfort-ship-new-york-coronavirus-failure-symbol\">where a US Navy hospital ship is moored</a>.</p> <p>There isn\u2019t a business worldwide that hasn\u2019t felt the virus\u2019s impact, with calamitous results for millions. And the art world has been far from immune. An industry that has become synonymous with hyper-connectedness and global mobility is now, like the rest of us, at a standstill. The art market is idling. The places where we experience art \u2013 <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/museum-lockdown-impact-survey-1827237\">from </a><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/museum-lockdown-impact-survey-1827237\">leading museums to the tiniest independent spaces</a> \u2013 are abruptly out of bounds. Many galleries are likely to go out of business; artists will lose livelihoods. A recent piece by the New York magazine art critic, Jerry Saltz, carried an apocalyptic headline: <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/how-the-coronavirus-will-transform-the-art-world.html\">The Last Days of the Art World</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aabb0282c1909095072ca5c13fee5e90d84a82bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aabb0282c1909095072ca5c13fee5e90d84a82bc/0_86_4366_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman wears a face mask while visiting the Armory Show in New York last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The last days before the lockdown \u2026 a woman wears a face mask while visiting the Armory Show in New York last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal moment,\u201d suggests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/16/tate-modern-director-frances-morris-interview\">Frances Morris, director of Tate Modern</a>, when we speak. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk in terms of before and after. The virus will change a lot of things for art.\u201d</p> <p>But what sort of changes, and what sort of things? Is there only emptiness on the horizon, or are there opportunities, too? And when we finally emerge, what will art \u2013 and, yes, the art world \u2013 look like?</p> <p>One glimmer of hope is that, though we can\u2019t see art in person, we seem hungry to access it by any means possible.

      "bodyText": "In the first week of March, New York\u2019s Armory Show opened on schedule, as it has done for the past 26 years. Despite coronavirus concerns, gallerists and collectors from across the globe packed Piers 90 and 94 on the West Side of Manhattan for one of the ritziest art fairs in the calendar. Big sales were made \u2013 a painting by the superstar contemporary painter Kehinde Wiley went for $280,000 (\u00a3220,000) \u2013 and the organisers congratulated themselves on not surrendering to the fearmongers (\u201cNew Yorkers are strong,\u201d concluded the fair\u2019s director, Nicole Berry). Aside from the absence of air-kissing and the prevalence of hand sanitiser, it was hard to spot anything amiss. Only a month later, the Armory Show looks like the last days of the Roman Empire. Days after it closed, European countries had gone into lockdown. Art fairs elsewhere were being cancelled by the dozen and auctions postponed. By mid-March, galleries worldwide had locked their doors; haemorrhaging income, many started furloughing or laying off staff. New York itself has become the epicentre of the North American outbreak. And Pier 90 is now famous for a grimmer reason: it\u2019s where a US Navy hospital ship is moored. There isn\u2019t a business worldwide that hasn\u2019t felt the virus\u2019s impact, with calamitous results for millions. And the art world has been far from immune. An industry that has become synonymous with hyper-connectedness and global mobility is now, like the rest of us, at a standstill. The art market is idling. The places where we experience art \u2013 from leading museums to the tiniest independent spaces \u2013 are abruptly out of bounds. Many galleries are likely to go out of business; artists will lose livelihoods. A recent piece by the New York magazine art critic, Jerry Saltz, carried an apocalyptic headline: The Last Days of the Art World. \u201cIt\u2019s a pivotal moment,\u201d suggests Frances Morris, director of Tate Modern, when we speak. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk in terms of before and after. The virus will change a lot of things for art.\u201d But what sort of changes, and what sort of things? Is there only emptiness on the horizon, or are there opportunities, too? And when we finally emerge, what will art \u2013 and, yes, the art world \u2013 look like? One glimmer of hope is that, though we can\u2019t see art in person, we seem hungry to access it by any means possible. Galleries have been experiencing record web traffic: visitors to the British Museum site soared in the early days of the crisis, while the Courtauld Gallery\u2019s virtual tour reported an astonishing 723% spike in visitors in mid-March. Every private gallery worth its salt has launched \u201conline viewing rooms\u201d. Even the blue-chip Art Basel Hong Kong fair went virtual after being forced to cancel the physical event. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d says Alison Cole, editor of industry bible the Art Newspaper. \u201cAfter talking about it for years, a lot of people are finally seizing the opportunity of online.\u201d Social media has been part of the art world for a while. But with physical galleries now empty it\u2019s suddenly the sole means for organisations to retain a connection to audiences. The most august institutions are revealing a more unbuttoned, down-to-earth side: the Royal Academy Twitter feed, previously full of earnest promos for RA events, has been taken over by an #RAdailydoodle challenge aimed at amateur artists (sample post: \u201cWho can draw us a thirsty ferret?\u201d). Other galleries are trialling similar projects \u2013 less top-down, more collaborative. Morris at Tate detects a deep shift: \u201cHaving a real conversation with real people is hugely exciting. I think it\u2019s partly because people are missing the social space of being in a museum. It\u2019s something we haven\u2019t always done enough.

      "body": "<p>The best review ever received by Elliott Gould \u2013 renowned actor and star of M*A*S*H and The Long Goodbye; not to mention, Ross and Monica\u2019s dad on Friends \u2013 was from Groucho Marx. The two of them had become close in the comedian\u2019s latter years \u2013 so close, Gould says, \u201che used to let me shave him\u201d. One day Marx asked Gould to change a lightbulb in his bedroom. Gould took off his shoes, stood on the bed and replaced the broken bulb. Marx told him: \u201cThat was the best acting I\u2019ve ever seen you do.\u201d</p> <p>Gould, now 81, has been telling the story for decades \u2013 but it is clear even in our pixelated video call that it still delights him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great?\u201d he says, his distinctive nasal, New York baritone now deepened with age. As we speak he is sitting at a computer at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles, relaxed in a blue hoodie, with a seemingly bottomless mug of coffee before him. In isolation on either side of the Atlantic, neither of us has anywhere to be. And after more than half a century in Hollywood, in which he went from leading man to exile and, eventually, fixture \u2013 Gould could fill days, not just hours, with his stories. Even without his eight-year marriage to Barbra Streisand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9fc012f09c74f383ec15065811ebb4baa90a98b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9fc012f09c74f383ec15065811ebb4baa90a98b/0_0_3504_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould as \u2018Trapper\u2019 McIntyre (right) with Donald Sutherland\u2019s Hawkeye in M*A*S*H.

Gould plays an epidemiologist based on the real-life expert Dr Ian Lipkin of Columbia University, who consulted on the film.

Gould admits his thinking is \u201cnot always linear\u201d. Some memories take time to retrieve: \u201cI flush it out as we\u2019re talking.\u201d But once they emerge, they are precise, both in detail and dialogue, such as his \u201clittle date\u201d with Elvis.</p> <p>Back in the 70s, Gould asked to meet Presley in his Las Vegas dressing room. They were at close quarters, Gould recalls, made all the more so by the conspicuous, gilded .45 automatic in Elvis\u2019s belt and the watchful presence of his manager, Tom \u201cThe Colonel\u201d Parker, as well as the singer\u2019s father, Vernon. It was clear to Gould that they would not let their \u201ccash cow\u201d out of their sight and he said so, urging Presley to \u201cleave \u2018Elvis\u2019 here and come out, be a free spirit\u201d. \u201cElvis says to me, with his gold gun in his belt: \u2018You\u2019re crazy, man.\u2019 I said: \u2018Elvis, I ain\u2019t crazy. I\u2019m scared, just like you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Gould was born Elliott Goldstein in Brooklyn in 1938, the only child of Bernard and Lucille \u2013 non-orthodox, working-class Jews. Their marriage was troubled (they eventually divorced after 27 years), but they were ambitious for their son, putting him through stage school.</p> <p>He was a shy, fearful child, who loved to get lost in radio dramas, Sherlock Holmes stories and Pinocchio, but struggled to express himself. His parents worried that he was slow to develop. One of his earliest memories is being told, when he was two: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to feel, and you don\u2019t know how to think, and we\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c7d08b69452ec5f06df267d48dd748e60f23df0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c7d08b69452ec5f06df267d48dd748e60f23df0/0_0_1743_1300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Close to a perfect picture\u2019 ...

When I wept, he did not treat me like a baby and he got through to me.\u201d Later, the teacher gave him a copy of Webster\u2019s dictionary, to which he still routinely refers.</p> <p>In 1957, aged 19, Gould made his Broadway debut in the musical Rumple, at the Alvin theatre. \u201cIt smelled great,\u201d Gould remembers, inhaling the memory. \u201cI could go to the theatre and feel I have some place where I belong.\u201d A few small parts followed. Then, in 1961, he was cast as the leading man in the musical I Can Get It For You Wholesale, \u201cwhich was so unlikely!\u201d he says, with feeling. He sat in on the final audition of the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Barbra Streisand. Gould says he saw elements of himself in her, that same inhibition from childhood: \u201cShe presents herself the way I feel about myself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49ce60e60097d1ecaae2e3c19a12254253e42719\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49ce60e60097d1ecaae2e3c19a12254253e42719/0_58_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Part of the stellar gang in Ocean\u2019s Eleven.

Gould goes quiet and I wonder if our video connection has cut out. Then he says: \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, are you kidding?\u201d After her audition, Streisand gave him her phone number aloud; Gould memorised it, and called her. Streisand invited him to see her sing but he declined. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re so good, I think you\u2019re going to be in the show \u2013 we\u2019ll see if we get to know one another then.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Streisand was cast as Gould\u2019s character\u2019s secretary, Miss Marmelstein; the part was enlarged to do her justice. Shortly after the play closed in early 1963, after a stellar run of 300 performances, the pair married. A year later Streisand was the toast of the business in Funny Girl, with an album at No 1. Gould has likened their marriage to both a souffle and a \u201cbath of lava\u201d. Streisand has been working on a book for some time, says Gould, and will often call him to draw on his recollections. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t spin. It\u2019s so precious to me, that it has to be absolutely right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9706d80de5d9b361fa13ee816fb41409c5304f4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9706d80de5d9b361fa13ee816fb41409c5304f4b/0_80_2528_1517/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould with Barbra Streisand and Jack Kruschen in the 1962 Broadway play I Can Get it For You Wholesale.

They divorced in 1971, five years after the birth of their son Jason and following a two-year separation. Streisand later called Gould to ask why they had grown apart. He told her: \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow together, and you made yourself more important than us, and all I care about is us. We made it very fast, and no one has what we have.\u201d But, today Gould says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t play the part. I had to be able to find myself, to be able to be myself. I couldn\u2019t let myself live in a mould.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, Gould starred in Paul Mazursky\u2019s wife-swap comedy Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice. His performance secured him his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. A string of hits followed: Robert Altman\u2019s M*A*S*H, in which Gould cast himself as Trapper John McIntyre, and the student protest film Getting Straight. It was around this time that he got his second-best review \u2013 from Muhammad Ali, who told him: \u201cYou do what you do as well as I do what I do.\u201d</p> <p>In 1970, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as \u201cthe star for an uptight age\u201d for his (as he explains it now) \u201cunexpected success\u201d at a time of political upheaval. Later I ask him if the current US administration causes him some distress. \u201c<em>Some</em> distress? Oh my goodness,\u201d he replies, pulling his hands down over his eyes theatrically. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that and it\u2019s not just him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d715129e9c45e1afbd5c97a519d147f76000e9c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d715129e9c45e1afbd5c97a519d147f76000e9c7/0_97_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gould, Natalie Wood, Robert Culp and Dyan Cannon in Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice.

He says he intends to study politics more, though he seems to avoid talking about it where possible. Shooting the 2013 television drama Ray Donovan with Jon Voight, a Trump supporter, Gould told him: \u201cNo politics, Jon.\u201d (When they work together \u201cit can be like Laurel and Hardy on acid,\u201d he adds.) He recalls a similarly loaded phone conversation with Jack Nicholson, who said to him: \u201cI love being American, Ell.\u201d Gould agreed, making reference to Canada and Mexico. Nicholson shouted back: \u201cNo, no, no! Just America!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought: \u2018Gee, that\u2019s rather Trumpish, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Diversity is essential to me. It\u2019s essential to all of us.\u201d</p> <p>In 1971, Gould was still cresting the wave and had just returned from Sweden, where he shot The Touch: the first English-language film for legendary director Ingmar Bergman. The director has largely dismissed the picture, but Gould was honoured to be chosen as his first non-Scandinavian leading man and sees working with the demanding director as a transformative moment. He recalls: \u201cBergman said to me, outside a 2,000-year-old church near Stockholm: \u2018You\u2019ve gone beyond your limits and you\u2019ll have to live more to understand what you\u2019ve done.\u2019 \u201cAt that moment, I didn\u2019t know limits.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51bc1761100c2d3587f4642efc2fef9f4a28edbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51bc1761100c2d3587f4642efc2fef9f4a28edbb/0_0_1850_2732/677.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018As much as I love to win, I hate losing more\u2019 ...

The 1974 drama California Split, said by some to be the best film about gambling ever made, was semi-autobiographical. Decades later, spending time in casinos for Ocean\u2019s Eleven, Gould says he realised those days were behind him: \u201cAs much as I love to win, I hate losing more, and there\u2019s nothing I need that I can win.\u201d</p> <p>He has always denied ever having had a drug problem: on national television, in 1988; on the phone to Streisand (his response, in summary: \u201cBullshit\u201d); and to me. \u201cI had a reality problem,\u201d is his oft-repeated quip. \u201cOf course I smoked marijuana. I don\u2019t do that now, because I\u2019m centred and balanced and I don\u2019t want to alter that.\u201d As for \u201cmind-expanding drugs\u201d \u2013 mescaline, psilocybin, acid \u2013 Gould says: \u201cI had some experience with that and did some work behind it.\u201d He remembers telling Bergman (then in his 50s) about it. \u201cHe said it was interesting to him, but that he felt he did not want to do it at that time.\u201d Was that experimentation part of his pushing back against directors? \u201cNo. No. No! But still, I saw too much \u2013 I knew too much.\u201d</p> <p>After making The Touch, Gould says he \u201cshould have stayed out of work for a while\u201d. Instead, in 1971, he took on A Glimpse of Tiger as co-producer and star. The film was never made (though it was later retooled as What\u2019s Up, Doc?, starring Streisand), but its story is infamous. Just five days in, production was shut down, following reports of Gould\u2019s erratic behaviour and power struggles. His co-star Kim Darby was so frightened of him that security was hired. Gould says now that he tried to reassure Darby that he was \u201creally very sweet\u201d and that she could ask for \u201ctime out\u201d at any time \u2013 \u201cbut it couldn\u2019t work that way\u201d. Of his attempt to undermine the director, Anthony Harvey, he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t communicate and I behaved very badly.\u201d</p> <p>Gould says he was \u201cnot sufficiently developed\u201d to harness his newfound vision and naive about the demands of a production. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t compromise. I couldn\u2019t. And I had to find out for myself, taking a chance, not knowing if I would ever get back. It\u2019s pretty fabulous, to take the chance \u2026 and not be enslaved to one\u2019s success,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "The best review ever received by Elliott Gould \u2013 renowned actor and star of M*A*S*H and The Long Goodbye; not to mention, Ross and Monica\u2019s dad on Friends \u2013 was from Groucho Marx. The two of them had become close in the comedian\u2019s latter years \u2013 so close, Gould says, \u201che used to let me shave him\u201d. One day Marx asked Gould to change a lightbulb in his bedroom. Gould took off his shoes, stood on the bed and replaced the broken bulb. Marx told him: \u201cThat was the best acting I\u2019ve ever seen you do.\u201d Gould, now 81, has been telling the story for decades \u2013 but it is clear even in our pixelated video call that it still delights him. \u201cIsn\u2019t that great?\u201d he says, his distinctive nasal, New York baritone now deepened with age. As we speak he is sitting at a computer at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles, relaxed in a blue hoodie, with a seemingly bottomless mug of coffee before him. In isolation on either side of the Atlantic, neither of us has anywhere to be. And after more than half a century in Hollywood, in which he went from leading man to exile and, eventually, fixture \u2013 Gould could fill days, not just hours, with his stories. Even without his eight-year marriage to Barbra Streisand. In a prolific list of credits, Gould has no single iconic role. You might choose M*A*S*H, Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice or The Long Goodbye, but there are also Little Murders (\u201cclose to a perfect picture,\u201d says Gould), Capricorn One, American History X, the Ocean\u2019s 11 franchise \u2013 or Friends. (The week before our interview, Gould was due to reprise the role of Jack Gellar in Friends for HBO Max\u2019s long-awaited reunion special, but the pandemic delayed production.) Many have seen Gould more recently in Contagion, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 2011 medical thriller that has had a coronavirus-inspired resurgence. Gould plays an epidemiologist based on the real-life expert Dr Ian Lipkin of Columbia University, who consulted on the film. The pair remain friendly and Gould says Lipkin gave him advice on his plans to travel to Seattle and Italy: don\u2019t go. (The scientist was diagnosed with the virus shortly afterwards.) So Gould is \u201csequestering\u201d in his friend\u2019s house and happy to tell the story of his life, even if by way of many freewheeling divergences, from Netflix recommendations to gnomic theories on human nature. Gould admits his thinking is \u201cnot always linear\u201d. Some memories take time to retrieve: \u201cI flush it out as we\u2019re talking.\u201d But once they emerge, they are precise, both in detail and dialogue, such as his \u201clittle date\u201d with Elvis. Back in the 70s, Gould asked to meet Presley in his Las Vegas dressing room. They were at close quarters, Gould recalls, made all the more so by the conspicuous, gilded .45 automatic in Elvis\u2019s belt and the watchful presence of his manager, Tom \u201cThe Colonel\u201d Parker, as well as the singer\u2019s father, Vernon. It was clear to Gould that they would not let their \u201ccash cow\u201d out of their sight and he said so, urging Presley to \u201cleave \u2018Elvis\u2019 here and come out, be a free spirit\u201d. \u201cElvis says to me, with his gold gun in his belt: \u2018You\u2019re crazy, man.\u2019 I said: \u2018Elvis, I ain\u2019t crazy. I\u2019m scared, just like you.\u2019\u201d Gould was born Elliott Goldstein in Brooklyn in 1938, the only child of Bernard and Lucille \u2013 non-orthodox, working-class Jews. Their marriage was troubled (they eventually divorced after 27 years), but they were ambitious for their son, putting him through stage school. He was a shy, fearful child, who loved to get lost in radio dramas, Sherlock Holmes stories and Pinocchio, but struggled to express himself. His parents worried that he was slow to develop. One of his earliest memories is being told, when he was two: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to feel, and you don\u2019t know how to think, and we\u2019ll tell you.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was a difference between thinking and feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I realise, because I\u2019ve been able to understand myself, and having been afraid for so long \u2013 I didn\u2019t want them to think I was stupid.\u201d Yet he also credits them with his success: \u201cMy mother never gave up \u2013 I have no choice, I have to be this way.\u201d As a young boy he did not enjoy performing, but it brought him out of his shell. \u201cI thought that if I memorised routines, perhaps I could be able to communicate.\u201d His tap dance teacher made a particular impression on the 12-year-old Gould. \u201cHe just pounded me mentally. When I wept, he did not treat me like a baby and he got through to me.\u201d Later, the teacher gave him a copy of Webster\u2019s dictionary, to which he still routinely refers. In 1957, aged 19, Gould made his Broadway debut in the musical Rumple, at the Alvin theatre. \u201cIt smelled great,\u201d Gould remembers, inhaling the memory. \u201cI could go to the theatre and feel I have some place where I belong.\u201d A few small parts followed. Then, in 1961, he was cast as the leading man in the musical I Can Get It For You Wholesale, \u201cwhich was so unlikely!\u201d he says, with feeling. He sat in on the final audition of the \u201cbrilliant\u201d Barbra Streisand. Gould says he saw elements of himself in her, that same inhibition from childhood: \u201cShe presents herself the way I feel about myself.\u201d I interject: did he fancy her? Gould goes quiet and I wonder if our video connection has cut out. Then he says: \u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, are you kidding?\u201d After her audition, Streisand gave him her phone number aloud; Gould memorised it, and called her. Streisand invited him to see her sing but he declined. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re so good, I think you\u2019re going to be in the show \u2013 we\u2019ll see if we get to know one another then.\u2019\u201d Streisand was cast as Gould\u2019s character\u2019s secretary, Miss Marmelstein; the part was enlarged to do her justice. Shortly after the play closed in early 1963, after a stellar run of 300 performances, the pair married. A year later Streisand was the toast of the business in Funny Girl, with an album at No 1. Gould has likened their marriage to both a souffle and a \u201cbath of lava\u201d. Streisand has been working on a book for some time, says Gould, and will often call him to draw on his recollections. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t spin. It\u2019s so precious to me, that it has to be absolutely right.\u201d Gould\u2019s picture of their marriage has Streisand putting her career above their family life and him rebelling against the limits of it. They divorced in 1971, five years after the birth of their son Jason and following a two-year separation. Streisand later called Gould to ask why they had grown apart. He told her: \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow together, and you made yourself more important than us, and all I care about is us. We made it very fast, and no one has what we have.\u201d But, today Gould says: \u201cI couldn\u2019t play the part. I had to be able to find myself, to be able to be myself. I couldn\u2019t let myself live in a mould.\u201d In 1969, Gould starred in Paul Mazursky\u2019s wife-swap comedy Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice. His performance secured him his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor. A string of hits followed: Robert Altman\u2019s M*A*S*H, in which Gould cast himself as Trapper John McIntyre, and the student protest film Getting Straight. It was around this time that he got his second-best review \u2013 from Muhammad Ali, who told him: \u201cYou do what you do as well as I do what I do.\u201d In 1970, he appeared on the cover of Time magazine, hailed as \u201cthe star for an uptight age\u201d for his (as he explains it now) \u201cunexpected success\u201d at a time of political upheaval. Later I ask him if the current US administration causes him some distress. \u201cSome distress? Oh my goodness,\u201d he replies, pulling his hands down over his eyes theatrically. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that and it\u2019s not just him.\u201d He struggles to simplify his views: \u201cI can\u2019t even get an acceptable definition in my Webster\u2019s dictionary.\u201d But as a unionist, an idealist and a devout Jew, he believes \u201cit\u2019s all of us together, or none of us\u201d. He says he intends to study politics more, though he seems to avoid talking about it where possible. Shooting the 2013 television drama Ray Donovan with Jon Voight, a Trump supporter, Gould told him: \u201cNo politics, Jon.\u201d (When they work together \u201cit can be like Laurel and Hardy on acid,\u201d he adds.) He recalls a similarly loaded phone conversation with Jack Nicholson, who said to him: \u201cI love being American, Ell.\u201d Gould agreed, making reference to Canada and Mexico. Nicholson shouted back: \u201cNo, no, no! Just America!\u201d \u201cI thought: \u2018Gee, that\u2019s rather Trumpish, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Diversity is essential to me. It\u2019s essential to all of us.\u201d In 1971, Gould was still cresting the wave and had just returned from Sweden, where he shot The Touch: the first English-language film for legendary director Ingmar Bergman. The director has largely dismissed the picture, but Gould was honoured to be chosen as his first non-Scandinavian leading man and sees working with the demanding director as a transformative moment. He recalls: \u201cBergman said to me, outside a 2,000-year-old church near Stockholm: \u2018You\u2019ve gone beyond your limits and you\u2019ll have to live more to understand what you\u2019ve done.\u2019 \u201cAt that moment, I didn\u2019t know limits.\u201d He was a bankable star, with a tendency to push back against authority. \u201cI can be very aggressive, or equally shy and repressed.\u201d He was also at times a compulsive gambler. The 1974 drama California Split, said by some to be the best film about gambling ever made, was semi-autobiographical. Decades later, spending time in casinos for Ocean\u2019s Eleven, Gould says he realised those days were behind him: \u201cAs much as I love to win, I hate losing more, and there\u2019s nothing I need that I can win.\u201d He has always denied ever having had a drug problem: on national television, in 1988; on the phone to Streisand (his response, in summary: \u201cBullshit\u201d); and to me. \u201cI had a reality problem,\u201d is his oft-repeated quip. \u201cOf course I smoked marijuana. I don\u2019t do that now, because I\u2019m centred and balanced and I don\u2019t want to alter that.\u201d As for \u201cmind-expanding drugs\u201d \u2013 mescaline, psilocybin, acid \u2013 Gould says: \u201cI had some experience with that and did some work behind it.\u201d He remembers telling Bergman (then in his 50s) about it. \u201cHe said it was interesting to him, but that he felt he did not want to do it at that time.\u201d Was that experimentation part of his pushing back against directors? \u201cNo. No. No! But still, I saw too much \u2013 I knew too much.\u201d After making The Touch, Gould says he \u201cshould have stayed out of work for a while\u201d. Instead, in 1971, he took on A Glimpse of Tiger as co-producer and star. The film was never made (though it was later retooled as What\u2019s Up, Doc?, starring Streisand), but its story is infamous. Just five days in, production was shut down, following reports of Gould\u2019s erratic behaviour and power struggles. His co-star Kim Darby was so frightened of him that security was hired. Gould says now that he tried to reassure Darby that he was \u201creally very sweet\u201d and that she could ask for \u201ctime out\u201d at any time \u2013 \u201cbut it couldn\u2019t work that way\u201d. Of his attempt to undermine the director, Anthony Harvey, he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t communicate and I behaved very badly.\u201d Gould says he was \u201cnot sufficiently developed\u201d to harness his newfound vision and naive about the demands of a production. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t compromise. I couldn\u2019t. And I had to find out for myself, taking a chance, not knowing if I would ever get back. It\u2019s pretty fabulous, to take the chance \u2026 and not be enslaved to one\u2019s success,\u201d he says. But the financial toll on Gould was significant and the fallout so disastrous that he was considered unfit to work for two years. In 1973, M*A*S*H director Altman threw Gould a lifeline, casting him as Philip Marlowe in his updating of The Long Goodbye. \u201cAltman says: \u2018You are this guy,\u2019\u201d says Gould, exhaling as though he still can\u2019t believe his luck. The studio insisted that he take a psychiatric test, as well as the standard physical. Gould says Altman\u2019s faith extended to allowing him to improvise a scene where Marlowe paints his face with inky fingerprints at a police station. \u201cIt exhibited the confidence and trust that Altman had in me, because it would have taken 25 minutes to clean me up.\u201d The same year he married the actor Jenny Bogart. They went on to have two children \u2013 and two divorces. \u201cJenny married me three times,\u201d says Gould. Though they are no longer living together, he says he \u201cwill be married to Jenny for ever \u2013 until she can do better\u201d. Gould\u2019s likably loopy Marlowe trumps Humphrey Bogart and Dick Powell for many \u2013 but to an entire generation he is Mr Geller from Friends. He almost didn\u2019t take the part \u2013 \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much in it for me\u201d \u2013 but wound up doing 22 episodes in the show\u2019s 236-episode run. He remembers it as a \u201cvery good experience\u201d and feels fortunate to be part of its enduring success. Oddly, as Friends reruns onwards into the future, it may come to define a 50-year career that, Gould does not deny, has had highs and lows. Looking back, Gould says it would be \u201cdisloyal\u201d to other crew members to regret any film he has worked on. \u201cSometimes things work, sometimes things don\u2019t work, and we learn from it.\u201d Even the 1978 Matilda, playing opposite a man in a cheap and unsettling kangaroo suit?

The drop in consumer spending has already forced several struggling retailers including Debenhams, Oasis, Warehouse and Laura Ashley to call in the administrators since the shutdown began. The data firm Markit\u2019s survey of UK purchasing managers, due on Thursday, is likely to show that output across the economy slumped in April, faster than in the depths of the financial crisis in 2008-09. The CEBR predicts the pandemic will cause the deepest recession since the financial crisis, with unemployment more than doubling, after businesses had to temporarily close as a result of lockdown restrictions and cutting costs to preserve cash. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates up to 2.1m people could lose their jobs in the second quarter, and data from the Department for Work and Pensions showed 950,000 people applied for universal credit in the second half of March.

Speaking at the Beehive in Wellington, Ardern said New Zealand was in with a fighting chance of eliminating the disease, and the number of deaths was low enough that she still received a phone call for each one. \u201cWe have done what very few countries have been able to do. We have stopped a wave of devastation,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cOur transmission rate, the number of cases each person with the virus passes it onto, is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas the average is 2.5 people. We have amongst the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world.\u201d The prime minister said New Zealand had a \u201crelatively low proportion of serious cases\u201d, and according to the Oxford University coronavirus government response tracker, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. Overall 1,400 people have become infected with coronavirus in New Zealand, and 12 people have died, all older people with pre-existing health conditions.

The government\u2019s decision to conditionally ease restrictions from next Monday night has taken a middle path between those urging an immediate end to lockdown for the sake of the gasping economy, and those urging an extension to give the elimination strategy a fighting chance. Moving to level three overnight on Monday 27 April would see many more businesses able to trade, including those involved in takeaways and food deliveries, the construction sector and the forestry sector. The move to level three would have significant benefits for the economy, Ardern said. Social lives would largely be unchanged however, with Kiwis still urged to remain at home unless taking exercise or fetching supplies. \u201cBubbles\u201d could be marginally expanded, however, to include close family or those who might be alone or isolated in the community, she said. Schools would be open, but students should remain at home, if they could. Cabinet would make a decision whether level three lockdown would move to two on 11 May. New Zealand entered lockdown on 25 March, when there were fewer than 150 cases of the virus and no deaths. Lockdown has been widely complied with countrywide, despite stringent regulations, which have dictated Kiwis stay in their homes around the clock unless shopping for essentials such as food or medicine, or taking a brief respite of exercise within their neighbourhood. The first two weeks of lockdown saw widespread confusion as to what and wasn\u2019t permitted, and the health minister David Clark was demoted after flouting the rules and taking his family to a beach 20km from their home. There have been some isolated reports of lockdown parties, but overall police have praised Kiwis adherence to the rules. New Zealand is pursuing an elimination strategy and is one of few worldwide to do so, but has advantages in being able to completely shut down its borders, having a small number of cases, and cities that are not so densely packed as the likes of New York and London. Epidemiologists working on New Zealand\u2019s Covid-15 strategy urged the prime minister to stay the course and choose the conservative path, saying if the country came out of lockdown too soon, months of good work would be lost. Scientist Dr Michelle Dickinson, who participated in a press conference for children with the prime minister, praised the government\u2019s decision. \u201cWhile other countries show no sign of any control of Covid-19 I\u2019m so proud of NZ &amp; what we\u2019ve done as a nation,\u201d Dickinson said on Twitter. \u201cWe had some of the toughest lockdown rules in the world, but today we can be optimistic about coming out of it on Monday &amp; feeling safe that this is the right decision\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Fake news comes home to White House</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with the situation report as of this Monday morning.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has continued to veer towards using the White House briefing room as a newsroom for dubious campaign messages. A few hours ago the president \u2013 at what was supposed to be a coronavirus task force briefing \u2013 broadcast two <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/trump-plays-misleading-clips-of-support-from-cuomo-at-coronavirus-briefing\">selectively edited and somewhat out of date videos</a> featuring the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, appearing to shower him with praise. In fact, two days ago Cuomo eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks for \u201csitting home watching TV\u201d during the crisis and placing emotion, politics and \u201cpersonal ego\u201d ahead of doing his job.</p> \n<p>The heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies have warned of the risk of coronavirus to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors have pledged around a quarter of the $2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response. In an open letter shared before publication with the Guardian, the most senior emergencies, health and development officials warn that help for the world\u2019s weakest countries is in everyone\u2019s interest, \u201cto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/20/un-heads-warn-of-coronavirus-risk-in-weakest-countries\">stop the virus from spreading unchecked, destroying lives and economies, and continuing to circle around the world\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Oil prices have slumped to their lowest for two decades as doubts grew about Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of ending the US lockdown and investors braced for a week of potentially damaging figures about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">impact of the coronavirus on the world economy</a>. The price of US crude oil plunged almost 20%, to below $15, in early trading on Monday \u2013 its lowest point since 1999 \u2013 as stockpiles continued to build owing to a crash in demand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n<p>It is predicted British households will have \u00a343bn less cash available for essential spending between April and June, as the UK slides into its deepest recession in decades. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research it equates to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/british-households-face-disposable-income-fall-of-515-per-month\">monthly fall of \u00a3515 per household</a>. UK retail sales are expected to have fallen by up to 10% in March. Nearly 80% of workers facing job insecurity right now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/uk-workers-without-degrees-face-deeper-job-insecurity-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">do not have a university degree</a>, according to new research by the consultancy firm McKinsey. \u201cShort-term job risk is highly correlated with level of education, potentially exacerbating existing social inequalities,\u201d McKinsey said. The warning comes as the government starts accepting applications for support from firms that have furloughed staff.</p> \n<p>Globally the death toll is approaching 165,000, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center while the total number of infections worldwide has exceeded 2,394,000. US deaths have passed 40,000,<strong> </strong>with more than 755,000 infections. Italy has said that deaths from the coronavirus pandemic rose by 433 on Sunday, the lowest daily tally in a week.

It is the worst act of mass murder the country has seen in modern times. A police officer was among the dead. Officials said the gunman, named as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/nova-scotia-shooting-gunman-profile-quiet-gentle-denturist\">Gabriel Wortman, a denturist aged 51</a>, also died after shooting people in several locations. Authorities said Wortman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/portapique-shooting-nova-scotia-rcmp-canada\">drove what appeared to be a police car</a> but was actually an SUV disguised as one. \u201cToday is a devastating day for Nova Scotia and it will remain etched in the minds of many for years to come,\u201d said Lee Bergman, commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Invasive beyond reason\u2019 \u2013 </strong>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have written to the main tabloid editors to say they will never again deal with their journalists,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/20/harry-and-meghan-uk-tabloids-duke-duchess-sussex-sun-daily-mail\"> in an unprecedented attack</a> on a large part of the media that leaves little chance of repairing an already fractured relationship with the press. Harry and Meghan sent a letter to the editors of the Sun, Daily Mail, Mirror and Express outlining a policy of \u201czero engagement\u201d except when necessary through the couple\u2019s lawyers. They said they refused to \u201coffer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion\u201d and accused the outlets of running stories that are \u201cdistorted, false, or invasive beyond reason\u201d. Meghan is due to take on the Mail on Sunday in a court hearing on Friday after it printed a letter she sent to her estranged father.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>What\u2019s the secret of coronavirus\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in spreading itself around the world? A host of factors determines whether a virus survives and thrives in humans \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-master-of-disguise-scientists-viruses-covid-19\">Sars-Cov-2 struck it lucky</a>, writes Dr Zania Stamataki, a senior lecturer in viral immunology.</p> \n<p>Carol Ann Duffy, the former poet laureate, has launched an international poetry project with other poets, including Imtiaz Dharker and Ian McMillan, as a response to coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Fake news comes home to White House Hello, Warren Murray with the situation report as of this Monday morning. Donald Trump has continued to veer towards using the White House briefing room as a newsroom for dubious campaign messages. A few hours ago the president \u2013 at what was supposed to be a coronavirus task force briefing \u2013 broadcast two selectively edited and somewhat out of date videos featuring the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, appearing to shower him with praise. In fact, two days ago Cuomo eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks for \u201csitting home watching TV\u201d during the crisis and placing emotion, politics and \u201cpersonal ego\u201d ahead of doing his job. The heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies have warned of the risk of coronavirus to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors have pledged around a quarter of the $2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response. In an open letter shared before publication with the Guardian, the most senior emergencies, health and development officials warn that help for the world\u2019s weakest countries is in everyone\u2019s interest, \u201cto stop the virus from spreading unchecked, destroying lives and economies, and continuing to circle around the world\u201d. Oil prices have slumped to their lowest for two decades as doubts grew about Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of ending the US lockdown and investors braced for a week of potentially damaging figures about the impact of the coronavirus on the world economy. The price of US crude oil plunged almost 20%, to below $15, in early trading on Monday \u2013 its lowest point since 1999 \u2013 as stockpiles continued to build owing to a crash in demand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is predicted British households will have \u00a343bn less cash available for essential spending between April and June, as the UK slides into its deepest recession in decades. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research it equates to a monthly fall of \u00a3515 per household. UK retail sales are expected to have fallen by up to 10% in March. Nearly 80% of workers facing job insecurity right now do not have a university degree, according to new research by the consultancy firm McKinsey. \u201cShort-term job risk is highly correlated with level of education, potentially exacerbating existing social inequalities,\u201d McKinsey said. The warning comes as the government starts accepting applications for support from firms that have furloughed staff. Globally the death toll is approaching 165,000, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center while the total number of infections worldwide has exceeded 2,394,000. US deaths have passed 40,000, with more than 755,000 infections. Italy has said that deaths from the coronavirus pandemic rose by 433 on Sunday, the lowest daily tally in a week. The British government will charter flights to repatriate the most vulnerable Britons stranded in New Zealand this week. Further coronavirus news as it comes to hand at our live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Mass shooting by police impostor \u2013 Canadian police have said 16 people were killed by a gunman in a 12-hour shooting rampage across Nova Scotia. It is the worst act of mass murder the country has seen in modern times. A police officer was among the dead. Officials said the gunman, named as Gabriel Wortman, a denturist aged 51, also died after shooting people in several locations. Authorities said Wortman drove what appeared to be a police car but was actually an SUV disguised as one. \u201cToday is a devastating day for Nova Scotia and it will remain etched in the minds of many for years to come,\u201d said Lee Bergman, commanding officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. * * * \u2018Invasive beyond reason\u2019 \u2013 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have written to the main tabloid editors to say they will never again deal with their journalists, in an unprecedented attack on a large part of the media that leaves little chance of repairing an already fractured relationship with the press. Harry and Meghan sent a letter to the editors of the Sun, Daily Mail, Mirror and Express outlining a policy of \u201czero engagement\u201d except when necessary through the couple\u2019s lawyers. They said they refused to \u201coffer themselves up as currency for an economy of clickbait and distortion\u201d and accused the outlets of running stories that are \u201cdistorted, false, or invasive beyond reason\u201d. Meghan is due to take on the Mail on Sunday in a court hearing on Friday after it printed a letter she sent to her estranged father. Coronavirus Extra What\u2019s the secret of coronavirus\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in spreading itself around the world? A host of factors determines whether a virus survives and thrives in humans \u2013 and Sars-Cov-2 struck it lucky, writes Dr Zania Stamataki, a senior lecturer in viral immunology. Carol Ann Duffy, the former poet laureate, has launched an international poetry project with other poets, including Imtiaz Dharker and Ian McMillan, as a response to coronavirus. Duffy hopes the project, Write Where We Are Now, can serve as a \u201cliving record\u201d of the times. Hands, Duffy\u2019s poem, was written on 26 March and sees the author reflecting on how every Thursday \u201cwe clap at the darkness\u201d, and on how she can see the hands of her absent daughter \u201cwhen I put my head in my own\u201d. Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans from the Help for Heroes charity have drawn up guidance and support to help NHS workers cope with PTSD from treating coronavirus patients. There is concern that NHS staff are experiencing levels of emotional intensity similar to that on the battlefield. Today in Focus podcast: Post-viral culture Three Guardian critics \u2013 Ammar Kalia, Laura Snapes and Sian Cain \u2013 join Rachel Humphreys with a guide to the best of television, music and books under lockdown. And what the future holds for the arts when conditions are lifted. Lunchtime read: Seeking Covid-19 answers in Wuhan Residents of the city where coronavirus first appeared are looking for an explanation from the government about its handling of what became a pandemic, writes Lily Kuo.

The PGA Tour hopes to take delivery of up to one million Covid-19 test kits to assist with the completion of its season from 11 June.

The news came as US deaths passed 40,000 on Sunday \u2013 nearly a quarter of the global total \u2013 with infections at just under 760,000, or just under a third of the world\u2019s total. The UK has more than 121,000 cases and 16,000 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>Trump turns Covid-19 briefing into \u2018campaign ad\u2019</strong></h2> <p>In a bad-tempered press briefing in which he clashed with several reporters, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/trump-plays-misleading-clips-of-support-from-cuomo-at-coronavirus-briefing\">Donald Trump was accused of broadcasting in effect a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d</a> in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise. He played selectively edited video clips just two days after Cuomo eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. Trump also criticised the restrictions put in place by some state leaders and again criticised the WHO and China over the pandemic but also said he was prepared to give Iran help to fight the virus. Domestically, he said a deal on aid for businesses was close to being agreed with the Democrats.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand plans to ease restrictions in a week</strong></h2> <p>The country\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/new-zealand-plans-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdown-in-a-week\">extended the country\u2019s level-4 lockdown for a week</a>, after which schools and daycare centres will be allowed to open, as well as some businesses barring major upsets. She warned New Zealanders to: \u201ckeep your bubble as small as possible \u2013 you can expand your bubble a small amount to include family members, vulnerable people or caregivers\u201d. The country\u2019s virus death toll stands at 12 and has introduced some of the strictest lockdown measures in the world, as it pursues and \u201celimination\u201d strategy with the virus.</p> <h2>UN sounds warning on emergency relief fund for vulnerable</h2> <p>The heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies have issued a graphic warning of the risk to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/20/un-heads-warn-of-coronavirus-risk-in-weakest-countries\">donors had pledged around a quarter of the $2bn the UN requested</a> for its emergency Covid-19 response in March.</p> <h2><strong>China reports just 12 new cases</strong></h2> <p>The number of new cases reported by the country in Monday is down from 16 a day earlier, with no new deaths for the third day in a row.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global cases pass 2.4 million, US deaths pass 40,000 There have now been more than 2.4m confirmed cases and 165,000 deaths from Covid-19 worldwide. The news came as US deaths passed 40,000 on Sunday \u2013 nearly a quarter of the global total \u2013 with infections at just under 760,000, or just under a third of the world\u2019s total. The UK has more than 121,000 cases and 16,000 deaths. Trump turns Covid-19 briefing into \u2018campaign ad\u2019 In a bad-tempered press briefing in which he clashed with several reporters, Donald Trump was accused of broadcasting in effect a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise. He played selectively edited video clips just two days after Cuomo eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. Trump also criticised the restrictions put in place by some state leaders and again criticised the WHO and China over the pandemic but also said he was prepared to give Iran help to fight the virus. Domestically, he said a deal on aid for businesses was close to being agreed with the Democrats. New Zealand plans to ease restrictions in a week The country\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has extended the country\u2019s level-4 lockdown for a week, after which schools and daycare centres will be allowed to open, as well as some businesses barring major upsets. She warned New Zealanders to: \u201ckeep your bubble as small as possible \u2013 you can expand your bubble a small amount to include family members, vulnerable people or caregivers\u201d. The country\u2019s virus death toll stands at 12 and has introduced some of the strictest lockdown measures in the world, as it pursues and \u201celimination\u201d strategy with the virus. UN sounds warning on emergency relief fund for vulnerable The heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies have issued a graphic warning of the risk to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors had pledged around a quarter of the $2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response in March. China reports just 12 new cases The number of new cases reported by the country in Monday is down from 16 a day earlier, with no new deaths for the third day in a row. There were also 49 new asymptomatic cases reported on Monday. On Friday China revised its death toll up significantly, including by 50% in Wuhan. Japanese expert \u2018very pessimistic\u2019 about Tokyo 2021 Speaking about the likelihood of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead next year, Kentaro Iwata, a professor at Kobe University Hospital, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the Olympics are likely to be held next year.

Five months ago, the 25-year-old Sri Lankan borrowed $1,400 (\u00a31,120) to pay recruiters to take him to the United Arab Emirates, where he got a job as cleaner at a five-star hotel. But since the coronavirus outbreak there are no longer any guests, so he no longer has work and the loan is going unpaid.</p> <p>\u201cI really need a job so I can repay it,\u201d he says. \u201cI also need to earn money to help my family. This is such a big problem.\u201d</p> <p>Bipul was earning AED 1,000 (\u00a3218) per month, working up to 11 hours a day, six days a week at the Pullman Hotel in Sharjah, which is managed by Accor, a French firm that owns several upscale international hotel chains.</p> <p>Bipul\u2019s final salary instalment and passport are being held by the company until flight restrictions are lifted and he can be put on a plane home, he says. Sending most of his earnings to Sri Lanka and living paycheque to paycheque, he is now stranded and penniless.</p> <p>Dulhara*, a Nepali in his 20s, is struggling to pay $2,500 of debts he incurred with Nepalese recruitment brokers who brought him to the UAE last year. Until he was placed at a job with Accor, the brokers made him live in a room with more than 20 other men, where he slept on a mattress on the floor and was given insufficient food. After that ordeal, he was desperate for life to improve.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m trapped,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel so sad and angry. But what can I do?\u201d</p> <p>The UAE is on lockdown and most hotels are shut, leaving very low paid migrant workers \u2013 mainly employed in the tourism, hospitality and construction sectors \u2013 stranded in the country with no prospect of earning. The Emirati government has allowed some repatriation flights for Asian migrant workers left jobless by the pandemic. However, some countries have refused to allow their citizens home, citing concerns over possible disease transmission, leaving workers struggling to survive without funds.</p> <p>\u201cThese are worrying reports. Given the already vulnerable position of migrant workers in the UAE, abrupt redundancies are likely to have a devastating effect,\u201d says May Romanos, Amnesty International\u2019s Gulf migrant rights\u2019 researcher. </p> <p>In accordance with UAE law, Accor is still providing its blue-collar migrant workers with food and accommodation. But in addition to their worry over debt, both Bipul and Dulhara say they are increasingly frightened their families back home will find paying for food difficult now they can\u2019t send money.</p> <p>\u201cNo redundancies have been made at Pullman Sharjah and Marjan Island Resort &amp; Spa as a result of the possible impact that Covid-19 is having on business levels,\u201d said Accor in a statement. The company did not respond to questions about salary levels and working conditions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/despite-coronavirus-its-business-as-usual-for-world-cup-workers-in-qatar\">Despite coronavirus, it's 'business as usual' for World Cup workers in Qatar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instances of coronavirus in the UAE are higher among migrant workers owing to their often <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/20/covid-19-lockdown-turns-qatars-largest-migrant-camp-into-virtual-prison\">cramped and communal living conditions</a>.

Several floors have been converted into makeshift dormitories, with up to six workers packed into each small bedroom.</p> <p>In Dulhara\u2019s room a series of single metal beds are positioned side by side. It is dark, the walls are bare, and the only other furniture is row of school-style lockers for the workers\u2019 belongings.

Sending most of his earnings to Sri Lanka and living paycheque to paycheque, he is now stranded and penniless. Dulhara*, a Nepali in his 20s, is struggling to pay $2,500 of debts he incurred with Nepalese recruitment brokers who brought him to the UAE last year. Until he was placed at a job with Accor, the brokers made him live in a room with more than 20 other men, where he slept on a mattress on the floor and was given insufficient food. After that ordeal, he was desperate for life to improve. \u201cI\u2019m trapped,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel so sad and angry. But what can I do?\u201d The UAE is on lockdown and most hotels are shut, leaving very low paid migrant workers \u2013 mainly employed in the tourism, hospitality and construction sectors \u2013 stranded in the country with no prospect of earning. The Emirati government has allowed some repatriation flights for Asian migrant workers left jobless by the pandemic. However, some countries have refused to allow their citizens home, citing concerns over possible disease transmission, leaving workers struggling to survive without funds. \u201cThese are worrying reports. Given the already vulnerable position of migrant workers in the UAE, abrupt redundancies are likely to have a devastating effect,\u201d says May Romanos, Amnesty International\u2019s Gulf migrant rights\u2019 researcher. In accordance with UAE law, Accor is still providing its blue-collar migrant workers with food and accommodation. But in addition to their worry over debt, both Bipul and Dulhara say they are increasingly frightened their families back home will find paying for food difficult now they can\u2019t send money. \u201cNo redundancies have been made at Pullman Sharjah and Marjan Island Resort &amp; Spa as a result of the possible impact that Covid-19 is having on business levels,\u201d said Accor in a statement. The company did not respond to questions about salary levels and working conditions. Instances of coronavirus in the UAE are higher among migrant workers owing to their often cramped and communal living conditions. The men interviewed said they are concerned they could become infected as social distancing is impossible. The hospitality workers are living in a high-rise tower near the luxury hotel they were working at. Several floors have been converted into makeshift dormitories, with up to six workers packed into each small bedroom. In Dulhara\u2019s room a series of single metal beds are positioned side by side. It is dark, the walls are bare, and the only other furniture is row of school-style lockers for the workers\u2019 belongings. Without money for cleaning products, they struggle to keep their living quarters sanitised. Bored, the men mainly stay in their rooms and play games on their phones to pass the time. \u201cI came here to fulfil my hopes,\u201d says Bipul. \u201cBut now everything is finished.\u201d",

Rossetti discovered her while walking down the Strand. He was struck by her auburn hair and declared she had the type of face he had been seeking for so long. He paid her a retainer to model for him alone and she posed for some of his finest works, including The Bower Meadow (1872). Image: Ricorditi di me Che Son la Pia (from Dante\u2019s Purgatorio), 1868, Dante Gabriel Rossetti (1828\u20131882), the Fitzwilliam Museum, 2:C - Monet took inspiration from his much-loved garden in Giverny, a village in Normandy, northern France. He first saw the garden in 1883 and was seduced by its flowering fruit trees. It was here that Monet created the beautiful ponds from which he painted the famous waterlilies. The house is now a museum. Monet depicts Suzanne Hosched\u00e9, the daughter of his then-mistress Alice (they would marry in 1892), seated with his son, Jean. Image: Springtime, 1886, Claude Monet (1840\u20131926), the Fitzwilliam Museum, 3:C - Although Degas is best remembered for his paintings, he made many small-scale sculptures of dancers, horses and bathers from wax and plastiline for his own pleasure and edification. After his death, around 70 were selected for reproduction as limited edition bronze casts. The Fitzwilliam owns three of Degas\u2019s original lifetime wax sculptures: the only ones in Britain. It also owns seven bronze edition casts, including this one, allocated in 2018. Image: Danse Espagnole (Spanish Dance), after 1931-before 1948, A.A. H\u00e9brard Foundry (active c1900-1937) and Edgar Degas (1834\u20131917), the Fitzwilliam Museum, 4:B - William Holman Hunt (1827\u20131910) was one of the founders of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. This is a study for the painting in Tate Britain, which represents the scene in Measure for Measure, where the novice nun, Isabella, tells her brother, Claudio, that she will not release him from the death penalty by sleeping with the corrupt judge Angelo. Image: Claudio and Isabella, 1850, William Holman Hunt (1827\u20131910), the Fitzwilliam Museum, 5:A - In 1818, Blake(1757-1827) met John Linnell, a young landscape and portrait painter who soon became one of his closest friends and supporters. He commissioned Blake to execute a series of watercolours on biblical and literary themes, notably The Book of Job, Dante\u2019s Divine Comedy and Milton. The Fitzwilliam owns a substantial archive related to John Linnell\u2019s life and work. Image: William Blake Wearing a Hat, c1825, John Linnell (1792\u20131882), the Fitzwilliam Museum, 6:B - The cornemuse is a French musical instrument very similar to the bagpipe. Couture was a French history painter and a student of Antoine-Jean Gros (1771\u20131835) and Paul Delaroche (1797\u20131856). He was distrustful of the academic institutions such as the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, but achieved huge success with his monumental Romans of the Decadence (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay) when it was exhibited at the Salon in 1847. It is now one of his best-known pictures. Image: Still Life with a Cornemuse, 19th century, Thomas Couture (1815\u20131879), the Fitzwilliam Museum, 7:C - This painting was, in fact, once owned by Edgar Degas. It was bought by the economist John Maynard Keynes at the sale of the artist\u2019s collection, held in Paris after his death in 1917. Returning from France by car, Keynes left it as a surprise in a hedge at Charleston, the house in Sussex rented by Vanessa Bell. Image: Still Life with Apples, c.1878, Paul Ce\u0301zanne (1839\u20131906), the Fitzwilliam Museum, 8:E - The son of an Italian barber, Giovanni Belzoni (1778\u20131823) performed as a strongman in fairs throughout Europe, during which time he became interested in hydraulics. In 1815, he travelled to Egypt, where he explored and uncovered many of the great sites of Egyptian antiquity. He published an account of his adventures in 1820, which he partly illustrated himself. In 1823, he gave the sarcophagus lid of Ramesses III to the Fitzwilliam Museum.

Bob Loughman, an MP from the island of Tanna, will become the next prime minister of the south Pacific nation, after defeating the former foreign minister Ralph Regenvanu in a vote in parliament on Monday, by 31 votes to 21. Loughman is the leader of the Vanua\u2019aku Pati \u2013 one of the oldest political parties in Vanuatu \u2013 which secured seven out of 52 seats in elections held on 19 March. Elections are held every four years in Vanuatu and it is extremely rare for a party to win a majority of seats, meaning that governments formed in the country are almost always a coalition of parties. Loughman has been in the Vanuatu parliament since 2004 and has previously served as minister for education and minister for trade and tourism. He also served as deputy prime minister for a period of time under the former prime minister Charlot Salwai. His coalition government will include two other major parties, as well as a raft of independents and micro-parties. Loughman\u2019s government will be required to hit the ground running, after a tumultuous month for the country, which has a population of nearly 300,000 people. The country declared a state of emergency in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic, restricting business activity and travel and imposing a curfew on residents. There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in the nation, but there are fears that were coronavirus to reach Vanuatu\u2019s shores, its health system would very quickly become overwhelmed. The country also bore the brunt of the passage of Tropical Cyclone Harold in April. The category-5 storm wreaked damage and destruction across much of the north of the island group and killed three people.

But amid threats by the publisher to refer potential criminal breaches to the Australian federal police, copyright law specialists said the company and the former prime minister might have a better chance of bringing a civil lawsuit. The uproar over the early distribution of Turnbull\u2019s memoirs \u2013 and the role of one of Scott Morrison\u2019s senior advisers \u2013 overshadowed the official release of the book on Monday. Labor blasted the behaviour as \u201cchildish\u201d and raised concern about the impact on workers within all tiers of the publishing industry. The adviser, Nico Louw, was reported on Sunday to have apologised for sending unauthorised copies of Turnbull\u2019s memoir, A Bigger Picture, to 59 acquaintances, while the prime minister\u2019s office said staff members had been \u201creminded of their obligations under copyright law, and of the high standards of conduct expected of them\u201d. Lawyers for Turnbull and the publisher, Hardie Grant, said in a cease-and-desist letter to Louw at the weekend that they would be \u201cproceeding against this malicious conduct and infringement of copyright immediately\u201d. Hardie Grant said it planned to refer the issue to the AFP and was also considering subpoenaing government members to seek the source of the illegal copies, according to a report in Nine newspapers. The wide distribution within government circles became apparent when Marise Payne, the foreign minister, told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday she had \u201creceived and deleted\u201d the unauthorised copy, but she said it had not come from the prime minister\u2019s office. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, revealed that he, too, had deleted the book after receiving a copy of it from a friend outside the government via WhatsApp. An AFP spokesperson said the agency had not received a referral in relation to the matter. Guardian Australia has contacted the publisher for comment. The Copyright Act 1968 outlines penalties of up to five years in jail for \u201ccommercial-scale infringement\u201d that has \u201ca substantial prejudicial impact on the owner of the copyright\u201d. But Turnbull and the publisher would have to persuade the AFP to investigate and pursue the matter. A court would have to take into account the volume and value of the infringing copies when deciding whether it was of a commercial scale. Other sections of the Copyright Act would allow Turnbull and the publisher to bring a civil suit seeking damages for alleged copyright violations. Matthew Rimmer, a professor of intellectual property and innovation law at the Queensland University of Technology, said it might be more straightforward for the publisher to pursue a civil case rather than seek a criminal referral. \u201cIn terms of the standard of proof, it\u2019s perhaps easier to be established in relation to a civil matter,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are some complex questions about at what threshold do the criminal offences kick in.\u201d Yet-to-be-answered factual questions included exactly how widely the work had been distributed and what kind of impact that would have on book sales. Given that parliamentarians have pushed for stronger measures to protect copyright over the past decade, Rimmer said it was \u201csurprising and shocking that MPs and staffers have been alleged to have been infringing those self-same copyright laws\u201d. The head of the Australian Publishers Association, Michael Gordon-Smith, said leaders \u201cshould not be tolerating any behaviour that suggests some people \u2013 particularly people at the top levels of government \u2013 follow different rules from the rest of us\u201d.

In the book Turnbull portrays Morrison as a \u201ccontrol freak\u201d and a plotter against another former prime minister, Tony Abbott.

More than 7,000 people, most of the young, have been arrested in relation to the frequent and occasionally violent anti-government protests held since June. Shortly after his release on Saturday, Martin Lee said he was \u201cproud and relieved to be listed as a defendant, after seeing so many brilliant young people arrested\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian before he was arrested, Martin Lee said Beijing was \u201cresorting to all kinds of tricks\u201d to stifle potential pro-democracy candidates, out of a reasonable fear that they might win power. Pro-Beijing legislator and former secretary of security Regina Ip told the Guardian the arrests shouldn\u2019t be viewed \u201cpurely through a political lens\u201d and that no one was above the law. Ip said the protests were expected to \u201creturn with a vengeance\u201d once the pandemic subsided, and that Hong Kong would never regain its stature if order wasn\u2019t restored. \u201cThus it is imperative for the government to strictly enforce the law to restore order, irrespective of the threat of sanctions and criticisms by foreign governments,\u201d she said. Saturday\u2019s arrests came after a number of events interpreted as overreaching intrusions by Beijing into Hong Kong\u2019s semi-autonomy, guaranteed under a 50-year agreement made when Britain handed the territory over to China in 1997. Under that agreement Hong Kong\u2019s mini constitution, the Basic Law, declares that no department under the Chinese central and local governments \u201cmay interfere in the affairs which the Hong Kong special administrative region administers on its own\u201d. However on Friday China\u2019s top bodies in the region, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), which had been criticised for weighing into a Hong Kong legislative dispute, claimed it was not bound by that law, and that Hong Kong\u2019s right to self-rule was \u201cauthorised by the central government\u201d. Attempting to get on top of the issue, Hong Kong\u2019s government then released a series of contradicting statements. It also followed a speech earlier in the week by the head of China\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, calling for long-shelved national security legislation to be introduced as soon as possible to safeguard against threats to national security, like the protests. Luo was supported in his call by pro-Beijing legislators and the chief executive Carrie Lam, however Ip told the Guardian that while the laws were needed, now was not the right time, because the government was \u201cconsumed with the fight against Covid-19\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Australian universities have sparked privacy concerns over plans to use software to monitor students through webcams as they take exams from home during the coronavirus pandemic. Students, academics and privacy experts have criticised the decision, from multiple universities, to sign up to remote exam monitoring software created by third-party companies. The Australian National University in Canberra told Guardian Australia it has signed an agreement to use the US-owned Proctorio software, while the University of Queensland and University of Sydney will use ProctorU \u2013 also developed by a US-based company. The University of Canberra told Guardian Australia it was exploring a number of providers including Proctorio. Both platforms require students to potentially grant access to their computer\u2019s webcam, microphone and keystrokes to prevent cheating. Both platforms also use artificial intelligence, including machine learning and facial detection technology, to verify students\u2019 identities and spot suspicious activity during exams. Nearly 3,000 people have signed a petition from ANU students opposing the use of Proctorio, and Dr Monique Mann, the chair of the surveillance committee at the Australian Privacy Foundation, said she was concerned by the platforms\u2019 description of artificial intelligence. She said all universities should prepare privacy assessments of their software and submit them to their state or territory privacy commissioner before they are used for students. \u201cI would certainly want to know what information they are collecting about my students, how are they making inferences on the behaviour of my students, how long is it being retained, and what other purposes is it being used for,\u201d she said.

It\u2019s pretty common for a lot of students, myself included, when we sit exams, to look around the room, take pauses, or fidget, while you consider the question.\u201d The Proctorio spokesperson said that \u201csubtle movements, such as the one implied, are not likely to be flagged\u201d. \u201cOur facial detection is used to identify students looking away from the exam frequently and for long intervals of time, to identify if there are multiple people in the testing environment or if the student leaves the testing environment.\u201d Skyring said that he and other students would prefer if remote exam software was being conducted by the ANU rather than a third party. \u201cIf we knew it was being conducted on Wattle, which is an ANU website, then we would know it would only be accessed by ANU staff, who have signed obligations to protect our privacy and more,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be OK with it if I had full transparency,\u201d Personeni said. \u201cWith actual information about where the data is being stored, who can access it, and whether it complies with the actual Australian regulations.\u201d Proctorio\u2019s spokesperson said its software \u201ccomplies with the strictest data privacy regulations, including Australian, German and European regulations\u201d. An ANU spokesman told Guardian Australia that \u201conly a small proportion\u201d of exams would use Proctorio, and the university would test the use of the platform in May and forward findings to students. The ANU has completed a privacy impact assessment for Proctorio that concluded that \u201cno personal information is sent to or held in the system\u201d and \u201cno third parties will have access to or be provided with the personal information.\u201d An ANU spokesman said Proctorio does \u201cnot record every keystroke or mouse movement\u201d and cannot access the files on a student\u2019s personal computer. The university said any student could opt out of the system and apply for a deferred exam to be taken when face-to-face exams are allowed, and that students with accessibility arrangements would be supported. But Mann said that as a teaching academic, she believed universities and academics should redesign assessments to make them harder to cheat in, rather than use \u201cpunitive surveillance technology\u201d. Skyring said deferring exams was not a reasonable way to allow students to opt-out of the software. \u201cThere are people who are doing subjects this semester who may not be able to do an exam until next year\u201d, he said. \u201cHaving to do an exam six to 12 months after you have studied a subject is unfeasible.\u201d The University of Queensland\u2019s student union have called on their university to abandon plans to use ProctorU. In a statement, UQ said only \u201cauthorised UQ staff\u201d would have access to the data collected by the program. \u2022 This story was amended on 28 April 2020 to make clear that Proctorio does not require students to upload their biometric data, and to add further context to other concerns expressed about its programs.",

When you remember something, you think you\u2019re reconstructing what it was like at the time. In fact, what you recall is your last recollection, filtered through the state you are now in.</p> <p>Nostalgia is a funny thing. Quiz, a programme watched by almost 6 million people on its last night, told a story from the beginning of the century, from pre-Iraq New Labour, the time of Chris Tarrant and primetime TV shows, bootcut jeans and chintz sofas. On three nights last week, it encouraged its audience, housebound by the coronavirus lockdown, to sip on the crisp white wines of slick television executives, to recall a time before Google, when the biggest story in Britain was about an army major who may or may not have cheated his way to a million pounds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nostalgia can keep people distracted while power is solidified</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like video-conferencing services, hedge fund managers betting against the stock market and manufacturers of nuclear bunkers, nostalgia is enjoying a boom time. Our culture was already long in its grip \u2013 the coronavirus lockdown has only solidified its hold on us. Now very little new art or entertainment can be made. We can barely go outside. We can barely create new memories. Fear and anxiety stalk the land. Friends and family may already have fallen seriously ill. The economic outlook is bleak.</p> <p>But we have our sofas and our laptops, our televisions and our streaming services. When times are tough, the desire to escape to a place of perceived peace becomes ever harder to deny \u2013 the warm bath of nostalgia is ready and waiting. The country is giving up, slipping into it, dozing in those waters for hours on end before climbing out to put on a soft, enveloping robe, also made of nostalgia. The fear of missing out has morphed into the remembrance of things past.</p> <p>On Netflix, Friends<em> </em>has been doing a brisk trade in nostalgia for a while now. Rachel still has <em>that </em>haircut. Joey remains enamoured with sex and eating. Ross\u2019s love of dinosaurs and divorce (and Rachel) endures. The Office<em> </em>is one of the streaming site\u2019s most watched shows at the moment, now combining nostalgia for a time with nostalgia for a place (even if you once thought you hated it): the office, that thing you used to go to, before all this happened.</p> <p>With fortuitous timing, earlier this year Channel 4 put all of Seinfeld on its website, so you can watch the 90s\u2019 foremost show about nothing, in a world where you do nothing. The British broadcaster also has Frasier and Cheers<em> </em>at its disposal, with the latter\u2019s theme tune already a masterpiece in nostalgia, evoking a warm glow in millions of people who\u2019ve never set foot in the city of Boston, let alone a basement bar there. Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and right now, that place is the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Tswannell/status/1250130571591901185\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just a bit of fun \ud83d\ude02 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coys?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coys</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/C2Vy3jHotM\">pic.twitter.com/C2Vy3jHotM</a></p>&mdash; Thomas Swannell (@Tswannell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tswannell/status/1250130571591901185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 14, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>With no sport being played, classic games are replayed on television, radio, podcasts and even, somehow, in the form of live blogs. On the same day that the plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/newcastle-expect-green-light-saudi-takeover-despite-amnesty-misgivings\">sell Newcastle United</a> to a consortium that includes Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was being announced, a young lad\u2019s recreation of a classic goal by Geordie legend Paul Gascoigne (albeit playing for Tottenham) was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tswannell/status/1250130571591901185\">going viral on Twitter</a>. In football-less Premier League, the present is an ever darker place, in which<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41160746\"> zero-hour contract king</a> Mike Ashley can be found flogging a beloved north-eastern institution to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/exit-the-house-of-karrimor-enter-the-austere-and-unforgiving-house-of-saud\">petro-state prince</a> who even the CIA acknowledges has blood on his hands. Far happier, then, to return to seemingly more innocent times, with jumpers for goalposts and a vintage game crackling on the wireless.</p> <p>Much of this nostalgia exists and is driven by social media. With more of us in front of our screens and on our devices, but with nothing much in the way of new content to share, Instagram and Facebook draw us further back, with reminders of where we were and what we were doing in previous years. Half the people I know on social media \u2013 myself included \u2013 suddenly find themselves posting photos of what they looked like aged 20. Instagram is wall-to-wall <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/throwback-thursday\">Throwback Thursdays</a> and \u201csimpler times\u201d.</p> <p>Politically, this pandemic represents an opportunity for both left and right \u2013 one that our culture\u2019s addiction to nostalgia is tied up in. In the US, Donald Trump has been harnessing the past for years, most notably with his \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan. The stuttering campaign of Joe Biden is fuelled by a centrist liberal nostalgia for the Obama years and Bill Clinton.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/02/bbc-summer-sport-nostalgia-coronavirus-lockdown\">BBC to broadcast summer of sport nostalgia during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, we have had Brexit, with its imperial nostalgia, and Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 election campaign, with its promise to end politics and return us to a time \u2013 once again, imagined \u2013 when we didn\u2019t have to worry about such things.</p> <p>Nostalgia can be a powerful tool for such forces and in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, it can keep people distracted while power is solidified. For the left, the challenge is to harness what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/sep/26/walter-benjamins-legacy-75-years-on\">Walter Benjamin</a> called \u201crevolutionary nostalgia\u201d, in which the traditions of oppressed peoples of the past are drawn upon to question the present. This means shaking people out of their nostalgia and bringing them into the here and now. It means, finally, proceeding as if, in the face of a climate crisis and a global pandemic, there is a just and good future to strive for. This isn\u2019t easy.</p> <p>One site for downloading 1990s computer games was upfront about the demand it was currently seeing: \u201cDue to the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19), we are under a heavy load of retrogamers wanting to travel back to those old and safe times,\u201d a large sign on its homepage read.</p> <p>One of those games, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2012/jun/13/civilization-ii-big-brother-orwell-1984\">Civilisation II</a>, tasks the player with building a civilisation from the dawn of time into the modern age.

      "bodyText": "Memory, according to the barrister representing \u201ccoughing major\u201d Charles Ingram in ITV\u2019s Who Wants to be a Millionaire dramatisation Quiz, is a funny thing. When you remember something, you think you\u2019re reconstructing what it was like at the time. In fact, what you recall is your last recollection, filtered through the state you are now in. Nostalgia is a funny thing. Quiz, a programme watched by almost 6 million people on its last night, told a story from the beginning of the century, from pre-Iraq New Labour, the time of Chris Tarrant and primetime TV shows, bootcut jeans and chintz sofas. On three nights last week, it encouraged its audience, housebound by the coronavirus lockdown, to sip on the crisp white wines of slick television executives, to recall a time before Google, when the biggest story in Britain was about an army major who may or may not have cheated his way to a million pounds. Like video-conferencing services, hedge fund managers betting against the stock market and manufacturers of nuclear bunkers, nostalgia is enjoying a boom time. Our culture was already long in its grip \u2013 the coronavirus lockdown has only solidified its hold on us. Now very little new art or entertainment can be made. We can barely go outside. We can barely create new memories. Fear and anxiety stalk the land. Friends and family may already have fallen seriously ill. The economic outlook is bleak. But we have our sofas and our laptops, our televisions and our streaming services. When times are tough, the desire to escape to a place of perceived peace becomes ever harder to deny \u2013 the warm bath of nostalgia is ready and waiting. The country is giving up, slipping into it, dozing in those waters for hours on end before climbing out to put on a soft, enveloping robe, also made of nostalgia. The fear of missing out has morphed into the remembrance of things past. On Netflix, Friends has been doing a brisk trade in nostalgia for a while now. Rachel still has that haircut. Joey remains enamoured with sex and eating. Ross\u2019s love of dinosaurs and divorce (and Rachel) endures. The Office is one of the streaming site\u2019s most watched shows at the moment, now combining nostalgia for a time with nostalgia for a place (even if you once thought you hated it): the office, that thing you used to go to, before all this happened. With fortuitous timing, earlier this year Channel 4 put all of Seinfeld on its website, so you can watch the 90s\u2019 foremost show about nothing, in a world where you do nothing. The British broadcaster also has Frasier and Cheers at its disposal, with the latter\u2019s theme tune already a masterpiece in nostalgia, evoking a warm glow in millions of people who\u2019ve never set foot in the city of Boston, let alone a basement bar there. Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name, and right now, that place is the past. With no sport being played, classic games are replayed on television, radio, podcasts and even, somehow, in the form of live blogs. On the same day that the plan to sell Newcastle United to a consortium that includes Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman was being announced, a young lad\u2019s recreation of a classic goal by Geordie legend Paul Gascoigne (albeit playing for Tottenham) was going viral on Twitter. In football-less Premier League, the present is an ever darker place, in which zero-hour contract king Mike Ashley can be found flogging a beloved north-eastern institution to a petro-state prince who even the CIA acknowledges has blood on his hands. Far happier, then, to return to seemingly more innocent times, with jumpers for goalposts and a vintage game crackling on the wireless. Much of this nostalgia exists and is driven by social media. With more of us in front of our screens and on our devices, but with nothing much in the way of new content to share, Instagram and Facebook draw us further back, with reminders of where we were and what we were doing in previous years. Half the people I know on social media \u2013 myself included \u2013 suddenly find themselves posting photos of what they looked like aged 20. Instagram is wall-to-wall Throwback Thursdays and \u201csimpler times\u201d. Politically, this pandemic represents an opportunity for both left and right \u2013 one that our culture\u2019s addiction to nostalgia is tied up in. In the US, Donald Trump has been harnessing the past for years, most notably with his \u201cMake America great again\u201d slogan. The stuttering campaign of Joe Biden is fuelled by a centrist liberal nostalgia for the Obama years and Bill Clinton. In the UK, we have had Brexit, with its imperial nostalgia, and Boris Johnson\u2019s 2019 election campaign, with its promise to end politics and return us to a time \u2013 once again, imagined \u2013 when we didn\u2019t have to worry about such things. Nostalgia can be a powerful tool for such forces and in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, it can keep people distracted while power is solidified. For the left, the challenge is to harness what Walter Benjamin called \u201crevolutionary nostalgia\u201d, in which the traditions of oppressed peoples of the past are drawn upon to question the present. This means shaking people out of their nostalgia and bringing them into the here and now. It means, finally, proceeding as if, in the face of a climate crisis and a global pandemic, there is a just and good future to strive for. This isn\u2019t easy. One site for downloading 1990s computer games was upfront about the demand it was currently seeing: \u201cDue to the Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19), we are under a heavy load of retrogamers wanting to travel back to those old and safe times,\u201d a large sign on its homepage read. One of those games, Civilisation II, tasks the player with building a civilisation from the dawn of time into the modern age. It ends in the year 2020. \u2022 Oscar Rickett is a journalist and writer",

      "body": "<p>Good evening, this is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia on Monday 20 April.</p> \n<h2>Lowest increase since March</h2> \n<p>Australia has recorded its lowest daily increase in cases since early March.</p> \n<p>Three states \u2013 Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia \u2013 have recorded no new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Victoria recorded just one new case overnight, while New South Wales recorded six new cases, the lowest daily total in five weeks. The Australian Capital Territory recorded one new case.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s the third day in a row that South Australia recorded no new cases. The state\u2019s chief public health officer, associate professor Nicola Spurrier, said that result came on the back of increased testing. Almost 5,000 people were tested over the past five days.</p> \n<p>Both South Australia and Queensland said if results remained that strong, they would begin considering lifting restrictions.</p> \n<p>The national total increased by just 26 cases. That seems to comprise mainly of 16 new cases among crew members aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which were not included in NSW\u2019s daily totals. A total of 202 crew members on the ship, which is moored at Port Kembla, have now tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>Virgin Australia goes into administration</h2> \n<p>Accounting firm Deloitte is understood to have been appointed the administrators for Virgin Australia, which has collapsed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/queensland-nsw-fight-headquarters-virgin-australia-if-it-survives\">despite competing offers of rescue packages from the Queensland and NSW state governments.</a></p> \n<p>It comes after the Australian government refused the airline\u2019s request for a $1.4bn emergency loan. It\u2019s not clear what this development will mean for the airline\u2019s 10,000 staff or 130 planes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Facebook and Google forced to share advertising revenue</h2> \n<p>The Australian government has announced it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/19/facebook-and-google-to-be-forced-to-share-advertising-revenue-with-australian-media-companies\">impose a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies Facebook and Google</a> that will force them to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies.</p> \n<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the code, which will include penalties and binding dispute resolution mechanisms, will \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d between media companies and the two tech giants.</p> \n<h2>Privacy concerns remain over coronavirus app</h2> \n<p>Digital experts have called on the federal government to formally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/privacy-concerns-persist-over-australias-coronavirus-tracing-app\">make data collected by its coronavirus tracking app exempt from use by law enforcement.</a></p> \n<p>And the Law Council of Australia has said that the public health benefits of the app need to be balanced with the privacy implications. </p> \n<p>Government services minister Stuart Robert said on Monday that the information collected by the app, which is intended to register when people have been standing near another person for more than 15 minutes, can be used in contact tracing for a potential Covid-19 infection, will \u201callow us to get back to life quicker\u201d.</p> \n<h2>NRL chief executive quits</h2> \n<p>Todd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/nrl-ceo-todd-greenberg-quits-amid-rugby-league-coronavirus-crisis\">resigned his post effective immediately</a>, in the latest blow to a league that has struggled financially since the shutdown of the 2020 season due to the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>In a shock announcement on Monday, Greenberg said he and the league had come to a mutual agreement to part ways. Chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo will take over the role on an interim basis until a replacement CEO is found.</p> \n<p>Greenberg said it had been a \u201cgreat honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last four years\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Unemployment rate could hit 16%</h2> \n<p>Australia\u2019s unemployment rate could rise as high as 16% over the next few months due to the continued economic impact of the coronavirus, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/lower-income-earners-more-likely-to-lose-jobs-due-to-coronavirus\">according to a report by the Grattan Institute.</a></p> \n<p>The report said that between 17% and 28% of Australian workers, or 2.2 million to 3.6 million people, are either out of work now could be out of work in the coming weeks and months as a direct result of social distancing laws introduced in March. The jobseeker scheme will keep the official unemployment rate lower.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Elective surgery could resume within the month</h2> \n<p>Rules preventing non-urgent elective surgery <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/20/australia-coronavirus-live-news-nsw-victoria-qld-contact-tracing-app-schools-exit-strategy-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9d317f8f08bade1f2964ae#block-5e9d317f8f08bade1f2964ae\">could be lifted within the month</a>, the federal deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth said.</p> \n<p>The issue was discussed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on Monday and will be considered at a national cabinet meeting on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are Australians out there who are in pain and have disability, cannot be in the workforce, they need to take very potent pain medication and they need their elective surgery done,\u201d Coatsworth said.</p> \n<p>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

      "bodyText": "Good evening, this is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia on Monday 20 April. Lowest increase since March Australia has recorded its lowest daily increase in cases since early March. Three states \u2013 Western Australia, Queensland and South Australia \u2013 have recorded no new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. Victoria recorded just one new case overnight, while New South Wales recorded six new cases, the lowest daily total in five weeks. The Australian Capital Territory recorded one new case. It\u2019s the third day in a row that South Australia recorded no new cases. The state\u2019s chief public health officer, associate professor Nicola Spurrier, said that result came on the back of increased testing. Almost 5,000 people were tested over the past five days. Both South Australia and Queensland said if results remained that strong, they would begin considering lifting restrictions. The national total increased by just 26 cases. That seems to comprise mainly of 16 new cases among crew members aboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which were not included in NSW\u2019s daily totals. A total of 202 crew members on the ship, which is moored at Port Kembla, have now tested positive to Covid-19. Virgin Australia goes into administration Accounting firm Deloitte is understood to have been appointed the administrators for Virgin Australia, which has collapsed despite competing offers of rescue packages from the Queensland and NSW state governments. It comes after the Australian government refused the airline\u2019s request for a $1.4bn emergency loan. It\u2019s not clear what this development will mean for the airline\u2019s 10,000 staff or 130 planes. Facebook and Google forced to share advertising revenue The Australian government has announced it will impose a mandatory code of conduct on tech companies Facebook and Google that will force them to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the code, which will include penalties and binding dispute resolution mechanisms, will \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d between media companies and the two tech giants. Privacy concerns remain over coronavirus app Digital experts have called on the federal government to formally make data collected by its coronavirus tracking app exempt from use by law enforcement. And the Law Council of Australia has said that the public health benefits of the app need to be balanced with the privacy implications. Government services minister Stuart Robert said on Monday that the information collected by the app, which is intended to register when people have been standing near another person for more than 15 minutes, can be used in contact tracing for a potential Covid-19 infection, will \u201callow us to get back to life quicker\u201d. NRL chief executive quits Todd Greenberg, the chief executive of the NRL, has resigned his post effective immediately, in the latest blow to a league that has struggled financially since the shutdown of the 2020 season due to the coronavirus. In a shock announcement on Monday, Greenberg said he and the league had come to a mutual agreement to part ways. Chief commercial officer Andrew Abdo will take over the role on an interim basis until a replacement CEO is found. Greenberg said it had been a \u201cgreat honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last four years\u201d. Unemployment rate could hit 16% Australia\u2019s unemployment rate could rise as high as 16% over the next few months due to the continued economic impact of the coronavirus, according to a report by the Grattan Institute. The report said that between 17% and 28% of Australian workers, or 2.2 million to 3.6 million people, are either out of work now could be out of work in the coming weeks and months as a direct result of social distancing laws introduced in March. The jobseeker scheme will keep the official unemployment rate lower. Elective surgery could resume within the month Rules preventing non-urgent elective surgery could be lifted within the month, the federal deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth said. The issue was discussed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on Monday and will be considered at a national cabinet meeting on Tuesday. \u201cThere are Australians out there who are in pain and have disability, cannot be in the workforce, they need to take very potent pain medication and they need their elective surgery done,\u201d Coatsworth said.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected.

She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme her organisation was \u201cvery concerned about the update to the PPE guidance\u201d as it was the first time advice on PPE has been given based to a shortage, rather than best practice. The change, first reported by the Guardian, means fluid-resistant gowns, rather than fluid-repellent gowns, can be used. Several hospitals are expecting to run out out of protective gowns in the coming days, with the situation worsened by the delay of a consignment from Turkey that was meant to arrive on Sunday night. Chris Hopson, the leader of NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses, urged the government to stop talking up individual deliveries of PPE until they had landed and been checked as it was known from \u201cbitter experience\u201d that they might not arrive or be usable. Responding for the government, Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, said first he expected the Turkey delivery to arrive on Monday and later that he was \u201chopeful\u201d that it would come. He said there had been a \u201csingular effort across government to get this equipment\u201d and highlighted the global competition for resources. \u201cWe are working hard to get it to where it\u2019s needed.\u201d In relation to the Turkish consignment of about 400,000 gowns, he said there had been \u201cchallenges at the Turkish end with getting the relevant paperwork\u201d and said a further \u201c25m gowns from China\u201d were expected soon. Dowden also defended the government from criticism over its response to coronavirus, after it emerged over the weekend Boris Johnson had not attended five emergency Cobra meetings at the start of the crisis. He said it was \u201cnormal and proper\u201d for more junior ministers to chair the gathering and argued it was not the time to look back with \u201cperfect 20/20 hindsight\u201d. The culture secretary declined to acknowledge it had been wrong to allow mass gatherings such as Cheltenham festival to go ahead at the beginning of March, saying the government had listened to \u201call the scientific advice\u201d about taking the right steps at the right time. With ministers now focused on the way through the crisis, Dowden struck a cautious note about when the lockdown will be ended. Some senior cabinet ministers have been pressing for an early end to the shutdown, but Johnson is understood to be cautious about relaxing restrictions too early and risking a second peak that requires another hard response. Dowden signalled this was likely to be the approach, saying: \u201cWe said right at the beginning of this, and the prime minister said, he expected the peak to last around three months. What\u2019s happened is kind of consistent with that.\u201d",

NHS staff are saying they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/hospital-leaders-hit-out-government-ppe-shortage-row-escalates-nhs\">do not have enough access to PPE</a>, while a crisis is brewing in care homes and hospices in the UK. Yet Blackstock is confident that MediConnect, a Blockchain solution, can help. His company is accepting donations from the public via a crowd-funding website, <a href=\"http://donatetonhs.com\">donatetonhs.com</a>, and he has enlisted the support of Blackburn\u2019s Bradley Johnson, who has given his time to the project and committed to delivering life-saving equipment to frontline staff near his home in Derby.</p> <p>\u201cWhat MediConnect is meant for is to provide transparency for all parties within the supply chain,\u201d Blackstock explains. \u201cIt\u2019s to add traceability of medications, to stop opioid addiction. I was building the platform for a couple of years. You have to build a relationship with everyone along the supply chain \u2013 pharmacies, manufacturers, distributors, logistics companies \u2013 to bring it all together.</p> <p>\u201cPPE is one of the biggest problems people are struggling with. I have the connections \u2013 instead of people just coming out the woodwork \u2013 which means you can actually get the product.

The website has already raised more than \u00a312,000. Each donation can be followed up by an email request, directing it be supplied to wherever people feel it is needed.</p> <p>\u201cWhen people donate they can see what we\u2019re spending the money on and what supplies we\u2019re getting,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt\u2019s a step-by-step transaction.

He was going through the motions at Rotherham but he had planned for the future. Now he is in a position to talk about the shortage of PPE. \u201cIt\u2019s like toilet paper a few weeks ago,\u201d he says. \u201cThe product can be made in the quantity required. But if everyone rushes at one time you can\u2019t get it. If everyone in England decides to go and buy baked beans tomorrow, there won\u2019t be enough. The rush has been too quick and the numbers are too much. The problem wasn\u2019t the PPE, it\u2019s just the time.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there are a lot of people who\u2019ve come out of the woodwork in between who are blocking deals or buying up the stock at the same time, meaning the government can\u2019t buy it. This is worldwide. A lot of it is coming from China. China physically can\u2019t produce that amount.</p> <p>\u201cThe NHS has an endless backlog.

So there\u2019s not enough that can be made to distribute. England have not got access to every warehouse in China or product worldwide.\u201d</p> <p>It sounds like a tricky world to negotiate. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen some people sending money to factories that are not even there,\u201d Blackstock says. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad. If I just woke up today and tried to source PPE I\u2019d get robbed from the first batch. I wouldn\u2019t know where to go, I wouldn\u2019t know how shipment works. I\u2019d be finished.

The world is burning and we are reaching for more fire extinguishers while gasoline soaks through the tinder at our feet.</p> <p>To reduce risk of pandemics for ourselves, our gaze needs to turn to the health of animals. In the case of wild animal populations, such as the bats that scientists have theorised as a probable origination point for Covid-19, the best solution seems to be to limit and regulate human interaction. Much has rightly been written on this and, slowly and unevenly, policies seem to be moving in the right direction. As it became established that a number of people contracted the virus after visiting a wet market in Wuhan, where the virus likely passed through humans from bats via an intermediate host, China shut down 19,000 wildlife-farming operations and banned meat from wild animals at wet markets.</p> <p>In the case of farmed animals, though, the lack of public understanding has allowed unscrupulous corporations to move policy in exactly the wrong direction.

      "body": "<p>When someone near me coughs, my whole body tenses. The mouth sores that come with chemotherapy can irritate your throat, and the cough probably has nothing to do with coronavirus. But sometimes I can\u2019t help but hold my breath, suddenly terrified that the virus I\u2019ve been trying to protect myself from is mere feet from me.</p> <p>I\u2019m sitting in a chair in Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, Washington, with chemotherapy drugs pumping through my bloodstream to treat my stage 2 cervical cancer. It\u2019s my third week of treatment and it feels more crowded than usual: I can see at least 10 other patients today, plus a few visitors and a handful of nurses.</p> <p>I\u2019m trying to convince myself to use the bathroom but I\u2019ve already been four times, and each time I have to wade through this terrifying maze of people.</p> <p>The hospital now requires patients and visitors to wear masks. But rather than making me feel protected, the mask traps my breath, fogs up my glasses and makes me hot and claustrophobic.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been listening to my apocalypse playlist today. I made it a while back to store my favorite songs. There\u2019s some Tragically Hip, The Cure, Awolnation and of course Hamilton. It feels appropriate, but it\u2019s not doing much to curb my anxiety.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/what-a-terrible-time-to-have-cancer-falling-ill-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">'What a terrible time to have cancer': falling ill during the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I just hit the halfway point in my treatment, and I\u2019ve settled into a routine. After I got past the initial fear of chemo, the process was starting to feel fairly relaxing. I was able to get out of the house and have a few hours to myself.</p> <p>But my doctor was delayed today, which gave me time to think about how alone I feel without my family by my side, and my nerve was irritated when a nurse used a needle to access my chemo port. I usually face a window, but this time my chair faced all those people in the room.

      "bodyText": "When someone near me coughs, my whole body tenses. The mouth sores that come with chemotherapy can irritate your throat, and the cough probably has nothing to do with coronavirus. But sometimes I can\u2019t help but hold my breath, suddenly terrified that the virus I\u2019ve been trying to protect myself from is mere feet from me. I\u2019m sitting in a chair in Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, Washington, with chemotherapy drugs pumping through my bloodstream to treat my stage 2 cervical cancer. It\u2019s my third week of treatment and it feels more crowded than usual: I can see at least 10 other patients today, plus a few visitors and a handful of nurses. I\u2019m trying to convince myself to use the bathroom but I\u2019ve already been four times, and each time I have to wade through this terrifying maze of people. The hospital now requires patients and visitors to wear masks. But rather than making me feel protected, the mask traps my breath, fogs up my glasses and makes me hot and claustrophobic. I\u2019ve been listening to my apocalypse playlist today. I made it a while back to store my favorite songs. There\u2019s some Tragically Hip, The Cure, Awolnation and of course Hamilton. It feels appropriate, but it\u2019s not doing much to curb my anxiety. I just hit the halfway point in my treatment, and I\u2019ve settled into a routine. After I got past the initial fear of chemo, the process was starting to feel fairly relaxing. I was able to get out of the house and have a few hours to myself. But my doctor was delayed today, which gave me time to think about how alone I feel without my family by my side, and my nerve was irritated when a nurse used a needle to access my chemo port. I usually face a window, but this time my chair faced all those people in the room. Any semblance of calm I had at the beginning of the day was completely shot. I should have known better than to think that the difficult times were behind me. My doctors warned me that this is when the symptoms ramp up. I have to stop thinking that I\u2019m somehow invincible or the exception to the rules.

This number includes many kinds of workers who keep transit systems running, from mechanics and maintenance workers to bus and subway operators. The number of all transit workers who have died of coronavirus across the US is likely higher.</p></li> <li><p>The New York City area has seen the majority of American transit worker deaths, with 68 fatalities among employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as of Friday afternoon. Nearly 2,500 MTA transit employees had tested positive, and more than 4,000 were in quarantine, a spokesman said.</p></li> <li><p>At least 24 more transit union members have died in other cities, according to two major transit unions. Bus drivers have <a href=\"https://www.atu.org/remember-our-fallen\">died from coronavirus</a> in Boston; Chicago; St Louis; Detroit; Seattle; Newark and Dover, New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; and Washington DC, among others. In New Orleans, city bus drivers said they had lost three colleagues to coronavirus, only one of them a union member.</p></li> <li><p>Some of America\u2019s largest cities, including Denver, Colorado; Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin only started giving out face masks to public bus drivers very recently.</p></li> <li><p>Only a few places, including Oakland, California; Columbus, Ohio; and New Jersey, currently require passengers to wear face masks in order to ride, a policy many bus drivers described as essential to their safety.</p></li> <li><p>New Orleans bus drivers have seen some of the most challenging overall conditions, national union officials said. Even as thousands of New Orleans residents are sick and hundreds dying, the city\u2019s bus and streetcar drivers have been given no additional paid sick leave. A harsh company attendance policy has made some drivers fear they may be disciplined or fired for calling in sick.</p></li> <li><p>Suspending bus fares has led to high numbers of homeless people using public buses as shelter, making it difficult to observe social distancing guidelines, bus drivers across the country said.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8d4f71c64749a4c47e2174a7e9044e26bd1270d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d4f71c64749a4c47e2174a7e9044e26bd1270d7/0_267_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Sioux Area Metro bus driver wears a protective mask while working in Sioux Falls, South Dakota on 15 April 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Sioux Area Metro bus driver wears a protective mask while working in Sioux Falls, South Dakota on 15 April 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Brouillette/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late March, Jason Hargrove, a Detroit driver, posted an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Dj.Infiniti?__tn__=%2CdlC-R&amp;eid=ARCSLBZ_DXMh-oYyV9_DhjJmXyZP3q0qJMMHkmbmycLQKVi3cKl3S-Jd8niqG8kpLvT66wRJ70syUU1l&amp;hc_ref=ARQFxMQqM15lRDd_fGaAEfCl7fsgLrx8H4Pc8UPZI_hfINg4QidOW48c0cL7os3MmuQ\">emotional Facebook video</a> about a passenger coughing on his bus without covering her mouth. Eleven days later, Hargrove was dead from coronavirus. CNN and Good Morning America played clips from his video, and Time Magazine hailed Hargrove as a <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/coronavirus-heroes/5816894/jason-hargrove-bus-driver-coronavirus/\">frontline hero</a>.</p> <p>But more than two weeks after Hargrove\u2019s death made headlines, bus drivers and union officials say they\u2019re still struggling to obtain appropriate protections.</p> <p>Union officials say that many bus drivers are terrified while watching the growing number of online tributes to colleagues who have died from coronavirus. Belated safety measures have been \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d, said<strong> </strong>John Costa, the president of the nation\u2019s largest transit workers\u2019 union.</p> <p>\u201cI think if it was done earlier, and there wasn\u2019t pushback, I think more lives would have been saved,\u201d Costa said.</p> <p>Three unions that represent more than 275,000 American transit workers are now pushing for essential workers to receive 1.5 times their typical salary as \u201chazard pay\u201d, as well as for the<a href=\"https://www.atu.org/media/releases/atu-twu-smart-utu-joint-union-letter-to-leadership-transit-worker-priorities\"> federal government to set standards</a> for cleaning measures and transit worker safety equipment.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, and we need to be compensated,\u201d said Mikesha Walker, a bus driver from Gwinnett County, Georgia, who started an <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-of-the-united-states-hazard-pay-for-transit-workers?recruiter=1059352457&amp;recruited_by_id=844ee7f0-6c3d-11ea-8b98-41370db76220&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_initial&amp;fbclid=IwAR3wIZktGVyPMmcnzFVMN_ughf6yhexXzypRGw4HVkISLlfS9AKb6lOBXRo\">online petition</a> asking for hazard pay for drivers, which has already received close to 10,000 signatures.</p> <p>\u201cI did not sign up to put my life on the line without any protective wear,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI signed up to drive a bus.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0cb178b3222853318075ff31a69dd065cbe5d42e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0cb178b3222853318075ff31a69dd065cbe5d42e/0_0_3234_4859/666.jpg\" alt=\"The driver of a New Orleans RTA bus wears protective clothing to protect against coronavirus on 26 March 2020.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The driver of a New Orleans RTA bus wears protective clothing to protect against coronavirus on 26 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Granger/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I didn\u2019t want to take off from work\u2019</h2> <p>While New York has seen the highest number of deaths, union officials said the fight to get safety protections has been more difficult in other cities, including in New Orleans, which has one of America\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks. There have been more than 11,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the New Orleans metropolitan area.</p> <p>But Transdev, the company that manages New Orleans\u2019s public bus and streetcar system, is still not offering employees additional paid sick leave during the pandemic.</p> <p>When local union officials started checking in on New Orleans drivers, they heard from multiple people who had symptoms of coronavirus but were still showing up to work, worried about losing their only source of income or about the company\u2019s strict attendance policy, said Valerie Jefferson, the president of the local affiliate of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU).</p> <p>Jefferson said a lot of the union\u2019s members are single parents.<strong> </strong>One driver who had lost multiple family members to coronavirus told Jefferson she was worried that if she called in sick because of her own symptoms, she might be fired. \u201cMorale is very, very low,\u201d Jefferson said.</p> <p>One New Orleans driver, who asked to remain anonymous,<strong> </strong>told the Guardian they had continued<strong> </strong>to drive a city bus for two weeks after first experiencing coronavirus symptoms.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes you would get gloves and you wouldn\u2019t get a mask. Or vice versa. Or none.</p> <footer> <cite>Anonymous New Orleans bus driver</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re really strict when it comes to attendance. I was just dealing with the symptoms, because I didn\u2019t want to take off from work. I didn\u2019t want to suffer any consequences,\u201d the driver said.</p> <p>After being \u201cin denial\u201d for several days, the driver\u2019s symptoms became so severe that \u201cI had a moment where I kind of hallucinated on the bus and actually turned in front of a car,\u201d they said. \u201cI knew that wasn\u2019t right.\u201d Shaken, the driver got tested for coronavirus.</p> <p>But slow testing meant it was almost a full week between when the driver took the test, and when they were informed they had tested positive for Covid-19. In the meantime, the driver went back to work, worried that missing more days would have career consequences.</p> <p>During this time, as some New Orleans bus drivers continued to work while experiencing coronavirus symptoms, their access to masks and other protective gear was \u201chit or miss,\u201d the driver said.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you would get gloves and you wouldn\u2019t get a mask.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 100 American transit workers have died from the coronavirus as basic measures to keep employees safe have lagged in cities across the United States, a Guardian US investigation has found. Even after the death of a public bus driver in Detroit put a spotlight on the risks that transit workers face, transit agencies in many cities have been slow to provide simple protections, like face masks or paid sick leave. Interviews with union officials, workers and transit authorities in a dozen major cities reveal that: At least 94 transit workers have succumbed to coronavirus, according to two national transit unions, New York City transit officials, and workers in New Orleans. This number includes many kinds of workers who keep transit systems running, from mechanics and maintenance workers to bus and subway operators. The number of all transit workers who have died of coronavirus across the US is likely higher. The New York City area has seen the majority of American transit worker deaths, with 68 fatalities among employees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as of Friday afternoon. Nearly 2,500 MTA transit employees had tested positive, and more than 4,000 were in quarantine, a spokesman said. At least 24 more transit union members have died in other cities, according to two major transit unions. Bus drivers have died from coronavirus in Boston; Chicago; St Louis; Detroit; Seattle; Newark and Dover, New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; and Washington DC, among others. In New Orleans, city bus drivers said they had lost three colleagues to coronavirus, only one of them a union member. Some of America\u2019s largest cities, including Denver, Colorado; Columbus, Ohio; Atlanta, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin only started giving out face masks to public bus drivers very recently. Only a few places, including Oakland, California; Columbus, Ohio; and New Jersey, currently require passengers to wear face masks in order to ride, a policy many bus drivers described as essential to their safety. New Orleans bus drivers have seen some of the most challenging overall conditions, national union officials said. Even as thousands of New Orleans residents are sick and hundreds dying, the city\u2019s bus and streetcar drivers have been given no additional paid sick leave. A harsh company attendance policy has made some drivers fear they may be disciplined or fired for calling in sick. Suspending bus fares has led to high numbers of homeless people using public buses as shelter, making it difficult to observe social distancing guidelines, bus drivers across the country said. In late March, Jason Hargrove, a Detroit driver, posted an emotional Facebook video about a passenger coughing on his bus without covering her mouth. Eleven days later, Hargrove was dead from coronavirus. CNN and Good Morning America played clips from his video, and Time Magazine hailed Hargrove as a frontline hero. But more than two weeks after Hargrove\u2019s death made headlines, bus drivers and union officials say they\u2019re still struggling to obtain appropriate protections. Union officials say that many bus drivers are terrified while watching the growing number of online tributes to colleagues who have died from coronavirus. Belated safety measures have been \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d, said John Costa, the president of the nation\u2019s largest transit workers\u2019 union. \u201cI think if it was done earlier, and there wasn\u2019t pushback, I think more lives would have been saved,\u201d Costa said. Three unions that represent more than 275,000 American transit workers are now pushing for essential workers to receive 1.5 times their typical salary as \u201chazard pay\u201d, as well as for the federal government to set standards for cleaning measures and transit worker safety equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, and we need to be compensated,\u201d said Mikesha Walker, a bus driver from Gwinnett County, Georgia, who started an online petition asking for hazard pay for drivers, which has already received close to 10,000 signatures. \u201cI did not sign up to put my life on the line without any protective wear,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI signed up to drive a bus.\u201d \u2018I didn\u2019t want to take off from work\u2019 While New York has seen the highest number of deaths, union officials said the fight to get safety protections has been more difficult in other cities, including in New Orleans, which has one of America\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks. There have been more than 11,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus across the New Orleans metropolitan area. But Transdev, the company that manages New Orleans\u2019s public bus and streetcar system, is still not offering employees additional paid sick leave during the pandemic. When local union officials started checking in on New Orleans drivers, they heard from multiple people who had symptoms of coronavirus but were still showing up to work, worried about losing their only source of income or about the company\u2019s strict attendance policy, said Valerie Jefferson, the president of the local affiliate of the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU). Jefferson said a lot of the union\u2019s members are single parents. One driver who had lost multiple family members to coronavirus told Jefferson she was worried that if she called in sick because of her own symptoms, she might be fired. \u201cMorale is very, very low,\u201d Jefferson said. One New Orleans driver, who asked to remain anonymous, told the Guardian they had continued to drive a city bus for two weeks after first experiencing coronavirus symptoms. \u201cThey\u2019re really strict when it comes to attendance. I was just dealing with the symptoms, because I didn\u2019t want to take off from work. I didn\u2019t want to suffer any consequences,\u201d the driver said. After being \u201cin denial\u201d for several days, the driver\u2019s symptoms became so severe that \u201cI had a moment where I kind of hallucinated on the bus and actually turned in front of a car,\u201d they said. \u201cI knew that wasn\u2019t right.\u201d Shaken, the driver got tested for coronavirus. But slow testing meant it was almost a full week between when the driver took the test, and when they were informed they had tested positive for Covid-19. In the meantime, the driver went back to work, worried that missing more days would have career consequences. During this time, as some New Orleans bus drivers continued to work while experiencing coronavirus symptoms, their access to masks and other protective gear was \u201chit or miss,\u201d the driver said. \u201cSometimes you would get gloves and you wouldn\u2019t get a mask. Or vice versa. Or none.\u201d \u201cWe have been as generous as our economic realities allow us to be,\u201d a Transdev North America spokesperson said in a statement. Its contracts with cities like New Orleans limit compensation and benefits \u201cbecause cities simply don\u2019t have the funding to be more generous,\u201d the spokesperson added. The company called on the federal and state governments to fund protections, pay and benefits for frontline workers. Transdev \u201chas been forced to lay off hundreds of people and make across-the-board salary cuts,\u201d the spokesperson said. Transdev added that it had informed its New Orleans employees in early March that its harsh sick leave had been suspended because of coronavirus, and said that it had not disciplined any workers for calling in sick. Four employees and Jefferson, the local union president, said they had never been informed that the sick leave policy had changed, and that no notification of a suspension in the discipline policy had ever been posted in the normal locations. In a subsequent statement, Transdev confirmed that the company had not posted any explicit notification of the suspension in New Orleans, but said that supervisors had communicated the policy change to employees verbally. A spokesperson for the Regional Transit Authority, the agency that pays Transdev to manage New Orleans\u2019 transit system, said staff had worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to put new measures in place to protect frontline workers, even as many people, from administrative staff to the organization\u2019s CEO, were themselves becoming sick. \u2018Early on, it was not recommended that people wear masks\u2019 Across the country, some transit agencies acted quickly to protect drivers. In Oakland and Berkeley, California, \u201cWe had an abundance of supplies when this first broke,\u201d said Yvonne Williams, the president of the local transit union. Though there have been some shortages, drivers started getting personal protective equipment on 13 March, she said, and the transit agency also allowed bus drivers 65 and older to stay home with pay. Across the bay in San Francisco, bus drivers did not receive masks until 2 April, though a transit spokeswoman said drivers did have a built-in protective barrier on their vehicles. New York City had begun issuing basic masks to its full transit workforce after 27 March, and began giving transit workers the highest-quality N95 masks on 4 April, according to a transit spokesperson. But it took weeks for other major cities to take similar measures. They blamed difficulties in obtaining masks and a lack of guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advising members of the general public to wear masks until 3 April. In Columbus, Ohio, bus drivers for weeks received gloves but no masks, as confirmed coronavirus cases in the midwestern city surged from dozens to hundreds. When the region\u2019s transit authority finally started issuing lower-grade cloth and medical masks to drivers on 8 April, they were asked to sign waivers acknowledging that they understood the masks did not offer full protection. Higher-quality N95 masks have been ordered, but not yet distributed, an agency spokesperson said. In Denver, Colorado, the president of the local transit workers\u2019 union said he had raised the issue of masks for drivers in a meeting with a transit official on 12 March. It was not until 8 April that drivers actually received high-quality masks, and they were provided by the union. \u201cThat\u2019s really the first frontline protection that any of our operators have gotten,\u201d said Lance Logenbohn, the local transit union president. Early on, he said, there had even been resistance to drivers wearing their own masks. \u201cI had reports that people were being told that they couldn\u2019t wear the masks they were providing for themselves,\u201d Logenbohn said. \u201cAt that point, shamefully, I believe there was concern ... of the image of a driver wearing a mask.\u201d A spokesperson for the Denver area\u2019s Regional Transportation District said the agency was continuing to struggle to source the needed masks, and that \u201cearly on, it was not recommended to the public that people wear masks unless they felt sick.\u201d Steven Markowitz, an occupational health expert at the City University of New York, said he doesn\u2019t blame transit agencies for relying on the CDC. \u201cThey are our public health authorities for situations like this,\u201d Markowitz said. But the CDC \u201cmade a mistake in not recommending masks earlier,\u201d he argued. \u201cBus drivers need masks. I think they need N95 masks,\u201d Markowitz said. Bus drivers often stay on the job into their 50s or 60s because their access to pension benefits tend to be less generous than other public workers. Because they spend a full day in traffic exposed to air pollution, drivers are also more likely to have a chronic disease. Advanced age and chronic health issues put many drivers at risk for complications due to Covid-19. On top of those risks, bus drivers now have \u201ceight hour, full shift exposure\u201d to large numbers of other high-risk workers, like medical and grocery workers, Markowitz said. The bottom line: Bus drivers \u201cwould have been better off had they gotten masks earlier,\u201d Markowitz said. The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \u2018Hazard pay is not under consideration\u2019 If Amazon workers and some grocery store employees are getting an additional $2 an hour during the pandemic, bus drivers argue, they deserve hazard pay, too. Even with a mask, driving a public bus during a pandemic is anxious work. \u201cAnytime somebody coughs, you look in the mirror, because you\u2019re kind of nervous,\u201d said Lyntel Cannon, 59, who has worked as a Columbus bus driver for 23 years. So far, Cannon said, the main acknowledgement bus drivers in his city had received for risking their lives was a free pizza. The next week, it was a boxed sandwich. \u201cWe don\u2019t want food. That won\u2019t cheer us up,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cWhat would be helpful for most of us is pandemic pay.\u2019\u201d Columbus\u2019 transit agency \u201cwanted to show our appreciation for what we call our heroic frontline workers by offering them lunch,\u201d Jeff Pullin, a spokesman for the Central Ohio Transit Authority, said. \u201cHazard pay is not under consideration right now,\u201d Pullin added. Some victories \u2013 but new problems A few cities are beginning to offer bus drivers additional pay for the risk they are taking. Milwaukee, Wisconsin, announced last week that bus drivers would receive $200 a week in additional hazard pay, going back to 15 March, a transit spokeswoman said. Last week, Atlanta\u2019s transit agency announced that it would be offering transit workers \u201ca one-time hero payment of $500\u201d, in recognition of their service at the front lines of the pandemic. Columbus, Oakland, and the state of New Jersey, among others, now require face masks or other coverings for transit passengers. In Columbus, bus passengers will be given flexibility to use any kind of fabric covering, from a bandana to a scarf to a T-shirt. Philadelphia reversed a mandate that transit passengers wear masks, according to local news reports, after a video surfaced of police officers dragging a man off a city bus, allegedly for refusing to wear a mask. Other attempts to make drivers safer have had unintended consequences. Many cities now ask most passengers to enter and exit through the rear door of buses, further away from the drivers at the front.

In April, California\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Could-coronavirus-collide-with-fire-season-15128059.php\">wildfire season will start</a>. Restrictions on work caused by the pandemic will make it harder for firefighters to conduct controlled burns that steer fires \u2013 and smoke \u2013 from homes. Californians\u2019 lungs could face Covid-19 and unusually intense smoke at the same time. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/03/19/spring-flood-outlook-nws/\">third of the country</a> also faces serious flood risk through the spring. And in summer and fall, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/04/02/above-average-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-including-possible-major-hurricane-strike/\">forecasters predict</a> \u201cabove average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States\u201d. We\u2019re already seeing this catastrophic convergence elsewhere: In Ecuador, <a href=\"https://earther.gizmodo.com/this-is-what-climate-change-looks-like-in-an-era-of-cov-1842539967\">a muted government response</a> to flooding in indigenous communities, for fear of spreading the virus; in Fiji, devastated by Cyclone Harold this week, 19 confirmed coronavirus cases are casting doubt on how to rebuild.</p> <p>Here too, we will need to find ways to do the needed relief work without deepening the pandemic. Amid all this suffering, the case for bold moves to tackle the miseries of inequality, Covid, and climate at once will get clearer.</p> <p>Moreover, green stimulus is the only option for a smooth transition to the 21st century green economy. The era of dirty energy is ending. Even the conservative CBNC analyst Jim Cramer has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/jim-cramer-investors-should-sell-oil-stocks-on-any-rumored-opec-deal.html\">warned investors</a> that oil stocks are no longer safe investments, as society is increasingly repudiating fossil fuels. Giant investors like Blackrock are gradually <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/business/dealbook/larry-fink-blackrock-climate-change.html\">winding down</a> their investments in carbon. And at the <a href=\"https://www.pv-magazine.com/2020/04/14/european-leaders-push-green-recovery-plan-for-post-covid-economy/\">European</a> level, and in countries like <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/germany-touts-green-stimulus-in-post-covid-19-policy-push\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/04/16/south-korea-embraces-eu-style-green-deal-for-covid-19-recovery/#7089bc4a5611\">South Korea</a>, a green stimulus-based recovery is becoming the consensus choice, with investments in efficiency and clean energy seen as obvious drivers of economic reconstruction.</p> <p>Here in the US, green stimulus is easily the best way to create good jobs through public investment. <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTOGMC/Resources/Measuring_the_employment_impact_of_energy_sector1.pdf\">According to a 2011 World Bank</a> study, $1m invested in the oil and gas in the United States creates just five jobs, compared to 17 jobs per million dollars invested in energy-saving building retrofits, 22 jobs for mass transit, 13 for wind, and 14 for solar. <a href=\"https://rael.berkeley.edu/publication/putting-renewables-and-energy-efficiency-to-work-how-many-jobs-can-the-clean-energy-industry-generate-in-the-us/\">Kammen\u2019s research</a> and that of <a href=\"https://citizensclimatelobby.org/laser-talks/jobs-fossil-fuels-vs-renewables/\">other institutes</a> all concur that investment in a modern green economy is a more efficient job creator than the fossil sector.</p> <p>The longer-term vision of the green stimulus is a more rewarding, lifelong career of dignified green work. We should also invest in Stem education for all<em> </em>children and create apprenticeship programs in vulnerable communities, matched with new careers for workers to enter. And by directly investing in frontline communities, following <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/california-climate-investments\">best practices</a> in California, we can bring technologies like solar and battery storage to neighborhoods that have been <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/report-finds-wide-racial-and-ethnic-disparities-in-rooftop-solar\">scandalously left out</a> of the clean energy boom so far. Plus, these same nimble, local solutions make neighborhoods more resilient to extreme weather. Local storage and nested microgrids make the power system, including healthcare facilities, more reliable during disasters. We\u2019d be making environmental, economic, and social improvements in the same places, at the same time.</p> <p>And we should speak of green investments in concrete terms. <a href=\"https://www.dataforprogress.org/memos/green-industrial-policy\">Polling conducted</a> by Data for Progress in March finds majority support for massive green spending overall. More interesting is the finding of even greater support \u2013 including majority Republican approval \u2013 for <em>specific</em> public green investments, like electric buses, retrofits to low-income housing, and renewable energy. Strip away abstract rhetoric, and the substance that we\u2019re advocating is incredibly popular.</p> <p>For these reasons, we recently joined nine other experts in social and climate policy to write a letter to Congress outlining a menu of policy options for a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@green_stimulus_now/a-green-stimulus-to-rebuild-our-economy-1e7030a1d9ee\">Green Stimulus</a>. Our proposals span eight sectors of the economy. But fundamentally, a Green Stimulus is about mobilizing massive public funds \u2013 say, $2tn to start \u2013 in specific green investments to create high-quality jobs and improve the quality of life, especially in low-income communities, communities of color, and indigenous communities, which have suffered the most disinvestment and pollution in recent decades.</p> <p>It seems counterintuitive, but the timing for such a Green Stimulus is perfect. Bridge-loans and advance payments on public green purchases of goods like solar panels and electric vehicles for public use would stabilize firms\u2019 and workers\u2019 finances. Announcing initiatives like a Climate Conservation Corps would give young people eager to work jobs to apply for, and plan to start. And desk workers across the economy could get on Zoom and do paperwork to make green projects shovel-ready the minute it\u2019s safe to break ground. (Indeed, <a href=\"https://weatherization.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/pdf/WAPRecoveryActEvalFinalReports/ORNL_TM-2015_139.pdf\">a major reason</a> the 2009 Obama stimulus faltered was months wasted on paperwork.)</p> <p>Each of us has lived through climate-fueled disasters \u2013 in Cohen\u2019s case, Hurricane Sandy, and in Kammen\u2019s, last year\u2019s devastating wildfires.

      "bodyText": "Virgin Australia is set to go into voluntary administration in the biggest airline collapse in Australia since Ansett failed in 2002, putting thousands of jobs and more than a billion dollars in prepaid tickets at risk. On Monday night sources said the airline, which has been largely grounded since 25 March due to the coronavirus crisis, will appoint John Greig, Vaughan Strawbridge and Richard Hughes of big four accounting firm Deloitte as administrators. The move comes after the federal government rebuffed its plea for a $1.4bn loan as part of a wider bailout of the industry and despite duelling offers of support from New South Wales and Queensland. An announcement is expected as early as Tuesday morning. Virgin Australia employs 10,000 people whose employment is now in jeopardy. Also to be decided is the fate of its fleet of about 130 planes, many of which are mortgaged to the hilt, and almost $1.2bn in customer ticket bookings. The move also sparked fears of sky-high air fares for consumers if bigger rival Qantas is once again able to establish dominance of the Australian market. Administration is likely to wipe out the value of stock in the group, including that held by dominant shareholders Singapore Airlines, Chinese groups Nanshan and HNA, the government of Abu Dhabi through state airline Etihad and billionaire Richard Branson. However, administration may also help a buyer to reduce or eliminate a debt mountain of more than $4.8bn owed to banks that has crippled the airline as it continued to burn through cash while its planes were grounded. It may also be able to close parts of the airline that are not performing well, such as budget arm Tiger. This would allow Virgin Australia to eventually fly again, even if in a reduced form. It is understood that chief executive Paul Scurrah is likely keep his job for the time being. Over the past fortnight Scurrah has been fighting against what he sees as a campaign against Virgin Australia by Qantas, as well as dealing with a government that repeatedly said it was committed to keeping two airlines in Australia but has so far been unwilling to bail out the company. The government has offered the industry about $700m in reduced fees and charges, but these are only of value if planes are flying. It has also offered $165m to underwrite Virgin Australia and Qantas operating a \u201cminimum domestic network servicing the most critical metropolitan and regional routes\u201d, but because this money only covers the cost of operating the flights it does not improve Virgin Australia\u2019s financial position. Its collapse raises the prospect of Qantas once again enjoying a monopoly over major Australian air routes, as it did after the collapse of Ansett in 2002. This resulted in fares rising, the former competition tsar Allan Fels told Guardian Australia. The Flight Attendants\u2019 Association of Australia said it was important that governments gave thought to what they wanted the aviation industry to look like after the coronavirus crisis passed. \u201cWe cannot have a complete abandonment of competition. It took 20 years to get Virgin to a position where it was a competitor to Qantas,\u201d FAAA\u2019s manager of industrial relations, Steven Reed, said. \u201cWe need Virgin in some form, so that people can afford to fly on Qantas,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople should recall what the airline industry was like when there was no meaningful competition under the two airline policy of the 1970s and early 1980s. \u201cUnless the government caps airfares, then the market will set fares and it will be back to $1,000 return to Melbourne, or $3,000 return to Perth [from Sydney].\u201d Reed said it was important to keep Virgin trading through administration as Ansett did in the 1990s when it went into administration to ensure that some jobs are preserved. \u201cAdministration has great uncertainty, and it doesn\u2019t mean that our people keep their jobs, or that their conditions survive,\u201d he warned. He said the union movement was greatly disturbed by the governments\u2019 recent regulations which allow enterprise bargaining agreements to be changed at the drop of a hat. Reed also warned that Virgins\u2019s collapse could prove more expensive for government than a bailout. \u201cAt the end of the day, the only people paying tax at Virgin are the employees,\u201d he said. Virgin has paid no tax for several years as it has failed to run profitably. Virgin Australia has been in the red every year for the past five years, running up losses of more than $1.6bn. It lost an additional $88m in the six months to the end of the year. Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary Michael Kaine said administration would be a \u201cterrifying moment for thousands of Virgin workers\u201d and repeated his previous calls for the federal government to bail the company out. \u201cIt is a viable and much-needed business and without it Australia will struggle to get its economy back on track once the crisis abates,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is still time for the federal government to work on an investment plan to get through this period of crisis and taxpayers will get a double benefit. The government will retain a competitive aviation market and they will get a return on their equity stake. \u201cThe prime minister has promoted the concept of hibernation, of keeping viable businesses afloat through this crisis. That must include Virgin and the only way to do that is a government equity stake in this business.\u201d Of the $4.8m the airline owes to its banks, $540m needs to be repaid or refinanced before the end of this calendar year. The company has been considering appointing administrators since at least last Tuesday. As time ran short for the airline, Queensland offered it $200m if it kept its headquarters in Brisbane. Virgin\u2019s Bowen Hills headquarters has 1,200 workers and there are 5,000 Virgin employees in Queensland. But NSW treasurer, Dominic Perrotet, told Sky News on Sunday night the NSW government was considering offering support and pointing to the second airport being built at Badgerys Creek. \u201cVirgin should have their headquarters for both Virgin and Tiger in Sydney,\u201d Perrottet said. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, confirmed her state\u2019s interest on Monday morning. \u201cIf there are other opportunities [where] the NSW government can support businesses retooling or looking at other opportunities to set up their head office here in NSW, we are open to all of those things.\u201d NSW is expected to release a statement once Virgin makes an announcement to the ASX.",

      "bodyText": "Renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring global GDP gains of almost $100tn (\u00a380tn) between now and 2050, according to a report. The International Renewable Energy Agency found that accelerating investment in renewable energy could generate huge economic benefits while helping to tackle the global climate emergency. The agency\u2019s director general, Francesco La Camera, said the global crisis ignited by the coronavirus outbreak exposed \u201cthe deep vulnerabilities of the current system\u201d and urged governments to invest in renewable energy to kickstart economic growth and help meet climate targets. The agency\u2019s landmark report found that accelerating investment in renewable energy would help tackle the climate crisis and would in effect pay for itself. Investing in renewable energy would deliver global GDP gains of $98tn above a business-as-usual scenario by 2050 by returning between $3 and $8 on every dollar invested. It would also quadruple the number of jobs in the sector to 42m over the next 30 years, and measurably improve global health and welfare scores, according to the report. \u201cGovernments are facing a difficult task of bringing the health emergency under control while introducing major stimulus and recovery measures,\u201d La Camera said. \u201cBy accelerating renewables and making the energy transition an integral part of the wider recovery, governments can achieve multiple economic and social objectives in the pursuit of a resilient future that leaves nobody behind.\u201d The report also found that renewable energy could curb the rise in global temperatures by helping to reduce the energy industry\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions by 70% by 2050 by replacing fossil fuels. Renewables could play a greater role in cutting carbon emissions from heavy industry and transport to reach virtually zero emissions by 2050, particularly by investing in green hydrogen. The clean-burning fuel, which can replace the fossil fuel gas in steel and cement making, could be made by using vast amounts of clean electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen elements. Andrew Steer, chief executive of the World Resources Institute, said: \u201cAs the world looks to recover from the current health and economic crises, we face a choice: we can pursue a modern, clean, healthy energy system, or we can go back to the old, polluting ways of doing business.

Turnbull praised his attorney general, George Brandis, for his insight in the extent to which the Liberal party had become \u201ctribalised\u201d between a liberal and a conservative faction, who Turnbull claims tore him down not because he stood to lose the next election but because they \u201cwould have preferred Bill Shorten to be prime minister than me\u201d. Turnbull accepted it was a \u201cfair criticism\u201d that he hadn\u2019t appreciated the extent of the party\u2019s tribal nature, but argued without cooperation from Dutton, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, and other conservatives his government could not have functioned effectively. In describing the events of August 2018, Turnbull again set out his case that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp and other conservative commentators were directly involved in instigating the spill and accused the conservative faction of \u201coperating like a terrorist\u201d in making threats to remove him. \u201cNow, they don\u2019t use guns and bombs, I hasten to add,\u201d he said. \u201cBut \u2026 it is the technique of terrorism, where you create enough mayhem, enough damage that people in the middle say it\u2019s got to come to an end; how can I stop this terrible horror?\u201d Turnbull said he called the first spill \u2013 in which Dutton won 35 votes, partly due to Morrison allies including Stuart Robert voting for the challenger \u2013 to \u201cflush out\u201d his opponents, and insisted he could have continued as prime minister if Cormann had not switched loyalties later that week. Turnbull said it was \u201cpossible but unlikely\u201d that Morrison\u2019s allies had voted for Dutton to weaken him without Morrison\u2019s knowledge, but explained he backed Morrison in the second and decisive spill to prevent Dutton from winning the leadership. Turnbull defended his record successfully challenging two Liberal leaders, first Brendan Nelson in September 2008, and then Tony Abbott in September 2015. Turnbull said he had challenged Abbott because he had \u201cbasically abandoned cabinet government\u201d. \u201cHis whole style of government was erratic and flaky \u2026 from a national security point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a time when terrorism was our biggest \u2026domestic security issue, Abbott was determined to ramp up the rhetoric in a way that was calculated to inflame animosity against Muslims. \u201cThat was obviously lapped up and echoed by the Murdoch press, who were doing the same thing. That made Australia less safe. It was profoundly dangerous.\u201d Turnbull accused \u201cbillionaire media proprietors\u201d of removing him not because of policy differences on climate change or same-sex marriage, but because \u201cthey wanted to have again a prime minister who they felt they had some control over, they had an ownership of \u2026 and they wanted to feel that, as they had done with Abbott, that they were in charge\u201d. Turnbull accused right-wing media of playing on \u201cirrational fears\u201d and \u201cstoking division\u201d on the issue of climate change. \u201cThe bottom line is that they do not, the right wing of the Liberal Party and the National Party, do not accept the reality of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are franker about it than others, like Barnaby Joyce; ah most of them, you know, use mealy-mouthed expressions \u2026 but underpinning it all is a refusal to recognise that we have a responsibility to reduce our emissions.\u201d Turnbull said he realised Dutton wanted the leadership very late because he did not imagine Dutton could be \u201cso deluded as to imagine that our political prospects would be advanced by a change of leadership, and especially to him\u201d. \u201cIt never occurred to me, frankly, that \u2026 so many people would support him. \u201cI mean \u2026 if Dutton had become leader, not even Bill Shorten could have lost the election!\u201d Turnbull praised the efforts of \u201call the governments in Australia\u201d for the response to coronavirus which have so far been effective in flattening the curve of its spread, but warned satisfaction was \u201cno cause for complacency\u201d. \u201cBut the economic shock will be massive,\u201d he warned.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. More than 40,000 people have now died in the US as a result of the coronavirus \u2013 almost a quarter of the total global death toll. So on Sunday, Donald Trump again used his daily press briefing to focus on favourable coverage of his own performance. The president read aloud sections of a Wall Street Journal column praising him, and then rolled a selectively edited video of Andrew Cuomo lauding the federal response to the crisis. In fact, the New York governor recently slammed Trump, suggesting that if the president was \u201csitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work\u201d. The New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, stepped up his criticism of the president at a Sunday press conference, asking whether his administration was \u201cgoing to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead?\u201d Governors across the US have also faulted Trump over his apparent support for the weekend\u2019s protests by rightwing groups against their states\u2019 stay-at-home orders. The president\u2019s plan for lifting the lockdown, without adequate testing measures in place, is both \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d, state leaders said. A \u2018narcissistic bully\u2019. That\u2019s former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s assessment of Trump. In this extract from his new memoir, Turnbull looks back on his dealings with the US president during the latter\u2019s first weeks in power. The UN\u2019s crisis fund for vulnerable countries is falling far short There have now been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide, with at least 165,000 deaths. And the risk to the world\u2019s more vulnerable countries is looking ever more stark, say UN agency chiefs, who revealed that their plea for international aid to key crisis areas, including the Middle East and Africa, has so far raised only a quarter of the requested $2bn total. The oil price hit a 21st century low. In a sign of the gloomy global economic outlook, the price of US crude plunged almost 20% on Monday, to below $15 \u2013 its lowest point since 1999. Almost 100 US public transit workers have died with Covid-19 In late March, a Detroit bus driver posted an emotional Facebook video about a passenger coughing on his bus without covering her mouth. Eleven days later, he was dead as a result of coronavirus. As Lois Beckett reports, at least 94 American transit workers have died so far during the pandemic, and a Guardian investigation has found many cities failing to provide them with even basic safety measures. Celebrities highlight black and Latino victims. Sean Combs, Lin-Manuel Miranda and others appeared on CNN to discuss the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on US communities of colour, which Combs described as \u201csobering\u201d and \u201ctragic\u201d. Workers without degrees face greater hardship. That\u2019s the conclusion of a European survey, which found that the crisis will increase inequality across the continent, with the livelihoods of less educated workers most under threat. But things are looking up \u2026 \u2026 in New Zealand, where lockdown restrictions may be loosened in a week\u2019s time. Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government has been so successful in preventing the virus\u2019 spread that just 12 people have perished, and the prime minister still receives a phone call to inform her of each death. \u2026 for endangered sea turtles in Florida, where marine life researchers say the coronavirus restrictions have kept humans and harmful waste away from beaches, leading to a \u201csignificant\u201d annual increase in the number of leatherback sea turtle nests. In other news \u2026 A gunman killed 16 people in Nova Scotia. The 51-year-old suspect posed as a police officer during his 12-hour spree \u2013 Canada\u2019s worst act of mass murder in modern times \u2013 which ended with the suspect dead after a standoff with police. Did the EPA break the law to back Monsanto? The agency will try to answer that question in court on Tuesday, following claims from farmers that a herbicide made by the controversial agri-giant has triggered \u201cwidespread\u201d crop damage. Harry and Meghan have cut ties with UK tabloids. The former senior royals wrote to the editors of four British newspapers, saying they would no longer respond to their journalists\u2019 enquiries and accusing them of running stories that were \u201cdistorted, false, or invasive beyond reason\u201d. Covering climate now The world may be occupied by Covid-19, but there\u2019s another global crisis happening \u2013 and the media can\u2019t afford to stop covering it. Which is why, 50 years since the first Earth Day, the Guardian has joined forces with hundreds of newsrooms around the world to focus attention on creative solutions to the climate emergency. Great reads Behind every great man: how Kim\u2019s sister crafts his image Kim Yo-jong is now thought to be the single most important figure in the North Korean regime besides her brother, the country\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. As Justin McCurry reports, Kim is allowing his sister and top propagandist to become his \u201calter ego\u201d. Elliot Gould: \u2018Of course I smoked marijuana!\u2019 The star of M*A*S*H and The Long Goodbye is still winning new fans, including for his role in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s pandemic thriller, Contagion. Now 81, Gould tells Elle Hunt: \u201cSometimes things work, sometimes things don\u2019t work, and we learn from it.\u201d Why Deepwater Horizon could happen again, a decade on It has been precisely 10 years since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. But with Obama-era rules having been loosened under Trump, there is every chance of a similar environmental catastrophe occurring today, as Emily Holden reports. Opinion: Activists can still push for change in a pandemic The global lockdowns have brought an unprecedented era of street protest to an abrupt halt. But researchers say the crisis has also sparked new forms of activism, which could prove just as powerful. In just several weeks\u2019 time, we\u2019ve identified nearly 100 distinct methods of nonviolent action that include physical, virtual and hybrid actions \u2013 and we\u2019re still counting. Far from condemning social movements to obsolescence, the pandemic \u2013 and governments\u2019 responses to it \u2013 are spawning new tools, new strategies, and new motivation to push for change. Last Thing: the top 10 toasties of all time The lockdown has left many of us obsessed with bread, which makes sandwiches the logical next step. And why eat a sandwich, when you could eat a toasted sandwich? From grilled cheese to Snickers, Zoe Williams presents her run-down of history\u2019s greatest toasties.

      "bodyText": "US hostility to the World Health Organization scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic. In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics. The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and China in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides. Donald Trump has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body\u2019s China-centric approach, reflected \u2013 in his view \u2013 by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for Saudi Arabia, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting. A six-paragraph statement made no mention of the WHO, but referred to systemic weaknesses in the way in which the world handled pandemics. However, an unpublished 52-paragraph draft communique supported and committed to further strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating the fight against the pandemic, including the protection of frontline health workers and delivery of medical supplies, especially diagnostic tools, medicines and vaccines. The draft also expressed \u201cconcern about the continuity and lack of sustainable funding\u201d of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme. It urged all donors to invest in the fund, saying \u201cit is far more cost effective to invest in sustainable financing for country preparedness than to pay to the costs of responding to outbreaks\u201d. Several days before the meeting it had emerged that the US health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, would not be attending as scheduled. Other attendees said they understood that Trump did not want him to participate. Instead, the US was represented by Eric Hargan, Azar\u2019s deputy, and another US official. Sherpas for other delegations were also made aware before the meeting of US objections to language relating to the WHO, which was supported by the 19 other countries. According to those present, many of the representatives at the meeting spoke of the key role being played by the WHO and praised the value of the guidance it has issued during the outbreak. Sources said that some representatives also made the point that any inquest into the handling of the pandemic by the WHO \u2013 as demanded by the Trump administration \u2013 should wait until after the pandemic was brought under control. When the US delegation\u2019s turn came to speak, Hargan explained that the US \u201ccould not endorse\u201d the declaration, instead suggesting that a summary be issued in the form of a press release. The bulk of the draft communique constituted a call for countries to cooperate multilaterally to prevent future pandemics, highlighting the current inequality in health resources and the human suffering the pandemic was causing. The draft contained no implicit or explicit criticism of China\u2019s initial handling of the crisis, saying instead all sides were committed to learning lessons from the crisis, including the vulnerabilities exposed by the global response. Donald Trump last week suspended US payments to the WHO claiming the organisation was too \u201cChina-centric\u201d and accused its leadership of failing to alert the world to the scale of the pandemic that began in Wuhan until it was too late. The WHO has insisted it acted as soon as it had information from Beijing and stated that it needed Chinese support to gain access to China, and investigate the issue of human-to-human transmission. David Nabarro, the WHO special envoy, warned on Monday that cutting funding in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic is \u201clike removing the right hand of a surgeon when she is in the middle of a difficult operation.\u201d The US has previously prevented the G7, a smaller group of mainly western industrialised countries, from reaching a joint position when foreign ministers were unable to agree with a US insistence that the virus be described as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d. Saudi Arabia is this year\u2019s chair of the G20, and the main summit of world leaders is still scheduled to be held in Riyadh in November. In the run-up to that event specialist ministers meet to prepare parts of the final communique. The US is the second largest contributor to the WHO, and the sudden suspension of US payments for up to 90 days has infuriated other nations\u2019 health ministries, while easing some of the pressure on China over its handling of the crisis.

In the latest intervention to cushion the unfolding economic blow, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the financial package would help support technology and life sciences firms so they could continue to develop innovative products, powering UK growth in future. He said the mix of government loans, grants and private sector-matched funding would help companies access capital at a difficult moment, adding: \u201cOur startups and businesses driving research and development are one of our great economic strengths, and will help power our growth out of the coronavirus crisis.\u201d The package comes on top of billions of pounds of support announced by Sunak to support businesses through the Covid-19 pandemic, as the government\u2019s lockdown measures effectively shut down large chunks of the economy. However, ministers have faced criticism for not moving quickly enough. Concerns have also been raised over gaps in the safety net, raising the risk of higher rates of business failures and unemployment across Britain. The announcement comes on the day the government\u2019s job retention scheme opens to applications, with the system expected to face significant demand as employers submit claims to furlough millions of workers. The centrepiece of the latest financial package announced by the chancellor is a \u00a3500m loan scheme called the Future Fund, which will provide UK-based companies with between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a35m from the government, with private investors at least matching the government commitment. Distributed through the British Business Bank, the loans will convert into shares in the companies receiving them if they are not repaid. The government plans to offer \u00a3250m until the end of September before reviewing the scheme. A further \u00a3750m of grants and loans will also be made available for UK companies involved in intensive research and development of new technologies, with funding channeled through Innovate UK, the government body for supporting business research projects. The government said the innovation agency would \u201caccelerate\u201d up to \u00a3200m in payments to 2,500 existing customers, while \u00a3550m will also be made available to increase support to these firms. About 1,200 hi-tech firms in Britain not in receipt of Innovate UK funding will be offered \u00a3175,000.",

      "body": "<p>Priti Patel is facing legal action under whistleblowing laws after her former permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam lodged an employment tribunal claim on Monday saying he was forced from his job for exposing her bullying behaviour.</p> <p>Rutnam claims he was constructively dismissed from his role as Home Office permanent secretary after informing the Cabinet Office that Patel had belittled officials in meetings and made unreasonable demands on staff.</p> <p>The development will increase pressure on Patel, who has denied claims that she bullied civil servants in three government departments, and on Boris Johnson, who has publicly backed his home secretary. She is also the subject of a Cabinet Office inquiry into her behaviour.</p> <p>It is the first time that Rutnam has said he will make a claim of \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d under whistleblowing laws and the first time that a secretary of state has been sued by a former permanent secretary.</p> <p>Another consequence of a whistleblowing claim means that instead of a ceiling of \u00a385,000 on Rutnam\u2019s claim, there will be no upper limit to any damages he might receive.</p> <p>Announcing the start of the legal action, the general secretary of the civil service union the FDA, Dave Penman, told the Guardian: \u201cThis morning Sir Philip, with the support of his legal team and the FDA, submitted a claim to the employment tribunal for constructive dismissal and whistleblowing against the home secretary. Sir Philip will not be making any further comment at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Rutnam\u2019s claim is expected to focus on Patel\u2019s treatment of senior civil servants in the Home Office. According to reports, a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with Patel. Patel is understood to have successfully asked for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job.</p> <p>Rutnam subsequently wrote to all senior civil servants in the department highlighting the dangers of workplace stress. He also made clear that they could not be expected to do unrealistic work outside office hours.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f76d86c816ac6a4cfac215c4eed14b5a8e4ad56f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f76d86c816ac6a4cfac215c4eed14b5a8e4ad56f/0_0_2890_1734/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Philip Rutman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Philip Rutman addressing the home affairs select committee in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a report in the Times highlighted tensions between Rutnam and Patel, sources close to Patel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/01/priti-patel-bullying-row-explosive-briefings-that-may-resurface-in-rutnam-legal-case\">were quoted in several newspapers</a> as saying that Rutnam should resign. An article in the Times said he should be stripped of his pension, another in the Telegraph said he was nicknamed Dr No for negative ideas, while one in the Sun compared him to Eeyore.</p> <p>At that time the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson had full confidence in the home secretary and in the civil service, though the same guarantee was not given to Rutnam specifically.</p> <p>Rutnam resigned on 29 February, reading a hastily arranged statement outside his home. In the statement, he accused Patel of orchestrating a \u201cvicious\u201d campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department.</p> <p>Rutnam is expected to be represented by Gavin Mansfield QC, the head of Littleton Chambers and an employment law specialist. He will be supported by Clive Howard from the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon.</p> <p>Patel would be expected to appear as a witness, along with her special advisers, and the government would be asked for full disclosure of emails and correspondence between Patel, her staff, the Cabinet Office and No 10. </p> <p>Bruce Carr, a leading QC and former government adviser on employment legislation, said the significance of a whistleblowing claim was that the compensation would be uncapped, unlike an ordinary unfair dismissal claim.</p> <p>\u201cRutnam will have to show that he made a \u2018protected disclosure\u2019 \u2013 such as a disclosure of information showing there has been a breach of a legal obligation. This could include an allegation that others had been bullied, which would amount to a breach of their contract of employment.

      "bodyText": "Priti Patel is facing legal action under whistleblowing laws after her former permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam lodged an employment tribunal claim on Monday saying he was forced from his job for exposing her bullying behaviour. Rutnam claims he was constructively dismissed from his role as Home Office permanent secretary after informing the Cabinet Office that Patel had belittled officials in meetings and made unreasonable demands on staff. The development will increase pressure on Patel, who has denied claims that she bullied civil servants in three government departments, and on Boris Johnson, who has publicly backed his home secretary. She is also the subject of a Cabinet Office inquiry into her behaviour. It is the first time that Rutnam has said he will make a claim of \u201cprotected disclosure\u201d under whistleblowing laws and the first time that a secretary of state has been sued by a former permanent secretary. Another consequence of a whistleblowing claim means that instead of a ceiling of \u00a385,000 on Rutnam\u2019s claim, there will be no upper limit to any damages he might receive. Announcing the start of the legal action, the general secretary of the civil service union the FDA, Dave Penman, told the Guardian: \u201cThis morning Sir Philip, with the support of his legal team and the FDA, submitted a claim to the employment tribunal for constructive dismissal and whistleblowing against the home secretary. Sir Philip will not be making any further comment at this time.\u201d Rutnam\u2019s claim is expected to focus on Patel\u2019s treatment of senior civil servants in the Home Office. According to reports, a senior Home Office official collapsed after a fractious meeting with Patel. Patel is understood to have successfully asked for another senior official in the department to be moved from their job. Rutnam subsequently wrote to all senior civil servants in the department highlighting the dangers of workplace stress. He also made clear that they could not be expected to do unrealistic work outside office hours. After a report in the Times highlighted tensions between Rutnam and Patel, sources close to Patel were quoted in several newspapers as saying that Rutnam should resign. An article in the Times said he should be stripped of his pension, another in the Telegraph said he was nicknamed Dr No for negative ideas, while one in the Sun compared him to Eeyore. At that time the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Johnson had full confidence in the home secretary and in the civil service, though the same guarantee was not given to Rutnam specifically. Rutnam resigned on 29 February, reading a hastily arranged statement outside his home. In the statement, he accused Patel of orchestrating a \u201cvicious\u201d campaign against him, of lying about her involvement in it and of creating a climate of fear in her department. Rutnam is expected to be represented by Gavin Mansfield QC, the head of Littleton Chambers and an employment law specialist. He will be supported by Clive Howard from the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon. Patel would be expected to appear as a witness, along with her special advisers, and the government would be asked for full disclosure of emails and correspondence between Patel, her staff, the Cabinet Office and No 10. Bruce Carr, a leading QC and former government adviser on employment legislation, said the significance of a whistleblowing claim was that the compensation would be uncapped, unlike an ordinary unfair dismissal claim. \u201cRutnam will have to show that he made a \u2018protected disclosure\u2019 \u2013 such as a disclosure of information showing there has been a breach of a legal obligation. This could include an allegation that others had been bullied, which would amount to a breach of their contract of employment. It could also include an allegation that a minister had breached the ministerial code,\u201d he said. The ministerial code states: \u201cThere must be no bullying and no harassment.\u201d A Cabinet Office inquiry into the allegations of bullying and Rutnam\u2019s resignation is being carried out by Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister\u2019s independent adviser on ministers\u2019 interests. He will decide whether Patel broke any rules. However, the final say rests with Johnson, who can overrule Allan and keep his findings secret. Despite holding one of the four great offices of state during a national pandemic, Patel has rarely been seen in public since the allegations of bullying emerged in February. She has made one appearance at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, and was criticised after saying she was sorry if people felt there had been a failure to supply sufficient personal protective equipment to NHS staff. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe do not comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d Patel\u2019s office has been approached for a comment.",

To mark <a href=\"https://www.fashionrevolution.org/\">Fashion Revolution Week</a>, the organisation, who are focused on creating an ethical and sustainable way forward for fashion, are exploring new models of behaviour for clothes lovers across the globe. At the start of this special week we celebrate 10 tales of long-lasting love for favourite items.</p> <h2><strong>Nikki Redcliffe</strong></h2> <p>My name is Nikki and I\u2019m an addict. A vintage clothing addict. Asking me to write a love story to just one garment is like asking me to pick my favourite child. I have an awful lot of clothes and I love them all.</p> <p>During the coronavirus lockdown my massive vintage wardrobe has been a source of endless comfort and joy. I\u2019ve been able to play, guilt free, in my dressing room to my heart\u2019s content and a couple of nights a week my partner and I \u201cdress for dinner\u201d. Even if dinner is only a bowl of pasta we don our finest threads and make it a special event.</p> <p>I\u2019ve picked this late 1950s red taffeta cocktail frock by Suzy Perette for its sheer joie de vivre. Suzy Perette had a licence to make copies of Christian Dior designs in the US in the 50s and I have several examples in my collection. All are impeccably made and although they are about the same age as me the dresses are still as good as new. This dress is always ready for a party.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08668baa7a2adea2bae2593296660591a2488d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08668baa7a2adea2bae2593296660591a2488d3d/0_0_1440_1651/872.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Redcliffe in her late 1950s red taffeta cocktail dress by US label Suzy Perette\" width=\"872\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Party piece: Nicola Redcliffe in her late 1950s red taffeta cocktail dress by Suzy Perette.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicola Redcliffe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Clothes can have such a dramatic effect on mood and dressing up definitely makes me feel happier.

It\u2019s also a historic emblem of sustainability through fashion. Saris are simply extended pieces of material you adorn your body with, in a myriad of ways. It can be worn when washing the dishes, going for a walk or to your own wedding. They\u2019re timeless and generous in the stories they lend.</p> <p>One of my favourite saris is this red and green georgette number. I\u2019ve worn it to a Mehndi ceremony and also when visiting Bangladesh recently. When I bought it, for \u00a325 in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/apr/03/east-shopping-centre-europes-first-boutique-asian-arcade\">Green Street</a>, I knew we would be friends for a while. This sari will be shared, so my nieces and children, inshallah, will also wear it. Just like other parts of my culture, it\u2019s a tribute to all those women in Bangladesh and their skills in making something beautiful and made to last.</p> <h2><strong>Dina Doerfel</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3ef072b81d25ea1e06057887646830a2cf86749a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ef072b81d25ea1e06057887646830a2cf86749a/0_0_1500_2000/750.jpg\" alt=\"Dina Doerfel in the tailored blazer her mum made for her 30 years ago\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Office romance: Dina Doerfel in the tailored blazer her mum made for her 30 years ago.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dina Doerfel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1990 I found myself, at the age of 30, in a job that required \u201cprofessional office wear\u201d.

My parents were not keen on kidswear bikinis, so when I was gifted this one, aged seven, on a camping trip in the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall, by a lady it no longer fitted, I was ecstatic. I have been wearing it ever since.</p> <p>In 1998, the bikini travelled to Nevis, the Caribbean. Despite my mother saying it was ballooning and did not fit, I remember swimming in the warm sea with my friends and jumping off a fallen palm tree.</p> <p>I\u2019ve grown up in and with this bikini. I played in it as a child, chatted with friends in the mountains wearing it and romanced on the beach. Wearing it now, I\u2019ve pondered existential questions and accepted that stretch marks are here to stay. It\u2019s joined me for a beachside dance and a chance holiday romance.</p> <p>I am happy to say that today, over 20 years on, it\u2019s still a good friend and that my clothing love story has not reached the end.</p> <h2><strong>Lily Pearmain</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00d91d0e527e37afa8c31f95c79e9defca5d75e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00d91d0e527e37afa8c31f95c79e9defca5d75e6/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lily Pearmain in her work overalls\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Function junction: Lily Pearmain in her work overalls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lily Pearmain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t think about my work overalls when I put them on. I don\u2019t think about how they make me feel or the fabric or the fit. That\u2019s simply because they are an extension of me. I\u2019m not trying to prove anything when I put them on, there\u2019s absolutely nothing aspirational about them. They just signal \u201cwork, now\u201d.</p> <p>Trying to work without them just feels wrong. I took all three pairs home for a wash recently, and felt at a loss at the studio the next day without them, barely getting a single thing done. I can only conclude that the overalls are integral to my mindset and work.</p> <h2><strong>Laura Nash</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e087acf43e2aece1eb0e24d8e028b8f12ba877b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e087acf43e2aece1eb0e24d8e028b8f12ba877b9/0_0_962_640/500.jpg\" alt=\"Roman (right) in the waistcoat worn by his dad (left).\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacket required: Roman (right) in the waistcoat worn by his dad (left).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Nash</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When my son, Roman, was born, my mother-in-law gave me a bundle of beautiful hand-me-down baby clothes, all lovingly handcrafted by her mother. The clothes had been worn by my husband and his sisters in the mid-1980s.</p> <p>I\u2019m particularly fond of this little waistcoat which is now a staple in Roman\u2019s spring wardrobe. Not only is it beautifully made, it is also reversible with a blue paisley pattern on one side and red flowers on the other.</p> <p>It has been so special to dress Roman in these clothes as he is growing, knowing that they were worn by his dad and aunties and have stood the test of time. Now his aunty Lily is taking the baton during isolation and has made Roman some fabulous yellow plaid trousers to add to the archive. Who knows, maybe Roman\u2019s children will wear them one day.</p> <h2><strong>Orsola de Castro</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"342e161b05db52a98f9e174e12de4b743b7af4d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/342e161b05db52a98f9e174e12de4b743b7af4d2/0_0_3024_4032/750.jpg\" alt=\"Orsola de Castro\u2019s map dress draped over the side of a bath with a yellow tiled wall behind.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">World view: Orsola de Castro\u2019s map dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Orsola de Castro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is my love story for a map dress which I have worn hundreds of times. Here it is, refreshed and ready for another day on my body.</p> <p>When I first bought it, I kept it exclusively for the evening, wearing it with my grandmother\u2019s pearl necklace and monster heels. Many times after wild nights out (or in) I woke up still in it.</p> <p>After a few years it graduated from evening to daytime wear \u2013 but still for special occasions only. However, I always knew that I wanted to wear it as a nightie / Sunday slouch, so I have been waiting for some kind of tear, or an indelible stain to appear.</p> <p>But it\u2019s so well made, so easy to care for (a quick steam under the shower and a lick of sponge and it\u2019s all new again) that zero damage has occurred. And so now, in the midst of lockdown, I wait no more, self permission granted, and I wear it every day \u2013 my trusted friend, my second skin, my clothing hero.</p> <p><br><em><a href=\"https://www.fashionrevolution.org/\">Fashion Revolution Week</a></em><em> </em><em>takes place 20</em><em>-26 April.</em></p> <p><em>Share your own Clothing Love Story <a href=\"https://issuu.com/fashionrevolution/docs/fr_2020_getinvolved_lovestory-comingsoon\">here</a>.</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020.

That\u2019s simply because they are an extension of me. I\u2019m not trying to prove anything when I put them on, there\u2019s absolutely nothing aspirational about them. They just signal \u201cwork, now\u201d. Trying to work without them just feels wrong. I took all three pairs home for a wash recently, and felt at a loss at the studio the next day without them, barely getting a single thing done. I can only conclude that the overalls are integral to my mindset and work. Laura Nash When my son, Roman, was born, my mother-in-law gave me a bundle of beautiful hand-me-down baby clothes, all lovingly handcrafted by her mother. The clothes had been worn by my husband and his sisters in the mid-1980s. I\u2019m particularly fond of this little waistcoat which is now a staple in Roman\u2019s spring wardrobe. Not only is it beautifully made, it is also reversible with a blue paisley pattern on one side and red flowers on the other. It has been so special to dress Roman in these clothes as he is growing, knowing that they were worn by his dad and aunties and have stood the test of time. Now his aunty Lily is taking the baton during isolation and has made Roman some fabulous yellow plaid trousers to add to the archive. Who knows, maybe Roman\u2019s children will wear them one day. Orsola de Castro This is my love story for a map dress which I have worn hundreds of times. Here it is, refreshed and ready for another day on my body. When I first bought it, I kept it exclusively for the evening, wearing it with my grandmother\u2019s pearl necklace and monster heels. Many times after wild nights out (or in) I woke up still in it. After a few years it graduated from evening to daytime wear \u2013 but still for special occasions only. However, I always knew that I wanted to wear it as a nightie / Sunday slouch, so I have been waiting for some kind of tear, or an indelible stain to appear. But it\u2019s so well made, so easy to care for (a quick steam under the shower and a lick of sponge and it\u2019s all new again) that zero damage has occurred. And so now, in the midst of lockdown, I wait no more, self permission granted, and I wear it every day \u2013 my trusted friend, my second skin, my clothing hero.

A number of beef and pork plants have also been given waivers, including a <a href=\"https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/usda-prioritizes-privatizing-beef-slaughter-inspection-over-food-safety-during-pandemic\">beef plant</a> in Kansas in late March. The move will allow the additional chicken factories to slaughter as many as 175 birds a minute \u2013 the equivalent of 3 per second.<br><br>A union representing federal food safety inspectors <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/usda-approves-poultry-slaughterhouse-increase-line-speed-food-safety/\">has said</a> faster lines will make it harder to catch \u201cpathology that shouldn\u2019t be going out to the consumers\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no way that food safety is not compromised when the sole trained government inspector on the slaughter line in a chicken plant is expected to examine three birds every second,\u201d said Tony Corbo, senior government affairs representative at Food &amp; Water Watch. \u201cThe US government has stepped on the accelerator to grant these waivers while everyone is concentrating on the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d<br><br>A spokesperson for the FSIS accused campaigners of \u201cspreading fear among the American public\u201d. \u201cThe agency\u2019s decisions [on granting line speed waiver requests] are based on data gathered under the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)-based Inspection Models Project (HIMP) pilot study. The 20-year pilot showed that online inspectors in HIMP young chicken establishments were able to conduct an effective online inspection of each carcass when operating at a line speed of up to 175 bpm and that HIMP establishments were able to control for pathogens at the line speeds authorized under HIMP.\u201d</p> <p>Increased line speeds are supported by the poultry industry, which argues they do not represent additional risk to food or workers safety, and are necessary to remain financially competitive. Three years ago the National Chicken Council <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7734f5cf-05d9-4f89-a7eb-6d85037ad2a7/17-05-Petition-National-Chicken-Council-09012017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\">lobbied</a> the government to scrap line speed limits completely, calling them \u201carbitrary\u201d.</p> <p>Under traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/5bd6c2c0-5e37-4397-9ed4-2468c2168557/2018-0014.htm?MOD=AJPERES\">individual regulatory waivers</a> enabling line speed increases.<br><br>\u201cIt potentially reduces some of the quality control efforts, but I am not concerned about worker safety as a result of the increased line speeds. Some plants are actually reducing speeds because of employee absenteeism,\u201d said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst at IHS Markit\u2019s Agribusiness Intelligence.</p> <h2>\u2018People are getting sick from our poultry production\u2019</h2> <p>The line speed increases come as Guardian data analysis reveals that at least one in 10 US poultry slaughterhouses failed government salmonella tests last year. In some categories, failure rates are as high as 34%.</p> <p>Targets to reduce salmonella disease outbreaks have also been missed, with a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6816a2.htm?s_cid=mm6816a2_w#T1_down\">rise of </a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6816a2.htm?s_cid=mm6816a2_w#T1_down\">9% in the incidence rate</a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6816a2.htm?s_cid=mm6816a2_w#T1_down\"> over the last three years</a> according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p> <p>Campaigners have filed <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/d2a7c76e-dda9-475d-bf35-4cb69f5fca24/20-01-marler-011920.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\">a petition</a> with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), demanding that it declare certain types of salmonella in meat products adulterants (meaning producers have an obligation to withhold contaminated batches), because they \u201cconstitute an imminent threat to public health necessitating prompt agency action\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.</p> <footer> <cite>Tony Corbo</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been playing around with these standards for 20 years now,\u201d said Corbo, one of the parties to the petition, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t seem to be working in terms of reducing the amount of food-borne illness in this country. People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.\u201d</p> <p>The FSIS has made attempts to bring down salmonella levels and reduce food-borne illness. The FSIS pointed out to the Guardian that the number of establishments in category three [it has a rating system to encourage improvement] has been halved since 2017. But a Guardian analysis of the FSIS\u2019s reports for the last year shows that for chicken carcass plants, an average 11.8% of inspected plants still failed the standard. </p> <p> </p> <p>In 2011, when the FSIS <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/65602d92-d017-4edc-8536-5ed6aaa6b52a/Strategic_Plan_2011-2016.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\">set a target</a> to reduce food-borne illness, the incidence level for salmonella was estimated at around 16.4 people per 100,000.

      "bodyText": "The US government is accelerating controversial regulatory rollbacks to speed up production at meat plants, as companies express growing alarm at the impact of Covid-19 on their operations. Last week Smithfield shut down one of the largest pork plants in the country after hundreds of employees contracted the coronavirus. The plant in South Dakota \u2013 whose output represents 4\u20135% of US pork production \u2013 is reported to be the largest single-source coronavirus hotspot in the US, with more than 600 cases. In response, the company said it was \u201ccritical\u201d for the meat industry to \u201ccontinue to operate unabated\u201d. Now it has emerged that as a wave of plants announce closures, US meat plants are being granted permission to increase the speed of their production lines. This comes despite warnings that the waivers for higher speeds on slaughter and processing lines will compromise food safety. The latest line speed increases, announced by the Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) mean 11 poultry plants have been given waivers to operate higher line speeds in the past fortnight. A number of beef and pork plants have also been given waivers, including a beef plant in Kansas in late March. The move will allow the additional chicken factories to slaughter as many as 175 birds a minute \u2013 the equivalent of 3 per second. A union representing federal food safety inspectors has said faster lines will make it harder to catch \u201cpathology that shouldn\u2019t be going out to the consumers\u201d. \u201cThere is no way that food safety is not compromised when the sole trained government inspector on the slaughter line in a chicken plant is expected to examine three birds every second,\u201d said Tony Corbo, senior government affairs representative at Food &amp; Water Watch. \u201cThe US government has stepped on the accelerator to grant these waivers while everyone is concentrating on the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d A spokesperson for the FSIS accused campaigners of \u201cspreading fear among the American public\u201d. \u201cThe agency\u2019s decisions [on granting line speed waiver requests] are based on data gathered under the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP)-based Inspection Models Project (HIMP) pilot study. The 20-year pilot showed that online inspectors in HIMP young chicken establishments were able to conduct an effective online inspection of each carcass when operating at a line speed of up to 175 bpm and that HIMP establishments were able to control for pathogens at the line speeds authorized under HIMP.\u201d Increased line speeds are supported by the poultry industry, which argues they do not represent additional risk to food or workers safety, and are necessary to remain financially competitive. Three years ago the National Chicken Council lobbied the government to scrap line speed limits completely, calling them \u201carbitrary\u201d. Under traditional poultry processing rules, line speeds ran at 140 birds a minute, and required at least four inspectors to be stationed on each line, tasked with checking carcasses for defects, disease or contamination, including fecal matter which can cause salmonella. That has since been reduced to one inspector per line, with individual regulatory waivers enabling line speed increases. \u201cIt potentially reduces some of the quality control efforts, but I am not concerned about worker safety as a result of the increased line speeds. Some plants are actually reducing speeds because of employee absenteeism,\u201d said Adam Speck, a senior commodity analyst at IHS Markit\u2019s Agribusiness Intelligence. \u2018People are getting sick from our poultry production\u2019 The line speed increases come as Guardian data analysis reveals that at least one in 10 US poultry slaughterhouses failed government salmonella tests last year. In some categories, failure rates are as high as 34%. Targets to reduce salmonella disease outbreaks have also been missed, with a rise of 9% in the incidence rate over the last three years according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Campaigners have filed a petition with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), demanding that it declare certain types of salmonella in meat products adulterants (meaning producers have an obligation to withhold contaminated batches), because they \u201cconstitute an imminent threat to public health necessitating prompt agency action\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing around with these standards for 20 years now,\u201d said Corbo, one of the parties to the petition, \u201cand it doesn\u2019t seem to be working in terms of reducing the amount of food-borne illness in this country. People are getting sick from our poultry production system, and we think that is a public health emergency.\u201d The FSIS has made attempts to bring down salmonella levels and reduce food-borne illness. The FSIS pointed out to the Guardian that the number of establishments in category three [it has a rating system to encourage improvement] has been halved since 2017. But a Guardian analysis of the FSIS\u2019s reports for the last year shows that for chicken carcass plants, an average 11.8% of inspected plants still failed the standard. In 2011, when the FSIS set a target to reduce food-borne illness, the incidence level for salmonella was estimated at around 16.4 people per 100,000. The FSIS\u2019s plan aimed to reduce that number to 11.4 by this year, but instead, after a small decline over five years, it has now risen to 18.3, according to a CDC spokesperson. Outbreak numbers are rising too. A report by US consumer organisation PIRG found that meat and poultry recalls are up by 65% since 2013. Meanwhile a report by the CDC highlighted the rise in antibiotic-resistant salmonella as a serious threat that requires \u201cprompt and sustained action\u201d. A spokesperson for the Chicken Council disagreed with criticisms of the sector. He told the Guardian: \u201cNo one wants to reduce salmonella more than the companies producing our food. Our families eat the same chicken.\u201d The council opposes the petition, he stated. \u201cWe agree with FSIS, and previous court rulings, that a science-based, multitiered approach aimed at reducing all salmonella on raw meat and poultry products results in a more appropriate and effective use of agency resources compared to a separate and specific focus on specific individual strains.\u201d Campaigners say the FSIS is limited in its ability to keep US meat and poultry healthy. A critical report on the FSIS by the US Government Accountability Office in 2018 stated that a review of data had shown that \u201csome plants are still not meeting pathogen standards \u2013 in some cases repeatedly not meeting the standards \u2013 and are allowed to operate\u201d. It also pointed out that the agency still had no mandatory recall authority.",

Three of the books \u2013 The Discomfort of Evening by Dutch newcomer Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree by Iran\u2019s Shokoofeh Azar, and The Adventures of China Iron by Argentina\u2019s Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara \u2013 have sold fewer than 1,000 copies.</p> <p>Most of the publishers of the shortlisted books appealed to the Booker Prize Foundation, the charity that oversees the prize, to delay this year\u2019s award. Daniela Petracco at Europa Editions, which published Azar\u2019s novel, was one of them.</p> <p>\u201cWe talked to Faber and some other of the shortlisted publishers and found there was agreement on approaching the Booker Foundation with the suggestion to postpone to a more propitious moment, at a time when booksellers \u2013 independents and chains \u2013 can make the most of it and readers can easily get their hands on the books,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Booker Foundation were already considering a postponement as it turns out, so there was broad agreement there.\u201d</p> <p>Jacques Testard of Fitzcarraldo, the publisher of previous International Booker winner and Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk, said the book trade \u201chas all but shut down in recent weeks\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cA winner announcement in May, in the current context, would have been a bit bittersweet for the winners, who might not have had a chance to enjoy their success as they might another year. We\u2019re grateful to the Booker Foundation for taking this decision.\u201d</p> <p>Gaby Wood, the foundation\u2019s literary director, said: \u201cAfter careful consideration, we\u2019ve decided on this course of action to ensure that the shortlist, and ultimately the winner, can be celebrated at a time when readership of these exceptional novels is made easier for everyone. As the world begins to recover, their contents will be found all the more rewarding for being, in effect, a form of travel.\u201d</p> <p>The shortlisted books are: Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor, translated from Spanish by Sophie Hughes; Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara\u2019s The Adventures of China Iron, translated from Spanish by Iona Macintyre and Fiona Mackintosh; Azar\u2019s The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, translated from Farsi by an anonymous translator; Rijneveld\u2019s The Discomfort of Evening, translated from Dutch by Michele Hutchinson; Ogawa\u2019s The Memory Police, translated from Japanese by Stephen Snyder; and Daniel Kehlmann\u2019s Tyll, translated from German by Ross Benjamin.</p> <p>A new date for the International Booker winner announcement will be revealed later in the year.</p> <p>The announcement of the winner of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/orange-prize-for-fiction\">Women\u2019s prize for fiction</a> has also been postponed, from June to September.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The six authors up for this year\u2019s International Booker prize will have to wait a little longer to find out who won. The announcement has been postponed until the summer due to the severe impact of the coronavirus outbreak on book sales. The winner of the \u00a350,000 award for the best novel translated into English, shared equally between author and translator, was due to be announced on 19 May. But prize organisers say that the announcement of the shortlist on 2 April exposed the difficulties that readers were having getting hold of books during the lockdown. Only one of the shortlisted books, Japanese author Y\u014dko Ogawa\u2019s novel The Memory Police, has sold more than 5,000 copies. Three of the books \u2013 The Discomfort of Evening by Dutch newcomer Marieke Lucas Rijneveld, The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree by Iran\u2019s Shokoofeh Azar, and The Adventures of China Iron by Argentina\u2019s Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara \u2013 have sold fewer than 1,000 copies. Most of the publishers of the shortlisted books appealed to the Booker Prize Foundation, the charity that oversees the prize, to delay this year\u2019s award. Daniela Petracco at Europa Editions, which published Azar\u2019s novel, was one of them. \u201cWe talked to Faber and some other of the shortlisted publishers and found there was agreement on approaching the Booker Foundation with the suggestion to postpone to a more propitious moment, at a time when booksellers \u2013 independents and chains \u2013 can make the most of it and readers can easily get their hands on the books,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Booker Foundation were already considering a postponement as it turns out, so there was broad agreement there.\u201d Jacques Testard of Fitzcarraldo, the publisher of previous International Booker winner and Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk, said the book trade \u201chas all but shut down in recent weeks\u201d. He added: \u201cA winner announcement in May, in the current context, would have been a bit bittersweet for the winners, who might not have had a chance to enjoy their success as they might another year. We\u2019re grateful to the Booker Foundation for taking this decision.\u201d Gaby Wood, the foundation\u2019s literary director, said: \u201cAfter careful consideration, we\u2019ve decided on this course of action to ensure that the shortlist, and ultimately the winner, can be celebrated at a time when readership of these exceptional novels is made easier for everyone. As the world begins to recover, their contents will be found all the more rewarding for being, in effect, a form of travel.\u201d The shortlisted books are: Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor, translated from Spanish by Sophie Hughes; Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara\u2019s The Adventures of China Iron, translated from Spanish by Iona Macintyre and Fiona Mackintosh; Azar\u2019s The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, translated from Farsi by an anonymous translator; Rijneveld\u2019s The Discomfort of Evening, translated from Dutch by Michele Hutchinson; Ogawa\u2019s The Memory Police, translated from Japanese by Stephen Snyder; and Daniel Kehlmann\u2019s Tyll, translated from German by Ross Benjamin. A new date for the International Booker winner announcement will be revealed later in the year. The announcement of the winner of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction has also been postponed, from June to September.",

Kaine says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The airline has two decades of providing decent jobs, a safe working environment and excellent service for the travelling public. It is a viable and much needed business and without it Australia will struggle to get its economy back on track once the crisis abates. There is still time for the federal government to work on an investment plan to get through this period of crisis and taxpayers will get a double benefit. </p> \n   <p>The government will retain a competitive aviation market and they will get a return on their equity stake.</p> \n   <p>The prime minister has promoted the concept of hibernation, of keeping viable businesses afloat through this crisis. That must include Virgin and the only way to do that is a government equity stake in this business.</p> \n   <p>Countries around the world have recognised the extraordinary circumstances that the aviation is in and where they have stepped in and saved jobs. If the federal government does not move to save Virgin the prime minister must explain why Virgin workers don\u2019t matter? Why don\u2019t their families who depend on them matter?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The union said it had urged the Victorian, NSW and Federal Governments to financially assist Virgin, following a pledge by the Queensland Premier for $200m aid for the airline.</p> \n  <p>A letter from the union read:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While all of Australia is experiencing the stresses of altered life, with many people stood down from their jobs, the anxiety among Virgin staff is heightened given the airline\u2019s difficulties and the fact that they worsen in a very public way on a daily basis. </p> \n   <p>We ask that you consider these workers and to examine your state\u2019s capacity to give them and their families the certainty they need about their future. We believe it is also in the interest of the travelling public that Virgin remains a viable airline to ensure an efficient, reliable service right across Australia. A monopoly by one airline after this crisis ends will hamper the nation\u2019s ability to restart and get back to where it was.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T09:39:05.446Z\">at 10.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d62bc8f08bade1f29661f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-butler\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T08:54:47.691Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Paul Scurrah is to keep his job as chief executive of Virgin Australia, at least for the short term, when insolvency practitioners from Deloitte are appointed as administrators, Guardian Australia understands.</p> \n  <p>The shape of the administration, which has yet to be confirmed by Virgin Australia, is still far from clear.</p> \n  <p>But as we\u2019ve previously reported at least one bidder, BGH Capital, thinks something can be salvaged from the collapse.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78e6ba6d025fe4102485b72e9406ebfd367d9034\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78e6ba6d025fe4102485b72e9406ebfd367d9034/414_37_4132_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Virgin Australia CEO Paul Scurrah addressing shareholders in November 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Virgin Australia CEO Paul Scurrah addressing shareholders in November 2019.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Peled/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d5fa28f080ee110448124\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T08:43:38.549Z\">9.43am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Aussie stocks plunge in worst loss for three weeks</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australian stocks had their worst loss in three weeks.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pain out there today,\u201d CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy told AAP.</p> \n  <p>The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index finished Monday down 134.5 points, or 2.45%, to 5,353 points, while the All Ordinaries index was closed down 130 points, or 2.34 %, to 5,414.</p> \n  <p>AAP reports the plunge wiped out last week\u2019s gains and was the ASX200\u2019s worst loss since a 5.3% drop on March 27.</p> \n  <p>US oil benchmark was smashed to its lowest level since 1999, hitting energy stocks.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to close up our live Covid-19 coverage. Here are the day\u2019s key developments: The country recorded its lowest count of new cases since early March. WA, Qld and SA recorded zero new cases. Victoria and the ACT just one each, with NSW adding 6. Tasmania had 9 new cases. Reports that airline Virgin Australia could go into administration sparked fears for thousands of jobs. Australian stocks saw their worst drop in three weeks. Unemployment in Australia could hit 16% according to a report from think tank the Grattan Institute. National Rugby League CEO Todd Greenberg stepped down amidst a financial crisis for the game. Take care of yourselves, take care of others and stick to the rules. Have a good night. Jimmy Barnes is still knocking out tunes from his lounge room, with wife Jane on guitar. And so [adopts voice of 1970s radio disco jockey] here\u2019s Jimmy Barnes with Creedence Clearwater Revival\u2019s 1970 track Have You Ever Seen the Rain. Take it away Jimmy. The Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary Michael Kaine says reports airline Virgin Australia is heading for administration is a \u201cterrifying moment\u201d for thousands of workers. The TWU said a crisis roundtable had been held earlier on Friday with Virgin CEO Paul Scurrah and all trade unions representing airport workers. The TWU said the roundtable \u201cheard a call for the federal government to take an equity stake in return for bailing out airlines.\u201d In a statement just released, Kaine says if administrators are appointed, the federal government should work with them to find a solution. Kaine says: The airline has two decades of providing decent jobs, a safe working environment and excellent service for the travelling public. It is a viable and much needed business and without it Australia will struggle to get its economy back on track once the crisis abates. There is still time for the federal government to work on an investment plan to get through this period of crisis and taxpayers will get a double benefit. The government will retain a competitive aviation market and they will get a return on their equity stake. The prime minister has promoted the concept of hibernation, of keeping viable businesses afloat through this crisis. That must include Virgin and the only way to do that is a government equity stake in this business. Countries around the world have recognised the extraordinary circumstances that the aviation is in and where they have stepped in and saved jobs. If the federal government does not move to save Virgin the prime minister must explain why Virgin workers don\u2019t matter? Why don\u2019t their families who depend on them matter? The union said it had urged the Victorian, NSW and Federal Governments to financially assist Virgin, following a pledge by the Queensland Premier for $200m aid for the airline. A letter from the union read: While all of Australia is experiencing the stresses of altered life, with many people stood down from their jobs, the anxiety among Virgin staff is heightened given the airline\u2019s difficulties and the fact that they worsen in a very public way on a daily basis. We ask that you consider these workers and to examine your state\u2019s capacity to give them and their families the certainty they need about their future. We believe it is also in the interest of the travelling public that Virgin remains a viable airline to ensure an efficient, reliable service right across Australia. A monopoly by one airline after this crisis ends will hamper the nation\u2019s ability to restart and get back to where it was. Paul Scurrah is to keep his job as chief executive of Virgin Australia, at least for the short term, when insolvency practitioners from Deloitte are appointed as administrators, Guardian Australia understands. The shape of the administration, which has yet to be confirmed by Virgin Australia, is still far from clear. But as we\u2019ve previously reported at least one bidder, BGH Capital, thinks something can be salvaged from the collapse. Australian stocks had their worst loss in three weeks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pain out there today,\u201d CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy told AAP. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index finished Monday down 134.5 points, or 2.45%, to 5,353 points, while the All Ordinaries index was closed down 130 points, or 2.34 %, to 5,414. AAP reports the plunge wiped out last week\u2019s gains and was the ASX200\u2019s worst loss since a 5.3% drop on March 27. US oil benchmark was smashed to its lowest level since 1999, hitting energy stocks. Woodside Petroleum dropped 4.4% to $20.15, Santos fell 3.7% to $4.13 and Oil Search dropped 2.9% to $2.66. Caltex Australia fell 7.8%to $21.72 after Canada\u2019s Alimentation Couche-Tard put its $8.8bn takeover proposal on hold, given the uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic. No word yet from Virgin Australia regarding our report that the airline is headed for voluntary administration, with a company spokesman declining to comment. Administration doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the end for Virgin Australia - it, or potential buyers, could use the process to get rid of bits of the airline they don\u2019t like and shed some of its $4.8bn debt mountain. We set out one of the ways that could happen, a deed of company arrangement, here. Sources say one of the potential buyers, private equity group BGH Capital, is confident Virgin Australia will come out the other side. In what sort of shape is another question. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk made some comments earlier that rugby league fans might have missed. Asked about the State of Origin series and restarting the NRL season, she said: Of course we\u2019re open to look at any plan (but) there has been no plan submitted, there have been no phone calls. But in relation to the State of Origin, yes, of course I have spoken to the QRL and as I said from day one, towards the end of the year we would be open to that if the health advice said that we were in the situation to do so. Maybe the reason for the lack of contact from the game\u2019s administrators had something to do with today\u2019s revelations? Earlier today, the NRL announced it had parted with CEO Todd Greenberg as Covid-19 sends the game into a financial crisis. Here\u2019s more on that. Prof Peter Doherty, Australian immunologist and Nobel laureate, has been talking to the Australian Academy of Science about Covid-19, our immune systems and why some people may respond to the virus in different ways. In comments just released, Doherty says despite claims that many products you can buy from pharmacies can \u201cboost your immune system\u201d there\u2019s little evidence that any of them actually work. The best way to boost your immune system, he says, is just to stay fit and healthy and have a good diet. Doherty has also been talking about the history of vaccine developments and how things are progressing on that front for Covid-19. You can watch the whole 13-minute video here. With that, I will hand over to my colleague Graham Readfearn. Stay safe, stay well. There are alarming signs of a sharp slowdown in the property market thanks to the coronavirus, with the number of residential listings down nearly 30% for the month before Easter, and sharp drops in searches being conducted on property information group Corelogic\u2019s site. In the 28 days to Easter Sunday 2020, the number of new residential listings advertised for sale across Australia was 24,051. \u201cThis is by far the lowest level of listings for this time of the year in years, and is 27.3% below the equivalent period last year,\u201d Corelogic said. The company has also been tracking weekly data on requests for information from its site by real estate agents. These take place in the early stages of preparing a property for sale and provide a glimpse of the future. The number of comparative market analysis reports generated by real estate agents using the RP Professional platform to get information on an individual property has slipped 20% in the week to 5 April and continued into the week leading into Easter. A second early indicator is requests for valuations over its platform. The number of valuations began declining in mid March but has continued and was down 24% over the last week and 19.2% over the year. The only good news is that most of the valuations were done for refinancing purposes, indicating that people are taking advantage of low interest rates and trying to reduce their housing costs. There is no sign that there has yet been a surge in requests from mortgagees in possession, but it\u2019s probably too early for that. The ABC has issued a statement defending the integrity of health reporter Norman Swan, who has been repeatedly criticised in the pages of the Australian. A recent report highlighted Swan\u2019s involvement in Tonic Health Media, a private health media company which unsuccessfully pitched for a government contract to produce videos about the coronavirus. It should be noted that Swan\u2019s criticism of the federal government\u2019s response, and call for Australia to take a \u201cgo hard, go early\u201d approach to suppressing Covid-19, dates back to January. In a statement, the ABC said: Dr Norman Swan is a highly experienced ABC journalist and health professional who offers informed insights and analysis as part of the ABC\u2019s coverage of Covid-19. Dr Swan is doing invaluable work briefing the community on the implications of Covid-19 and helping answer people\u2019s questions, including in the Coronacast podcast. This has included setting out scenarios on what might occur as a result of the pandemic given various different assumptions, primarily using international information because Australian data have not been available. This work has been to the highest scientific standard. Dr Swan has worked with the ABC since 1982. His contract allows him to undertake external work. All such external work is subject to approval to ensure it does not create any conflicts with the individual\u2019s work for the ABC. As has already been publicly disclosed in past years, Dr Swan\u2019s external work includes Tonic Health Media, which produces fact-based, independent medical content that streams on video screens in GP waiting rooms and is used by Aboriginal medical services. Dr Swan is a minority shareholder and sits on the board. Its clients include commercial organisations and government agencies ... Dr Swan\u2019s involvement is to ensure such programming is evidenced-based, accurate and of value to consumers. Any accusation of a conflict of interest between Dr Swan\u2019s contribution to the community about Covid-19 as a journalist and the work of Tonic Health Media is unfounded. Dr Swan is a valued member of the ABC Science Unit. Rightly, he is highly regarded and respected for his commitment to independence and integrity. Speaking of Virgin Australia, the Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk just tweeted the following clip of state development minister Cameron Dick saying that it was prepared to fight NSW to keep the headquarters of the airline in Brisbane. Says Dick: Now NSW may want to bring a peashooter to the fight, that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll bring a bazooka and we\u2019re not afraid to use it. According to Guardian Australia business editor Ben Butler\u2019s report, they could be scrapping over a carcass. \u2018The reality is I am writing history\u2019: Turnbull Malcolm Turnbull has argued he was \u201cwriting history\u201d as he defended the level of detail his memoirs contain about his colleagues and cabinet discussions. The former prime minister \u2014 whose book was officially released today despite unauthorised copies being in circulation ahead of time \u2014 also told The Australian newspaper that Scott Morrison would not be prime minister if Turnbull had not \u201cgone to great lengths\u201d to ensure Peter Dutton did not win the leadership contest of 2018. Some conservatives have reacted angrily to the book\u2019s publication and argued Turnbull should be expelled from the Liberal party. In the interview with The Australian \u2014 published a short time ago online \u2014 Turnbull said he had included information that was vital to telling the story of his government: The reality is I am writing history. My government is over. We are in a different government, different political era and of course with the Covid pandemic it is, you know, we are crossing what is going to be quite a watershed. There is not much point in writing a memoir if you cannot write it truthfully. OK, sometimes you have got to use discretion and judgment but it\u2019s important that people know what happened. And, you know, I\u2019ve given a truthful account. NRL chief executive Todd Greenberg has quit his post in the latest blow to rugby league amid the coronavirus epidemic. Pressure had been mounting on Greenberg after the sport was plunged into a financial crisis by the suspension of the 2020 season due to the outbreak. Greenberg steps down with immediate effect, with Andrew Abdo taking over on an interim basis. \u201cIt has been my great honour and privilege to be the CEO of the NRL for the last four years,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cDespite the variety of challenges and pressures I have loved every single minute of the journey. Our growth over the last four years has been extraordinary and I am very proud of my contribution to the game.\u201d Deloitte understood to be appointed administrator for Virgin Australia It is understood big four accounting firm Deloitte will be appointed as Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators. The move comes after the federal government rebuffed the airline\u2019s request for a $1.4bn emergency loan as part of a wider industry bailout package and despite duelling aid offers from NSW and Queensland, each of which wanted to host Virgin Australia\u2019s HQ. It is not clear what will happen to the approximately 10,000 people who work for Virgin Australia if it goes into administration. Also unclear is what will happen to its fleet of 130 planes, many of which are heavily mortgaged. The company has been crushed by a $4.8bn mountain of debt and has been burning cash while the fleet is grounded. A busy few minutes. Virgin Australia is expected to go into administration shortly in what would be the biggest airline collapse in Australia since Ansett. We\u2019ll have more as it happens. Spurrier said South Australia had been doing some \u201cvery intensive planning to see what restrictions should be lifted and when\u201d. Spurrier said there would be some announcements about those decisions at the national cabinet meeting tomorrow. (It\u2019s not clear if she\u2019s talking here about the elective surgery measures, which the national deputy medical officer Nick Coatsworth mentioned earlier.) But for now, she said, they had to remain in place. On the situation in SA, Spurrier said 85% of people who have tested positive to Covid-19, or 369 people, have now recovered, meaning there are only 62 active coronavirus cases in the state. There are still only four cases with an unknown epidemiological link so, really, no evidence at all of community transmission. Not to be outdone by WA and Queensland, which both reported no new cases in the past 24 hours, South Australia has reported no new cases of Covid-19 for the third day in a row. Australia\u2019s total case increase today is just 26. SA\u2019s chief public health officers, Associate Professor Nicola Spurrier said she was \u201cvery pleased to have that news\u201d. This is in the context of many more tests being done in South Australia, so thank you to all those people who have developed a mild cold in the last three or four days and have come forward and had a test done. Spurrier said SA tested almost 2,000 people on both Thursday and Friday last week, another 1,000 on Saturday and 968 on Sunday \u2014 a record for testing in that state on a Sunday. It is all very reassuring because if we were getting very low numbers but our testing rate was dropping then we would be concerned so please keep up the good work. South Australian premier Steven Marshall is talking in Adelaide now about the repatriation flight from India, which landed at Adelaide airport with 370 passengers on board earlier today. They will undergo a 14-day mandatory quarantine at hotels in Adelaide, at the state government\u2019s cost. Marshall said SA was proud to play its part in the national repatriation effort. McGowan also announced a new app that will allow West Australians who want to move between districts to have that travel approved online. WA\u2019s travel restrictions include intra-state travel bans, so movement between regions is only allowed for set reasons. The app allows people who have legitimate reasons for travelling between regions \u2014 like truck drivers \u2014 to apply through the app. They then get a QR code on their phone, kind of like an electronic plane ticket, that can be scanned at the checkpoint. Let\u2019s go now to Western Australia, where the premier Mark McGowan has announced that they have recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. It\u2019s the first time since 21 February that WA has recorded no daily change in the number of cases. McGowan has credited his state\u2019s border closures with this result. I want to acknowledge the efforts of every West Australian through this pandemic crisis, the overwhelming majority of the community have in listening to the advice and following the new rules, for that I cannot thank you enough, Western Australia has done an incredible job but we can\u2019t let it go to waste now, we need everyone to stay the course. I know it\u2019s easy to think we have succeeded and we can just get back to normal, but we need to continue to be very cautious, we can\u2019t get complacent. McGowan said people are continuing to arrive in the state. Five domestic flights and one international flight \u2014 one cargo, one passenger plane from Doha \u2014 were scheduled to land at Perth airport today. In the past 24 hours, 176 people arrived in WA from overseas and interstate, of which 72 were essential workers exempt from quarantine, and 82 were placed in 14-day mandatory quarantine. Scott Morrison said on the weekend that the proposed coronavirus tracking app would not be made mandatory. A reporter asked what the utility of the app would be if the uptake is as low as 1%. Coatsworth says that even if only 1% of Australians sign up to the app, that will be \u201cmore useful than if no one takes it up\u201d. We have a very well-oiled machine at the moment which is about people calling Australians and determining whether they have been contacts. And what the app will do is just provide an added layer but if you want the icing on the cake to enable more, a greater percentage of people, to work out whether they are at risk or not. And that is the purpose of the app. It is the case that if you put the app out and even if only 1% of the population take it up, it will be more useful than if no one takes it up. Coatsworth said he thinks that Australians \u201cwill come with us\u201d on signing up to the app. They will see the inherent value in having a mechanism that helps those disease detectives do their work.... we have been very clear on what the app is about, this is not a geolocation app, for example. This is about letting those disease detectives know who someone has been in contact with for greater than 15 minutes and basically to help with our memory, if you will, because we cannot remember everyone we have been in contact with for over 15 minutes. Deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth says there may be a \u201csafe and cautious reintroduction\u201d of elective surgery over the next month, before other social and physical distancing measures are lifted. All elective surgery other than category one and urgent category two has been suspended to free up hospital capacity for dealing with the coronavirus. Coatsworth said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee discussed the issue today, and is considering what rules might underpin \u201ca very cautious and safe but ultimately consumer and patient focused reintroduction of elective surgery into Australia\u201d. Coatsworth would not preempt the national cabinet\u2019s decision on elective surgery but said it was \u201cnot something we are going to sit on for many weeks\u201d. ... There are Australians out there who are in pain and have disability, cannot be in the workforce, they need to take very potent pain medication and they need their elective surgery done. He said that the availability of PPE was not a restrictive factor in reopening elective surgery, but that having adequate levels of the appropriate PEE was \u201ca key requirement\u201d. Coatsworth says he was comforted, when he and his family went outdoors for exercise in Canberra this weekend, to see people obeying social distancing laws. What I observed was Australians in pairs, in family groups, maintaining their physical distance, getting out for exercise. I saw some small businesses that were open and I saw some small businesses that had instituted some very practical and easy to follow measures to keep physical distance and to help their customers adhere to the guidelines that we have asked them to do. And that was such a comforting thing for me to see. And the reason it was comforting was because I know how hard it is now that we are approaching just over one month of these really stringent physical distancing measures and restrictions that we have placed on our usual lifestyle. But to see people still adhering to those guidelines, to see small businesses assisting their customers and being quite creative about those processes and I know it is not just going on in Canberra, I know that it is going on around the whole country. The deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth is giving an update in Canberra. He says Australia has reported 26 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. That \u201cdemonstrates that the physical distancing measures that we have asked of Australians and that Australians have really embraced are still paying dividends for us and still keeping our numbers of Covid-19 very low indeed,\u201d Coatsworth says. Labor\u2019s employment spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, has used an ABS survey released today to argue for the extension of the jobkeeper payment to cover a wider range of industries and casual workers. The ABS Household Impacts of Covid-19 Survey found that 3% of Australians who had a job in the first week of March had lost that job by the first week of April, and one in four people had their hours cut. O\u2019Connor: When unemployment spikes in the next few months remember hundreds of thousands of job losses could have been prevented if Josh Frydenberg had used his power to extend jobkeeper to millions of workers, which he can do at the stroke of a pen. Australia entered the crisis from a position of relative economic weakness not strength, including record high underemployment before the worst of the virus outbreak, which makes much-needed support even more urgent. Federal Labor will continue to work constructively with the government to ensure Australians have the best possible response to the health crisis we are facing. The Law Council of Australia says there must be strict limitations placed on the kind of data that can be collected from the government\u2019s proposed coronavirus tracking app and the uses to which that data can be put. It has also called for the release of the full privacy impact statement \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. In a statement, Law Council president Pauline Wright said that the desire to improve contact tracing of coronavirus cases had to be balanced with privacy concerns. She said: If privacy protections are built-in to the app, it will provide the public with greater confidence. There must also be strict limits on what kind of data can be collected and the uses to which it can be put and there must be clear limits about how long data can be kept and when it must be deleted. It must also be made clear how the collection of data be limited to ensure that only the required or necessary data points to address Covid-19 are being collected. The Law Council commends the government\u2019s announcement of their intention to publicly release a privacy impact assessment for the app before it is rolled out, as well as the source code to be utilised by the app. Open source enables the source code to be independently inspected and audited, and this is something we would vigorously support. We understand that the government is working with the Australian Signals Directorate and some members of the private cyber security industry on the security of storage arrangements for data transmitted by the app ... it is imperative and particularly important that a comprehensive privacy impact statement is released publicly, as a matter of urgency, and that Australians are given an opportunity to comment. Only then will Australians be able to make an informed decision about whether to use the app. As with any measure taken to combat the pandemic, the functionality of the app should be proportionate to the risk posed by the pandemic and should be temporary, with clear time limits. New South Wales treasurer Dom Perrottet has poured water (or is it oil?) on suggestions he is engaged in a round of fisticuffs with his Queensland counterpart over the future of Virgin Australia. Perrottet says NSW is not in a fight with Queensland, it is \u201cin a fight to keep people in jobs and business in business\u201d. (And to keep both those jobs and that business out of Queensland and in NSW.) As Anne Davies reported, the NSW and Queensland governments are in a bidding war over who gets to bail out Virgin Australia, because both governments want the airlines headquarters to be in their state. Queensland offered Virgin $200m if it keeps its headquarters in Brisbane, and Perrottet said he was considering making an offer for the airline to move its headquarters Sydney\u2019s new, still under construction second airport at Badgerys Creek. That prompted Queensland\u2019s state development minister, Cameron Dick, to tell Perrottet and his entire state to \u201cback right off\u201d. Not fighting at all. And with that news, I\u2019m going to leave you in the hands of my colleague Calla Walhquist. Stay safe. The WA government has now lifted restrictions imposed on takeaway alcohol in response to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe temporary restrictions were put in place in late March to ensure the state was well prepared to respond to Covid-19 as increased social distancing measures were applied,\u201d a statement said. \u201cThe restrictions were designed to minimise alcohol-related problems in the community, ensuring the health system, police and community services could focus on the response to the virus.\u201d The government said existing takeaway alcohol restrictions unrelated to Covid-19 in particular communities would remain. In New Zealand, the prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the country will move out of the level four lockdown at 11.59pm on Monday 27 April. \u201cWe will then hold at alert level three, for two weeks, before reviewing how we are tracking again,\u201d she says. The ACT has recorded one new Covid-19 case in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 104. \u201cThe individual is a male in his 40s who acquired the virus overseas,\u201d a government statement said. The statement said 91 people had recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. One Covid-19 patient is currently being treated at Canberra Hospital. Some more details from AAP on the repatriation flight that arrived in Adelaide today. The first of two flights bringing Australians home from India has landed in Adelaide with about 370 passengers facing a 14-day period of mandatory quarantine. The first of two flights bringing Australian citizens home from India has landed in Adelaide. The Lion Air flight touched down on Monday morning carrying more than 370 passengers after leaving Chennai and travelling through Denpasar. It was met by police and SA Health officials. From Adelaide airport, the repatriated Aussies will be taken by buses to a local hotel to begin a 14-day mandatory quarantine. A second flight, carrying about the same number of people, is expected in Adelaide from Mumbai on Tuesday. SA chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said the arrivals would be tested after they disembarked and monitored daily for symptoms. \u201cWe will not be risking the health and wellbeing of our population,\u201d she said. Police commissioner Grant Stevens said about 45 officers would monitor the building to ensure people don\u2019t leave prematurely. \u201cGiven the excellent results we\u2019ve seen in terms of limiting the spread of the virus in South Australia, we\u2019re taking the security of these people extremely seriously,\u201d Stevens said. No new cases of coronavirus were recorded in the state over the weekend despite a testing blitz in recent days. The total remains at 435 and only 89 cases are active. The shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers is speaking to the media in Brisbane. He is sharply criticising two aspects of the government\u2019s economic response: If the treasurer was doing everything he can he wouldn\u2019t be denying jobkeeper payments to more than a million casuals and other workers. If the treasurer was doing everything he can to prevent job losses, he wouldn\u2019t be ignoring the plight of something like 15,000 workers at Virgin Airlines. We don\u2019t yet know how deep this economic downturn will be or the precise number of Australians who will lose their jobs or add risk of losing their jobs. We do know the unemployment queues will be longer than is necessary because the treasurer refuses to step in and expand eligibility for the jobkeeper program. Meanwhile, if you\u2019ve missed some important news from Adelaide. Responding to the government\u2019s plans for a code for tech giants, the Greens communications spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young said: Finally the government is doing something, albeit late and after much suffering for Australian media and creators. Waiting until November for tech giants and media companies to reach a deal was never going to cut it and would\u2019ve seen more news outlets hit the wall. Australian media outlets were already under pressure because of this content theft before Covid-19, but the loss of advertising revenue during this crisis has been the last straw for many. The key issue now is what the code will look like and how it will be enforced. Other jurisdictions have been grappling with this issue and Australia must learn their lessons. Asked how much tech giants will need to pay for the news and media content they use, Frydenberg says: Hard to be specific about it because right now, we know that this is very lucrative for the media companies - sorry, for the tech titans to use the original content on their web site but, in terms of the actual numbers, it is going to be in the millions but it is hard to the explicit about the exact number. The treasurer Josh Frydenberg and communications minister Paul Fletcher are addressing the new mandatory code of conduct that the government will impose on tech giants such as Facebook and Google. \u201cThe government\u2019s taken a decision to move to a mandatory code, with a draft mandatory code to be released by the end of July and to be put together by the ACCC,\u201d Frydenberg says. \u201cWe hope it will be legislated soon thereafter. We are very conscious of the challenges we face and that we are dealing with some of the most valuable and powerful companies in the world.\u201d Mutual obligations for welfare recipients should be suspended for six months, the Greens say. \u201cThe current suspension of mutual obligations requirements for people on income support operates until Monday 27 April, that is the beginning of next week,\u201d Greens senator Rachel Siewert said. As it stands, the government advice is still stay at home unless you are going to work or education (if you are unable to do so at home), shopping for essential supplies such as groceries, going out for personal exercise in the neighbourhood on your own or with one other, attending medical appointments or compassionate visits. Social distancing and isolating is especially important for older Australians, those with existing health concerns, First Nations peoples, disabled people, carers, many of whom access our social safety net. Now is not the time to be penalising people and suspending their payments for choosing not to put their safety at risk by requiring them to attend appointments and face to face meetings. With the unprecedented number of people now applying for income support, and the strain this will place on employment service providers it is the ideal time to reset how we support jobseekers. We need to ditch the punitive approach and move to a supportive model that meets peoples needs and doesn\u2019t focus on compliance over support. The federal opposition has stepped up its calls for the Morrison government to bail out Virgin Australia. Victorian-based Labor MPs have gathered at Melbourne airport to call for immediate action. Catherine King, the shadow transport minister, said 16,000 jobs were at stake if the airline went into administration. \u201cAustralians need Scott Morrison to step up and take an equity stake in Virgin to get the airline through this crisis,\u201d she said in a statement issued ahead of the event. \u201cIf the company falls over, thousands of jobs will be gone overnight and all Australians will be worse off with higher airfares and fewer services.\u201d At 12:30 we\u2019ll hear from treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and communications minister, Paul Fletcher, about the move to make digital giants share revenue with media companies. In a statement, Facebook has announced it is disappointed. Will Easton, managing director of Facebook Australia and New Zealand said: We\u2019re disappointed by the government\u2019s announcement, especially as we\u2019ve worked hard to meet their agreed deadline. Covid-19 has impacted every business and industry across the country, including publishers, which is why we announced a new, global investment to support news organisations at a time when advertising revenue is declining. We believe that strong innovation and more transparency around the distribution of news content is critical to building a sustainable news ecosystem. We\u2019ve invested millions of dollars locally to support Australian publishers through content arrangements, partnerships and training for the industry and hope the code will protect the interests of millions of Australians and small businesses that use our services every day. The Australian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie says today\u2019s Grattan Institute report warning of widespread unemployment shows the government must avoid \u201cthrowing up barriers to income support\u201d in the future. Goldie welcomed the temporary boost to welfare payments, but said: \u201c... we can never go back to the low rate of the old Newstart payment of just $40 a day or the punitive approaches that punished and demonised people locked out of paid work.\u201d This included what Acoss considered past approaches such as \u201cdenying payments to people with a small amount of savings, or imposing Work for the Dole and unrealistic job search requirements; the government should meet its own obligations to secure employment for people\u201d. \u201cWe need to raise the rate for good so those without paid work can cover the basics \u2013 food, housing, electricity \u2013 and they can make the most of job opportunities as the economy rebuilds,\u201d she said. Acoss also wants an expansion in infrastructure investment, such as social housing and improvements in the energy efficiency of homes, to restore growth in employment as the lockdowns are eased. \u201cWe need to fix our employment services system to create pathways to jobs for people who are unemployed long term and those at greatest risk, including people leaving education without Year 12 qualifications, older people, people with disability and people with caring responsibilities,\u201d she said. As we reported earlier, the Victorian government released some modelling today which estimate the impact on the state if authorities did not implement physical distancing measures. It includes the chart below. An Australian Bureau of Statistics survey into how households are responding to the coronavirus pandemic has found nearly a quarter of Australian adults with a job are now working fewer hours. But the survey also found 12% were working more hours than usual as a result of Covid-19. The ABS surveyed 1,059 people aged 18 and over via telephone between 31 March and 6 April to gain a snapshot as to how Australian households are responding to the pandemic, AAP reported. \u201cThe survey found that around 3.0% of people who had a job in early March no longer had one by early April,\u201d said Michelle Marquardt, ABS program manager for household surveys. One in six Australians \u2013 17% \u2013 said they were wearing a face mask to help prevent the spread of the virus. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has been handed $53m to boost its capacity during the coronavirus pandemic. It will be used to deliver personal protective equipment for frontline medical staff and fly-in GP clinics for testing if there is a broader outbreak. The service will airlift suspected and confirmed virus patients from regional areas. \u201cIt will give an area of comfort and assurance to the people in the more remote parts of Australia that should an outbreak occur in their communities, there is assets available to help them at their time of need,\u201d said federal regional health minister Mark Coulton. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has said the AFL would need to demonstrate how it can play games during the Covid-19 pandemic before it can restart the season. \u201cMy suggestion was it needs to be a national conversation because it does relate to how teams can move around the country,\u201d said Sutton, who has been in regular discussions with the AFL boss, Gillon McLachlan. \u201cWe don\u2019t want a situation where everyone\u2019s in quarantine crossing a state border for 14 days. The AFL can\u2019t work in that regard. \u201cBut it needs a detailed proposal that works through exactly how this is managed, how the physical distancing will be in place and surveillance for illness of any players is managed so that\u2019s still to come through.\u201d McLachlan said he could deliver definitive details around the competition\u2019s resumption date by the end of April, AAP reports. But the AFL is preparing for an entire season without spectators. \u201cI take a line through what Brett Sutton said \u2026 [and] I think that\u2019s going to be challenging [to host crowds] this year,\u201d McLachlan told 3AW on Monday. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen later in the year, but certainly not contemplating crowds at the start. \u201cAnd I think if you take a line through what Brett Sutton said, who in Victoria will be the guy making the decision, I think it\u2019s a challenge to have [crowds] at all this year.\u201d There has been a debate in Victoria (helped along by some elements of the media and the state opposition) about the decision to close golf courses. People in other states are able to play. The premier, Daniel Andrews, has addressed this today, saying no one would \u201clike to be on the golf course more than me, but I don\u2019t need to play golf\u201d. He said no one needed to play golf. The Tasmanian health minister, Sarah Courtney, is addressing the media. The state has reported six new cases of coronavirus. Courtney says: There were over 270 tests in the north-west over the last 24 hours and 309 tests across the state. There have been 40 emergency room presentations at the North-West regional hospital. A new section at the Royal Hobart Hospital, K Block, has opened. Victoria police says in an update that up to 11pm officers conducted 819 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services over the past 24 hours. 91 fines have been issued in the past 24 hours Since 21 March, police have conducted a total of 24921 spot checks. Police say examples of fines issued included: Five people sitting in a vehicle drinking 16 people gathered at a private residence for a party 20-year-old male from Mildura who was spoken to by police five times in five hours for breaches of the chief health officer\u2019s directions The Mildura man was arrested and charged in relation to these breaches and bailed to appear at Mildura magistrates court on 15 July. AAP reports that Queensland\u2019s online education portal has crashed on the first day of term two, leaving parents and students unable to access remote learning. Only the students of essential workers, as well as vulnerable children, were required to attend school when school returned on Monday. High demand had resulted in a \u201ctemporary disruption\u201d to the Learning@Home website, the Education Department tweeted, and it was working to resolve the issue. The online portal is a vital resource tool for students to learn remotely under adult supervision. Parents and carers took to social media wanting to know when the portal would be back online. \u201cWe apologise for this short term interruption as we adapt to the learning at home model. Please remain patient as we work through it. Thank you,\u201d the education department has tweeted several times. Earlier, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said she was not aware of the crash. She said Queenslanders were living through an unprecedented period and her government was doing its best to facilitate remote learning for all students. \u201cWe are providing everything we possibly can to ensure our children are still getting educated,\u201d she told 4BC radio. \u201cLet\u2019s see how the next few weeks ago.\u201d Hi everyone. Thanks to Michael for his efforts today. I\u2019ll be with you through the rest of the morning. That\u2019s me done for the morning. I\u2019ll hand you over now to my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes. Thanks for reading. Novak Djokovic, the 17-time grand slam tennis champion, says he\u2019s \u201copposed\u201d to vaccination and would face a difficult choice if one became available for Covid-19. Reuters reports that during a live Facebook chat with several fellow Serbian athletes, Djokovic, who won the Australian Open in January, said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to be forced\u201d to receive a vaccine. \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\u201d Djokovic reportedly said. \u201cBut if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don\u2019t know. \u201cHypothetically, if the season was to resume in July, August or September, though unlikely, I understand that a vaccine will become a requirement straight after we are out of strict quarantine and there is no vaccine yet.\u201d Aboriginal people in remote communities under lockdown are still going without food and essentials, two weeks on from a meeting of the big supermarket chains and the federal government designed to sort it out, and after already enduring months of critical shortages due to the coronavirus pandemic. A coalition of 13 Aboriginal health, housing and medical organisations of the Northern Territory want the national cabinet to \u201cimmediately\u201d guarantee an agreed proportion of essentials set aside for the independent suppliers of community stores. \u201cWe are getting daily reports of remote stores struggling to supply basic goods. Some stores are running out of fresh food three days after their weekly delivery,\u201d said the chief executive of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance of the NT, John Paterson. \u201cSmall, community owned stores must suddenly meet 100% of people\u2019s needs across a much greater range of products. In some stores this means a tripling of their usual orders. \u201cIn recent weeks the big supermarkets have responded to panic buying down south by sweeping up the bulk of goods from manufacturers and producers. Independent suppliers are struggling to get what they need for remote stores. \u201cThis issue can\u2019t be solved through donated goods. It needs a systemic response from government.\u201d The coalition wants a 20% point-of-sale subsidy of essential food, cleaning and hygiene products, as well as winter bedding and clothing. \u201cA direct consumer subsidy is the best way to guarantee that residents who are no longer able to shop around can afford the basics,\u201d Paterson said. The NT coalition wants to stop people taking backroads into towns to buy the essential and affordable supplies they can\u2019t get at home. \u201cWe urge the national cabinet to take action, before it is too late, because time is all remote Aboriginal communities have on their side in their fight against the virus. \u201cWe are all affected by this crisis, some more than others when it comes to accessing affordable food,\u201d said the chief executive of the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, Donna Ah Chee. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, has been sought for comment. After the initial meeting, Wyatt said there had been \u201cimmense goodwill\u201d to resolve the problem but said the group would \u201cmeet again in two weeks time to see how the goodwill is translated into outcomes.\u201d The national Covid-19 coordination commission has been asked to work with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to monitor the cost of goods in remote communities. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has told media that modelling prepared for the health department shows that without the current restrictions in place 650 Victorians would have died each day at the peak of the virus. Sutton says the modelling, prepared by the Peter Doherty Institute, Monash University and the Victorian Health department, shows \u201cwhat might have occurred\u201d if the state had maintained only case isolation. He says Victoria would have had 58,000 infections a day at the peak, and would have required 7,000 ventilated hospital beds. It would have peaked at 650 deaths per day, so not dissimilar to what\u2019s being seen across Europe in a number of countries ... You can see that Victoria has taken a different trajectory. We did, along with all the states and territories of Australia, take an early robust measure with the physical distancing restrictions in place. It has pushed our curve on a very different path way than other countries. But Andrews again says it\u2019s too early to think about reopening bars or restaurants, though he does flag the possibility of relaxing some rules. I want to make it clear though that the notion that pubs are opening any time soon, restaurants, bars, cafes \u2013 I don\u2019t think that will be [happening]. The risk will be far greater than any reward. I think there are some areas where we might be able to make changes in around the way people interact, around some of the ... social measures ... I\u2019m trying to give people a sense that there is hope here. These numbers are good. This strategy is working. It\u2019s as much to avoid the alternative as it is to then relax all these rules. That would be exactly the wrong thing to do. Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, who is having a busy morning, has been updating the media after earlier announcing only one new case of Covid-19 in his state in the past 24 hours. Andrews says it\u2019s too early to talk about rolling back restrictions on movement, but that the national cabinet tomorrow will discuss what the \u201cprerequisites\u201d for rollbacks should look like: National cabinet tomorrow will have a discussion about some of the prerequisites for relaxing any of the rules. That means you have to have the right amount of testing being done, the right number of coronavirus detections, the contract tracing [so that] if there is an outbreak in a given community, you can have a squad as it were go in there and lock the community down so you don\u2019t get another that runs rampant. We saw in north-west Tasmania how quickly these things can get away from us. We see every day tragically what is occurring in so many parts of the world. Let\u2019s take a quick look at what the newspapers are reporting today. The big news, which you can read about here, is that Facebook and Google will be forced to share advertising revenue with Australian media companies after the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, instructed the competition watchdog to develop a mandatory code of conduct for the digital giants amid a steep decline in advertising brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s the splash on most of the major mastheads including Nine\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, the West Australian, the Courier-Mail, the Herald Sun and Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph. The Hobart Mercury has a \u201cvirus hell\u201d story about a couple who were stranded on board a Coronavirus-stricken cruise ship, while the Canberra Times has a special edition thanking frontline healthcare workers. In Victoria, where only one new Covid-19 case was recorded overnight, Daniel Andrews has warned it will be some time still before life returns to some kind of normality. Speaking to Melbourne radio station 3AW the premier said while it was a \u201cpositive result\u201d the situation was still \u201cvery, very fragile\u201d. With Victoria\u2019s state of emergency in place until at least late May, he said the state had to \u201cstay the course\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a theory, there are countries who have relaxed the rules and now they\u2019re in a harder lockdown because it [the virus] moves so fast,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cIf [the virus] gets away there\u2019s no pulling it back and then we have people using machines to breathe and we can\u2019t have that happen.\u201d He also talked down the possibility that cafes, restaurants and bars could reopen in the near future. \u201cThey were closed for a reason. There might be some things we can do, some rules we can let off a little bit, but we have to be careful,\u201d Andrews said. Hoo boy. And some fighting words from the Queensland minister for state development, Cameron Dick, over some comments from the New South Wales treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, yesterday on Virgin Airlines. Perrottet told Sky News on Sunday that NSW would consider a bailout for the beleaguered airline if it based itself at the new western Sydney airport. \u201cVirgin should have their headquarters for both Virgin and Tiger in Sydney,\u201d Perrottet told Sky on Sunday night. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, echoed that this morning, though she did not provide any details on what a potential bailout for the company would look like. Virgin is now based in Brisbane, and Dick has not held back in blasting NSW, telling his southern counterparts to \u201cback right off\u201d. Dick said no one fought like \u201ca Queenslanders with their backs to the wall\u201d and that NSW could \u201cbring a pea gun to the fight, we\u2019ll bring a bazooka\u201d. \u201cBack right off,\u201d Dick said. \u201cJust don\u2019t go there. \u201cThere is nothing more dangerous than Queenslanders with their backs to the wall.\u201d Not totally sure what that means, but reading between the lines it seems Queensland ministers are not too happy with their NSW counterparts this morning. Big news out of Queensland, where the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has just announced no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. She says she\u2019s \u201coverjoyed\u201d by the result and flags easing of restrictions in the coming weeks. This is an absolutely tremendous effort, so our total still sits at 1,019 and, if we can keep this up over the coming weeks, I\u2019m sure that that is going to mean that we will be able to make some changes and ease some of those restrictions on the populations. So thank you Queensland for the enormous effort you are doing. This is tremendous news but we want to see this over a period of weeks and I just, I\u2019m overjoyed we\u2019ve seen this result. The head of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, has told Seven\u2019s Sunrise program this morning that a major delivery of personal protective equipment announced by the health minister, Greg Hunt, on Sunday should allow elective surgery to resume. Yesterday Hunt said he believed elective surgeries and IVF could continue sooner than previously expected. Certainly, the shortage of masks is one of the reasons why elective surgery was put on hold. It was also about ensuring that we had bed capacity and we had the time to prepare for that Covid-19 surge in demand. We\u2019ve been so successful so far that that\u2019s given us the opportunity now to plan a sensible, safe, graduated return into the low-risk procedures which provide clinical benefit to patients and allow us to not ensure we don\u2019t have, you know, ramping up waiting lists when we come out of the Covid-19 crisis. Just briefly, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has confirmed in a commercial radio interview this morning that he was not one of the people who received a leaked copy of the dformer prime minister Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s book. We revealed yesterday that lawyers acting for Turnbull\u2019s publisher had fired off a letter to a staff member in Scott Morrison\u2019s office alleging he hd been \u201cresponsible for unauthorised distribution of my client\u2019s book\u201d. The staff member has since apologised, but it seems the book was shared widely among journalists and MPs before its release. But Albanese says he wasn\u2019t one of the recipients. I did not. I am not on the prime minister\u2019s office\u2019s email list, obviously. But it seems to be a pretty childish thing to do and I am not surprised that it\u2019s been taken seriously by the publishers. You can read the full story from yesterday here: A new report out from the Grattan Institute today warns that Australia\u2019s unemployment rate could go as high as 16% due to Covid-19. The report says that in the weeks ahead as many as 28% of Australians could be out of work, although the impact of the wage replacement schemes will keep the official unemployment rate lower. The first of two planes repatriating Australians stranded overseas has landed in Adelaide, the Advertiser reports. The aircraft, carrying 374 passengers, landed at a largely deserted Adelaide airport at 7.20am. A second flight will arrive tomorrow. Our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, tells me a group of 13 Aboriginal organisations in central Australia will meet at 9.30am to condemn the lack of action on food security in remote communities. That\u2019s despite a big roundtable chaired by Ken Wyatt, who brought together Coles, Woolies, outback store owners and the Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, two weeks ago. The organisations want a 20% government subsidy on essentials at point of sale and guaranteed supply \u2013 they say the big supermarkets are hogging supply chains and they\u2019re left struggling to source essentials which are now way more expensive than they used to be. Stores in the bush are empty within days of supplies arriving and consequently people are sneaking into towns on backroads to stock up and getting caught and fined, and risking contracting Covid-19. Over on Nine\u2019s Today Show, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has revealed his state recorded only one new case of Covid-19 overnight. That\u2019s a 24-hour period with only seven new cases in the two states which have experienced the largest outbreaks of the virus. Andrews said about 7,000 people in the state had been tested at the weekend. \u201cWe need to be proud of the progress we\u2019ve made but we need to know it\u2019s very, very fragile,\u201d Andrews said. Labor\u2019s shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is on RN Breakfast. She\u2019s asked whether she \u201ctrusts\u201d China. I think transparency and openness are the basis for trust and the world wants to trust China, China wants to be trusted, and that requires China to be more transparent. I think we all want to trust China and that requires China to be more transparent. Trust isn\u2019t set and forget, it\u2019s derived from and built on actions. This is the same question the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, was asked and sidestepped yesterday. The shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, got it at a press conference too. If you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re suddenly asking every Australian politician about trust and China, it\u2019s off the back of Payne\u2019s call for an independent international investigation into the spread of Covid-19 and concerns about China\u2019s transparency during the outbreak. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has listed areas in the state where she wants people to be tested for Covid-19 based on cases without identified sources. That is, they want people in areas where there may be community transmission to be tested. They include the local government areas of Blacktown, Canada Bay, Cumberland, Goulburn, Mulawarie, the inner west, Liverpool, Parramatta, Penrith, Randwick, Ryde, Waverley and Woollahra . Anyone in those areas that have symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose should present for testing and we are trying to have high testing rates in those areas to again assure us that we are not missing more widespread community transmission in those areas. What has prompted us to nominate those areas is that we have a weekly review of cases, where we haven\u2019t got identified sources and this allows us to focus on those target areas. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, says there have been only six new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. It\u2019s the lowest number of new infections since four were recorded on 10 March. There has been one death in the state in the past 24 hours \u2013 a 94-year-old man from the Newmarch House aged care home in western Sydney who we reported on yesterday. There are two additional cases of Covid-19 at that home, taking the total to 41 including 14 staff. Berejiklian has also announced a $140m boost for primary industries such as forestry and agriculture. Over on the commercial network breakfast shows, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is also talking apps, saying the Covid-19 tracing app would \u201ctrace the so-called digital handshake\u201d. \u201cOf course we have looked very closely at the privacy issues, the security aspects of it,\u201d Frydenberg told Seven\u2019s Sunrise. Stuart Robert, still doing the rounds, was just on RN Breakfast repeating a lot of the same lines about Australians downloading the Covid-19 tracing app because we \u201cwant to get back to the footy and want to get back to the beach\u201d. Fran Kelly pushed Robert on whether the app would be effective if it failed to meet that 40% take-up threshold the government has been talking about. Robert said effectiveness \u201cis a scale\u201d. \u201cAny digital take-up to assist current manual tracing effort is of great value,\u201d he said. Roughly 100,000 students are expected to attend schools across Queensland on Monday amid closures due to the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities estimate about 10% to 15% of students enrolled across the state will attend school for the first day of term two. That figure would be spread across the whole state as schools open only for the children of essential workers and vulnerable children as part of the response to the coronavirus outbreak, said the education minister, Grace Grace. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting somewhere around 10, maybe 15%,\u201d Grace told media on Sunday. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know but whatever happens we\u2019ll be able to accommodate.\u201d All other students will be required to learn remotely, based on medical advice. But parents who have children at home with them were not required to take any classes, Grace said. That\u2019s a job for teachers and teacher aides employed across the state who will help children learn via digital devices and hard copies of the curriculum. \u201cThis is remote learning,\u201d Grace said. \u201cNo parent is required to be a teacher.\u201d The government services minister, Stuart Robert, has been on the ABC this morning defending the government\u2019s proposed Covid-19 tracing app. The app hasn\u2019t been released yet but is already facing pushback. Within the government, the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce is among a few who have publicly said they won\u2019t download it because of privacy concerns. Robert told the ABC the app would reduce contact tracing on confirmed Covid-19 cases from \u201cdays to minutes\u201d and allow Australians \u201cto get back to life quicker\u201d. The government though says it wants at least 40% of Australians to download the app to make it successful. Robert dodged questions about whether the government would consider making the app mandatory if they failed to meet that target, saying he\u2019s a \u201cglass half full guy\u201d. He said: Our memories fail us, Michael. Think about if you got the virus and state health asked who you were with 10 days ago, you wouldn\u2019t know. You can\u2019t remember the name of the lady in the queue behind you at Woolies. If everyone is running the app, the data is securely on the app and only goes to state health officials if you test positive for the virus. No commonwealth agency sees the data. It\u2019s only used for health, and it\u2019s only used to protect you. This would reduce the time from days to minutes. So it\u2019s a massive productivity saving and, frankly, it\u2019s going to allow us to get back to life quicker. It will allow us to get back to the footy quicker. It will allow us to get back to work quicker. It will allow us to resume the economic activity of the nation quicker. And we need to do this for the country. There are a lot of people unemployed now and hurting. And the prime minister has made this clear \u2013 this is one of the key conditions we need to get economic life back into the country. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. I\u2019m Michael McGowan and I\u2019ll be taking you through the morning news. Today some 100,000 kids (or about 10% to 15% of the school population) in Queensland are expected to return to school for the first day of term two today. A repatriation flight from India carrying 440 people is also expected to arrive in Adelaide. And in some good news for swimmers in Sydney\u2019s east, beaches in the Randwick council areas \u2013 Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra \u2013 have reopened for exercise only this morning, adding further fuel to the debate about when and how to lift lockdown restrictions. Here\u2019s a quick summary of what else you might have missed yesterday: Australia recorded two new Covid-19 deaths. One, in New South Wales, was a 94-year-old man. He was a resident at the Newmarch House aged care facility in western Sydney. It is the second death from the aged care facility after a significant outbreak. A man in his 80s from Victoria also died. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, called for an independent global investigation into the spread of Covid-19. Payne says she does not think the World Health Organization should run the investigation, saying she shares some of the concerns expressed by the US about the agency\u2019s handling of the pandemic. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said elective surgery and IVF could resume sooner than previously expected, thanks to an increase in personal protective equipment equipment available to Australia\u2019s healthcare system. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced anyone who spat on a worker could receive a $5,000 fine. It\u2019s an expansion of a previous decision to allow the fines for people who spat on health workers or police. Hazzard also said NSW had avoided some 700 deaths, based on projections during the peak of the outbreak.",

      "body": "<p>The number of footballers reporting symptoms of depression has doubled since the sport shut down because of Covid-19, a survey by the global players\u2019 union, Fifpro, has found. Anxiety symptoms have also risen amid significant concerns about the long-term impact that coronavirus may have on the football community.</p> <p>Fifpro\u2019s study of 1,602 professional players, conducted between 22 March and 14 April, discovered that 22% of 468 female players and 13% of 1,134 male players reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depression. It also found that 18% of the women and 16% of men reported markers of generalised anxiety. England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland were among 16 countries \u2013 all of which have implemented drastic measures to contain Covid-19, such as home confinement \u2013 whose footballers were surveyed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/20/dexter-blackstock-supplying-ppe-former-striker-equipment-to-frontline-staff-coronavirus\">Dexter Blackstock's journey from scoring goals to supplying PPE | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a troubling rise when set along another Fifpro study, conducted in December and January while football seasons were still active in most locations globally, involving a smaller set of 307 players. Back then, 11% of the women and 6% of the men reported symptoms characteristic of depression. Scientific research generally finds women report depression and anxiety in higher numbers than men.</p> <p>Fifpro said that players who felt worried about their future in football were significantly more likely to report depression or anxiety symptoms. Although footballers at the very top level may find themselves financially secure, the average contract length globally is less than two years and the majority experience the same financial considerations as those in other walks of life.</p> <p>Economic uncertainty may partly explain the rise in depression symptoms but other factors are thought to be involved. The mean age of those surveyed was 26, among the male players, and 23 among the female players. Many footballers are young adults who are living, in many cases alone, in foreign countries without families in close proximity. Such an uncertain time appears to be taking a toll on mental health.</p> <p>\u201cIn football, suddenly young men and women athletes are having to cope with social isolation, a suspension of their working lives and doubts about their future,\u201d the Fifpro chief medical officer, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, said. \u201cSome may not be well equipped to confront these changes and we encourage them to seek help from a person they trust or a mental health professional.\u201d</p> <p>More than 75% of those surveyed said they had access to sufficient resources and support to aid their mental health. Fifpro is developing a mental health toolkit to provide basic primary care for footballers.</p> <p>There is no suggestion from Fifpro that its members\u2019 concerns are more severe than those of people in other areas. Rather, it believes the results of the survey \u2013 conducted with Amsterdam University Medical Centres \u2013 is a reflection of problems in broader society and confirms that a vast number of footballers are affected similarly. </p> <p>The union wants to stress the social responsibility that comes hand in hand with economic decisions made on the nature of football\u2019s continuation, and that it is far more than a question of an entertainment industry returning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese findings ... underline how important it is that football stakeholders work together during these uncertain times by making collective agreements that maintain social stability and relieve pressure for all employees in the industry, including the players,\u201d the Fifpro general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said.</p> <p>Baer-Hoffmann emphasised that Fifpro was not using the survey\u2019s findings as an argument to rush into resuming the football season. Only a resumption in a safe environment in which players felt comfortable and secure would reduce the number of stressors that can contribute to depression and anxiety, he said.</p> <p><em>In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

      "bodyText": "The number of footballers reporting symptoms of depression has doubled since the sport shut down because of Covid-19, a survey by the global players\u2019 union, Fifpro, has found. Anxiety symptoms have also risen amid significant concerns about the long-term impact that coronavirus may have on the football community. Fifpro\u2019s study of 1,602 professional players, conducted between 22 March and 14 April, discovered that 22% of 468 female players and 13% of 1,134 male players reported symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of depression. It also found that 18% of the women and 16% of men reported markers of generalised anxiety. England, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland were among 16 countries \u2013 all of which have implemented drastic measures to contain Covid-19, such as home confinement \u2013 whose footballers were surveyed. It is a troubling rise when set along another Fifpro study, conducted in December and January while football seasons were still active in most locations globally, involving a smaller set of 307 players. Back then, 11% of the women and 6% of the men reported symptoms characteristic of depression. Scientific research generally finds women report depression and anxiety in higher numbers than men. Fifpro said that players who felt worried about their future in football were significantly more likely to report depression or anxiety symptoms. Although footballers at the very top level may find themselves financially secure, the average contract length globally is less than two years and the majority experience the same financial considerations as those in other walks of life. Economic uncertainty may partly explain the rise in depression symptoms but other factors are thought to be involved. The mean age of those surveyed was 26, among the male players, and 23 among the female players. Many footballers are young adults who are living, in many cases alone, in foreign countries without families in close proximity. Such an uncertain time appears to be taking a toll on mental health. \u201cIn football, suddenly young men and women athletes are having to cope with social isolation, a suspension of their working lives and doubts about their future,\u201d the Fifpro chief medical officer, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, said. \u201cSome may not be well equipped to confront these changes and we encourage them to seek help from a person they trust or a mental health professional.\u201d More than 75% of those surveyed said they had access to sufficient resources and support to aid their mental health. Fifpro is developing a mental health toolkit to provide basic primary care for footballers. There is no suggestion from Fifpro that its members\u2019 concerns are more severe than those of people in other areas. Rather, it believes the results of the survey \u2013 conducted with Amsterdam University Medical Centres \u2013 is a reflection of problems in broader society and confirms that a vast number of footballers are affected similarly. The union wants to stress the social responsibility that comes hand in hand with economic decisions made on the nature of football\u2019s continuation, and that it is far more than a question of an entertainment industry returning. \u201cThese findings ... underline how important it is that football stakeholders work together during these uncertain times by making collective agreements that maintain social stability and relieve pressure for all employees in the industry, including the players,\u201d the Fifpro general secretary, Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, said. Baer-Hoffmann emphasised that Fifpro was not using the survey\u2019s findings as an argument to rush into resuming the football season. Only a resumption in a safe environment in which players felt comfortable and secure would reduce the number of stressors that can contribute to depression and anxiety, he said.

      "body": "<p>Something is clearly wrong. Britain does not need Boris Johnson, but it needs a prime minister, and badly. Coronavirus promises are made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/britain-on-target-for-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day-says-no-10\">and not fulfilled</a>. Orders go out and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/vital-ppe-equipment-including-400000-gowns-en-route-to-uk-delayed-nhs-coronavirus\">are not delivered</a>. The clothing industry in the UK apparently <strong> </strong>cannot mass-produce a simple medical gown or mask, and must turn to Turkey, China and volunteers with sewing machines and 3D printers for supplies.</p> <p>Ever since Tony Blair came to power, the British government has been what some observers call \u201cNapoleonic\u201d. The focus of authority was one person sitting on a sofa. In good times, it has worked. In a bad time, it has collapsed. At first, Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/nonchalant-boris-johnson-accused-of-covid-19-complacency\">didn\u2019t take Covid-19 seriously</a>, then he changed his mind and his advisers \u2013 and put himself in charge. Then he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/27/boris-johnson-promises-to-lead-national-fightback-despite-testing-positive-for-coronavirus-video\">got ill and vanished</a>.</p> <p>Since then, a stage army of second-rate ministers, with a media alternately cheering and jeering, seemed in thrall to one man, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">Neil Ferguson of Imperial College</a>, whose record of modelling of past epidemics <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/neil-ferguson-scientist-convinced-boris-johnson-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-criticised/\">has been criticised</a>.</p> <p>Now, as countries across Europe feel their way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/israel-and-south-korea-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdowns\">ending lockdown</a>, Britain\u2019s government refuses even to mention the phrase, let alone debate it. A public experiencing immense economic precariousness is considered unfit to be told anything, other than to obey orders of ludicrous joy-suppression. Sitting on a park bench is a police offence.</p> <p>This week, the Europe-wide consensus on combating Covid-19 is starting to crumble. Death rates are plateauing, and at levels where national health services feel they can cope with a return to partial normality (as it appears can Britain\u2019s). Shops and schools are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/angela-merkel-announces-plans-reopen-schools-shops-germany-coronavirus-lockdown\">cautiously reopening</a>. Public spaces are refilling, within limits. In every country, every province, arguments are taking place, and what amounts to a great experiment is under way, with wildly unreliable statistics.</p> <p>Not in Britain. No one is in charge. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/matt-hancock-dominic-raab-ppe-care-badges\">serial promiser</a> rather than deliverer. He is like a signalman with his wires cut. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is clearly not senior enough to win the case for relaxation. The stand-in prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/13/raab-sticks-to-the-old-non-je-ne-regrette-rien\">Dominic Raab</a>, intones slogans about \u201cprotecting the NHS\u201d. A government that resorts to slogans has lost an argument.</p> <p>There is now a serious functional disconnect between Whitehall on the one hand and the Covid-19 economy on the other. The failures revealed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/labour-urges-government-publish-findings-2016-pandemic-drill\">2016 Cygnus report</a> on pandemic preparedness were not acted upon. Sunak\u2019s 80% loan scheme has not worked, because banks were told to shoulder 20% of the risk and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/19/pressure-intensifies-for-100-government-backed-business-loans\">many are naturally baling</a>. It should have been 100%.

      "bodyText": "Something is clearly wrong. Britain does not need Boris Johnson, but it needs a prime minister, and badly. Coronavirus promises are made and not fulfilled. Orders go out and are not delivered. The clothing industry in the UK apparently cannot mass-produce a simple medical gown or mask, and must turn to Turkey, China and volunteers with sewing machines and 3D printers for supplies. Ever since Tony Blair came to power, the British government has been what some observers call \u201cNapoleonic\u201d. The focus of authority was one person sitting on a sofa. In good times, it has worked. In a bad time, it has collapsed. At first, Johnson didn\u2019t take Covid-19 seriously, then he changed his mind and his advisers \u2013 and put himself in charge. Then he got ill and vanished. Since then, a stage army of second-rate ministers, with a media alternately cheering and jeering, seemed in thrall to one man, Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, whose record of modelling of past epidemics has been criticised. Now, as countries across Europe feel their way to ending lockdown, Britain\u2019s government refuses even to mention the phrase, let alone debate it. A public experiencing immense economic precariousness is considered unfit to be told anything, other than to obey orders of ludicrous joy-suppression. Sitting on a park bench is a police offence. This week, the Europe-wide consensus on combating Covid-19 is starting to crumble. Death rates are plateauing, and at levels where national health services feel they can cope with a return to partial normality (as it appears can Britain\u2019s). Shops and schools are cautiously reopening. Public spaces are refilling, within limits. In every country, every province, arguments are taking place, and what amounts to a great experiment is under way, with wildly unreliable statistics. Not in Britain. No one is in charge. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is a serial promiser rather than deliverer. He is like a signalman with his wires cut. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is clearly not senior enough to win the case for relaxation. The stand-in prime minister, Dominic Raab, intones slogans about \u201cprotecting the NHS\u201d. A government that resorts to slogans has lost an argument. There is now a serious functional disconnect between Whitehall on the one hand and the Covid-19 economy on the other. The failures revealed in the 2016 Cygnus report on pandemic preparedness were not acted upon. Sunak\u2019s 80% loan scheme has not worked, because banks were told to shoulder 20% of the risk and many are naturally baling. It should have been 100%. The furlough subsidies are similarly mired in bureaucracy. Money should have been \u201cprinted\u201d and paid into individual bank accounts, not to companies. Most serious has been an apparent collapse in public health beyond the realm of the NHS. From the start of the outbreak, the focus of attention should have been on those already caring for the elderly. Yet for weeks, care homes and home carers were not mentioned and the progress of the virus for them was not monitored. Because they were not \u201cour NHS\u201d, they were not even our dead. The NHS was showered with beds and praise, while its workers were left at home, untested. Local government, which everywhere else in Europe seems to be deeply involved this emergency, was simply ignored. Equipment was not supplied, money was not spent. Whitehall famously hates \u201clocal\u201d \u2013 and it shows. If Johnson really thinks the country is at war, then the enemy has walked all over him at first push. It is right that the nation should summon its spirits to boost the morale of medical and caring staff. Their morale is crucial to public confidence. But in this emergency, morale is a function of competent government.

      "body": "<p>The modern world has been shaped by the belief that humans can outsmart and defeat death. That was a revolutionary new attitude. For most of history, humans meekly submitted to death. Up to the late modern age, most religions and ideologies saw death not only as our inevitable fate, but as the main source of meaning in life. The most important events of human existence happened after you exhaled your last breath. Only then did you come to learn the true secrets of life. Only then did you gain eternal salvation, or suffer everlasting damnation. In a world without death \u2013 and therefore without heaven, hell or reincarnation \u2013 religions such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism would have made no sense. For most of history the best human minds were busy giving meaning to death, not trying to defeat it.</p> <p><em>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview26\">Epic of Gilgamesh</a></em>, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, the Bible, the Qur\u2019an, the Vedas, and countless other sacred books and tales patiently explained to distressed humans that we die because God decreed it, or the Cosmos, or Mother Nature, and we had better accept that destiny with humility and grace. Perhaps someday God would abolish death through a grand metaphysical gesture such as Christ\u2019s second coming. But orchestrating such cataclysms was clearly above the pay grade of flesh-and-blood humans.</p> <p>Then came the scientific revolution. For scientists, death isn\u2019t a divine decree \u2013 it is merely a technical problem. Humans die not because God said so, but because of some technical glitch. The heart stops pumping blood. Cancer has destroyed the liver. Viruses multiply in the lungs. And what is responsible for all these technical problems? Other technical problems. The heart stops pumping blood because not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle. Cancerous cells spread in the liver because of some chance genetic mutation. Viruses settled in my lungs because somebody sneezed on the bus. Nothing metaphysical about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3419a4521af00f4d50c8cde129de9970d8b85d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3419a4521af00f4d50c8cde129de9970d8b85d81/0_138_3888_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Coleman from Dublin at Knock Shrine, Co Mayo, May 2010, when he claimed that an Apparation would take place, directly linked to the second coming of Christ on Earth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Coleman from Dublin at Knock Shrine, Co Mayo, May 2010, when he claimed that an apparition would take place, directly linked to the second coming of Christ on Earth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Behal/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And science believes that every technical problem has a technical solution. We don\u2019t need to wait for Christ\u2019s second coming in order to overcome death. A couple of scientists in a lab can do it. Whereas traditionally death was the speciality of priests and theologians in black cassocks, now it\u2019s the folks in white lab coats. If the heart flutters, we can stimulate it with a pacemaker or even transplant a new heart. If cancer rampages, we can kill it with radiation. If viruses proliferate in the lungs, we can subdue them with some new medicine.</p> <p>True, at present we cannot solve all technical problems. But we are working on them. The best human minds no longer spend their time trying to give meaning to death. Instead, they are busy extending life. They are investigating the microbiological, physiological and genetic systems responsible for disease and old age, and developing new medicines and revolutionary treatments.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In their struggle to extend life, humans have been remarkably successful. Over the last two centuries, average life expectancy has jumped from under 40 years to 72 in the entire world, and to more than 80 in some developed countries. Children in particular have succeeded in escaping death\u2019s clutches. Until the 20th century, at least a third of children never reached adulthood. Youngsters routinely succumbed to childhood diseases such as dysentery, measles and smallpox. In 17th-century England, about 150 out of every 1,000 newborns died during their first year, and only about 700 made it to age 15. Today, only five out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and 993 get to celebrate their 15th birthday. In the world as a whole, child mortality is down to less than 5%.</p> <p>Humans have been so successful in our attempt to safeguard and prolong life that our worldview has changed in a profound way. While traditional religions considered the afterlife as the main source of meaning, from the 18th century ideologies such as liberalism, socialism and feminism lost all interest in the afterlife. What, exactly, happens to a communist after he or she dies? What happens to a capitalist? What happens to a feminist? It is pointless to look for the answer in the writings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-marx\">Karl Marx</a>, Adam Smith or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/simonedebeauvoir\">Simone de Beauvoir</a>.</p> <p>The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is nationalism. In its more poetic and desperate moments, nationalism promises that whoever dies for the nation will live forever in its collective memory. Yet this promise is so fuzzy that even most nationalists do not really know what to make of it. How do you actually \u201clive\u201d in memory? If you are dead, how do you know whether people remember you or not? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/09/apropos-of-nothing-by-woody-allen-review-a-life-and-an-accusation\">Woody Allen</a> was once asked if he hoped to live for ever in the memory of moviegoers. Allen answered: \u201cI\u2019d rather live on in my apartment.\u201d Even many traditional religions have switched focus. Instead of promising some heaven in the afterlife, they have begun to put far more emphasis on what they can do for you in this life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is nationalism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Will the current pandemic change human attitudes to death? Probably not. Just the opposite. Covid-19 will probably cause us to only double our efforts to protect human lives. For the dominant cultural reaction to Covid-19 isn\u2019t resignation \u2013 it is a mixture of outrage and hope.</p> <p>When an epidemic erupted in a pre-modern society such as medieval Europe, people of course feared for their lives and were devastated by the death of loved ones, but the main cultural reaction was one of resignation. Psychologists might call it \u201clearned helplessness\u201d. People told themselves it was God\u2019s will \u2013 or perhaps divine retribution for the sins of humankind. \u201cGod knows best. We wicked humans deserve it. And you will see, it will all turn out for the best in the end. Don\u2019t worry, good people will get their reward in heaven.

      "bodyText": "The modern world has been shaped by the belief that humans can outsmart and defeat death. That was a revolutionary new attitude. For most of history, humans meekly submitted to death. Up to the late modern age, most religions and ideologies saw death not only as our inevitable fate, but as the main source of meaning in life. The most important events of human existence happened after you exhaled your last breath. Only then did you come to learn the true secrets of life. Only then did you gain eternal salvation, or suffer everlasting damnation. In a world without death \u2013 and therefore without heaven, hell or reincarnation \u2013 religions such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism would have made no sense. For most of history the best human minds were busy giving meaning to death, not trying to defeat it. The Epic of Gilgamesh, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, the Bible, the Qur\u2019an, the Vedas, and countless other sacred books and tales patiently explained to distressed humans that we die because God decreed it, or the Cosmos, or Mother Nature, and we had better accept that destiny with humility and grace. Perhaps someday God would abolish death through a grand metaphysical gesture such as Christ\u2019s second coming. But orchestrating such cataclysms was clearly above the pay grade of flesh-and-blood humans. Then came the scientific revolution. For scientists, death isn\u2019t a divine decree \u2013 it is merely a technical problem. Humans die not because God said so, but because of some technical glitch. The heart stops pumping blood. Cancer has destroyed the liver. Viruses multiply in the lungs. And what is responsible for all these technical problems? Other technical problems. The heart stops pumping blood because not enough oxygen reaches the heart muscle. Cancerous cells spread in the liver because of some chance genetic mutation. Viruses settled in my lungs because somebody sneezed on the bus. Nothing metaphysical about it. And science believes that every technical problem has a technical solution. We don\u2019t need to wait for Christ\u2019s second coming in order to overcome death. A couple of scientists in a lab can do it. Whereas traditionally death was the speciality of priests and theologians in black cassocks, now it\u2019s the folks in white lab coats. If the heart flutters, we can stimulate it with a pacemaker or even transplant a new heart. If cancer rampages, we can kill it with radiation. If viruses proliferate in the lungs, we can subdue them with some new medicine. True, at present we cannot solve all technical problems. But we are working on them. The best human minds no longer spend their time trying to give meaning to death. Instead, they are busy extending life. They are investigating the microbiological, physiological and genetic systems responsible for disease and old age, and developing new medicines and revolutionary treatments. \u2022\u2022\u2022 In their struggle to extend life, humans have been remarkably successful. Over the last two centuries, average life expectancy has jumped from under 40 years to 72 in the entire world, and to more than 80 in some developed countries. Children in particular have succeeded in escaping death\u2019s clutches. Until the 20th century, at least a third of children never reached adulthood. Youngsters routinely succumbed to childhood diseases such as dysentery, measles and smallpox. In 17th-century England, about 150 out of every 1,000 newborns died during their first year, and only about 700 made it to age 15. Today, only five out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and 993 get to celebrate their 15th birthday. In the world as a whole, child mortality is down to less than 5%. Humans have been so successful in our attempt to safeguard and prolong life that our worldview has changed in a profound way. While traditional religions considered the afterlife as the main source of meaning, from the 18th century ideologies such as liberalism, socialism and feminism lost all interest in the afterlife. What, exactly, happens to a communist after he or she dies? What happens to a capitalist? What happens to a feminist? It is pointless to look for the answer in the writings of Karl Marx, Adam Smith or Simone de Beauvoir. The only modern ideology that still awards death a central role is nationalism. In its more poetic and desperate moments, nationalism promises that whoever dies for the nation will live forever in its collective memory. Yet this promise is so fuzzy that even most nationalists do not really know what to make of it. How do you actually \u201clive\u201d in memory? If you are dead, how do you know whether people remember you or not? Woody Allen was once asked if he hoped to live for ever in the memory of moviegoers. Allen answered: \u201cI\u2019d rather live on in my apartment.\u201d Even many traditional religions have switched focus. Instead of promising some heaven in the afterlife, they have begun to put far more emphasis on what they can do for you in this life. Will the current pandemic change human attitudes to death? Probably not. Just the opposite. Covid-19 will probably cause us to only double our efforts to protect human lives. For the dominant cultural reaction to Covid-19 isn\u2019t resignation \u2013 it is a mixture of outrage and hope. When an epidemic erupted in a pre-modern society such as medieval Europe, people of course feared for their lives and were devastated by the death of loved ones, but the main cultural reaction was one of resignation. Psychologists might call it \u201clearned helplessness\u201d. People told themselves it was God\u2019s will \u2013 or perhaps divine retribution for the sins of humankind. \u201cGod knows best. We wicked humans deserve it. And you will see, it will all turn out for the best in the end. Don\u2019t worry, good people will get their reward in heaven. And don\u2019t waste time looking for a medicine. This disease was sent by God to punish us. Those who think humans can overcome this epidemic by their own ingenuity are merely adding the sin of vanity to their other crimes. Who are we to thwart God\u2019s plans?\u201d Attitudes today are the polar opposite. Whenever some disaster kills many people \u2013 a train accident, a high-rise fire, even a hurricane \u2013 we tend to view it as a preventable human failure rather than as divine punishment or an inevitable natural calamity. If the train company didn\u2019t stint on its safety budget, if the municipality had adopted better fire regulations, and if the government had sent help quicker \u2013 these people could have been saved. In the 21st century, mass death has become an automatic reason for lawsuits and investigations. This is our attitude towards plagues, too.

      "bodyText": "With more countries planning to loosen restrictions imposed due to coronavirus but the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, concerned about the potential for a resurgence or second wave, here is what we know from the rest of the world about the risk of Covid-19 coming back. Will there be a second wave? Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics. Other flu pandemics \u2013 including in 1957 and 1968 \u2013 all had multiple waves. The 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic started in April and was followed, in the US and temperate northern hemisphere, by a second wave in the autumn. How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity. While second waves and secondary peaks within the period of a pandemic are technically different, the concern is essentially the same: the disease coming back in force. Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back elsewhere? This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden resurgence in infections despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak. Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in cramped dormitory accommodation used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens. With 1,426 new cases reported on Monday and nine dormitories \u2013 the biggest of which holds 24,000 men \u2013 declared isolation units, Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it. A small rise late last week in the number of infections in Germany \u2013 another country credited with handling its outbreak well via extensive testing and tracing \u2013 has also drawn attention, even as the country moved to loosen restrictions. And despite China\u2019s apparent success in bringing the outbreak in Hubei province under control, there has been an increase in cases in the country\u2019s north. A new cluster of coronavirus cases in the north-eastern city of Harbin near the Russian border has forced authorities to impose fresh lockdowns, after reporting near-zero local transmissions in recent weeks. All of this raises questions over when, and how, to reduce lockdowns to avoid a second wave or resurgence. What are experts worried about? Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration \u2013 which has triggered protests in the US and elsewhere \u2013 and the urgent need to reopen economies. The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available. In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with a vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves. As Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote strikingly for the Washington Post in March: \u201cEpidemics are like fires.

      "bodyText": "BBC Radio 1 has announced a charity single to benefit coronavirus relief, performed by 23 major pop stars. The cover of Foo Fighters\u2019 Times Like These, using \u201cphones, pots, pans and acoustic guitars\u201d, according to producer Fraser T Smith, features artists spanning pop, rock, rap, soul, dancehall and R&amp;B, including Dua Lipa, Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin, Rita Ora and Ellie Goulding. It will be released as a single, with profits from UK streams and downloads going to Children in Need and Comic Relief to help British people affected by the coronavirus crisis. Profits from international listeners will go to the World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Smith, known for his production work with Adele, Stormzy and Dave, said it was humbling to work on the song, adding: Our vision was to create a stay at home version using phones, pots, pans and acoustic guitars that would honour the brilliance and honesty of the artists and song, rather than the trickery of an expensive recording studio. We tried to make this single in a totally different way artistically, relevant to today. The lyrics particularly resonate with us all at this challenging time. Lipa said she was \u201cso proud that we\u2019ve been able to come together to record this track\u201d, while Goulding spoke of \u201cthe valuable role we each have to play in bringing hope, courage and strength to one another\u201d. Chris Price, Radio 1\u2019s head of music, said the cover version \u201csends a simple message to the world: that the power of music and human creativity can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to build a sense of community, togetherness and determination, even when we are forced apart\u201d. The charity single has been announced just after One World: Together at Home, a global musical charity project helmed by Lady Gaga that also benefited the Covid-19 Solidarity Response Fund, as well as other projects. With eight hours of performances from artists including the Rolling Stones, Stevie Wonder and Gaga herself, the livestreamed initiative raised $127m for coronavirus relief. Times Like These is released at midday on Thursday 23 April, with a video debuting that evening as part of the BBC\u2019s Big Night In charity show, which will also benefit Comic Relief and Children in Need.

General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule.</p>\n    <p>The repression intensified under Castelo Branco\u2019s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called \u201canos de chumbo\u201d (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What happened during the dictatorship?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Supporters of Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic \u201cmiracle\u201d.</p>\n    <p>It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio\u2019s Guanabara bay.</p>\n    <p>But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil\u2019s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel.</p>\n    <p>It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil\u2019s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How did it end?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy.</p>\n    <p>But the pro-democracy \u201cDiretas J\u00e1\u201d (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo and Belo Horizonte.</p>\n    <p>Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At one point \u2013 snubbing social distancing rules for the umpteenth time since the coronavirus crisis began \u2013 Brazil\u2019s paratrooper-turned-president clambered onto a truck to address the hundreds-strong assembly.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe era of roguery is over.

      "bodyText": "Health officials have prioritised two clinical trials that will be supplied with blood from recovered Covid-19 patients in the hope that transfusions can help save the lives of people hospitalised with the infection. NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) has started to collect blood from recovered patients with a view to using the antibody-rich serum to boost the immune systems of patients struggling to overcome the virus. The limited supply of convalescent plasma will be given to patients enrolled on sub-studies in the Recovery trial led by Peter Horby at the University of Oxford, and the Remap-Cap trial led by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) in London. The Recovery trial will assess whether the plasma helps patients to recover before they are admitted to intensive care, while the Remap-Cap trial will investigate whether similar transfusions help to save patients who are already in high-dependency or intensive care units. At least one trial that was designed to assess whether the plasma could protect healthy people who are in close contact with Covid-19 patients, such as NHS staff and family members, was rejected by NHSBT amid a shortage of the donated serum. Convalescent plasma therapy dates back more than a century and was used in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The treatment relies on the presence of antibodies that provide some level of immunity to patients who have recovered from the virus. The most effective transfusions contain high levels of antibodies that can, in principle, boost the recipient\u2019s immune defences for weeks. Doctors in China used convalescent plasma as an emergency therapy when the outbreak was raging on the mainland, and while early anecdotal evidence suggests it may have helped, formal clinical trials are needed to determine whether the intervention is really safe and effective, and that patients would not have recovered as well without it. In the US, where the number of reported coronavirus cases is greater than in any other country, doctors have rapidly expanded a trial of convalescent plasma which has been given to hundreds of patients. NHSBT is seeking blood donations from patients aged 17 to 66 who recovered at least 28 days ago, the time it takes to be certain that persistent antibodies are in the bloodstream. Donations can be made at 23 centres across England. Prof Sir Robert Lechler, the president of the Academy of Medical Sciences and executive director of King\u2019s Health Partners, which includes King\u2019s College London and three major London hospitals, is keen to trial the therapy and has been contacted directly by recovered patients who want to know how to donate their blood. \u201cConvalescent plasma transfusions are not a silver bullet solution for the coronavirus health crisis; however, they do have the potential to be hugely beneficial.

But technology has moved a huge distance since then and so has our understanding of how vaccines work.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen you step back at the end of the shift, you realise we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s of immense importance. We\u2019re in a privileged job where we can try to find a treatment for it.\u201d</p> \n<h2>___<br>Quick and painless</h2> \n<p><br>In the meantime, testing is critical. University hospital now has a dedicated swab-testing pod which can cater for up to 120 patients a day.</p> \n<p>Initially, testing was open to members of the public, but it has recently been scaled back to NHS staff and their families (members of the public can attend neighbouring centres).</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very quick, relatively painless. It\u2019s just uncomfortable,\u201d says the modern matron Amanda Jarvis. \u201cIt\u2019s two swabs for an adult: nasal swab and throat \u2013 right at the back of the throat. It takes a couple of minutes.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e3130b42e2ac6d234ceebc3e7b7771376dfdf34\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e3130b42e2ac6d234ceebc3e7b7771376dfdf34/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A swab used in the testing pod.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A swab used in the testing pod.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ca0ff8aa06259e318be87695681fe614d1a0514\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ca0ff8aa06259e318be87695681fe614d1a0514/0_0_6516_4344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leo Harris-Mortimer, four, is swab tested.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leo Harris-Mortimer, four, is swab tested.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Leo Harris-Mortimer, four, is swab tested.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Alex Mortimer, a paediatrician, has brought his four-year-old son, Leo Harris-Mortimer, for a test. Leo has had a dry cough for several days; Alex\u2019s wife had previously displayed symptoms, too.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith this particular illness, the profile is that the older population are much more vulnerable to it, but there are a number of case studies that show children have been infected and have been affected badly. So it\u2019s an important illness to take very seriously,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p>The test result takes between 48 and 72 hours to arrive, meaning Mortimer could soon be back at work if his son gets the all clear. Were it not for this rapid testing, he would have to undergo a precautionary period of isolation, excluding him from service for weeks.</p> \n<h2>___<br>Halfway up Mount Everest</h2> \n<p><br>Back in the dimly lit corridors surrounding ITU, nurses and consultants prepare to enter the highly infectious wards. Just like Billyard before them, they too must don \u2013 and later doff \u2013 every piece of equipment with the utmost precision, otherwise the risk of contaminating themselves, the safe zones and future patients is extreme.</p> \n<p>Yellow and black hazard tape marks the flooring \u2013 tread on the wrong side of it and you will be quickly admonished \u2013 and white plastic sheets with red zippers seal the outer perimeter of the changing zone.</p> \n<p>Each person who enters ITU is likely to stay inside for three hours or more before they take a 20-minute break. The sweat caused by wearing so much plastic is instantaneous and the FFP3 masks irritate the nose and skin. Yet there can be no distractions in critical care, where half of all patients with Covid-19 will not survive.</p> \n<p>(The NHS says it hopes that by allowing a photojournalist to document the care provided in ITU, it may reinforce the need to stay at home and protect the NHS.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe\u2019re used to death \u2013 death is part of life in intensive care \u2013 but not in the kind of numbers that we\u2019re seeing, and that\u2019s really quite hard to take,\u201d says Tom Billyard, a consultant at University hospital in Coventry, as he reflects on the unprecedented challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. In preparation for his latest 12-hour shift in ITU, where the worst affected patients are given life support, Billyard begins to don several layers of personal protective equipment (PPE) over his blue scrubs. First a pair of latex gloves, then a surgical hat. Next a full-length gown tied together at the rear, followed by an additional pair of latex gloves which are meticulously taped on to the sleeves for extra security. Finally, an FFP3 mask, which grips his face so tightly it will leave red marks across his cheeks, and a yellow-rimmed plastic visor to provide a secondary barrier against the disease. \u201cI feel trepidation,\u201d he says softly, before entering. \u201cThere\u2019s a load of patients in there and I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to survive this.\u201d Tom Billyard, a consultant at University hospital, which is part of the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire trust (UHCW). Roger Townsend, clinical lead for intensive care. All photographs by Jonny Weeks. ___ Struggling for breath Billyard is one of more than 9,000 employees at the hospital, all of whom \u2013 porters and nurses, cleaners and chaplains, consultants and volunteers \u2013 have a vital role to play in the treatment of patients and the functioning of the hospital. Emily Jones, a senior sister in the emergency department (ED), works on the hospital\u2019s frontline. \u201cED is usually quite noisy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case now \u2013 you don\u2019t see the patients immediately, until you look through the curtains, and then you realise quite how unwell they can be. \u201cWe\u2019ve had everything from patients who have self-presented at the door saying: \u2018I\u2019ve had a cough for a few days,\u2019 to people who have walked up the stairs to get to the emergency department and can barely hold a sentence with you. We\u2019re also getting crews bringing in patients of various ages who are struggling to get breaths while they\u2019re on oxygen.\u201d The West Midlands is one of the UK\u2019s most affected regions. At the time of writing, University hospital has admitted 568 patients with Covid-19 and recorded 161 deaths from it, while 316 patients have been discharged after making full recoveries. It has transferred its minor injuries unit to a neighbouring hospital within the Trust, allowing it to prioritise the influx of Covid-19 patients. \u201cWow,\u201d Jones says, pausing at the severity of the symptoms she\u2019s treating. \u201cThe acuity of our patients has gone up so much. They are so much sicker than we previously saw.\u201d A blizzard of healthcare staff whirls around her \u2013 some reading patient notes, others making telephone calls, washing hands, cleaning everything in sight and, heartbreakingly, placing a picture of a dove on to the door of one of the patients. \u201cThat\u2019s to show they\u2019re on the end-of-life care pathway,\u201d a nurse explains. \u201cIt means we should give them peace.\u201d Patients and staff in the emergency department. ___ Isolation Patients who present with less life-threatening difficulties are often transferred to the respiratory wards on level three for round-the-clock care. There, the eerie silence continues. With no families visiting and the corridors all but empty, it feels like a ghost hospital. University hospital currently has 91 Covid-positive patients, 12 of whom are in ITU, with a further 72 designated \u201cquery Covid\u201d who are yet to be tested. Some lie in isolation rooms, texting friends and loved ones, others in wards of six beds; many seem in a state of shock and weariness, barely registering the world around them. Patients and staff on wards 30, 31 and 32. Mark Anders, a local paramedic, was himself struck down by Covid-19. \u201cWe all joked about going to emergency coughs and high temperatures, because that\u2019s all we were going to.\u201d He fell ill during a Saturday night shift. \u201cI got halfway through the shift and I said to my crew mate: \u2018I don\u2019t know what it is; I just don\u2019t feel right,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThen I got home and the temperature started. I had a week at home of self-isolating, looking after myself, taking paracetamol every four hours, fluids, just trying to do everything to keep my temperature down. After a week I couldn\u2019t control it. From there on: nightmare.\u201d Anders was lucky. As doctors readied him for transfer to ITU, his body began to fight back. Sitting in his pyjamas and still bearing bloody scars around his septum from the oxygen supply that kept him alive, he has been told he can soon return home to his family. \u201cMassive,\u201d he says, when asked about the value of the NHS. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been this ill in my life. They have been brilliant.\u201d Mark Anders, a paramedic who caught Covid-19, receives the thumbs up from a nurse. ___ Frightened The first case of Covid-19 in Coventry was on ward 50, the renal ward. Lakhbir Kaur, known to her colleagues as Lacky, has been a sister there for five years. She treated Coventry\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d and has watched with concern as the virus has spread through the local community. She fears that it may also transition from patients to staff. For much of her shift, she wears only an apron, gloves and surgical mask \u2013 the kind you would find in a dentist\u2019s surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she says. \u201cOur masks already have an expiry date on them and the NHS have covered up the existing expiry date with a further expiry date. What is that? Are they hiding something or are they legitimately tested? \u201cInfection control have said they have been retested [and are fit for purpose] for another 10 years. I\u2019m wary about that. I really am. I\u2019m a single parent \u2013 I\u2019ve got a daughter. She\u2019s the thing I live for. The thought of taking this home from work to her freaks me out.\u201d A close-up of the cracked skin on her hands caused by washing them so frequently. University hospital follows guidance on PPE requirements from Public Health England, the government body. Fiona Wells, who works in infection prevention control, is one of those responsible for dispensing and teaching safe use of PPE. \u201cPPE is an extremely emotive topic,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are very frightened about the possibility that it might not be enough. \u201cSome of the images we see [from abroad] show people dressed up in hazard suits \u2026 and it adds to the tension around PPE. But it comes back to the key question: what is necessary? And then using it appropriately.\u201d Each procedure and each ward might require different levels of protection. In ITU patients might undergo aerosol procedures, which are more likely to spread Covid-19 particles through the air; hence the extra layers of protection worn by Billyard and his colleagues. Approximately 5,000 University hospital staff have so far been fit-tested for FFP3 masks since January and, though the hospital has plenty of PPE in stock, it relies on unpredictable army drops for replenishment. \u201cWe have to carefully manage it to ensure we have the longevity because this pandemic isn\u2019t going to be finished next week,\u201d Wells warns. PPE supplies; Tom Billyard adjusts the nose-bridge on a colleague\u2019s FFP3 mask. Lei Dayrit, a nurse who worked at Hospital of St Cross in Rugby, University hospital\u2019s sister hospital, died from Covid-19-related complications last week. She was one of several nurses who treated an asymptomatic Covid-19 patient who later became symptomatic. Her death was mourned on Thursday evening during the weekly \u201cclap for carers\u201d gathering outside University hospital, where a banner was unfurled in her honour. With tears in her eyes, the staff nurse Gail Hobley, a long-time colleague, said: \u201cShe was a special nurse to work with. Very caring, very supportive. We had a little discussion about Covid and she said everybody will look after each other, and we are. The support we have from everybody [in the community] is terrific.\u201d Colleagues gather to mourn the death of Lei Dayrit, a nurse who died of Covid-19. ___ Loved and cared for In the hospital\u2019s faith centre, the Rev John Matipano, one of the chaplains at University hospital, offers reassurance to those in need. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing rounds, supporting staff, and we\u2019ve had staff say: \u2018Please pray for us\u2019 \u2013 something that you would never imagine happening given the way people are quite private about their faith,\u201d he says. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t speak to staff, if you just go around ED and they see that a chaplain is here, they feel that someone cares, someone is there for them. Now, more than anything else, presence is very important.\u201d Of all the heartbreak caused by Covid-19, nothing compares with the inability of families to see \u2013 and say goodbye to \u2013 their loved ones in person. Only in ITU can a dying patient receive one visitor. Some patients have, at least, been able to communicate with friends and family via video conferencing apps on tablets donated to the hospital. Wells found this especially moving when her grandfather was admitted with Covid-19. \u201cHe was able to tell my family he loved them and to sign goodbye via FaceTime before he died,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew the staff on the ward he was on. They were amazing. They stepped up and fulfilled a role that we weren\u2019t able to fulfil. My mum feels happy that he was well loved and cared for.\u201d ___ A personal promise Throughout the hospital, one unexpected sound punctuates the silence: laughter. In these dark times, a joke between colleagues provides a flicker of normality to offset the stress. Thierno Siedou Diallo, a cleaner, puts it simply: \u201cYou must come in and laugh. You give assurance to everybody.\u201d In the medical decisions unit, Stacey Gavin, a band six sister in acute medicine, is sporting a \u201cbride to be\u201d sash. \u201cI was supposed to be in Benidorm this weekend for my hen do. About 13 of us were going, a mixture of family and friends. Unfortunately it got cancelled about a month ago. So I said if I\u2019m not going on my hen do, I\u2019ll bring my hen do to work. \u201cThe girls put on a little celebration at break time in the staff room. They got Shloer, pretending to be champagne!\u201d Stacey Gavin, a sister in acute medicine, celebrating her hen do at work. Ash Patini, a volunteer. Like most staff, Gavin has offered to worked extra shifts, forgoing her annual leave. She and her colleagues are helped by a group of dedicated volunteers and charity workers, among them Ash Patini. \u201cI lost my mum 17 years ago to terminal cancer and that absolutely changed my views on life what I wanted to do. She was made to feel very, very happy and comfortable here, right to the very end. It\u2019s something I can never forget. \u201cI promised myself that one day I would give something back. I kept that vision for 17 years [until taking early retirement]. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m back here; that\u2019s why I do what I do.\u201d The charity stock room is piled high with donations such as Easter eggs, crisps, sweets, fruit bars and toiletries. Elsewhere, local manufacturers such as Jaguar Land Rover have supplied visors for hospital staff, while many nurses have been given homemade headbands to alleviate the sores caused by wearing face masks. Visors and head-guards given to the hospital. ___ Privileged position In preparation for the pandemic, significant changes were made throughout the hospital\u2019s infrastructure: wards were repurposed, staff retrained, junior doctors given greater responsibilities, and strategies put in place to manage the trajectory of the disease. Kiran Patel, chief medical officer, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve probably had about 20 years\u2019 worth of transformation happen in the space of a month. And we\u2019ve probably had over 135 year-one to year-three students, and about 150 graduates, who have basically just hit the ground running and been brilliant.\u201d Following teleconferences with hospitals in China, Japan and Italy, University hospital has already prepared a reserve ITU ward of 32 beds and could raise capacity even higher, if needed. The hospital has also joined studies run by the World Health Organization. Nicolas Aldridge, lead nurse for research and development, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at a mixture of anti-viral medications such as hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria medication. We\u2019re gaining large numbers of patients for research because most of the existing research is only from small samples.\u201d Questioned on Donald Trump\u2019s recent support for the drug, despite limited evidence to support its efficacy in fighting Covid-19, Aldridge says diplomatically: \u201cIf we knew it would work, we wouldn\u2019t be doing research on it.\u201d \u201cHistorically, I think the last vaccine took 15 years to create. But technology has moved a huge distance since then and so has our understanding of how vaccines work. \u201cWhen you step back at the end of the shift, you realise we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s of immense importance. We\u2019re in a privileged job where we can try to find a treatment for it.\u201d ___ Quick and painless In the meantime, testing is critical. University hospital now has a dedicated swab-testing pod which can cater for up to 120 patients a day. Initially, testing was open to members of the public, but it has recently been scaled back to NHS staff and their families (members of the public can attend neighbouring centres). \u201cIt\u2019s very quick, relatively painless. It\u2019s just uncomfortable,\u201d says the modern matron Amanda Jarvis. \u201cIt\u2019s two swabs for an adult: nasal swab and throat \u2013 right at the back of the throat. It takes a couple of minutes.\u201d Leo Harris-Mortimer, four, is swab tested. Alex Mortimer, a paediatrician, has brought his four-year-old son, Leo Harris-Mortimer, for a test. Leo has had a dry cough for several days; Alex\u2019s wife had previously displayed symptoms, too. \u201cWith this particular illness, the profile is that the older population are much more vulnerable to it, but there are a number of case studies that show children have been infected and have been affected badly. So it\u2019s an important illness to take very seriously,\u201d he says. The test result takes between 48 and 72 hours to arrive, meaning Mortimer could soon be back at work if his son gets the all clear. Were it not for this rapid testing, he would have to undergo a precautionary period of isolation, excluding him from service for weeks. ___ Halfway up Mount Everest Back in the dimly lit corridors surrounding ITU, nurses and consultants prepare to enter the highly infectious wards. Just like Billyard before them, they too must don \u2013 and later doff \u2013 every piece of equipment with the utmost precision, otherwise the risk of contaminating themselves, the safe zones and future patients is extreme. Yellow and black hazard tape marks the flooring \u2013 tread on the wrong side of it and you will be quickly admonished \u2013 and white plastic sheets with red zippers seal the outer perimeter of the changing zone. Each person who enters ITU is likely to stay inside for three hours or more before they take a 20-minute break. The sweat caused by wearing so much plastic is instantaneous and the FFP3 masks irritate the nose and skin. Yet there can be no distractions in critical care, where half of all patients with Covid-19 will not survive. (The NHS says it hopes that by allowing a photojournalist to document the care provided in ITU, it may reinforce the need to stay at home and protect the NHS. Some viewers may find the following images distressing.) Medics in and around ITU, where signs warn of the extreme infection risk within. Roger Townsend is a clinical lead for ITU. \u201cWorking in the PPE is hot, uncomfortable, and because you can\u2019t take your mask off in the critical care area, you can\u2019t drink a glass of water,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s always the temptation to do one more job before you leave. So when you say to yourself: \u2018I\u2019ll wear this for two hours and then go out and have a drink and then come back in,\u2019 you find sometimes three, four hours have gone by or even longer.\u201d Inside ITU, many patients are in comas and connected to a vast array of machinery \u2013 ventilators, monitors, infusion pumps and sometimes dialysis machines \u2013 while groups of nurses and doctors check their vital signs. Nurses in ITU attend to their patients. Heart monitors flicker and nurses confer; Billyard wanders the ward, scanning for problems. Many of the patients he surveys are middle-aged. Behind a curtain, a patient is flipped on to their front \u2013 a process known as \u201cproning\u201d. It takes five people to roll one patient. Each of them has their name written across their front and back, because there would be no other way to recognise who was who. A patient is \u2018proned\u2019 \u2013 turned on to their front \u2013 to assist with breathing. In another bay, one of the few conscious patients is wearing a pressurised breathing apparatus. His head is entirely encased. \u201cBy the time a patient comes to critical care, they have got the kind of oxygen levels that you would have not quite half way up Mount Everest,\u201d says Townsend, \u201cand that\u2019s on supplemental oxygen to push their oxygen levels up. If we didn\u2019t intervene then the oxygen levels in their blood would fall away and they would die. The intervention that we do is essentially buying some time for mother nature to fix things.\u201d The hospital has two ITU wards and Townsend, speaking earlier in the week when ITU was busier, revealed the scale of the challenge when he said: \u201cNormally when we hand over at the end or beginning of the day, we might say that two or three patients are really sick, but we\u2019ve got 15 or 16 patients on each unit who I would say fit that definition. You do go home shell-shocked.\u201d ___ One second closer Far away from the trauma of ITU, in a scientific laboratory filled with test tubes, refrigerators and unfathomable machines, Ranveer Singh Chaven, a bio medical scientist, is busy analysing results from Covid-19 swab tests. \u201cOptimism is everything, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t come to work. I\u2019m sure I speak for everyone here at the hospital when I say we\u2019ll work day and night.\u201d Ranveer Singh Chaven, a bio medical scientist, and his phone, which shows how long it has been since he last gave his mum and niece a hug. He digs into his pocket and shows me an app on his phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got a timer on my phone,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve seen my mum and given her a hug, or kissed my niece goodnight: 24 days, 10 hours, 26 minutes, 53 seconds.\u201d He pauses, then adds: \u201cI keep that with me just to keep me going. If it brings me a second closer to seeing them \u2026 that\u2019s why we do this.\u201d A medic walks past messages of thanks and support from the local community.",

      "bodyText": "Stresses in the oil market are building up to truly epic levels, with the US benchmark nearing the $10 per barrel mark. It started the year above $60 per barrel, before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. The price of West Texas Intermediate futures for May delivery fell as low as $10.63 on Monday, as a combination of a demand slump and rapidly filling storage capacity around the world hit markets. Oil prices are lower in real terms than at any point since the 1970s, according to Erik Britton, managing director at Fathom Consulting. He also notes the bizarre US efforts to prop up oil prices (which may have more to do with the entanglement of US companies\u2019 interests in the White House than concern for the economy): Despite the deal to cut oil production, brokered by President Trump, oil prices have continued to track downwards - the promise of reduced supply has not kept pace with the expected reduction in demand, so far. It is one of life\u2019s curiosities, for macroeconomists, that the US president would intervene to keep oil prices up, unless for environmental reasons, which feels unlikely with this administration. The US economy, like most advanced economies, is a substantial net beneficiary in the round from lower oil prices, even if the oil-producing sector is hurt. Here are some of the other important developments from today: British household finances have reached their weakest point since November 2011, according to an index broadly followed by economists. The billionaire, the bailout, and a Caribbean island: Sir Richard Branson defends against critics. International investors reject Argentine debt restructuring demands, setting the scene for tough negotiations. Italian government debt yields rose as investors priced in more risk ahead of an EU summit this week where \u201ccoronabond\u201d risk sharing will be on the agenda. You can follow our continued coverage of the pandemic response around the world: In the UK, the government says its priority is avoiding second peak of infections before easing lockdown conditions In the US, confirmed cases near 800,000 And in our global coverage, Spain proposes \u20ac1.5tn EU Covid-19 fund Thank you as ever for reading, and join us tomorrow for more business, economics and financial markets. JJ We\u2019ve caveated the plunging West Texas Intermediate price a few times: the futures contract for May delivery expires tomorrow, so a lot of traders are looking at the June contract. But this is not normal. It is the biggest one-day drop since the WTI futures contract, the US benchmark, was introduced in March 1983. Today\u2019s low on the WTI May contract is now $10.77. If it goes lower than $10.35 it will be the lowest since April 1986, the only month in the contract\u2019s record when prices fell below $10 per barrel. There is quite a striking contrast with the WTI contract for June delivery, which is trading at $22.51 - although that is still down by almost 11% today. That spread between the front-month and the second-month contract is itself a record (and the spread was briefly higher than the actual contract price, which is quite extraordinary). It\u2019s what the industry lovingly (and to outsiders, bafflingly) refers to as \u201ccontango\u201d, when futures are more expensive than the actual spot price of a barrel of oil. That means that traders will pay a premium to get the commodity at some point in the future because the price of storage is much too high in the short term. Kit Juckes, global fixed income strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: The contango in WTI prices is extraordinary. August WTI is more than twice as expensive as May. The chart shows the front contract divided by the 4th. Too much oil, with nowhere to put it. [...] This will put more pressure to reduce supply and the pressure may be felt most, under the circumstances, in North America. Nobody wants to be left with oil they can\u2019t store when the music stops, as it is threatening to... US stock market indices fell heavily at the start of trading on Monday, as oil prices slumped with traders concerned that storage facilities are rapidly running out. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 1.6%, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 2%, and the Nasdaq lost 1.1%. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, slumped to below $11 per barrel*, an astonishing 40% daily fall. *This post has been corrected. WTI fell below $11 per barrel, not $10 as previously stated. There were also some interesting comments earlier from Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, addressing the concerns that government-backed loans are not getting through to companies quickly enough. Speaking at a briefing for businesses this morning, he said that the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme\u2019s problems are no secret, and that help is not getting at the pace needed to help the economy. Haldane also said that while most businesses had been able to hang on to existing lines of credit, fewer loans are being extended than the economy needs. The government was considering 100% guaranteed loans to speed the pace that banks would give them out, he added, according to the wire report. That would mean banks would not have to worry as much about the risks attached when lending. The pace of lending has been remarkable, but then these are remarkable times: The Bank of England has been wielding a mixture of carrot and stick towards the banks during this crisis (perhaps more of the latter) and it seems to have worked so far: financial markets have for the most part functioned. New guidance for lenders suggests that Threadneedle Street is not yet satisfied by what the sector is doing. The Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) today said it expects banks to focus on continuing to support customers, even if that means using some of their buffer space. Via Reuters: Banks are expected to use their liquidity buffers in doing so, even if it means liquidity coverage ratios go significantly below 100%. The PRA said they would give lenders sufficient time after the crisis to replenish their liquidity and capital buffers, which they are forced to hold in better times in case of catastrophe - one of the lessons learned from the financial crisis 12 years ago. Startups probably get more coverage than they warrant on the whole, but then they are seen as a key source of the kind of innovation that\u2019s important for an economy\u2019s long-term prosperity. That\u2019s why the government is stepping in with support. Fast-growing UK companies will be offered \u00a31.25bn in taxpayer-backed loans, as the government attempts to protect emerging sectors of the British economy during the coronavirus pandemic, writes the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent, Richard Partington. In the latest intervention to cushion the unfolding economic blow, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the financial package would help support technology and life sciences firms so they could continue to develop innovative products, powering UK growth in future. You can read the full report on who is eligible for support here: Sir Richard Branson has faced mounting criticism for pleading for taxpayers\u2019 cash, rather than using his own fortune to rescue the airline. Now he has pledged to put up his private Caribbean island as collateral to raise money in a blog post pleading for a government bailout. You can read the full report here: Activitst are not happy. Here is Fiona Nicholls, a climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK: Richard Branson\u2019s letter failed to convince us that suing the NHS wasn\u2019t bad for the health service, moving his money to a tax haven wasn\u2019t to avoid tax, or that emitting millions of tonnes of pollution wasn\u2019t bad for the environment. There are still no justified grounds to give Virgin an unconditional bailout. Public money should be used for public goods. That should include improving workers\u2019 rights and protections, cutting back on bonuses and dividends, and limiting flights to a level compatible with the Paris Agreement. If we allow polluting industries to use the pandemic to dodge their responsibility to cut carbon, we will be turning a global crisis into a catastrophe.\u201d And US stock market futures are also indicating pain ahead for Wall Street. S&amp;P 500 futures prices are down 1.8%, Dow Jones industrial average futures prices are down 1.9%, and those for the Nasdaq have lost 1.1%. A quick round-up of market news as we approach lunchtime in London. The FTSE 100 has lost the brief bursts of good mood seen this morning, falling by 1.3% by early afternoon. The oil price fall has not helped the heavyweight energy sector. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has lost 0.8% - consumer-facing companies are the big losers, along with oil services. The Euro Stoxx 600 has lost 0.4%. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 1.3%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 is also down by 1.3% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB has lost 1.5%. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures have lost even more ground. The latest low point is $12.41 per barrel for May delivery. (N.B., the contract expires tomorrow.) Brent crude futures have lost 5% to hit lows of $26.50 per barrel. Argentina\u2019s international creditors have rejected the government\u2019s plans to ease the burden of $66.2bn in debt as the country tries to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Argentina is heading for its ninth default unless it can reach an agreement with its creditors on debt restructuring. So far, the group (a lot of whom are US fund managers) is not playing ball. Members of the group include AllianceBernstein, Amundi Asset Management, Ashmore, BlackRock, BlueBay Asset Management, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. and T. Rowe Price Associates. Another, separate group has already rejected the government\u2019s proposals. The lenders are afraid they will lose their big anticipated profits if they agree to Argentina\u2019s demands for a three-year repayment holiday and a steep cut in interest payments. The group\u2019s statement said: Regrettably, despite the efforts of the group and other stakeholders, the proposals contained in the recently published press release are not ones which the group can or will support. The group believes that all stakeholders in Argentina will need to contribute to a solution that puts Argentina on a path toward sustainable growth and financial stability. The statement does implicitly acknowledge sharing the burden is appropriate, suggesting there will be more tough negotiations to come. What do investors know about pandemics? No more than the average person on the street, for the most part. So don\u2019t take the below chart as a forecast - but it is a useful indicator of worsening market sentiment. Deutsche Bank\u2019s survey of market participants has found that the outlook for a return to normal life has worsened: While in early to mid-March expectations were that we would see life normalise over the summer, now 60% of respondents do not believe we will return to normal until September at the earliest. But bear in mind this puzzle/warning about the sometimes arbitrary functioning of markets: Interestingly the equity market has surged since this last survey even though the reality of the new slow return to normal emerges. An update on oil markets: it has got even worse for US crude futures. The West Texas Intermediate contract for May delivery has fallen by 26% today, just now hitting a low of $13.43 per barrel (likely as US traders wake up). Remember there is a technical reason for some of the decline: the contract for May delivery expires tomorrow, which can trigger some volatility. However, futures for June delivery are also steeply down: by 8.4% to $23 per barrel. Here is what it looks like this year: a brutal selloff as demand has plunged (although happily that also cushions some of the blow to economies that run on oil). Brent crude futures are also down by 3.5% at $27.10 per barrel, indicating this is very much an expression of weak global demand forecasts. This is the point in the oil market cycle when traders are looking all over for somewhere to put their oil in the hopes they can sell it once prices have risen again - whether it be ships, trains, but certainly not planes. Britain in lockdown: new spending data from Starling Bank, based on 1.25m accounts, reveals that video gaming on Playstation and Nintendo is up by 300% while Amazon purchases rose 39% in recent weeks. The bank looked at its customers\u2019 seven-day spending between the week to 15 March and that ending 5 April. Deliveroo sales were flat over that period, but some retailers saw big increases in spending: Argos (+49%), Asos (+12%), John Lewis (+13%) and Apple Store (+36%). People spent most in London, the south east and south west. Britons are also splashing out on home cooking appliances, according to the market research firm GfK. In the week 29 March to 4 April, purchases of deep fryers jumped 76.4% in value compared to the same week last year, while hot beverage makers steamed in at 65.4%. There was a 62.1% rise in purchases of sandwich makers, waffle makers and grills while mixers and food processors were also in high demand, up 61.5%. The bakery chain Pain Quotidien is reportedly close to collapse as it tries to find a buyer. The company, which has 26 UK sites, could appoint administrators as soon as this week, according to Sky News. It reported: An emergency sale process for the business, which trades from 26 sites in Britain, has set a deadline of Wednesday for offers. Alvarez &amp; Marsal, the professional services firm, is overseeing the auction and is likely to be appointed as administrator unless a solvent sale is concluded in the coming days, insiders said on Monday. Primark has agreed to pay an additional \u00a3370m to suppliers to cover stock in production or yet to be delivered after criticism for cancellation of orders during the coronavirus crisis. The cut price fashion chain, which has been forced to close stores around the world as part of efforts to control the spread of the virus, does not have an online outlet and has joined many rivals in cancelling orders from suppliers as stocks mount up in its warehouses. The company had previously committed to pay for orders that were in transit or booked for shipment by 18 March. It has now extended that commitment by another month until 17 April bringing the total amount of stock committed to or held to \u00a32bn. The retailer said it hoped to begin placing future orders for autumn/winter stock once there was further clarification of the reopening of stores. Metro Bank has promised to refund customers more than \u00a311.4m after failing to send the right information about unarranged overdraft charges to customers in their text alerts. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that while the bank texted customers to let them know they would end up entering into an unarranged overdraft, it failed to tell around 130,000 customers that they would be charged as a result. Some of the alerts were also sent later than they should have been. The breach has been ongoing since February 2018, according to the CMA. As is often the case, the CMA has been careful in its wording: it has not called this an order or a fine, but said Metro had instead \u201ccommitted to repay\u201d affected customers \u00a310.5m in fees, plus 8% interest on the charges. The lender will also consider \u201creasonable claims\u201d for customers who were hit with extra costs as a result of the charges. HSBC, Santander and Nationwide last year agreed to pay back millions of pounds to customers over similar breaches. David Thomasson, chief commercial officer at Metro Bank, said: We are very sorry that we didn\u2019t include all the information we should have done on our overdraft text alerts, and that on certain occasions some customers did not receive these alerts before 10am as they should have done. This isn\u2019t the level of service that we pride ourselves on providing and we are now contacting any customers who have been impacted to put things right for them as quickly as possible. Richard Branson has said he will use his private island as security to raise money in an effort to protect jobs, as he defended himself against criticisms for seeking a government bailout. Branson complained that references to his multi-billion-pound net worth do not take into account the fall in stock market valuations of the various Virgin companies in which he owns stakes. Branson\u2019s empire was last year valued at \u00a34.5bn b the Sunday Times Rich List. Bloomberg\u2019s Billionaires Index, which takes into account live movements in stock market values, still puts his fortune at $5.9 (\u00a34.7bn). The post notes that he has committed $250m (or \u201ca quarter of a billion dollars\u201d, in Branson-speak) to protect jobs, but he is also looking for as much as \u00a3500m to help Virgin Atlantic, the airline in which he owns a majority stake, while planes are grounded. Branson also bristled against references to his residence in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), meaning he has paid the UK exchequer no personal income tax for 14 years. He and his wife moved there because of the \u201cbeautiful\u201d surroundings, he said. Here are some excerpts from the blog: I\u2019ve seen lots of comments about my net worth \u2013 but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw. Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities. The challenge right now is that there is no money coming in and lots going out. Today, the cash we have in the Virgin Group and my personal wealth is being invested across many companies around the world to protect as many jobs as possible, with a big part of that going to Virgin Atlantic. We will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for. This would be in the form of a commercial loan \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be free money and the airline would pay it back. The reality of this unprecedented crisis is that many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it. Without it there won\u2019t be any competition left and hundreds of thousands more jobs will be lost, along with critical connectivity and huge economic value. Branson, the owner of a large stake in an intercontinental airline, also highlighted his donations to fighting the climate crisis. Hopes for the future for British households also look to have been severely curtailed, if the job security reading in IHS Markit\u2019s household finances index is anything to go by. The reading fell off a cliff to by far its lowest since the survey began (although bear in mind that it was founded after 2008, when uncertainty during the financial crisis was at its highest). This reading was taken in the first week of April, so there could well be more pain to come. Joe Hayes, an economist at IHS Markit, said: The UK Household Finance Index is already showing wide-reaching financial consequences of the lockdown measures implemented in late March. Around one-in-three UK households reported a decline in income from employment during April, which was by far the largest number since the survey began in 2009. But Hayes is still seeing the slimmest of silver linings: Nevertheless, we can still draw a small degree of positivity from the latest results, with overall measures of cash available to spend and household debt proving much more stable than workplace incomes. There was a slight pick-up in unsecured lending needs, while in some cases savings were depleted to meet immediate financing needs. Limiting the adverse impact on UK household balance sheets will be crucial in the coming months so that when economic activity does recover, consumers are not stuck repaying debts and instead are able to boost discretionary spending to aid a strong recovery. British household finances have reached their weakest point since November 2011, according to an index broadly followed by economists. IHS Markit\u2019s UK household finance index, which measures households\u2019 overall perceptions of financial wellbeing, plummeted to a reading of 34.9 in April, with the biggest monthly drop since the survey was started in 2009, as the financial crisis raged. At this point economic indicators are expressing the extent of rather than the fact of recession, but it is still a stark picture. And the signs for the future are not positive either. From IHS Markit\u2019s release: With a large degree of uncertainty surrounding the time frame to which the emergency public health measures will be maintained, financial wellbeing expectations also fell sharply. Overall, the respective index signalled the strongest level of pessimism for almost eight-and-a-half years. There were almost 70,000 applications for the state wage support in the first half hour of the portal being open, according to the head of HM Revenue and Customs. This is from the Financial Times (\u00a3) write-up of HMRC Jim Harra\u2019s appearance on BBC radio earlier: Harra said that the website was working, with about 67,000 claims from employers before 8.30am. He said: \u201cWe have scaled our IT system to cope with the maximum number of claims. There are over 2m PAYE schemes and our system is big enough to handle a claim from every one of those.\u201d This morning is an important day for the UK government\u2019s efforts to cushion the blow of the lockdown recession: the launch of the furlough scheme that will allow companies to claim back 80% of the wages of employees not working. Under the scheme, the government will cover 80% of workers\u2019 wages, up to \u00a32,500 a month, if they are not working but kept on their employers\u2019 payroll, reports the Guardian\u2019s Julia Kollewe. Workers across the economy have been furloughed because of the Covid-19 lockdown. The system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, the Treasury said. HM Revenue &amp; Customs has deployed 9,500 staff to deal with queries, including 5,000 on web chat, but there are fears that the website could crash and that telephone lines could also be overwhelmed. You can read the full report here: There are some worrying moves on bond markets, with Italian government debt pricing in more risk ahead of an EU summit this week where coronabonds will be on the agenda. The yield on the 10-year Italian bond rose by almost 10 basis points (0.1 percentage points) to 1.898% on Monday morning; yields rise when prices fall due to lower demand. On the other hand, German 10-year Bund yields were little changed at -0.482%. An increasing spread between the two bond yields is one of the most important indicators of how investors view the risks to the Italian economy. If there is no solidarity across the eurozone that could spell trouble. From Reuters: Selling pressure on Italian government bonds has returned in the past week, undoing some of the benefits of the European Central Bank\u2019s massive bond-buying scheme, after eurozone politicians failed to agree to common debt issuance as a means of addressing the crisis. Italian Prime Minister Guiseppe Conte used an interview with Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Monday to repeat calls for the EU to issue common eurozone bonds to demonstrate the bloc\u2019s solidarity in the face of a pandemic that is likely to trigger the worst recession in years. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid said: Thursday is the key day this week with the EU leaders summit a potentially big event for the future of Europe as they discuss how close the region can get to joint issuance in the near future. Expect creative ambiguity to rule as it normally does on the continent. Nevertheless you would expect more explicit details to be outlined as to how Europe will help Italy. Will this be enough to keep Italian spreads (and domestic politics) in check though? The selloff in US crude oil futures was a brutal 21% in early Monday trade, and there is little sign of any imminent recovery, with West Texas Intermediate May prices still bumping along below $15 per barrel. \u201cDon\u2019t panic,\u201d suggest analysts led by Mark Haefele, chief investment officer in UBS\u2019s wealth management arm. They forecast prices of WTI and Brent crude of $20 per barrel at the end of June, and over $40 per barrel at the end of the year. The volatile trade comes amid fears US storage facilities could soon max out, leaving markets watching both domestic production and inbound crude tankers due for US ports. If the current pace of the inventory build continues, we could see US tanks hit max capacity roughly by the end of June. But the sharp swing in the front month contract also reflects thinned trade, with most of the market already shifting to the June contract before the Tuesday rollover. But oil prices could be the last of the major asset classes to recover from the coronavirus crisis, cautioned Stephen Innes, global markets strategist at foreign exchange trader Axicorp. Regardless of what OPEC does, there will be structural demand loss for oil due to less travel. At a minimum, oil prices will be the last asset class to recover from lockdown. End transport demand will only occur in the final stages of reopening when border crossing is allowed, and travel restrictions get lifted. People will then flock again to planes, trains, and automobile One possible explanation for the bumpy ride on the FTSE 100 this morning (it is now mildly negative): the prospect of the UK easing restrictions appears to be fairly distant. Culture secretary Oliver Dowden is doing the media rounds this morning. He confirmed that the government is reluctant to lift the lockdown for fear of sparking a second wave of infections, telling BBC Breakfast: The worst thing we could possibly do would be to prematurely ease the restrictions, and then find a second peak and have to go right back to square one again, potentially with even more draconian measures. You can follow more on the UK coronavirus live blog: The positive start to the week on European stock markets was very short-lived indeed: the major indices are now negative today. The FTSE 100 is down by 0.3%, and the Stoxx 600 is down by 0.2%. The other big mover on the FTSE 350 is Aston Martin Lagonda, as the struggling carmaker got away a rights issue. Shares are up by 12% at 65p (although still barely a third of where they were at the start of the year). Billionaire investor Lawrence Stroll, who led the bailout, also takes over as executive chairman of Aston Martin\u2019s board today. He is also joined on the share register by Mercedes-Benz F1 boss Toto Wolff. Stroll said: The rights issue and the investment that I, and my co-investors in the consortium, have made has underpinned the financial security of, and our confidence in, the business. We can now focus on the engineering and marketing programmes that will enable Aston Martin to become one of the preeminent luxury car brands in the world. In this first year we will reset the business. Our most pressing objective is to plan to restart our manufacturing operations, particularly to start production of the brand\u2019s first SUV, DBX, and to bring the organisation back to full operating life. We will do this in a way that ensures we will protect our people, wherever they work - their safety is our overwhelming concern. Interesting timing on this announcement from spreadbetting company Plus 500: its chief executive has just resigned. Shares are down 7%, making it the biggest faller on the FTSE 350. Spreadbetting companies have seen a remarkable boom during quarantine measures, as historic market volatility coupled with the fact of millions of people being locked inside have contributed to an enormous surge in revenues. Asaf Elimelech, Plus 500\u2019s chief executive, \u201ctendered his resignation from the board and the company with immediate effect\u201d, the company said in a statement to the stock market. However, he has a year\u2019s notice period so will work alongside his successor to hand over. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.4% in the first exchanges in a relatively gentle start for these volatile times. FTSE 100 investors endured a rocky ride last week, with the index falling back before recovering some of its losses on Friday. In Germany the benchmark Dax gained 0.7%, while France\u2019s Cac 40 gained 0.7% and Spain\u2019s Ibex rose by 0.6%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. The US oil price benchmark has hit its lowest level since March 1999, with investors seeing little in the way of demand growth while coronavirus lockdowns continue in the world\u2019s largest economies. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures prices for May delivery fell as low as $14.47 per barrel in early trading, below the levels seen even during the Iraq war. The price fall also partly reflects the way the futures market functions, with the expiration on Tuesday of the contract for May delivery meaning some traders\u2019 demand moves to the next month. Nevertheless, the price action reflects the deep uncertainty around the outlook for a demand bounceback. Brent crude futures prices, the global benchmark based on North Sea oil prices, fell by 2.2% to $27.47 per barrel, hitting their lowest point since major production cuts were mooted. The number of active oil rigs in the US was 438, a 35% fall from only a month ago, according to data from Baker Hughes published on Friday. That was the steepest fall since February 2015 as oil producers desperately try to cut costs. Even historic production cuts from Opec+ - the cartel of oil producers including Saudi Arabia, plus Russia - have failed to prop up prices. Oil tankers generally used for transport have instead been drafted in for storage by traders hoping for higher prices. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at trading platform Oanda, said: With above-ground storage bulging at the seams, WTI\u2019s only hope, it appears, is for production cut action from the impending decisions of state authorities in Texas and Oklahoma, and lots of producers going out of business. In other developments this morning, China continued its incremental economics stimulus efforts with an interest rate cut. From the Reuters report: China cut its benchmark lending rate as expected on Monday to reduce borrowing costs for companies and prop up the coronavirus-hit economy, after it contracted for the first time in decades. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 20 basis points (bps) to 3.85% from 4.05% previously, while the five-year LPR was cut by 10 bps to 4.65% from 4.75%.",

After the first two went out \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.roleplaygateway.com/roleplay/your-courage#introduction\">Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory</a> and <a href=\"https://www.signsofwar.com/ourshop/prod_4997406-Freedom-Is-In-Peril.html\">Freedom Is in Peril / Defend It With All Your Might</a> \u2013 scathing letters appeared in the Times saying they were patronising. I think that\u2019s why Keep Calm was held back and never publicly displayed, and the bulk of copies either pulped or lost. If they had started with this one, I think it would have been just as popular then as it is now. It was a winner, they just didn\u2019t realise it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b6fe5f8e5a6b2e562f83f3f028c00f5176b0e825\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6fe5f8e5a6b2e562f83f3f028c00f5176b0e825/0_0_1635_2400/681.jpg\" alt=\"An earlier poster in the series, from 1939.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An earlier poster in the series, from 1939.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first found the poster in 2000, folded up at the bottom of a box of books we had bought at an auction. I liked it straight away and showed it to my wife Mary \u2013 she had it framed and put up in the shop. The next thing we found was that customers wanted to buy it. I suggested we make copies but Mary said: \u201cNo, it\u2019ll spoil the purity.\u201d She went away for a week\u2019s holiday, so I secretly got 500 copies made.</p> <p>I showed Mary the sales figures. She\u2019s a very practical person, and from then on we started making more. For the next two years it was a huge local and regional hit, but not a national hit. That wasn\u2019t until 2005 when a reporter called Susie Steiner from the Guardian did a little one-page feature, showing the Keep Calm poster as one of her favourite things. After that, all hell broke loose.</p> <p>It was in December, so a perfect Christmas present. We got thousands of orders. And that\u2019s really when the phenomenon began. Then people started copying it, ridiculing it and doing all sorts of things with it. It just grew and grew. It\u2019s probably fair to say that by the end of 2006, when I was down in London and saw a Keep Calm mug with \u201cMade in China\u201d on the bottom, that it had gone international. Lots of people jumped on the bandwagon and, frankly, some of the parodies I got sick to the teeth of. But the actual basic message has helped a lot of people, I think. When I\u2019m asked why it was so popular, I always say the same thing: it\u2019s cheaper than antidepressants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb12c924c2fd56410330478ec927526d4b9f1d48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb12c924c2fd56410330478ec927526d4b9f1d48/0_0_4343_4336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Carry On, 1941, by Cecil Beaton \u2026 a rare wartime sighting of the poster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"998\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carry On, 1941, by Cecil Beaton \u2026 a rare wartime sighting of the poster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Print Collector/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019ve probably sold somewhere in the region of 100,000 copies to date. In the last year or so, we\u2019ve typically only had two or three orders a month. Suddenly, with coronavirus, we\u2019re getting a dozen a week \u2013 nothing like what happened back in 2005, but enough to prove it has a timeless resonance. Although it probably needs updating \u2013 Keep Calm and Stay at Home.</p> <h2><strong>Susie Steiner, author and former Guardian journalist</strong></h2> <p>I discovered Keep Calm and Carry On in 2005 when I went on a writing retreat in Devon. The poster was on the wall of the kitchen where we all gathered to cook and eat meals. I was told it came from a tiny bookshop in Alnwick. At the time I was working at the Guardian\u2019s Weekend magazine, and when I got back I rang Barter Books and requested a poster to include in a roundup of things for the home.

      "bodyText": "Stuart Manley, co-owner of Barter Books, Alnwick The original poster was part of a trio designed during the second world war by the Ministry of Information. After the first two went out \u2013 Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution Will Bring Us Victory and Freedom Is in Peril / Defend It With All Your Might \u2013 scathing letters appeared in the Times saying they were patronising. I think that\u2019s why Keep Calm was held back and never publicly displayed, and the bulk of copies either pulped or lost. If they had started with this one, I think it would have been just as popular then as it is now. It was a winner, they just didn\u2019t realise it. I first found the poster in 2000, folded up at the bottom of a box of books we had bought at an auction. I liked it straight away and showed it to my wife Mary \u2013 she had it framed and put up in the shop. The next thing we found was that customers wanted to buy it. I suggested we make copies but Mary said: \u201cNo, it\u2019ll spoil the purity.\u201d She went away for a week\u2019s holiday, so I secretly got 500 copies made. I showed Mary the sales figures. She\u2019s a very practical person, and from then on we started making more. For the next two years it was a huge local and regional hit, but not a national hit. That wasn\u2019t until 2005 when a reporter called Susie Steiner from the Guardian did a little one-page feature, showing the Keep Calm poster as one of her favourite things. After that, all hell broke loose. It was in December, so a perfect Christmas present. We got thousands of orders. And that\u2019s really when the phenomenon began. Then people started copying it, ridiculing it and doing all sorts of things with it. It just grew and grew. It\u2019s probably fair to say that by the end of 2006, when I was down in London and saw a Keep Calm mug with \u201cMade in China\u201d on the bottom, that it had gone international. Lots of people jumped on the bandwagon and, frankly, some of the parodies I got sick to the teeth of. But the actual basic message has helped a lot of people, I think. When I\u2019m asked why it was so popular, I always say the same thing: it\u2019s cheaper than antidepressants. We\u2019ve probably sold somewhere in the region of 100,000 copies to date. In the last year or so, we\u2019ve typically only had two or three orders a month. Suddenly, with coronavirus, we\u2019re getting a dozen a week \u2013 nothing like what happened back in 2005, but enough to prove it has a timeless resonance. Although it probably needs updating \u2013 Keep Calm and Stay at Home. Susie Steiner, author and former Guardian journalist I discovered Keep Calm and Carry On in 2005 when I went on a writing retreat in Devon. The poster was on the wall of the kitchen where we all gathered to cook and eat meals. I was told it came from a tiny bookshop in Alnwick. At the time I was working at the Guardian\u2019s Weekend magazine, and when I got back I rang Barter Books and requested a poster to include in a roundup of things for the home. I could tell it was a \u201cthing\u201d not only because of my own reaction \u2013 I took a sense of comfort from it \u2013 but also because other people in the office really loved it and wanted to have one too. I wasn\u2019t surprised that it quickly became popular. I\u2019m glad Barter Books did well out of it. A contributing factor was that there was no copyright attached to the poster, which meant a proliferation of products could occur without companies incurring fees. I am, at this moment, drinking from a mug which says: Keep Calm I\u2019m a Teenager. I think Keep Calm and Carry On speaks to unhappiness and depression with a message of stoicism and patience, which is helpful. Or at least more helpful than becoming panicked or outraged.

It\u2019s comprised of bands of coloured butterfly wings, a key motif in Hirst\u2019s work. \u201cI wanted to do something to pay tribute to the wonderful work NHS staff are doing in hospitals around the country,\u201d said Hirst. \u201cThe rainbow is a sign of hope and I think it is brilliant that parents and children are creating their own version and putting them up in the windows of their homes.\u201d Hirst also plans to raise money for the health service by selling a limited edition of the work, with details to be announced on the artist\u2019s Instagram page. Hirst is not the only artist finding inspiration in the rainbow during the pandemic. Sir Quentin Blake recently released a series of 10 rainbow e-cards for people to send to friends and family during the lockdown. In them he imagines rainbows to be parts of everyday life \u2013 reinventing them as dog kennels, a moustache and even hair. Blake said: \u201cYou will see that I have supposed that [rainbows] are real and portable, and I hope they are optimistic, too.\u201d Blake\u2019s project is in association with the House of Illustration, the UK\u2019s only public gallery dedicated solely to illustration, which Blake founded in 2014. The e-cards can be downloaded from houseofillustration.org.uk.",

The NHS Confederation and NHS Providers spoke out amid continuing alarm that shortages of equipment will soon have disastrous effects on the frontline, with representatives of intensive care staff warning on Sunday that the critical shortage of PPE could lead to some people refusing to continue working there.",

They began with Donnerstag (Thursday), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/22/donnerstag-aus-licht-review-stockhausen-cosmic-opera\">a staging that came to London last year</a>, just before they embarked on this second instalment in <a href=\"https://live.philharmoniedeparis.fr/concert/1111564/?lang=en-US\">Paris at the Philharmonie</a>, again conducted by Maxime Pascal and directed with stylish economy by Damien Bigourdan. In Stockhausen\u2019s personal mythology, Samstag (Saturday) is Lucifer\u2019s Day, and he is the work\u2019s only solo voice, a bass (sung here by Damien Pass). The other protagonists are instrumental \u2013 piano, flute, trombone, percussion \u2013 though there is also a chorus of monks in the final scene, Lucifer\u2019s Farewell (which, in this production, is performed not in the concert hall, but in a nearby church). As ever in Licht, the dramaturgy is creaky, the narrative hard to take seriously; but as ever in Stockhausen, too, the music is often extraordinary, from the opening Saturday Greeting, in which groups of baleful brass surround the audience, through the solo-piano Lucifer\u2019s Dream, the singing flautist of Lucifer\u2019s Requiem and the orchestral tour de force of Lucifer\u2019s Dance, to the farewell, in which the monks chant a Franciscan text, before smashing coconuts on the steps of the church. <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLmxbXT8uW8&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Beethoven string trios: Sepec/Zimmermann/Queyras</a> (Wigmore Hall Live)</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/opera-and-classical-concerts-to-watch-at-home--critics-picks-week-three\">Opera and classical concerts to watch at home: our critics' picks, week three</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If nothing else, the Covid-19 lockdown provides an opportunity to remedy gaps in one\u2019s musical knowledge. This<a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/watch-listen/live-stream\"> live-streamed Wigmore concert</a> plugged a hole for me. The young Beethoven wrote five string trios between 1794 and 1798 before abandoning the genre in favour of quartets. The string trios are not often played, let alone all in one evening as they were here by the classy Franco-German trio of violinist Daniel Sepec, violist Tabea Zimmermann and cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras. There\u2019s a distinct development in Beethoven\u2019s treatment of the trio format between the multi-movement Op 3 trio and the Op 8 serenade on the one hand, and the more assertive aesthetic of the three trios Op 9 on the other. Best of all is Op 9 no 1 in G, which generates a beguiling back-and-forth response between the players. Yet the trios all constantly prefigure the muscularity of the later Beethoven chamber style at times, and the playing is alert and vigorous throughout. The concert is a bit of a marathon, lasting more than three and a half hours with intervals. But online you can hit the pause button from time to time and give each of these works the attention they deserve. <strong>Martin Kettle</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a12adb67fce72ff876386b95880fa56298f13ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a12adb67fce72ff876386b95880fa56298f13ed1/33_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fine vocal performances: Dutch National Opera\u2019s 2011 production of Eugene Onegin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fine vocal performances ...

      "body": "<p>On Saturday, Chris Maslanka converted my household to wearing masks in public with his solution to the first Pyrgic puzzle (18 April). His impeccable logic is too important to be tucked away where relatively few will read it. </p> <p>To summarise, any change in the infection rate of the virus is magnified greatly in the numbers infected. Thus every change for the better, such as people wearing masks, really matters. It matters little if all masks are not the best, or all wearers not skilled, because these are just minor percentages; the main thing is to block as much virus as we can. Whether an individual wearer is fully protected is beside the point.</p> <p>I would like to see the presenters at every coronavirus briefing walk in with masks on. The first speaker removes the mask, explains why they can (the empty room), and says their bit.

      "bodyText": "On Saturday, Chris Maslanka converted my household to wearing masks in public with his solution to the first Pyrgic puzzle (18 April). His impeccable logic is too important to be tucked away where relatively few will read it. To summarise, any change in the infection rate of the virus is magnified greatly in the numbers infected. Thus every change for the better, such as people wearing masks, really matters. It matters little if all masks are not the best, or all wearers not skilled, because these are just minor percentages; the main thing is to block as much virus as we can. Whether an individual wearer is fully protected is beside the point. I would like to see the presenters at every coronavirus briefing walk in with masks on. The first speaker removes the mask, explains why they can (the empty room), and says their bit. Exeunt wearing masks. Perhaps lockdowns in defined non-hotspots can be lifted earlier on condition that masks be worn, and offenders be refused entry. Perhaps shops can offer free upgrades where the spirit is willing but the mask is weak. This is another case where we would respond better than the government gives us credit for.

      "body": "<p>Unlike some high-ranking elected officials in America, John Oliver has long taken coronavirus seriously. Since the beginning of March, the Last Week Tonight host has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/02/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-coronavirus\">traced the virus\u2019s spread in China</a>, exhorted viewers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/16/john-oliver-coronavirus-were-going-to-need-to-look-out-for-one-another\">to take care of each other</a> as daily life in America evaporated, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/30/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-coronavirus-trump\">blasted Trump\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d handling</a> of the crisis and discussed how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/john-oliver-coronavirus-things-need-to-change-and-not-go-back-to-normal\">pandemic revealed and exploited longstanding inequalities in America</a>. And on Sunday, Oliver turned to one of the main threats to recovery in this pandemic: misinformation, particularly from within the feedback loop between America\u2019s rightwing media ecosystem and Donald Trump.</p> <p>America\u2019s rightwing media is \u201cdominated by some enormously powerful individuals\u201d, explained Oliver, such as the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, a \u201cman with millions of listeners, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and almost certainly a room in his basement that his housekeeper isn\u2019t allowed to go into.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRFbwjwQ4VE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRFbwjwQ4VE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Limbaugh exemplifies how, as Oliver said, \u201cMany in conservative media have found it easy to fold this virus into narratives that they\u2019ve been carefully building up for decades\u201d. For over a decade, Limbaugh has pushed his \u201cfour corners of deceit: government, academia, science and the media,\u201d which, \u201cunfortunately, happen to be the four most important groups to listen to during a public health crisis,\u201d said Oliver, though it makes sense as a business strategy: \u201cIf you establish your show as the sole outlet worth trusting, that gives you a lot of power.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s the same technique \u2013 we\u2019ll give you the \u201ctrue\u201d story elites are trying to hide \u2013 used by Fox News, as evidenced by the narrative the network pushed early in the pandemic: that coronavirus was hysteria drummed up by the liberal media to derail the president. Oliver pointed to such Fox News segments as \u201ccoronavirus hysteria\u201d (Sean Hannity), \u201cliberal media hoax backfires!\u201d (Trish Reagan), and \u201cTrump confronts the panic pushers\u201d (Laura Ingraham).</p> <p>\u201cAnd when people started dying \u2013 and their arguments became harder to sell \u2013 the network seemed to pivot from trying to downplay the warnings to downplaying the deaths,\u201d Oliver continued, pointing to numerous examples of Fox News hosts favorably comparing US coronavirus deaths with a whole season of the flu. And while yes, Oliver acknowledged, many people and companies underestimated Covid-19, Fox News was still doing it publicly while behind the scenes the company suspended all non-essential business travel and encouraged staff to move all in-person meetings to Skype, \u201cbecause, and this is true, they only pretend to believe these things on television for money\u201d, Oliver said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/john-oliver-coronavirus-things-need-to-change-and-not-go-back-to-normal\">John Oliver: 'Things need to change and not go back to normal'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s also, he continued, the compounding problem that President Trump is not only the subject of much Fox News misinformation, but also its target, as he\u2019s known to pull talking points directly from its hosts. For example, Trump latched on to the \u201cmiracle cure\u201d hydroxychloroquine after viewing Tucker Carlson tout a questionable study on its efficacy as a coronavirus treatment (there is no widespread medical evidence to support this, and side effects can be fatal). \u201cThat is not to say that this drug shouldn\u2019t be studied. It should, and it is,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cBut the feedback loop between Fox and Trump has run way ahead of the science here.\u201d It\u2019s a textbook demonstration of this news ecosystem at work: Fox News promoted the hydroxychloroquine \u201csolution\u201d over 300 times in two weeks, according to Media Matters. Trump encouraged Americans to \u201cjust try it \u2013 what do you have to lose?\u201d (your life), Limbaugh picked up the charge on his show, which still attracts 15 million listeners a week, and now lupus patients and others who depend on hydroxychloroquine are facing shortages.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say,\u201d whether the drug could be used as a treatment for the virus,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe problem is, \u2018might\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 aren\u2019t really words that grab an audience,\u201d and simple solutions make for good television, which is Trump\u2019s underlying logic.

      "bodyText": "Unlike some high-ranking elected officials in America, John Oliver has long taken coronavirus seriously. Since the beginning of March, the Last Week Tonight host has traced the virus\u2019s spread in China, exhorted viewers to take care of each other as daily life in America evaporated, blasted Trump\u2019s \u201cirresponsible\u201d handling of the crisis and discussed how the pandemic revealed and exploited longstanding inequalities in America. And on Sunday, Oliver turned to one of the main threats to recovery in this pandemic: misinformation, particularly from within the feedback loop between America\u2019s rightwing media ecosystem and Donald Trump. America\u2019s rightwing media is \u201cdominated by some enormously powerful individuals\u201d, explained Oliver, such as the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, a \u201cman with millions of listeners, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, and almost certainly a room in his basement that his housekeeper isn\u2019t allowed to go into.\u201d Limbaugh exemplifies how, as Oliver said, \u201cMany in conservative media have found it easy to fold this virus into narratives that they\u2019ve been carefully building up for decades\u201d. For over a decade, Limbaugh has pushed his \u201cfour corners of deceit: government, academia, science and the media,\u201d which, \u201cunfortunately, happen to be the four most important groups to listen to during a public health crisis,\u201d said Oliver, though it makes sense as a business strategy: \u201cIf you establish your show as the sole outlet worth trusting, that gives you a lot of power.\u201d It\u2019s the same technique \u2013 we\u2019ll give you the \u201ctrue\u201d story elites are trying to hide \u2013 used by Fox News, as evidenced by the narrative the network pushed early in the pandemic: that coronavirus was hysteria drummed up by the liberal media to derail the president. Oliver pointed to such Fox News segments as \u201ccoronavirus hysteria\u201d (Sean Hannity), \u201cliberal media hoax backfires!\u201d (Trish Reagan), and \u201cTrump confronts the panic pushers\u201d (Laura Ingraham). \u201cAnd when people started dying \u2013 and their arguments became harder to sell \u2013 the network seemed to pivot from trying to downplay the warnings to downplaying the deaths,\u201d Oliver continued, pointing to numerous examples of Fox News hosts favorably comparing US coronavirus deaths with a whole season of the flu. And while yes, Oliver acknowledged, many people and companies underestimated Covid-19, Fox News was still doing it publicly while behind the scenes the company suspended all non-essential business travel and encouraged staff to move all in-person meetings to Skype, \u201cbecause, and this is true, they only pretend to believe these things on television for money\u201d, Oliver said. There\u2019s also, he continued, the compounding problem that President Trump is not only the subject of much Fox News misinformation, but also its target, as he\u2019s known to pull talking points directly from its hosts. For example, Trump latched on to the \u201cmiracle cure\u201d hydroxychloroquine after viewing Tucker Carlson tout a questionable study on its efficacy as a coronavirus treatment (there is no widespread medical evidence to support this, and side effects can be fatal). \u201cThat is not to say that this drug shouldn\u2019t be studied. It should, and it is,\u201d said Oliver. \u201cBut the feedback loop between Fox and Trump has run way ahead of the science here.\u201d It\u2019s a textbook demonstration of this news ecosystem at work: Fox News promoted the hydroxychloroquine \u201csolution\u201d over 300 times in two weeks, according to Media Matters. Trump encouraged Americans to \u201cjust try it \u2013 what do you have to lose?\u201d (your life), Limbaugh picked up the charge on his show, which still attracts 15 million listeners a week, and now lupus patients and others who depend on hydroxychloroquine are facing shortages. \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to say,\u201d whether the drug could be used as a treatment for the virus,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe problem is, \u2018might\u2019 and \u2018could\u2019 aren\u2019t really words that grab an audience,\u201d and simple solutions make for good television, which is Trump\u2019s underlying logic. Thus, \u201cwe have a network, and a president, who thrive on division, feeding on one another, at a time when we desperately need a unified response to a public health crisis.\u201d This alternate facts ecosystem was on full display this weekend, as groups of protesters at capitols in Michigan, Minnesota and other states violated physical distancing orders to demand the economy reopen immediately. Said protesters repeated misinformation fostered on rightwing media; Fox News gleefully covered the protests and attributed their claim that \u201cthe cure can\u2019t be worse than the disease\u201d to Trump, though it actually originated on Fox News. And after the segment on a group called \u201cLiberate Minnesota\u201d aired, Trump tweeted \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d in support. \u201cAll of this is legitimately dangerous,\u201d said Oliver, \u201cbecause watching something like that might convince Trump that there\u2019s a sizable portion of the population that wants to go back to work no matter the cost,\u201d which is not the case. According to a Pew Research poll released on 16 April, 66% of Americans are more concerned with restrictions being lifted too quickly than too slowly.

      "body": "<p>There are no new comic books.</p> <p>Steve Geppi, head of Diamond Comic Distributors, which distributes nearly every comic sold in the anglophone world (or used to), announced this on 23 March, though senior industry figures already knew what was coming. The coronavirus pandemic had sunk retailers deep into the red. They couldn\u2019t pay their bills to Diamond or rent to their landlords, because they hadn\u2019t made any sales. \u201cProduct distributed by Diamond and slated for an on-sale date of 1 April or later will not be shipped to retailers until further notice,\u201d Geppi wrote.</p> <p>If shops can\u2019t pay Diamond, Diamond can\u2019t pay the industry\u2019s constellation of comics publishers, who then can\u2019t pay artists, writers, editors and printers, who now can\u2019t pay their rent or credit card bills \u2013 or buy comics. <a href=\"https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2019.html\">Sales of comics, graphic</a><a href=\"https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2019.html\"> novels and collectibles distributed by Diamond were </a><a href=\"https://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2019.html\">$529.7m (\u00a3462m) in 2019</a> \u2013 a huge number which suggests that a months-long gap between issues of Batman, Captain America and Spawn will stretch into tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue. (Though Diamond <a href=\"https://bleedingcool.com/comics/diamond-comics-plan-return-distribution-may/\">plans to start shipping comics to shops again on 17 May</a>, many around the world will still be in lockdown then.)</p> <p>The unprecedented situation has encouraged many acts of kindness, by individuals and companies. In solidarity with the shops relying on physical sales, most publishers are not currently selling new comics digitally. And dozens of artists and writers are auctioning off books and art to benefit others; DC artist Jim Lee is sketching a superhero pinup every day for two months, <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/sch/chunkymonkey0000/m.html?_nkw=&amp;_armrs=1&amp;_ipg=&amp;_from=\">selling them for thousands on eBay</a> to benefit comics shops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ffd04c04d1b9165d92e0d005c84d35d48ee6f8f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffd04c04d1b9165d92e0d005c84d35d48ee6f8f1/0_0_1210_1600/756.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Lee\u2019s original pen and ink illustration of Bizarro Superman, one of 60 artworks he is auctioning off to help comic book shops stay in business during the Covid-19 outbreak.

Though Marvel and DC have taken a hit from the pandemic, they\u2019re still so big that professionals and retailers look to them not just for guidance, but also for relief. DC has donated $250,000 to a charity for bookshops, and, for the first time since the 1970s, is allowing retailers to return unsold comics. A spokeswoman said the company was also assessing new ways to distribute comics to shops for mail-order and kerbside pickup programmes. The Guardian has also seen an email from DC sent to shops last week, saying it will start distributing comics through three new companies \u2013 two of which are <a href=\"https://bleedingcool.com/comics/dc-comics-new-distributors-midtown-dcbs/\">reportedly</a> run by retailers that directly compete with the shops themselves.</p> <p>And Marvel has cut its editorial staff by half, according to a source familiar with the situation. A Marvel spokesman said the company would not confirm numbers, but that all the cut staff were furloughed, not laid off, and the firm would continue providing health insurance \u201cfor the duration of the furlough period\u201d. <a href=\"https://bleedingcool.com/comics/marvel-tells-more-comics-creators-to-stop-work-for-now/\">Bleeding Cool also reports that Marvel has stopped work on at least 20% of its forthcoming books.</a> However, it is offering some discounts to publishers.</p> <p>Ron Hill, owner of New York shop Jim Hanley\u2019s Universe, says he appreciated some of the gestures, especially those of individuals such as Lee. But overall, he feels upset by the weak response of publishers to the pandemic. Hill, and retailers like him, don\u2019t only need discounts; they need debt relief, and recognition that everyone \u2013 shops, distributors, studios \u2013 is now in the same boat. The faster that happens, he said, the better everyone\u2019s chance of survival.</p> <p>\u201cThis is beyond 2008, this is beyond the Great Depression,\u201d Hill adds. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy who sells comic books but I feel like this is true up and down. How are we gonna do this? I\u2019m reading that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/30/macys-furloughs-coronavirus/\">Macy\u2019s is gonna go out of business</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2020-03-25/movie-theaters-recover-coronavirus-closures\">AMC [movie theaters] is gonna go out of business</a>.

The post-pandemic world must have comic shops, he feels: \u201cI\u2019m loath to predict anything except that we\u2019ll get through it.

      "bodyText": "There are no new comic books. Steve Geppi, head of Diamond Comic Distributors, which distributes nearly every comic sold in the anglophone world (or used to), announced this on 23 March, though senior industry figures already knew what was coming. The coronavirus pandemic had sunk retailers deep into the red. They couldn\u2019t pay their bills to Diamond or rent to their landlords, because they hadn\u2019t made any sales. \u201cProduct distributed by Diamond and slated for an on-sale date of 1 April or later will not be shipped to retailers until further notice,\u201d Geppi wrote. If shops can\u2019t pay Diamond, Diamond can\u2019t pay the industry\u2019s constellation of comics publishers, who then can\u2019t pay artists, writers, editors and printers, who now can\u2019t pay their rent or credit card bills \u2013 or buy comics. Sales of comics, graphic novels and collectibles distributed by Diamond were $529.7m (\u00a3462m) in 2019 \u2013 a huge number which suggests that a months-long gap between issues of Batman, Captain America and Spawn will stretch into tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue. (Though Diamond plans to start shipping comics to shops again on 17 May, many around the world will still be in lockdown then.) The unprecedented situation has encouraged many acts of kindness, by individuals and companies. In solidarity with the shops relying on physical sales, most publishers are not currently selling new comics digitally. And dozens of artists and writers are auctioning off books and art to benefit others; DC artist Jim Lee is sketching a superhero pinup every day for two months, selling them for thousands on eBay to benefit comics shops. The comics world is now split between many have-nots and two very prominent have-alls: DC Comics and Marvel Comics, subdivisions of massive publicly traded corporations Disney (Marvel) and AT&amp;T (DC), worth $192bn and $224bn respectively. Though Marvel and DC have taken a hit from the pandemic, they\u2019re still so big that professionals and retailers look to them not just for guidance, but also for relief. DC has donated $250,000 to a charity for bookshops, and, for the first time since the 1970s, is allowing retailers to return unsold comics. A spokeswoman said the company was also assessing new ways to distribute comics to shops for mail-order and kerbside pickup programmes. The Guardian has also seen an email from DC sent to shops last week, saying it will start distributing comics through three new companies \u2013 two of which are reportedly run by retailers that directly compete with the shops themselves. And Marvel has cut its editorial staff by half, according to a source familiar with the situation. A Marvel spokesman said the company would not confirm numbers, but that all the cut staff were furloughed, not laid off, and the firm would continue providing health insurance \u201cfor the duration of the furlough period\u201d. Bleeding Cool also reports that Marvel has stopped work on at least 20% of its forthcoming books. However, it is offering some discounts to publishers. Ron Hill, owner of New York shop Jim Hanley\u2019s Universe, says he appreciated some of the gestures, especially those of individuals such as Lee. But overall, he feels upset by the weak response of publishers to the pandemic. Hill, and retailers like him, don\u2019t only need discounts; they need debt relief, and recognition that everyone \u2013 shops, distributors, studios \u2013 is now in the same boat. The faster that happens, he said, the better everyone\u2019s chance of survival. \u201cThis is beyond 2008, this is beyond the Great Depression,\u201d Hill adds. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy who sells comic books but I feel like this is true up and down. How are we gonna do this? I\u2019m reading that Macy\u2019s is gonna go out of business, and AMC [movie theaters] is gonna go out of business. Why are we letting these places go out of business?\u201d You can\u2019t recreate the feel of a comic bookshop on the internet any more than you can a restaurant. In shops such as Hanley\u2019s, Batman rubs elbows with Alex Toth\u2019s Zorro, R Crumb\u2019s muses and Snoopy. No one appreciates this nexus of competing realities more than Robert Sikoryak, the chameleonic artist who draws line-perfect imitations of famous cartoonists to enliven iTunes\u2019s Terms and Conditions, and Donald Trump\u2019s verbal gaffes in The Unquotable Trump. While none of Sikoryak\u2019s mini-comics are going to outsell a new issue of Wolverine, some of his comics, such as the Trump book, have their genesis in the black-and-white 16-page one-offs he sells at Hanley\u2019s. \u201cThat did become weirdly lucrative, because people are so \u2026 traumatised, obsessed, whatever, with him,\u201d Sikoryak says. The post-pandemic world must have comic shops, he feels: \u201cI\u2019m loath to predict anything except that we\u2019ll get through it. I can\u2019t bring myself to predict anything else.\u201d Others are less optimistic. \u201cI \u2026 have to assume the anglophone comics market is not going to come back in anything like the shape it was in 200 years ago, back in February,\u201d wrote author Warren Ellis in his newsletter on 12 April. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of pain points, moving forward.\u201d Kieron Gillen, writer of Ludocrats and The Wicked + the Divine series, said he hadn\u2019t received bad news about any of his ongoing work \u2013 yet. \u201cIn terms of the Image books I\u2019ve been doing, we\u2019ve carried on making them, and because I\u2019m in a lucky position I have enough sales that they\u2019ll probably find an audience.

      "bodyText": "Imperial College London, whose research has played a key role in the government\u2019s response to the Covid-19 crisis, has warned of widespread cuts to mitigate the damaging impact of the pandemic on the institution. In an email to staff last week, Prof Alice Gast, the college president, said she was taking a voluntary 20% pay cut as she announced a raft of cost-cutting measures, including the suspension of capital projects, a freeze on recruitment and plans to furlough staff members. Imperial is one one of the jewels in the crown of the UK\u2019s higher education sector. Prof Neil Ferguson, of its faculty of medicine and school of public health, is one of the epidemiologists advising the government on Covid-19, and his team provided the modelling that led to the lockdown. It is not, however, immune to the effects of the pandemic. Analysis suggests UK universities are likely to be one of the hardest hit sectors, with fears that international students will not return and the possible loss of tens of thousands of Chinese students next year resulting in gaping holes in budgets. Gast told staff she was proud of the significant impact of Imperial\u2019s research, clinical care and public outreach on the pandemic, but warned: \u201cThe immediate need, as we face threats to enrolments and the financial burden of the shutdown, is to look for ways to conserve cash in the coming year. \u201cWe have already taken important decisions to suspend starting or approving new capital projects, limiting ongoing staff recruitment and identifying roles eligible for the furloughing scheme \u2026 We need to consider further measures.\u201d Gast said Imperial\u2019s provost, Prof Ian Walmsley, would also be taking a 20% pay cut and that the board had volunteered for a pay reduction of 10% over the next six months. \u201cOur intention is to share some of the many sacrifices our community is making by volunteering, working on the front line or having their laboratory or workplace closed. This money will be used to help our students and staff in hardship.\u201d Imperial is the latest of a number of higher education institutions to announce cuts or restructuring. Last week the University and College Union (UCU) condemned plans by Durham University to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing in response to the pandemic. Earlier this month it emerged that hundreds of university staff on precarious contracts had been dismissed in an effort to cut costs. Staff on fixed-term contracts, including visiting lecturers, researchers and student support workers, at Bristol, Newcastle and Sussex universities were made redundant or told their employment would or may end prematurely. Imperial has benefited from large numbers of international students in recent years, with 64% of the student body coming from outside the UK in 2017/18, of which Chinese students were the biggest non-UK nationality. The UCU\u2019s general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cIt is extremely concerning that any universities are using the current pandemic to look at changes to jobs and staffing levels.

A different interview involving Icke and London Real has been removed by YouTube, although none of it was broadcast on London Live. Icke has enjoyed the attention paid to him as a result of the controversy around the broadcast, with Google search interest in his name spiking as a result. Ofcom separately concluded that Holmes\u2019s comments on ITV\u2019s This Morning that people should challenge \u201cthe state narrative\u201d around 5G phone masts \u201cwere ill judged and risked undermining viewers\u2019 trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence\u201d. Although it said this was irresponsible, given recent attacks on mobile phone masts in the UK, it concluded that his subsequent clarification and other comments making clear the link was \u201cfake news\u201d meant there was no need to formally sanction ITV.",

Thomas Thabane, who has been accused of involvement in the murder of his ex-wife, will be allowed a \u201cdignified retirement\u201d, according to the deal negotiated by mediators from neighbouring South Africa. The 80-year-old leader appeared in court in February, where his lawyer argued that his office granted him immunity from prosecution for allegedly murdering his estranged first wife shortly before he took power. Lipolelo Thabane, 58, was shot several times at close range as she sat in a car near her home, two days before her husband\u2019s inauguration in 2017. She had reportedly refused a divorce and won a court battle to retain her privileges as first lady until any formal separation. Thabane remarried two months after her death. His current wife, Maesaiah, 42, has been charged with murder after briefly fleeing the country. Both deny any wrongdoing. The case was brought back into the spotlight in January after a letter from Lesotho\u2019s police chief emerged claiming communication records showed that someone at the murder scene had called Thabane\u2019s mobile phone on the day of the crime. The killing was initially blamed on unknown criminals; Lesotho has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Investigators have since said they believe professional hitmen, possibly hired in South Africa, carried out the attack.

      "bodyText": "More than 140,000 companies employing a total of about a million workers have applied to the government\u2019s job furlough scheme on its first day of operation, the chancellor has announced. It is understood the price tag attached to the requests is about \u00a31bn, a figure that is likely to rise significantly as more companies make their applications for help over the coming days and weeks. Rishi Sunak said the government had delivered on its promise to pay wages for threatened jobs, under a programme that allows employers to lay off staff temporarily and claim up to 80% of their salaries from the state, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, he said: \u201cExactly a month ago today I stood at this lectern and said we would help to pay people\u2019s wages. We promised support would be available by the end of April. Today, we deliver our promise.\u201d Expressing hope that the economy could still quickly recover from the coronavirus outbreak, Sunak said the first million people being furloughed were at risk of losing their jobs without the government\u2019s support. The chancellor said getting the coronavirus job retention scheme system (CJRS) up and running was a \u201cremarkable story of public service\u201d as thousands of HMRC staff had either worked overtime or come out of retirement to help. The system is able to process up to 450,000 applications an hour, while it will take companies up to six days to receive funds. HMRC has deployed 9,500 staff to deal with queries. Fears that the website could crash and that phone lines would be overwhelmed looked to be unfounded, as business groups said the scheme had got off to a smooth start. However, business leaders warned there was no room for error, as many employers would need to run their payrolls this week. The government has also been criticised over the rollout of its coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which is designed to help small and medium-sized businesses. Sunak said on Monday that the number of loans offered under the scheme had risen to 12,000 from 6,000 last week. A spokesman for the business lobby group the Institute of Directors said: \u201cAnother acid test will be the money reaching firms\u2019 accounts.\u201d Against the backdrop of a potentially prolonged government lockdown, after ministers opted to keep tough restrictions on social and business activity in place for at least another three weeks, the job retention scheme has been extended until the end of June. As many as 8 million workers could be furloughed in total, according to estimates from the Resolution Foundation thinktank, which warned low-paid hospitality and retail companies would be affected most. It said the cost of the scheme after the first day alone would be \u00a34.2bn over three months, although that figure is expected to rise sharply. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent economic forecaster, had put the cost of the scheme at \u00a342bn before the extension was announced. Employers can only claim for furloughed employees who were on their payroll on or before 19 March, and there are fears that many people will fall through the cracks. The scheme does not cover everyone who recently switched firms, or seasonal workers who were about to start jobs at holiday parks, airports and youth hostels. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said earlier on Monday that firms should only use the scheme if they could not afford to pay staff themselves. Asked on ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain about reports that Victoria Beckham was using the scheme for staff at her fashion company, Dowden would not comment directly, but added: \u201cThe clear principle is: you should only be using it [the scheme] if you have to.\u201d He had previously warned Premier League football clubs that the scheme was for struggling firms and was not intended for \u201cbillionaire owners\u201d. Workers locked out of the scheme continued to call on the chancellor to extend its coverage. The entertainment industry union Bectu said a last-minute change on Friday meant that employees in TV and film who were on fixed-term contracts that ended before 19 March were no longer able to go back to their last employer and ask them to extend their contract and furlough them.",

More than 140,000 UK firms apply for government help As the UK government\u2019s job retention scheme opened, a month after it was created, the chancellor Rishi Sunak said more than 140,000 firms had applied. The scheme, which offers to subsidise 80% of furloughed staff\u2019s wages up to the value of \u00a32,500 per month, was announced after some companies reacted to the prospect of a lengthy lockdown by immediately laying off employees. Global death toll exceeds 166,000, with more than 2.4m cases worldwide According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 166,794 people have died and 2,432,092 have been infected since the outbreak began. The data, which are based on official releases and media reports, are likely to be underestimates because of suspected underreporting and differing testing and statistical recording regimes. Distancing measures to remain in place in Scotland \u2018for some time\u2019 Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that, towards the end of the week, the government would set out a framework for the eventual lifting of lockdown measures. But she stressed that it would not amount to a firm timetable. \u201cIt will also be clear in the work we set out later in the week that living with this virus, as we will need to learn to do, is likely to mean some restrictions on everyday life in the form of social distancing for some time to come.\u201d Spain to propose \u20ac1.5tn EU fund The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst hit by the crisis, according to Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds newspaper. Citing an internal document, the paper reported that Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, was planning to make a formal proposal to his EU colleagues at a summit on Thursday. Virgin boss says airline needs government help to survive Sir Richard Branson warned that the survival of his Virgin Atlantic airline depends on UK government support. It has been reported that the carrier is asking for a loan of up to \u00a3500m of public money. The Virgin Group boss wrote in a blog post: \u201cTogether with the team at Virgin Atlantic, we will do everything we can to keep the airline going \u2013 but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for.\u201d",

A group of 13 Aboriginal organisations from across the Northern Territory is calling on the national cabinet to do more to guarantee food security for remote communities. The coalition of health, housing, medical and legal groups says communities are still going without food and essentials such as baby food and toilet paper. It wants the national cabinet to guarantee an agreed proportion of essentials will be set aside for the independent suppliers of community stores. \u201cWe are getting daily reports of remote stores struggling to supply basic goods. Some stores are running out of fresh food three days after their weekly delivery,\u201d CEO of the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance of the NT, John Paterson, said.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson has said he will mortgage his private Caribbean island to raise money to help his Virgin Group empire, as he pleaded with the UK government to step in and save his Virgin Atlantic airline from collapse. Branson, who is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune, and has lived tax-free on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands for the last 14 years, promised in a public blogpost on Monday that he would \u201craise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible\u201d. Branson, 69, made the pledge as he tried to convince the government to give his airline a \u00a3500m loan to help it through the \u201cdevastating impact this pandemic continues to have\u201d. \u201cThe reality of this unprecedented crisis is that many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do everything we can to keep the airline going \u2013 but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for.\u201d Branson is facing mounting criticism for seeking financial assistance from the taxpayer, rather than using his own fortune to rescue the airline. Many pointed out that the entrepreneur has paid the exchequer no personal income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago. The former shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the Guardian this month it was unacceptable that \u201crich billionaires [were] milking the system\u201d at a time of national crisis. Diane Abbott, the MP for Hackney North and former shadow home secretary, said on Monday: \u201cBranson has not paid tax in this country for 14 years. On no account should he get a taxpayer bailout, loan or otherwise.\u201d Branson\u2019s fresh plea for taxpayer support comes after the government rejected Virgin Atlantic\u2019s initial proposal for a \u00a3500m aid package. The Treasury rejected the proposal, and told Virgin to explore other ways to raise cash before seeking state assistance. Branson said he was asking for a taxpayer loan, not a handout: \u201cThis would be in the form of a commercial loan \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be free money and the airline would pay it back.\u201d He dismissed the idea that he should consider tapping into his vast personal wealth rather seeking government support. \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of comments about my net worth \u2013 but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,\u201d he said. The billionaire later confirmed that he is not offering Necker Island as collateral on loans from the UK taxpayer, but only as security against commercial loans. \u201cHe and the team at Virgin Group will use the resources available to them which could even include raising money against Necker,\u201d his spokesperson said. \u201cHe does not state that Necker Island would be used as collateral against any potential government support Virgin Atlantic may receive.\u201d Branson has pledged to inject $250m (\u00a3197m) into Virgin Group, his empire which stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships, and which employs about 70,000 people.

      "body": "<p>Israel\u2019s prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu\">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, and his main rival, Benny Gantz, have agreed to form a national unity government, ending<strong> </strong>a year-long political crisis that has seen the country hold three back-to-back elections.</p> <p>A copy of the power-sharing agreement said Netanyahu, currently the interim leader, would remain in the role for 18 months before handing over to Gantz, a former army chief, for the remainder of a three-year term.</p> <p>The announcement was a stunning turnaround for Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, who appeared to be flagging in recent weeks under the strain of three damning corruption indictments and mediocre election performance.</p> <p>He is now likely to remain in office throughout his upcoming corruption trial and also gain significant influence over judicial appointments. Meanwhile, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White will take half of all ministries, including defence and foreign affairs.</p> <p>The text also hinted at the potential annexation of parts of the Palestinian territories this summer, stating that Netanyahu could bring Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-middle-east-peace-plan-israel-netanyahu-palestinians\">\u201cvision for peace\u201d</a> to a government vote from 1 July. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/28/donald-trump-middle-east-peace-plan-israel-netanyahu-palestinians\">The US plan</a>, pre-emptively rejected by Palestinian leaders, gives Israel full military control over Palestinians, much of their land and all of Jerusalem and Israeli settlements.</p> <p>Both Netanyahu and Gantz support Trump\u2019s plan. Mohammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, warned that the formation of what he called \u201can Israeli annexation government\u201d would dismantle the rights of the people of Palestine.</p> <p>Minutes after<strong> </strong>Monday\u2019s power-sharing agreement was announced, Netanyahu<a href=\"https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1252274130818412548\"> tweeted a photo of the Israeli flag</a>. Gantz <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gantzbe/status/1252276044620607488\">said on Twitter</a> that he had prevented a fourth round of elections, the likely outcome if no deal was reached.</p> <p>It could take several days to pass legislation needed to formalise the agreement before the new government can be inaugurated.</p> <p>Many had expected the stalemate to hold following three inconclusive elections that produced similar results and with little progress made between the two rivals during months of talks. Without a fully functioning government, Israel has been unable to pass a budget.</p> <p>Both politicians have been unable to forge majority coalitions on their own. Gantz was the latest to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">tasked with forming a government</a> after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/israeli-opposition-leader-passes-deadline-to-form-government\">but he failed</a> to clinch a majority last week.</p> <p>Outbreaks of the coronavirus, which has put the country under lockdown, have added urgency to the need to break the deadlock.</p> <p>Last month, it was Gantz who appeared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/benny-gantz-elected-israeli-speaker-signalling-deal-with-netanyahu\">back down</a> on his longstanding demand that Netanyahu must leave power.</p> <p>The opposition leader went against his own party, Blue and White, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/benny-gantz-elected-israeli-speaker-signalling-deal-with-netanyahu\">nominated himself as speaker</a> of Israel\u2019s parliament.</p> <p>Blue and White had planned to elect a different speaker, and push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-aid-palestinians-coronavirus-trump-cut\">US to give Palestinians $5m in coronavirus aid \u2013\u00a01% of what Trump cut</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Gantz nominated himself with the support of Netanyahu and his allies, with the apparent aim of protecting the prime minister from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.</p> <p>In uproar, Blue and White swiftly disintegrated, amid allegations Gantz had broke his one main promise since he began his short career in politics less than two years ago: to oust Netanyahu.</p> <p>Gantz said at the time that he was \u201cat peace\u201d with his decision.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the time for leaders to choose what is right and put the lingering issues and personal scores aside,\u201d he said, adding he would not \u201cdrag Israel to elections at this time of emergency \u2013 which will be with us for a long time, and whose repercussions are going to be long-term.\u201d</p> <p>Under the unity deal signed on Monday, the two politicians will head a specific \u201ccoronavirus cabinet\u201d to deal with the pandemic.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his main rival, Benny Gantz, have agreed to form a national unity government, ending a year-long political crisis that has seen the country hold three back-to-back elections. A copy of the power-sharing agreement said Netanyahu, currently the interim leader, would remain in the role for 18 months before handing over to Gantz, a former army chief, for the remainder of a three-year term. The announcement was a stunning turnaround for Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, who appeared to be flagging in recent weeks under the strain of three damning corruption indictments and mediocre election performance. He is now likely to remain in office throughout his upcoming corruption trial and also gain significant influence over judicial appointments. Meanwhile, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White will take half of all ministries, including defence and foreign affairs. The text also hinted at the potential annexation of parts of the Palestinian territories this summer, stating that Netanyahu could bring Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cvision for peace\u201d to a government vote from 1 July. The US plan, pre-emptively rejected by Palestinian leaders, gives Israel full military control over Palestinians, much of their land and all of Jerusalem and Israeli settlements. Both Netanyahu and Gantz support Trump\u2019s plan. Mohammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian prime minister, warned that the formation of what he called \u201can Israeli annexation government\u201d would dismantle the rights of the people of Palestine. Minutes after Monday\u2019s power-sharing agreement was announced, Netanyahu tweeted a photo of the Israeli flag. Gantz said on Twitter that he had prevented a fourth round of elections, the likely outcome if no deal was reached. It could take several days to pass legislation needed to formalise the agreement before the new government can be inaugurated. Many had expected the stalemate to hold following three inconclusive elections that produced similar results and with little progress made between the two rivals during months of talks. Without a fully functioning government, Israel has been unable to pass a budget. Both politicians have been unable to forge majority coalitions on their own. Gantz was the latest to be tasked with forming a government after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy, but he failed to clinch a majority last week. Outbreaks of the coronavirus, which has put the country under lockdown, have added urgency to the need to break the deadlock. Last month, it was Gantz who appeared to back down on his longstanding demand that Netanyahu must leave power. The opposition leader went against his own party, Blue and White, and nominated himself as speaker of Israel\u2019s parliament. Blue and White had planned to elect a different speaker, and push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment. But Gantz nominated himself with the support of Netanyahu and his allies, with the apparent aim of protecting the prime minister from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive. In uproar, Blue and White swiftly disintegrated, amid allegations Gantz had broke his one main promise since he began his short career in politics less than two years ago: to oust Netanyahu. Gantz said at the time that he was \u201cat peace\u201d with his decision. \u201cThis is the time for leaders to choose what is right and put the lingering issues and personal scores aside,\u201d he said, adding he would not \u201cdrag Israel to elections at this time of emergency \u2013 which will be with us for a long time, and whose repercussions are going to be long-term.\u201d Under the unity deal signed on Monday, the two politicians will head a specific \u201ccoronavirus cabinet\u201d to deal with the pandemic.",

      "body": "<p>The frontline role of local convenience stores during the coronavirus pandemic and the heightened risk to their workers have come into the spotlight as tributes were paid to a popular staff member at a south London corner shop.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"92dbe2ce-3e33-44fd-8eee-cd4b6c6c4225\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>UK data from the Office for National Statistics has revealed that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease as women. The trend was first seen in China, where <a href=\"http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51\">one analysis</a> found a fatality rate of 2.8% in men compared with 1.7% in women. Since then, the pattern has been mirrored in France, Germany, Iran, South Korea and Italy, where men have accounted for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/bmjgh/2020/03/24/sex-gender-and-covid-19-disaggregated-data-and-health-disparities/\">71% of deaths</a>.</p>\n    <p>So why are men more vulnerable?</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe honest answer is none of us know what\u2019s causing the difference,\u201d said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.</p>\n    <p>Early on, smoking was suggested as a likely explanation. In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to the difference. Smoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.</p>\n    <p>Behavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/sites/default/files/assets/1/AssetManager/2010%20Hand%20Washing%20Findings.pdf\">less likely to wash their hands</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/01/30/hand-washing-soap-poll-survey\">less likely to use soap</a>, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.</p>\n    <p>However, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries, the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The man, identified for now only as Kumar, had worked at the Freshgo store in Gipsy Hill for more than 10 years.

On Monday, Nursing Notes, a platform run by nurses for others in the profession, said it was aware of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/at-least-100-uk-health-workers-have-died-from-coronavirus-figures-show\">100 deaths</a> of NHS staff and social care workers.</p> <p>The figures on PPE shortages do not necessarily imply that the same proportion of doctors as a whole are experiencing problems, since those facing an issue may be more likely to make a report.</p> <p>Of the doctors reporting problems via the app, 766 said they had no access to the higher-grade FFP3 masks. Some 416 doctors without access to these masks were involved in aerosol-generating procedures such as suctioning Covid-19 patients in ICUs.</p> <p>Gowns have been a particular problem, with 821 doctors reporting not being able to access one. For aerosol-generating procedures the number was 514.</p> <p>While the gown and mask situation has deteriorated since the system was launched on 2 April, the availability of eye protection has improved slightly, with 416 doctors reporting no access to eye protection, including 252 doctors involved with aerosol-generating procedures.</p> <p>Doctors are able to provide comments when they submit their data via the app. One said: \u201cWe\u2019re running short of gowns, visors and masks and we have been asked to reuse single use masks and visors unless visibly contaminated with blood or vomit.\u201d</p> <p>Another said: \u201cI was given a patient gown with plastic sleeves taped on to wear whilst performing a tracheostomy.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Martin Barkley, the chief executive of the Mid Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust, said his staff had bought 6,000 sets of coveralls owing to very low stocks of long-sleeved gowns.</p> <p>\u201cThe trust, along with many other trusts across the country, has very low stocks of the long-sleeved gowns required for use when staff are working in wards or departments where higher-risk procedures (ie aerosol-generating procedures) are carried out,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe fully recognise these coveralls are not ideal: they are more uncomfortable for staff and are more laborious to take on and off. However, our first priority is to keep our staff safe, and these coveralls will do so in the absence of certainty about the next delivery of long-sleeved gowns.\u201d</p> <p>Doctors and others are setting up new organisations to try to source desperately needed PPE. Jasmine Ho, of <a href=\"https://www.medsupplydrive.org.uk/\">MedSupplyDrive UK</a>, which appeals for unused medical supplies from places such as research laboratories and redirects them to the NHS frontline, said: \u201cWe need contingency plans during this pandemic to ensure that we are suitably prepared for inevitable global PPE shortages.\u201d</p> <p>She said some forms of PPE could be safely decontaminated using hydrogen peroxide vapour and reused, and one British company had designed technology to do this but had no licence to use the technology in the UK.</p> <p>Instead the company had exported its decontamination techniques to the US having been granted a licence by the Food and Drug Administration.</p> <p>Megan Phillips, a partner at Bhatt Murphy, is helping to source PPE and get it to frontline NHS workers via another organisation, <a href=\"https://faceprotectionhub.org/\">Scrub and Face Protection Hub</a>. \u201cWe are trying to coordinate the many efforts to help meet the needs of healthcare staff on the frontline. The present situation is deeply concerning,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Dr Jenny Vaughan, of the Doctors Association, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the real disconnect between the government and the daily experiences of frontline staff who have been reporting their PPE status in droves via our <a href=\"http://nhsppe.com/\">NHSppe.com</a>. Doctors are risking their lives on the frontline and deserve nothing less than the correct levels of PPE.</p> <p>\u201cA more sustainable solution will need to be found in the coming weeks and months to ensure a constant supply of PPE. The science behind any decontamination must be robust in order to keep frontline staff safe. Any evidence based decontamination process chosen should not and cannot offer inferior protection to frontline staff or cause degradation of equipment.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of doctors have reported having to go without masks, eye protection and gowns in the last week, according to data seen by the Guardian. Doctors short of protective kit include those carrying out high-risk \u201caerosol-generating procedures\u201d with coronavirus patients. The findings are drawn from research by the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, which has launched an app allowing doctors to report shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) in their workplace. Since it was launched a fortnight ago, 1,598 doctors have signed up from 257 NHS trusts and practices, and 1,095 have reported problems. The Guardian has recorded 81 deaths of healthcare workers reported in the news, but the true figure is likely to be higher. On Monday, Nursing Notes, a platform run by nurses for others in the profession, said it was aware of 100 deaths of NHS staff and social care workers. The figures on PPE shortages do not necessarily imply that the same proportion of doctors as a whole are experiencing problems, since those facing an issue may be more likely to make a report. Of the doctors reporting problems via the app, 766 said they had no access to the higher-grade FFP3 masks. Some 416 doctors without access to these masks were involved in aerosol-generating procedures such as suctioning Covid-19 patients in ICUs. Gowns have been a particular problem, with 821 doctors reporting not being able to access one. For aerosol-generating procedures the number was 514. While the gown and mask situation has deteriorated since the system was launched on 2 April, the availability of eye protection has improved slightly, with 416 doctors reporting no access to eye protection, including 252 doctors involved with aerosol-generating procedures. Doctors are able to provide comments when they submit their data via the app. One said: \u201cWe\u2019re running short of gowns, visors and masks and we have been asked to reuse single use masks and visors unless visibly contaminated with blood or vomit.\u201d Another said: \u201cI was given a patient gown with plastic sleeves taped on to wear whilst performing a tracheostomy.\u201d On Monday, Martin Barkley, the chief executive of the Mid Yorkshire hospitals NHS trust, said his staff had bought 6,000 sets of coveralls owing to very low stocks of long-sleeved gowns. \u201cThe trust, along with many other trusts across the country, has very low stocks of the long-sleeved gowns required for use when staff are working in wards or departments where higher-risk procedures (ie aerosol-generating procedures) are carried out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe fully recognise these coveralls are not ideal: they are more uncomfortable for staff and are more laborious to take on and off. However, our first priority is to keep our staff safe, and these coveralls will do so in the absence of certainty about the next delivery of long-sleeved gowns.\u201d Doctors and others are setting up new organisations to try to source desperately needed PPE. Jasmine Ho, of MedSupplyDrive UK, which appeals for unused medical supplies from places such as research laboratories and redirects them to the NHS frontline, said: \u201cWe need contingency plans during this pandemic to ensure that we are suitably prepared for inevitable global PPE shortages.\u201d She said some forms of PPE could be safely decontaminated using hydrogen peroxide vapour and reused, and one British company had designed technology to do this but had no licence to use the technology in the UK. Instead the company had exported its decontamination techniques to the US having been granted a licence by the Food and Drug Administration. Megan Phillips, a partner at Bhatt Murphy, is helping to source PPE and get it to frontline NHS workers via another organisation, Scrub and Face Protection Hub. \u201cWe are trying to coordinate the many efforts to help meet the needs of healthcare staff on the frontline. The present situation is deeply concerning,\u201d she said. Dr Jenny Vaughan, of the Doctors Association, said: \u201cWe are concerned about the real disconnect between the government and the daily experiences of frontline staff who have been reporting their PPE status in droves via our NHSppe.com. Doctors are risking their lives on the frontline and deserve nothing less than the correct levels of PPE. \u201cA more sustainable solution will need to be found in the coming weeks and months to ensure a constant supply of PPE. The science behind any decontamination must be robust in order to keep frontline staff safe. Any evidence based decontamination process chosen should not and cannot offer inferior protection to frontline staff or cause degradation of equipment.\u201d The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment.",

The mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almedia, has said that <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/madrid-mayor-admits-allowing-3000-21887516\">allowing the fixture to go ahead was a mistake.</a> At the press conference <strong>Prof Dame Angela McLean,</strong> the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, was asked if the match should have been cancelled. She appeared to defend the decision to allow it, saying that in normal circumstances a match like that would not be a risk. But then she went on to concede that it might have contributed to the coronavirus spread. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>However, when you get to the situation of our strange lives as we live them now where we spend all our time basically at home, of course you wouldn\u2019t add on an extra risk of lots and lots of people going off to the same place at the same time.</p> \n   <p>I think it will be very interesting to see in the future when all the science is done what relationship there is between the virus that has circulated in Liverpool and the virus that has circulated in Spain.

She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Certainly people have to make their decisions based on whether they are in a risky situation or not. It is very difficult to legislate for all of that from a distance here.

We are trying to get many more care workers through testing given the severity and urgency of the issues in the care sector; surveillance testing as we go through this next phase to inform decisions that we\u2019re taking will be a key part of that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Gary Smith, from the <strong>GMB</strong> Scotland trade union, which represents care workers, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is simply not credible at this stage in the crisis for us to be testing this kind of number.

Broadly he has been trying to avoid criticising the government, but in an interview with the BBC\u2019s <strong>Victoria Derbyshire</strong> he got sucked into the argument about whether Boris Johnson was at fault for missing five meetings of the Cobra emergency committee on coronavirus in the early weeks of the crisis.</p> \n  <p>This was the central allegation in <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh\">a Sunday Times Insight investigation published yesterday (paywall).</a> That prompted the government to publish <a href=\"https://healthmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/04/19/response-to-sunday-times-insight-article/\">a 2,000-word rebuttal last night</a> that said, among other things, that the Sunday Times was wrong to say Cobra was normally chaired by the PM.</p> \n  <p>Asked if Johnson should have attended those Cobra meetings, Blair largely avoided the invitation to criticise the PM - although he did insinuate that Johnson might have been somewhat negligent. Blair said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I just don\u2019t want to be in that game because I know how difficult it is for all of them.</p> \n   <p>People ask me: were there any Cobra meetings you missed?

Obviously if you have Cobra it\u2019s because it is a serious emergency.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m sure the people in government have been doing everything they possibly can. I think the most important thing is not who\u2019s doing their job well and who\u2019s doing it badly, it\u2019s whether you have the right combination of skill at the centre of government to handle some of these things.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Derbyshire came back to the topic towards the end of what was a long interview, and this time she did get Blair to come out with a more direct criticism. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If you talk to people in government themselves, I think what they would say is in the period of the initial start of the disease, in the period in other words between the start of the disease and the suppression, I think most people would accept the government was somewhat behind the curve.

Boris Johnson \u2018against lifting lockdown over second wave fears\u2019. The prime minister is reported to be cautious about easing the lockdown for fear of sparking a second wave of coronavirus infections. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, confirmed that the government was reluctant to lift the lockdown for fear of sparking a second wave of infections. Scotland\u2019s first minister and interim chief medical officer have appeared to rule out the resumption of football matches behind closed doors, a move which will increase anxiety at the country\u2019s professional clubs. The vast majority of the Scottish Professional Football League\u2019s sides \u2013 including Celtic and Rangers \u2013 have used the government\u2019s job retention scheme or implemented pay cuts or deferrals for players and staff. The 2019-20 campaign for the lower three tiers has already been abandoned and the Premiership is heading for the same outcome upon receipt of Uefa approval. The SPFL has been anxious to be in position to start its new season on the first weekend in August as per details of a new broadcasting deal with Sky Sports, worth a record \u00a3160m, and season tickets for the 2020-21 season are already widely on sale. The Scottish Football Association even hopes to open a new campaign with its cup semi-finals, which would ordinarily attract an aggregate of at least 80,000 spectators. Both options are now seriously remote, with Nicola Sturgeon also suggesting matches with no spectators would not be viable unless there is a major coronavirus breakthrough. Foster carers across the UK are calling for sick pay during coronavirus pandemic, warning they are currently being forced to chose between their own health, the wellbeing of the foster child, and the need to pay their bills. Foster care workers are as self-employed and have no entitlement to sick pay. A union said that foster carers who develop symptoms risk losing their income if children are therefore not assigned to their care. Jane Wright, chair of the IWGB foster care workers branch, says: Our work is not only more challenging but also more important now than ever. In a pandemic, denial of sick pay threatens to plunge even more of us into poverty. With a six week wait for universal credit, any unwell foster care worker forced to self-isolate risks destitution. They may be unable to pay bills and if they lose their house, their fostered child has nowhere to come home to. One foster care worker, who wished to remain anonymous, said: The government needs to do something. My rent didn\u2019t go down because I was sick. My job didn\u2019t get any easier because I was sick. They took the money right out of my bank account. They treat us like we\u2019re nothing, but who\u2019s feeding this baby? Who\u2019s buying wet wipes and nappies and heating and rent to keep him safe and warm? I\u2019m looking after a vulnerable child. Who\u2019s looking after us? Here are the main points from Rishi Sunak\u2019s press conference. Sunak, the chancellor, refused to accept that it might have been a mistake to allow a Champions League match involving Liverpool and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to go ahead on 11 March \u2013 even though a government scientist appeared to concede at the same press conference that the event may have contributed to the spread of coronavirus in the UK. Some 3,000 Atl\u00e9tico fans travelled to Merseyside for the match, at a time when some lockdown measures were already in force in Spain. The mayor of Madrid, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almedia, has said that allowing the fixture to go ahead was a mistake. At the press conference Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, was asked if the match should have been cancelled. She appeared to defend the decision to allow it, saying that in normal circumstances a match like that would not be a risk. But then she went on to concede that it might have contributed to the coronavirus spread. She said: However, when you get to the situation of our strange lives as we live them now where we spend all our time basically at home, of course you wouldn\u2019t add on an extra risk of lots and lots of people going off to the same place at the same time. I think it will be very interesting to see in the future when all the science is done what relationship there is between the virus that has circulated in Liverpool and the virus that has circulated in Spain. That\u2019s certainly an interesting hypothesis you raise there. Her comment surprised journalists. For example, this is from ITV\u2019s political editor Robert Peston. And this is from the Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan. But after McLean gave her answer, Sunak was pressed by the Liverpool Echo\u2019s Liam Thorp on whether the government should have allowed the match to go ahead. Sunak refused to accept the decision to allow it might have been a mistake. He said: At every stage in this crisis we\u2019ve been guided by the scientific advice and have been making the right decision at the right time ... Of course, This is an unprecedented situation we\u2019re all dealing with, I\u2019m sure there are all things that we will learn from this. But in terms of the guidance that we put in place, I believe that it was the right guidance at the right time, based on the scientific advice that we were provided with. It would not have been hard to say that, although that decision was based on scientific advice at the time, in retrospect maybe it wasn\u2019t so wise after all. But that would have taken Sunak into \u201cadmitting error\u201d territory, somewhere no politician is comfortable venturing to. Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director for Public Health England, defended the PHE decision to issue guidance last week advising NHS staff to wear aprons in some circumstances instead of full-length gowns when the right equipment was not available. She said this was a \u201cprecautionary set of advice\u201d, based on guidance that already existed and in line with WHO advice covering exceptional circumstances. She said: The guidance remains exactly the same. What has happened over the weekend is to cover people really and give them some security in exceptional circumstances, advice has been produced jointly with the NHS about how to be safe in circumstances where supplies may be at risk. And that is a very precautionary set of advice - it\u2019s quite the opposite to putting people at risk because there aren\u2019t enough supplies. It\u2019s trying to ensure that people are well secured and safe when there may not be enough supplies, and it also stresses how important it is not to take risks and when it is not right to do certain things and practices with the PPE. Doyle said it would be for staff to decide what was safe and what wasn\u2019t. She explained: Certainly people have to make their decisions based on whether they are in a risky situation or not. It is very difficult to legislate for all of that from a distance here. But the guidance is very clear on what is safe and not safe to do. Doyle said a lack of PPE (personal protective equipment) was \u201ca concern\u201d but insisted officials were \u201cworking very hard\u201d to improve the situation. Sunak said the government was doing everything it could to address the shortage. He said: We\u2019re improving our sourcing internationally and domestically to make sure we can get the PPE we need in what is a very challenging international context. But people on the frontline can rest assured that we\u2019re doing absolutely everything we can and straining everything we can to get the equipment they need. Sunak said more than 140,000 firms had today applied for help from the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme. The Resolution Foundation says these applications alone could cost the government \u00a34.2bn. (See 5.45pm.) McLean said the numbers of people testing positive for coronavirus had stabilised. The figures were \u201cpretty much stable and flat\u201d, she said. Doyle said the number of people dying from coronavirus was \u201cundoubtedly\u201d higher than the hospital figures implied. The daily global death rate chart released by the government has now been updated to reflect this. (See 5.14pm.) She said 90% of coronavirus deaths were in hospital. Sunak said he did not favour moving from a system where the government backed 80% of coronavirus loans to businesses to one where it backed 100% of those loans. The former chancellor George Osborne is among those who have been pushing for this change, for certain categories of loan. The number of prison staff who have tested positive for Covid-19 rose 40% in three days, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As at 5pm on Sunday, 194 prison staff across 53 prisons were confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus, compared with 138 in the last available figures for Thursday. The number of prisoners who had tested positive for Covid-19 increased 9% in the same period to 278 inmates across 64 prisons. There are around 81,500 prisoners in England and Wales, in 117 prisons. A total of 13 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died, including one inmate who died within prison walls. The government recently announced an extension of testing to prison and probation staff. The Prison Service is to temporarily release up to 4,000 inmates who are within two months of their release date, as well as build 500 cells within the existing prison estate to increase single-cell occupancy. This is from Dan Tomlinson, an economist at the Resolution Foundation thinktank, commenting on what Rishi Sunak said at the press conference about the take-up of the furlough scheme that opened today. (See 5.05pm.) Tomlinson said: The sheer scale of applications for the government\u2019s job retention scheme on its opening day shows just how badly the scheme is needed. Without firms having the option to furlough staff, Britain could be facing the prospect of totally unprecedented numbers of people being unemployed. The claims made today alone are set to cost at least \u00a34.2bn if staff are furloughed for three months. The demand today also indicates that the new IT system has managed to cope with significant claims. The next challenge is to make sure the payments to firms get made as swiftly as possible, as the scheme is very much on the frontline of protecting both firms and family incomes amid a huge economic crisis. Sunak is now wrapping up. As is normal at these events, he ends by repeating the government\u2019s stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives message. And, quoting what Dominic Raab said last week, he says: There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we are not there yet. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. Q: Is this new approach, where you are taking equity in start-ups, something that you will want to maintain long term? Sunak says this is an unprecedented approach. The UK is a European start-ups success story, he says. In the past the government has not needed to do something like this. He says they will keep this policy under review. Q: Do you have any modelling that suggests how people might behave when the lockdown measures are relaxed? That is a good question, says McLean. She says the behavioural scientists who advise the government are careful. If they were here, they would probably say it was difficult to predict. For example, who much will people go back to work when allowed? That is very hard to predict, she says. Q: Was the government too slow to ban major sports events? Sunak says that at every stage the government has followed the scientific advice, and by the need to make the right decisions at the right time. But it has been an unprecedented situation, he says. He says he believes that was the right guidance at the right time. Q: On 11 March Liverpool hosted a match against Atletico Madrid. Subsequently mass gatherings were banned. The mayor of Madrid says now it was a mistake to allow that match to go ahead. Do you agree? McLean says this has to be considered in the context of what the situation was at the time. Normally a football match is not a big risk. But of course you would not allow that now. Q: Can you promise councils that they get a fair funding settlement? Sunak says he used to be a local government minister. Of course he wants to support local government, he says. Q: Some self-employed people are not getting help. Do you see why people back a universal income? And shouldn\u2019t universal credit be more generous? Sunak says the UK\u2019s scheme to help the self-employed is more generous than comparable schemes in other countries. On universal credit, he says people can get advance payments from day one. Q: Tony Blair says he is terrified about the long-term consequences of the lockdown. Do you share that feeling? And is it correct that the Treasury analysis of the impact of the lockdown says there could be long-term damage to the economy, unlike the OBR\u2019s, which was more optimistic? Sunak says any responsible chancellor would have plans in place for a range of scenarios. He says this will be a challenging period. He will not be able to save every job. But he wants to get back to normal as soon as possible. Q: Would you support health staff refusing to work without the proper equipment? Doyle says the guidance is very clear. People have to make a judgment about how to interpret it. But the guidance says what is safe and what is not. Q: Some medical organisations are very worried about the new guidance for PPE issued last Friday. They think these new guidelines are based on equipment availability, not safety? Doyle says the advice is precautionary. She says it is based on guidance that already exists, and on what the WHO says should be done in exceptional circumstances. Q: Do you have an estimate of the cost and the take-up for the furlough scheme? Sunak says the Treasury has not produced its own estimate. The OBR published one last week, he said. (The OBR said the scheme might cost \u00a342bn.) Q: There are suggestions that your death figures understate coronavirus deaths by 40%. Is that accurate? Doyle says the hospital data does not tell the whole story. She says 90% of deaths occur in hospital. But the pattern is different in different parts of the country. Q: The governor of the Bank of England does seem to favour 100% loan guarantees. Why don\u2019t you agree? Sunak says the governor said he wanted money to get to firms quickly. He says the level of support he has introduced is higher than in almost any other country. Q: The PM seems to be making it clear that he won\u2019t relax the lockdown any time soon. Is that right? Sunak says they have been clear that they will follow the scientific advice. In response to a question about the business loan scheme, Sunak says he is not persuaded by arguments saying he should provide a 100% loan guarantee, instead of an 80% loan guarantee. Doyle says it is a \u201cconcern\u201d that health workers feel they do not have the PPE they need. McLean is now presenting the daily slides. Here is the transport use one. Here is the chart for new cases. Here are the figures for coronavirus cases in hospital. And here are the global comparison figures. The government has now put two lines for the UK on this chart: a hospital coronavirus death figures line, and a total deaths line. The data for total deaths is not so up to date, which is why that line does not extend so far. Sunak ends by reading out the latest figures for new cases and deaths. And he thanks people for following the guidelines. Sunak says he has launched a \u00a3500m investment fund for high-growth businesses, part of an innovation package worth \u00a31.25bn. Sunak says the government is not just protecting businesses now. It is sowing the seeds for recovery. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is speaking now at the government press conference. He is appearing with Prof Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientific adviser, and Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director for Public Health England. He says a month ago he promised to set up a scheme to protect jobs. Today the coronavirus job retention scheme has opened for business, and by 4pm more than 140,000 firms had applied. Stormont health minister Robin Swann has announced another 13 deaths in Northern Ireland. Forty people were in hospital intensive care units earlier today, while hospitals yesterday recorded 88 Covid-19 admissions. In its rebuttal of yesterday\u2019s Sunday Times Insight article mentioned earlier (see 10.39am) the government quoted the Lancet editor Richard Horton in its defence. Today Horton claims his views were quoted out of context. He has posted a Twitter thread on this starting here. As of 5pm on 19 April, 16,509 people in hospital who tested positive for coronavirus and died, up by 449 from the day before. The full figures are here. A total of 386,044 people have been tested, of whom 124,743 have tested positive. Downing Street won\u2019t discuss what its plan for easing the lockdown might look like, but the former prime minister Tony Blair is keen to explore the mechanics of how this might be achieved and his thinktank has published a report (pdf) on this topic which is well worth reading if you are at all curious about what the future might look like. Blair does not have a \u201cmagic bullet\u201d solution (until a vaccine arrives, no one does), but he has a useful summary of the options. Here are three charts that summarise his argument. This shows how hard it would be to relax the various measures in place without R, the reproduction number (the rate at new people get infected by every person with coronavirus), rising above 1. It puts the current rate at 0.7 and, based on Imperial College calculations, it says that it would be impossible to lift the main measures currently in place (except school closures) with R rising above 1. The report argues that what is needed is a twin strategy of containment and shielding. This chart uses a traffic-light analysis to assess the merits of eight policy options. And this chart suggests how the UK could move out of the hard lockdown, via a \u201csoft lockdown\u201d towards \u201csoft open\u201d, as and when various new cases/testing/tracing/shielding thresholds are hit. In an interview on Sky this morning Blair said that an exit strategy was essential because the lockdown would do crippling damage to the economy, government revenues and people\u2019s lives if it were allowed to continue for too long. He said: If we don\u2019t start to get our economy back to some type of normal, then I\u2019m terrified about the longterm economic and social damage in this. Only 17 out of a potential 70 inmates who are either pregnant or held in a mother and baby unit (MBU) have been released from prison since the government announced the emergency measure three weeks ago, MPs and peers have heard. The Ministry of Justice announced on 31 March it would temporarily release pregnant women in custody and women held in MBUs who do not pose a high risk of harm \u201cwithin days\u201d to protect them from coronavirus. There were 35 pregnant women in prison and 34 MBU inmates as of 6pm on 30 March. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, told the Joint Committee on Human Rights that only 17 had been released so far. He said: You\u2019re going to say to me well that doesn\u2019t sound very many. That\u2019s because I want to make sure each of them has a package of support so they\u2019re not merely released to the community because some of them will sadly have come from abusive relationships and can\u2019t go back to the former family home. I want to make sure they have the accommodation, and the support generally not just for them but either for the unborn child or the very young child whose rights are really important and underpin the approach I\u2019ve taken with regards to seeking to safeguard this vulnerable cohort. A new emergency hospital in Glasgow may not be needed because the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland appears to be plateauing thanks to high levels of public adherence to the lockdown, the hospital\u2019s chief executive has confirmed. The Louisa Jordan hospital opened at the Scottish Events Campus for its first patients on Monday, with a potential capacity of 1,036 beds. Jill Young, its chief executive, said it would open beds 40 at a time, basing its occupancy on normal hospital ward numbers. They have 100 staff on standby for the first patients but Young said there was no call yet on its facilities, which are due initially to remain at the SEC for five months but will remain there for as long as needed. The number of Covid-19 patients in Scottish hospitals and in intensive care beds has begun to fall. There were more than 200 people in ITU units in mid-April, but only 169 this morning. Young said: The reason the hospitals and health boards out there are coping so well, we have to give credit and thanks to the Scottish population. The compliance with the guidance they\u2019ve been given is just tremendous. It has given us hope, as you\u2019ve heard from the first minister and cabinet secretary [the health secretary, Jeane Freeman], that the numbers are not increasing as fast as we imagined they would and in fact they look like they\u2019re plateauing. But it\u2019s far too early to take any final predictions on that, so we have to stand ready at any point in time to open. At the moment, the numbers look like we will not be required to open, certainly within the next few days, and we\u2019re receiving a daily update on that. Young added that much of the equipment and furniture installed there would be reused within the NHS if the hospital was not required. Its construction and installation costs totalled \u00a343m, with local businesses donating around \u00a31m in supplies, including free concrete and steel. From emergency arrivals to critical care, the Guardian was given extraordinary access to UHCW hospital in Coventry to document the Covid-19 pandemic. This photo essay by Jonny Weeks captures the contributions of those who save our lives The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has told MPs any tracing app designed to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 would be \u201cfunctionally limited\u201d to prevent a \u201cmission creep\u201d that would change the relationship between the individual and the state. The NHSX \u2013 the health service\u2019s digital transformation arm \u2013 is developing an app that alerts users when they have been in contact with someone with coronavirus. But experts have warned that digital contact tracing will fail unless governments build the technology in a way that respects user privacy. Quizzed by the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC on the risks to privacy, Buckland, the cabinet minister responsible for human rights, said so far he had seen a \u201cproper prioritisation of privacy and indeed security\u201d. Buckland told a remote session of the Joint Committee on Human Rights: On every occasion that government or its agencies seek to create a device or mechanism that has potential of infringing rights or other fundamental civil liberties then the greatest care has to be taken. The lead will be Department of Health and Social Care, and the work of the NHS itself, who are developing a contact-tracing app. Thus far, I\u2019m seeing a proper prioritisation of the need for privacy and indeed for security when it comes to the data that might be contained in such a tracing device. Clearly speed is of the essence, because of the situation we\u2019re in, but the need for an ethical approach and legal approach is very much at the heart of what the NHS is doing. Buckland said consultation had taken place with the Information Commissioner, the National Data Guardians Panel, and the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. He said: The issues of patient data, that are familiar to us in an offline form because they\u2019ve been around for a number of years, are being fully reflected in the development of a tracing app. We\u2019re not there in terms of the finalised design. The source code will be provided so there will be independent scrutiny of that, so the transparency element is going to be at the heart of the development. Buckland said the app would be compliant with the GDPR, the Human Rights Act, and the Equality Act. \u201cThis is not an app that\u2019s being designed for enforcement. That\u2019s a very important point when considering the potential ramifications of this. The chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, told the Andrew Marr show on Sunday, that the app was in beta-testing phase. Ofcom has ruled that London Live broke broadcasting rules and posed \u201csignificant harm to viewers in London during the pandemic\u201d by broadcasting an 80-minute interview with David Icke. The media regulator imposed a sanction on ESTV, which owns London Live, following the interview in which Icke suggested the coronavirus pandemic was part of a plot by governments to destroy the economy and conduct mass surveillance. \u201cOur investigation found David Icke expressed views which had the potential to cause significant harm to viewers in London during the pandemic,\u201d Ofcom said in a statement. According to Sky News, three RAF aircraft which are due to fly to Turkey to collect consignments of PPE (personal protective equipment) that the NHS was expecting today have yet to take off because they have not received confirmation that the packages are ready. The government has announced that mortuaries will be expanded by 30,000 spaces during the coronavirus pandemic. The BBC reports that this is a precautionary measure rather than a prediction of how many people will die. Local government minister Simon Clarke said: \u201cWe all hope these contingencies will not be needed ... that requires everyone to play their part in the national effort.\u201d He added: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to strike an appropriate balance.\u201d NHS England has announced 429 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 14,829. Of the 429 new deaths announced today: 85 occurred on 19 April, 210 occurred on 18 April, and 53 occurred on 17 April. The figures also show 77 of the deaths happened between 1 April and 16 April, and the remaining four deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death thappening on 21 March. The full details of the figures are here (pdf). Plaid Cymru has called the Welsh government\u2019s dropping of coronavirus testing targets \u201ca scandal\u201d. The party\u2019s shadow health minister Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \u201cTesting has to be a priority. The World Health Organization said testing is the backbone of the war on coronavirus. Except in Wales, it seems \u2013 or does Welsh government know something the WHO doesn\u2019t?\u201d The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has confirmed the Welsh government will not meet the target it has set of carrying out 9,000 tests a day by the end of the month, blaming in part deliveries of equipment and reagents from abroad. He said no new target would be set but the government would report on the number of tests it had carried out weekly. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has told MPs that of 13 prisoners to have contracted Covid-19 and lost their lives, one has died within prison walls. Appearing before a remote session of the joint committee on human rights, Buckland said the individual died in a palliative care unit within a prison and a doctor was in attendance. Twelve other prisoners have tested positive for the coronavirus and died in hospital. The most recently available figures revealed that as of 5pm on Thursday, there were 255 infected prisoners across 62 prisons. There are 81,500 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons. An update for figures as of Sunday is expected later. There have been 296 Jewish funerals where the person who died contracted the coronavirus, as of and including 19 April. The latest figure is an increase of 40 from 16 April, when the last figures were reported. \u201cWe wish their families a long life, and pray that the memory of their loved ones should be for a blessing,\u201d the Board of Deputies of British Jews said in a statement. The organisation has been liaising with six of the largest denominational burial boards and the Orthodox burial boards in Manchester to collate an indicator of deaths where Covid-19 was a factor. It covers both deaths in hospitals and in the wider community. Nicola Sturgeon has admitted that virus testing rates in Scotland are running at little over half the NHS\u2019s full laboratory capacity, amid continuing controversy over failures to test care workers. Scottish government data shows that since the start of April, the NHS has conducted 22,605 tests, an average of 1,190 coronavirus tests per day; over the last 10 days, the average daily rate fell to 1,096 tests. The first minister confirmed during her daily coronavirus briefing that the NHS in Scotland now had the capacity to run around 2,000 tests a day, and planned to expand that to more than 3,500 by the end of April. Since the start of the outbreak, 39,612 tests have been conducted by NHS labs in Scotland. Over the weekend a care home in Prestwick, Ayrshire reported it now had 20 suspected deaths from the virus. NHS laboratories report they are still not running at capacity. And Sturgeon said the NHS laboratories total did not include the UK government\u2019s drive-through testing hubs at Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen airports. She did not directly answer a question on why NHS facilities were not being used to their fullest extent but said more details should be released on who is being tested, and how capacity is being used in a few days. She said: There is still work that is being done and needs to be done to make sure we are using that capacity to the maximum. That has focused not exclusively but largely on making sure we are testing NHS and care workers and their families where that is appropriate. There\u2019s more than 12,000 NHS and care workers and their families had been tested. We are trying to get many more care workers through testing given the severity and urgency of the issues in the care sector; surveillance testing as we go through this next phase to inform decisions that we\u2019re taking will be a key part of that. Gary Smith, from the GMB Scotland trade union, which represents care workers, said: It is simply not credible at this stage in the crisis for us to be testing this kind of number. They are badly letting down frontline workers, many of them on poverty wages, in the care industry. Testing is absolutely crucial in getting this virus under control. People should be incandescent that old people in care homes can\u2019t get tested and workers can\u2019t get tested, while they turn these homes into morgues. The Hackney Gazette has published a tribute to the two nurses at Homerton hospital in east London who died after contracting coronavirus. Sophie Fagan, 78, died on Sunday morning in the hospital she had spent years working in. She arrived in the UK from India aged 16 to begin her nursing training and went on to work in healthcare in Hackney for more than 50 years. Michael Allieu, 53, had worked as an acute care nurse at the hospital since 2007. Allieu, who was described as a \u201cvibrant, larger than life character\u201d, died on 18 April after contracting the virus. The Homerton university hospital NHS foundation trust said Sophie was \u201cpart of the healthcare fabric in Hackney\u201d and Michael was a \u201cmember of the Homerton family\u201d. There is a delay in the publication of the UK-wide figures. The Department of Health and Social Care tweeted they would be published later this afternoon. Nine people have died from the coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total number of deaths to 584, according to Public Health Wales. There were 276 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total in Wales to 7,546. The full summary of today\u2019s figures for Wales is here. At her daily news conference Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said the Scottish government would set out \u201ctowards the end of this week\u201d a framework that would guide its lifting of lockdown measures. But she stressed that it would not amount to a firm timetable. She said: I want to be clear, however, that the initial version of this work will not set out what measures will be lifted and when. We are simply not yet in the position to take those decisions in a properly informed way. Sturgeon also stressed that she would not rush to remove lockdown as this could risk a resurgence of the virus, overwhelming the NHS and putting many more lives at risk. She added: It will also be clear in the work we set out later in the week that living with this virus, as we will need to learn to do, is likely to mean some restrictions on everyday life in the form of social distancing for some time to come. Coronavirus lockdown fines have been issued after a police helicopter was scrambled to deal with submerged boaters, PA Media reports. Hinckley police in Leicestershire said officers were called to reports of a break-in at a boat house at 9.30pm on Saturday. The force said it found no signs of a break-in at Thornton Reservoir but spotted two men making their way across the water in a boat without a paddle. In a Facebook post, police said a helicopter was scrambled and spotted the men completely submerged in the water. After the helicopter guided officers to where the men were hidden, an ambulance was sent to the scene to \u201chelp warm the two individuals up\u201d. The pair were subsequently issued fixed-penalty notices for breaching coronavirus legislation. University students could be recruited to help carry out Covid-19 surveillance in Wales once the lockdown is lifted, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said that after the lockdown ends it is inevitable there will be flare-ups of the virus and plans are being drawn up to carry out surveillance in the community. Drakeford said public health officials and council officers would be used but it was clear it would need to recruit people such as students to help out. He confirmed the Welsh government would not meet the target it has set of carrying out 9,000 tests a day by the end of the month, blaming in part deliveries of equipment and reagents from abroad. He said no new target would be set but military planners were now helping streamline the system. The first minister has written to Michael Gove asking for a regular cycle of meetings between the UK government and the devolved administrations between now and the end of the current lockdown period. He said: What I don\u2019t want is us meeting the day before the three weeks are up ... because I think those decisions are going to be more complicated and more contentious than simply a decision to extend the lockdown. The first minister is keen on a four-nation plan on the next phase. My own view is that moving together across the UK is the best way of doing things for Wales. If we can\u2019t secure it and we need to make decisions for ourselves, that is what we will do. He also suggested that the lockdown restrictions around second homes may be tightened later this week. An \u201cextremely well-liked and valued\u201d NHS nurse has died after contracting Covid-19, PA Media reports. The University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS trust (UHNM) said Patrick McManus worked as a nurse for over 40 years in Staffordshire. The 60-year-old, described as \u201can exceptional leader\u201d and a \u201cloveable character\u201d, had worked at both Staffordshire Royal Infirmary and, most recently, the County hospital in Stafford. Paying tribute to McManus, Tracy Bullock, the UHNM chief executive, said: We are deeply saddened to confirm that a member of staff has passed away due to Covid-19. Patrick McManus was an extremely well-liked and valued member of the nursing team at County Hospital, Stafford ... Our deepest sympathies are with his family at this very sad time. Here is a summary of the main points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said that avoiding a second peak of infections was the \u201cbig concern\u201d as ministers approached the decision about easing the lockdown. (See 12.58pm.) The spokesman said that Boris Johnson is getting daily written updates on coronavirus policy as he recuperates at Chequers, but that he was not engaged in government work. The spokesman said: The prime minister is continuing his recovery at Chequers. He isn\u2019t doing government work. He has been receiving updates on the coronavirus response, and he has spoken with the first secretary of state [Dominic Raab], as well as senior members of his Number 10 team. The spokesman said the PM would be \u201cguided by the advice of his medical team\u201d as to when to return to work and that Raab was deputising in his absence. Asked about the PM\u2019s meeting with Raab and others on Friday, the spokesman said that this was a chance to update the PM, and not a decision-making meeting. The spokesman refused to elaborate on what options for the easing of the lockdown were being considered, or over what timescale they might be implemented. The spokesman said the government now has the capacity to carry out 36,000 coronavirus tests per day. But the latest daily figure for the number of tests carried out, in the 24 hours up to 9am yesterday, was just 21,626. More than 16,000 of those tests were carried out in NHS laboratories, and the rest by commercial partners in drive-through centres. More than 88,000 NHS and social care staff and their relatives have now been tested, the spokesman said, up from 66,000 at the end of last week. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will hold this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said. Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, will also be attending. Downing Street supports the idea of a minute\u2019s silence for NHS workers who have died from coronavirus, the spokesman said. The spokesman confirmed that Dominic Raab is due to deputise for Johnson at PMQs this week. But the exact details of how PMQs will work remain to be decided, he said. The spokesman said there had been no change from last week when ministers were saying they had no plans to follow their New Zealand counterparts, who have taken a 20% pay cut. The daily Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. And while the prime minister\u2019s spokesman claimed (not entirely convincingly) that Boris Johnson is not doing any government work while he continues to recuperate at Chequers, he confirmed that the government\u2019s priority is now to avoid a second peak - a line that Johnson reportedly stressed when he discussed the coronavirus crisis with Dominic Raab and his closest aides at the end of last week. (See 9.07am.) The spokesman said: The big concern is a second peak. That is what ultimately will do the most damage to health and the most damage to the economy. If you move too quickly, then the virus could begin to spread exponentially again. The public will expect us to do everything we can to stop the spread of the virus and protect life. The spokesman also reminded journalists that Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, said last week that a second peak of infections would be damaging not just for people\u2019s health, but for the economy too. For an illustration as to what a second peak might look like, here is a graph from a paper (pdf) produced by Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, for the government last month. I will post more from the briefing shortly. Here is a Guardian video explaining how coronavirus testing works. As my colleague Severin Carrell reports, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has been giving the latest coronavirus case numbers and death figures for Scotland. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has restated his call for the government to give more details about its coronavirus exit strategy. He made that point in a briefing with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, this morning also involving other opposition leaders. After it was over a spokesperson for Starmer said: This morning Keir Starmer and other opposition leaders were briefed over the phone by the foreign secretary and senior government officials about the coronavirus pandemic. The call was constructive. During the call, the Labour Leader raised his concerns about the availability of PPE to key workers and asked how the government would address the current shortages of supply. He also asked how confident the government was on hitting the target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month. Keir Starmer reiterated his support for the government\u2019s decision to extend the lockdown, but asked what planning was being put in place for when the restrictions are lifted. All sides agreed to further briefings in the weeks ahead. The Duke of Edinburgh, 98, has issued a rare public message to pay tribute to all those carrying out \u201cvital and urgent\u201d work in the coronavirus pandemic. Prince Philip, who along with the Queen, is being shielded at Windsor Castle, retired from public life in 2017, and has lived privately since. In his statement he said: As we approach world immunisation week, I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic; by those in the medical and scientific professions, at universities and research institutions, all united in working to protect us from Covid-19. On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues; the staff and volunteers working on food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected. Philip is affiliated to more than 750 organisations , including scientific and technological research, healthcare and infrastructure sectors which have been responding to the outbreak. The Dragon\u2019s Heart hospital, an emergency hospital set up at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff, is opening today, WalesOnline reports. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain this morning that firms should only use the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme - the furlough initiative, which opened for business this morning - if they could not afford to keep paying staff themselves. He made the point when asked about a story saying Victoria Beckham is using the scheme for staff at her fashion company. Dowden would not comment on the Beckham story, but speaking generally he said: We are facing an unprecedented global health crisis and in response to that we have taken unprecedented measures which are clearly having a big effect on the economy. I think each person and each company should ask themselves: do they have to rely on the taxpayer? Because this scheme is meant to be for, if you are about to make someone redundant and you haven\u2019t got the money to continue to employ them, then you can rely on the government to stop people being made redundant. I don\u2019t know the details of her [Beckham\u2019s] fashion business. I\u2019m not going to comment on each one in turn, but the clear principle is: you should only be using it if you have to. Muslims are being told to \u201cpray at home and share Ramadan digitally\u201d because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Muslim Council of Britain has published guidance showing how this can be done ahead of the holy month, which begins on Thursday (April 23). Dexter Blackstock, the former Queens Park Rangers and Nottingham Forest striker, now runs a medical technology firm that is involved in a project enabling people to donate to help provide more PPE (personal protective equipment) for NHS staff, my colleague Jacob Steinberg reports. A list of essential workers has been published by the Stormont administration, PA Media reports. They include food and personal protective equipment producers in Northern Ireland. Utilities, water and waste treatment and construction supporting the health service and food industry are also permitted to continue. The list was drawn up in consultation with a forum including the Chamber of Commerce, CBI, trade unions and Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Health Agency (PHA). The economy minister, Diane Dodds, said: The list is published for advisory purposes to allow companies to make their own decisions. If a company can work within the social distancing guidelines, then it should do so. The safety guidance will have practical application in the workplace. Yesterday the Sunday Times (paywall) said that Boris Johnson missed five meetings of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee and that this was unusual because Cobra meets \u201cat moments of great peril\u201d and it \u201cnormally chaired by the prime minister\u201d. In its rebuttal the government said that this was wrong and that it was normal for Cobra to be chaired by a relevant secretary of state. The matters because the \u201cfive missed Cobra meetings\u201d anecdote encapsulates a much wider argument - that Johnson was negligent in his early handling of coronavirus because he did not take it seriously enough. No 10 is working on the basis that, if it can discredit this anecdote, it might stop the wider narrative gaining credence. On the very narrow point about whether it is normal for Cobra to be chaired by the PM, Tony Blair seemed to back up the Sunday Times\u2019 claim. (See 10.03am.) Gordon Brown has not commented, but Damian McBride, his communications chief, has in tweets that argue that, if Cobra was convened, the PM should have been in the chair. However, what these interventions from the Blair/Brown years miss is the extent to which there seems to have been Cobra-inflation over recent years. Partly because of what happened in the New Labour years, governments discovered that if they wanted to persuade the media they were taking a crisis serious, they had to convene Cobra, journalists started expected Cobra meetings to take place as a matter of course and over time less-urgent Cobra meetings, chaired by officials or ministers, because more common. Richard Benyon, a former junior environment minister under David Cameron, made this point on Twitter yesterday. So the government is correct in saying it is not unusual for the PM not to chair Cobra. But one of the paradoxes of journalism is that it is not unusual for a story to be wrong on a narrow point of detail or interpretation but nevertheless accurate in that it conveys a broader truth. And the Sunday Times Insight report is probably a good example. On 5 March, in an interview about coronavirus, Johnson was still arguing it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d. The evidence that Johnson (like many others, including some government scientists) was slow to grasp the seriousness of the coronavirus threat is strong. Sir Richard Branson has warned that the survival of airline Virgin Atlantic depends on it receiving government support. The Virgin Group boss wrote in a blog post: Together with the team at Virgin Atlantic, we will do everything we can to keep the airline going - but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for. This would be in the form of a commercial loan - it wouldn\u2019t be free money and the airline would pay it back (as easyJet will do for the 600 million loan the government recently gave them). The reality of this unprecedented crisis is that many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it. Without it there won\u2019t be any competition left and hundreds of thousands more jobs will be lost, along with critical connectivity and huge economic value. Tony Blair, the former Labour prime minister, has been giving interviews this morning to promote a report on how to ease the lockdown written by his thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Broadly he has been trying to avoid criticising the government, but in an interview with the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire he got sucked into the argument about whether Boris Johnson was at fault for missing five meetings of the Cobra emergency committee on coronavirus in the early weeks of the crisis. This was the central allegation in a Sunday Times Insight investigation published yesterday (paywall). That prompted the government to publish a 2,000-word rebuttal last night that said, among other things, that the Sunday Times was wrong to say Cobra was normally chaired by the PM. Asked if Johnson should have attended those Cobra meetings, Blair largely avoided the invitation to criticise the PM - although he did insinuate that Johnson might have been somewhat negligent. Blair said: I just don\u2019t want to be in that game because I know how difficult it is for all of them. People ask me: were there any Cobra meetings you missed? The frank answer is I can\u2019t remember at this distance of time. Obviously if you have Cobra it\u2019s because it is a serious emergency. I\u2019m sure the people in government have been doing everything they possibly can. I think the most important thing is not who\u2019s doing their job well and who\u2019s doing it badly, it\u2019s whether you have the right combination of skill at the centre of government to handle some of these things. But Derbyshire came back to the topic towards the end of what was a long interview, and this time she did get Blair to come out with a more direct criticism. He said: If you talk to people in government themselves, I think what they would say is in the period of the initial start of the disease, in the period in other words between the start of the disease and the suppression, I think most people would accept the government was somewhat behind the curve. It is easy to say that with hindsight, but I think people probably accept that, even in government. Scotland\u2019s emergency hospital for Covid-19 patients, the NHS Louisa Jordan, will be ready to receive patients from today after construction on the \u00a343m facility was finished. The facility was built in around 18 days in exhibition halls at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow, and will initially offer 300 beds with the potential to expand capacity to 1,036 beds. Although the majority of emergency coronavirus hospitals in the UK are named after Florence Nightingale, a pioneer of professional nursing who ran field hospitals in the Crimean War, the Scottish site is named after a nurse who died treating troops in Serbia in 1915, during a typhus outbreak. Its completion comes amid growing confidence the facility will not be needed as the number of critical cases in Scotland shows signs of plateauing. Although weekend data does not cover all fatalities, it emerged yesterday that 10 more people had died in hospital in Scotland from Covid-19, bringing the death toll to 903. There has been a further drop in the numbers being treated in intensive care, down by eight, to a total yesterday of 174. In all, 1,797 people are in Scottish hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a rise of four. Non-British key workers who are on the coronavirus frontline in the NHS and elsewhere should be granted British citizenship, Plaid Cymru is proposing. In a letter to the home secretary, the Plaid MP Hywel Williams said: Despite their valiant efforts, many key workers who do not hold British citizenship, from doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics, are still living in perpetual uncertainty about whether they can stay in the UK permanently. To add insult to injury, they also face exorbitant application fees. This pandemic has shown that immigrants are a vital part of our society and our economy. It is therefore crucial that the UK government recognises the scale of sacrifice and commitment that key workers are making. The UK government granted the Gurkhas British citizenship rights for their great skill, courage and dignity during some of the most difficult times in history. The coronavirus pandemic is no different. I hope that you will consider this request carefully and give immediate, free citizenship to all key workers who have applied, thereby granting them the honour and recognition they deserve. Williams also pointed out that 25% of UK hospital staff were born overseas. A \u2018good news\u2019 tweet from NHS England At yesterday\u2019s government press conference Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, urged journalists to have \u201ca more adult, and more detailed conversation\u201d about shortages of PPE (personal protective equipment). The government was facing an unprecedented challenge, she said, and much had been achieved. Her comments have angered the Doctors\u2019 Association UK, a trade association for doctors. Its chair, Dr Rinesh Parmar said: Doctors have indeed been having both \u2018adult and detailed conversations\u2019 about the sheer lack of personal protective equipment for months, all of which have fallen on deaf ears. Since late February the Doctors\u2019 Association UK and frontline doctors have been sounding the alarm about potential shortages, which have been met with misplaced reassurances that the UK has sufficient supplies. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Boris Johnson is not back at work yet but, as we have reported already (see 7.26am), it is already clear that he is starting to exert a firm grip on the government\u2019s handling of coronavirus. On Saturday the Daily Telegraph ran a story (paywall) quoting an unnamed cabinet minister saying pressure for the lockdown was coming from the public, not from ministers. It said: A third cabinet source said: \u201cThere\u2019s no exit plan at the moment because they don\u2019t want to do anything without the boss\u2019s say so. \u201cNot a huge amount is going on in these cabinet meetings.\u201d The source added: \u201cThey are waiting for the public to change their minds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to go down this route in the first place \u2013 public and media pressure pushed the lockdown, we went with the science. \u201cThe lockdown will only start coming loose when the public wants it to \u2013 not ministers.\u201d Today Steven Swinford in the Times (paywall) says that when Johnson had a meeting with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, and aides at Chequers on Friday (Raab and some advisers were there in person; other officials participated by video conference), the prime minister expressed extreme caution about the idea of lifting the lockdown. Swinford reports: Mr Johnson said that his priority was to help Britain to recover and return to what aides have described as a \u201cnew normal\u201d after the pandemic had passed its peak. He raised concerns that lifting restrictions too soon could result in a \u201csecond peak\u201d and bring another lockdown, with a significant cost to health and the economy. \u201cThe idea that we will be rushing to lift measures is a non-starter,\u201d a government source said. \u201cIf the transmission rate rises significantly we will have to do a harder lockdown again\u201d ... \u201cIt\u2019s a question of how comfortable you are with the virus circulating in the community,\u201d a source said. \u201cEveryone wants the rate of transmission to be below 1 [when one person infects, on average, less than one other person]. But the question is how much lower it should be.\u201d Mr Johnson is concerned that relatively little is known about the effect that easing individual restrictions could have on the transmission rate. Asked about the Times report, Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, effectively confirmed it on the BBC this morning. (See 8.17am.) Downing Street is also giving the story the thumbs up. Asked about this this morning, a No 10 source said: The PM is very concerned about a second peak if we lift the restrictions too soon. The Scottish government is urging Boris Johnson to extend the Brexit transition period by the maximum possible period of two years. Michael Russell, Scotland\u2019s cabinet secretary for Europe, said prolonging the transition until the end of 2022 would allow time to rethink the future relationship with the EU. In a statement he said: The benefits of coordinated European action have never been clearer. An extended transition will keep the UK as close as possible to the EU and provide an opportunity to re-think the future relationship. He also accused the UK government of pushing ahead in talks with the EU without involving the devolved government at Edinburgh. The joint ministerial committee on EU negotiations, which is composed of representatives from the four nations of the UK, has not met since January, Russell said. The voices of all four UK nations must be heard and I am therefore calling for an urgent meeting of the joint ministerial committee (European negotiations) which has the task of overseeing negotiations. Clearly if it does not meet, it cannot oversee. His intervention came as EU and UK negotiators prepared to hold their first-ever negotiations via video link on Monday. This week\u2019s four-day round of talks is only the second set of negotiations on a post-Brexit future. Coronavirus has led to the cancellation of two previous rounds, squeezing an already tight timetable to forge a wide-ranging deal on trade and security by the end of the year. Dowden also defended Boris Johnson\u2019s failure to attend five Cobra meetings about coronavirus at the start of the outbreak. Asked whether the prime minister\u2019s attendance didn\u2019t matter, Dowden told Today: Bluntly, no, it didn\u2019t because he was he was engaged personally, as the prime minister is through Downing Street with the outcome of those committee meetings. He was constantly being briefed on it. It\u2019s perfectly normal for the prime minister to delegate to the health secretary, or whoever the relevant secretary of state is to chair Cobras. It has been the case in relation to floods and other things in the past and indeed, has happened on the previous governments. This is the normal, proper course of government. Dowden has now rowed back on his earlier suggestion that the delayed PPE shipment will arrive today. Speaking on the Today programme he said the government was only \u201chopeful\u201d that the flight would take off today. He said: The latest information I have is that we are hopeful that the flight will take place this afternoon. But obviously I want to be very cautious about making promises on this that that can\u2019t be kept. There\u2019s some challenges at the Turkish end in terms of getting the relevant paperwork and other related issues but we are very hopeful that later today, we will get that flight from Turkey. Dowden also confirmed that the government wais reluctant to lift the lockdown for fear of sparking a second wave of infections. He told BBC Breakfast: The worst thing we could possibly do would be to prematurely ease the restrictions, and then find a second peak and have to go right back to square one again, potentially with even more draconian measures. Asked when the government might allow mass gathering again, Dowden suggested ministers are considering a staggering an easing of the restrictions. He said: You wouldn\u2019t expect us to permit mass gatherings at a first stage. But I don\u2019t again, I think it\u2019s not going to be helpful to speculate as to what we might do for the simple reason that the evidence is continuing to evolve. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, has cast doubt on the government\u2019s claim that the delayed PPE shipment form Turkey will arrive today. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: As of an hour ago, there is relatively low confidence that will it will arrive today. If it is going to arrive today, it\u2019ll probably arrive very late on in the day. It just illustrates that we need to be careful about focusing on individual consignments. Bitter experience over the last few weeks has shown than until a consignment of gowns has actually landed, that the boxes have been checked and the equipment\u2019s been tested, the NHS simply can\u2019t count on the gowns being available at the front line. Dowden also backed Labour and union call for a minute\u2019s silence to honour the NHS workers who have died from coronavirus. Dowden, who as culture minister has responsibility for such ceremonies, suggested the government would soon announce that an official minute\u2019s silence will be held. He said: I think it is a very good idea and we are looking into it. As culture secretary I have responsibility for ceremonials and things like minute\u2019s silence. And we are actively looking into that. Asked if it would be an official minute\u2019s silence, Dowden said: \u201cYes I think it could be, but we will make an announcement on that at an appropriate time.\u201d The Labour leader Keir Starmer, responding to the call by Unison, the Royal College of Nursing and Royal College of Midwives for a minute\u2019s silence to honour all workers who have died from coronavirus, said: Our key workers are literally putting their lives on the line in the fight against the coronavirus. They represent the best of us. That is why Labour wholeheartedly supports the call for a minute\u2019s silence in honour of all those on the frontline who have died from coronavirus. The government has said the delayed delivery of PPE from Turkey is due to arrive later today. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said he expected the flight to take off this afternoon. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said he did not want to make further promises after his cabinet colleague Robert Jenrick said the shipment would arrive on Sunday. But Dowden added that it was his understanding the delivery would be made later on Monday. Jenrick promised the shipment would consist of 84 tonnes of PPE, including 400,000 much-needed surgical gowns. Welcome to our UK coronavirus live blog. Boris Johnson is reported to be cautious about easing the lockdown for fear of sparking a second wave of coronavirus infections. According to the Times, the prime minister held a two-hour meeting on Friday with key figures in the government at which he said lifting restrictions too soon could result in a \u201csecond peak\u201d and lead to another lockdown. Meanwhile, hospital leaders have directly attacked the government for the first time during crisis over the shortage of personal protective amid increasing frustration at delays to a promise shipment of PPE from Turkey. And the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has warned that vaccines are \u201clong shots\u201d in the immediate fight against coronavirus. Writing in the Guardian, he said: All new vaccines that come into development are long shots; only some end up being successful, and the whole process requires experimentation. Coronavirus will be no different and presents new challenges for vaccine development. This will take time, and we should be clear it is not a certainty.",

He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to start making more and more promises, but I understand that flight will take off this afternoon and those [gowns] will be delivered.\u201d</p> <p>NHS officials expressed disappointment that the delivery timetable announced by ministers had slipped again, having on Sunday urged the government to avoid making pledges of equipment that it could not be sure of fulfilling. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that having raised expectations about the additional PPE consignment coming from Turkey, there is still no sign of it.</p> <p>\u201cWe have called on the government and national leaders to be careful about announcing information about consignments of PPE from overseas until they know they have arrived, are unpacked and the kit has been checked to ensure it passes our safety tests.\u201d</p> <p>At the Downing Street briefing on Monday afternoon, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, acknowledged the issue, but did not give any further updates on when the gowns might now be received.</p> <p>\u201cWe are working to resolve the Turkish shipment of PPE as soon as possible following some unexpected delays at the weekend,\u201d Sunak said. He noted that 140,000 gowns had arrived from Myanmar and said that \u201cevery possible option\u201d was being explored.</p> <p>Three dozen crew for the mission had been previously told to expect takeoff \u201cin the late afternoon\u201d, according to defence sources. The other planes in the intended transport were another Atlas A400M and a C-17 Globemaster, the largest of the three.</p> <p>Along with many countries, Turkey has banned the export of PPE and other vital medical supplies without government approval, leading to several cases of lengthy delays.</p> <p>The shipment was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/nhs-frontline-staff-may-refuse-to-work-over-lack-of-coronavirus-ppe-says-union-unison\">originally due to arrive on Sunday</a>, the third such shipment to arrive from Turkey this year.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s presidency did not immediately respond to several requests for comment on the reasons behind the delays in allowing the equipment to be picked up.</p> <p>According to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera, an order of 200,000 Turkish-made masks was held up for 17 days last month until Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, raised the matter in a phone call with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p>On 3 April the Spanish government accused Turkey of holding on to a shipment containing dozens of respirators, citing efforts by Turkish officials to shore up their own supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. The shipment was released the next day after Ankara agreed to exempt the cargo from the export ban.</p> <p>Five million masks sold by Turkish companies to Belgium before the export ban were also delayed, leading Belgium\u2019s health ministry to file a criminal complaint.</p> <p>Turkey, a major medical equipment manufacturer, stepped up production when the Covid-19 outbreak reached neighbouring Iran. Turkey did not confirm its first case until 11 March. Since then the rate of infection in the country has become one of the highest in the world.</p> <p>The local news outlet H\u00fcrriyet quoted the interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, as saying authorities would seize factories if companies did not agree to sell medical supplies on an exclusive basis to the health ministry.</p> <p>Ankara has also sent PPE aid shipments to Armenia, Libya, Israel, the Palestinian territories and several Balkan states.</p>",

The plane, one of three that have been waiting to be dispatched to pick up the shipment of 400,000 protective gowns for NHS staff, took off from RAF Brize Norton on Monday despite earlier ministerial assurances that the matter was on the brink of being resolved. By the time the flight took off there was no indication from the Turkish authorities that the equipment had been approved for export. The RAF transport planes have been on standby at Brize Norton for days waiting for the go-ahead to pick up 84 tonnes of urgently needed medical clothing and equipment, including the 400,000 gowns made by Turkish suppliers. With a series of deadlines set by UK ministers missed, the British government has blamed its Turkish counterpart for causing the delays. But after one cabinet minister said the government had hoped the three planes would be able to take off on Monday afternoon, British sources admitted that the Turkish authorities had not confirmed the supplies were ready to be picked up. Instead, the RAF was ordered to put one of the three transport planes \u2013 an Atlas A400M \u2013 into the air in the hope that it would help speed up the process on the ground in Turkey, even though it would not be able to pick up all the ordered equipment on its own. \u201cWe call it pre-positioning,\u201d a military source said.

The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, told the BBC on Monday morning that the delays were down to \u201cchallenges at the Turkish end\u201d but appeared to suggest the issue was about to be resolved. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to start making more and more promises, but I understand that flight will take off this afternoon and those [gowns] will be delivered.\u201d NHS officials expressed disappointment that the delivery timetable announced by ministers had slipped again, having on Sunday urged the government to avoid making pledges of equipment that it could not be sure of fulfilling. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that having raised expectations about the additional PPE consignment coming from Turkey, there is still no sign of it. \u201cWe have called on the government and national leaders to be careful about announcing information about consignments of PPE from overseas until they know they have arrived, are unpacked and the kit has been checked to ensure it passes our safety tests.\u201d At the Downing Street briefing on Monday afternoon, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, acknowledged the issue, but did not give any further updates on when the gowns might now be received. \u201cWe are working to resolve the Turkish shipment of PPE as soon as possible following some unexpected delays at the weekend,\u201d Sunak said. He noted that 140,000 gowns had arrived from Myanmar and said that \u201cevery possible option\u201d was being explored. Three dozen crew for the mission had been previously told to expect takeoff \u201cin the late afternoon\u201d, according to defence sources. The other planes in the intended transport were another Atlas A400M and a C-17 Globemaster, the largest of the three. Along with many countries, Turkey has banned the export of PPE and other vital medical supplies without government approval, leading to several cases of lengthy delays. The shipment was originally due to arrive on Sunday, the third such shipment to arrive from Turkey this year. Turkey\u2019s presidency did not immediately respond to several requests for comment on the reasons behind the delays in allowing the equipment to be picked up. According to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera, an order of 200,000 Turkish-made masks was held up for 17 days last month until Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, raised the matter in a phone call with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. On 3 April the Spanish government accused Turkey of holding on to a shipment containing dozens of respirators, citing efforts by Turkish officials to shore up their own supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. The shipment was released the next day after Ankara agreed to exempt the cargo from the export ban. Five million masks sold by Turkish companies to Belgium before the export ban were also delayed, leading Belgium\u2019s health ministry to file a criminal complaint. Turkey, a major medical equipment manufacturer, stepped up production when the Covid-19 outbreak reached neighbouring Iran. Turkey did not confirm its first case until 11 March. Since then the rate of infection in the country has become one of the highest in the world. The local news outlet H\u00fcrriyet quoted the interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, as saying authorities would seize factories if companies did not agree to sell medical supplies on an exclusive basis to the health ministry. Ankara has also sent PPE aid shipments to Armenia, Libya, Israel, the Palestinian territories and several Balkan states.",

The deadline triggered a collapse in prices as desperate oil traders with more crude than storage space were forced to take action.</p> \n<p>Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-winning oil historian, said: \u201cThe May crude oil contract is going out not with a whimper, but a primal scream.\u201d</p> \n<p>The price of oil from the US shale heartlands has been declining steadily in recent weeks following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/oil-prices-slump-as-market-faces-lowest-demand-in-25-years-covid-19\">the biggest slump in oil demand for 25 years</a> steps due to restrictions on travel to curb the spread of Covid-19. The fall accelerated amid rising fears that the global economy may be facing its deepest downturn since the Great Depression.</p> \n<p>Oil producers have continued to pump near-record levels of crude into the global market even as analysts warned that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak would drive oil demand to its lowest levels since 1995. The emergence of negative oil prices is expected to prompt some oil companies to hasten the shutdown of their rigs and oil wells to avoid plunging deeper into debt or bankruptcy.</p> \n<p>The collapse will come as a blow to US President Donald Trump who took credit for brokering a historic deal between the Opec oil cartel and the world\u2019s largest oil producing nations to limit the flood of oil production into the market. The pact to cut between 10 million and 20 million barrels of oil from the market from next month was dismissed by many within the market as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d to avoid a market crash.</p> \n<p>At his daily White House briefing, Trump described the negative price as a \u201cshort-term problem\u201d. He said the US was filling up its strategic reserves: \u201cIf we could buy it for nothing, we\u2019re gonna take everything we can get,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8d3b7c2a-3328-472b-bf78-e277fe57ac8a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DbP_LVSZl2g?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-20T19:18:52/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph: US oil prices since 1983\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-20T19:18:52/embed.html\">Graph: US oil prices since 1983</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The Guardian reported over the weekend that a record 160m barrels of oil was being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/19/supertankers-drafted-in-to-store-glut-of-crude-oil-coronavirus\">stored in \u201csupergiant\u201d oil tankers outside the world\u2019s largest shipping ports</a>, including in the US Gulf. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover.</p> \n<p>Historically weak oil markets are likely to bring lower prices for drivers at service station forecourts, but the price collapse will also hurt pension savings which are often invested in major oil companies through funds which track equity markets. The oil price crisis has already wiped billions from the market value of the largest oil companies, many of which will not be able to pay dividends if the market rout drags on.</p> \n<p>Brett Fleishman, from climate campaign group at 350.org, said the collapse of oil prices is \u201canother powerful example of how fossil fuels are too volatile to be the basis of a resilient economy\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are experiencing an unparalleled upending in our economies. And it is time for the fossil fuel industry to recognize that, from now on, the cheapest and best place to store oil is in the ground,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile this recession shows us that we desperately need sustainable, resilient, and stable economic systems, based on renewable, accessible and just energy sources, the fossil fuel industry is not only trying to profit off of the current chaos, but continues to drive us further into climate breakdown,\u201d Fleishman added.</p> \n<p>Oil prices began to rise again on Tuesday as oil traders turn their attention to trading oil for delivery in June.</p> \n<p>The US oil market - known in the industry as the West Texas Intermediate price - is expected to trade above $20 a barrel this week, recovering from its slump into negative territory. The international oil price benchmark, known as Brent crude, is trading at around $26 a barrel.</p> \n<p>The recovery is expected to pick up over the second half of the year as tight restrictions on travel to help curb the spread of the virus are lifted, raising demand for fuels and oil. At the same time supply is expected to dwindle due to the historic deal to limit oil production and the financial collapse of weaker oil companies.</p> \n<p>However, most analysts believe that oil prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/13/historic-oil-production-cuts-slump-demand-goldman-sachs-coronavirus\">will fail to reach the same price levels</a> recorded at the beginning of the year before the outbreak. Brent crude reached highs of almost $69 a barrel in January before plummeting to less than $23 a barrel at the end of March. Many market experts predict the price of Brent will remain below $50 a barrel this year.</p>",

The price of US crude oil crashed from $18 a barrel to -$38 in a matter of hours, as rising stockpiles of crude threatened to overwhelm storage facilities and forcedoil producers to pay buyers to take the barrels they could not store. The market crash underlined the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on oil demand as the global economy slumps. On Tuesday prices rebounded above above zero, with the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May changing hands at $1.10 a barrel after closing at -$37.63 in New York on Monday. The rapid market decline of recent weeks had reached fever pitch on Monday as traders reached their last day to trade oil for delivery in May before the contracts expire. The deadline triggered a collapse in prices as desperate oil traders with more crude than storage space were forced to take action. Daniel Yergin, a Pulitzer-winning oil historian, said: \u201cThe May crude oil contract is going out not with a whimper, but a primal scream.\u201d The price of oil from the US shale heartlands has been declining steadily in recent weeks following the biggest slump in oil demand for 25 years steps due to restrictions on travel to curb the spread of Covid-19. The fall accelerated amid rising fears that the global economy may be facing its deepest downturn since the Great Depression. Oil producers have continued to pump near-record levels of crude into the global market even as analysts warned that the impact of the coronavirus outbreak would drive oil demand to its lowest levels since 1995. The emergence of negative oil prices is expected to prompt some oil companies to hasten the shutdown of their rigs and oil wells to avoid plunging deeper into debt or bankruptcy. The collapse will come as a blow to US President Donald Trump who took credit for brokering a historic deal between the Opec oil cartel and the world\u2019s largest oil producing nations to limit the flood of oil production into the market. The pact to cut between 10 million and 20 million barrels of oil from the market from next month was dismissed by many within the market as \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d to avoid a market crash. At his daily White House briefing, Trump described the negative price as a \u201cshort-term problem\u201d. He said the US was filling up its strategic reserves: \u201cIf we could buy it for nothing, we\u2019re gonna take everything we can get,\u201d he said. The Guardian reported over the weekend that a record 160m barrels of oil was being stored in \u201csupergiant\u201d oil tankers outside the world\u2019s largest shipping ports, including in the US Gulf. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover. Historically weak oil markets are likely to bring lower prices for drivers at service station forecourts, but the price collapse will also hurt pension savings which are often invested in major oil companies through funds which track equity markets. The oil price crisis has already wiped billions from the market value of the largest oil companies, many of which will not be able to pay dividends if the market rout drags on. Brett Fleishman, from climate campaign group at 350.org, said the collapse of oil prices is \u201canother powerful example of how fossil fuels are too volatile to be the basis of a resilient economy\u201d. \u201cWe are experiencing an unparalleled upending in our economies. And it is time for the fossil fuel industry to recognize that, from now on, the cheapest and best place to store oil is in the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile this recession shows us that we desperately need sustainable, resilient, and stable economic systems, based on renewable, accessible and just energy sources, the fossil fuel industry is not only trying to profit off of the current chaos, but continues to drive us further into climate breakdown,\u201d Fleishman added. Oil prices began to rise again on Tuesday as oil traders turn their attention to trading oil for delivery in June. The US oil market - known in the industry as the West Texas Intermediate price - is expected to trade above $20 a barrel this week, recovering from its slump into negative territory. The international oil price benchmark, known as Brent crude, is trading at around $26 a barrel. The recovery is expected to pick up over the second half of the year as tight restrictions on travel to help curb the spread of the virus are lifted, raising demand for fuels and oil. At the same time supply is expected to dwindle due to the historic deal to limit oil production and the financial collapse of weaker oil companies. However, most analysts believe that oil prices will fail to reach the same price levels recorded at the beginning of the year before the outbreak. Brent crude reached highs of almost $69 a barrel in January before plummeting to less than $23 a barrel at the end of March. Many market experts predict the price of Brent will remain below $50 a barrel this year.",

      "bodyText": "Parliament\u2019s spending watchdog has launched an inquiry into purchases of commercial property by local authorities, amid fears that the coronavirus pandemic will expose councils to a drop in income from their investments. The public accounts committee will look into whether local government officials have the commercial skills required for such transactions, which have rocketed over the past four years. MPs will also question officials from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government over how much they monitor commercial activity among local authorities and their exposure to risk. Local authorities have been on a shopping spree in recent years, buying up property such as shopping centres and office buildings as a means of increasing their revenues and to offset the impact of austerity measures introduced in 2010. A recent report from the National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises government spending, found that local authorities spent an estimated \u00a36.6bn on commercial property from 2016-17 to 2018-19, compared with \u00a3460m during the preceding three years. The pandemic is expected to create a hole in councils\u2019 budgets due to a huge shortfall in council tax income, along with lost revenues from missed parking and leisure fees during the coronavirus lockdown. Ministers are expected to provide English councils with a \u00a31bn bailout to prevent several of them from collapsing into insolvency due to soaring costs related to the coronavirus crisis, such as for providing extra social care and housing rough sleepers during the lockdown. Even before the government lockdown created uncertainty about local authorities\u2019 income, the NAO report warned of the risks associated with commercial property, which could leave councils badly exposed by a recession or property crash. \u201cIncome from commercial property is uncertain over the long term and authorities may be taking on high levels of long-term debt with associated debt costs,\u201d the NAO said. Councils have been able to access low-cost funding from the government\u2019s public works board, but critics argue it has caused them to bid higher amounts for property, and in some cases overpay. Spelthorne council in Surrey, a tiny Conservative-controlled authority, has used these Treasury-backed loans to build a \u00a31bn property portfolio, despite its annual operating budget of \u00a322m. The council said last year that income from commercial property allowed it to offset \u00a32.5m of government grants cuts, and raised more income than council tax. Shropshire council has previously been criticised for spending \u00a351m on three shopping centres in Shrewsbury, all of which had fallen in value by almost a quarter even before the pandemic. However, the council countered that the fall in value was not a major concern and the assets would guarantee some annual income and enable redevelopment, to make Shrewsbury town centre more attractive. A spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents English and Welsh councils, said: \u201cCouncils have faced a choice of either accepting funding reductions and cutting services \u2013 such as care for older and disabled people, protecting children, reducing homelessness, fixing roads and collecting bins \u2013 or making investments to try and protect them.\u201d Fears over council\u2019s property investments are being replicated across the continent.

It was designed \u2013 after Britain watched West Germany\u2019s hapless response to the 1972 Munich hostage crisis \u2013 to give a cross-government focus on an emergency incident, a terror attack or a mass-casualty disaster. Officials say it is not part of the normal Whitehall machine.</p> \n<p>Some of its meetings, which tend to be hardly reported, are attended only by civil servants. Others are chaired by departmental ministers \u2013 Amber Rudd, when home secretary, chaired a Cobra meeting during the Skripal crisis, for instance. The presence of the prime minister is by no means necessary, although in each case the decision to hold a lower-level meeting should have been signed off by No 10.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully.

The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The system is designed to be resilient, so in theory it does not matter who chairs it: the brief is so detailed for whoever takes the meeting that they can lead the ministers and officials present \u201chowever stressed they are\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It was David Cameron who expanded the Cobra emergency planning system when he was prime minister, telling officials he wanted to be \u201cone step ahead\u201d of crisis events. His successor, Theresa May, was reluctant use it at first because she disliked a structure that had been used to assert authority over the Home Office she once ran. The charge against Boris Johnson is that he did not want to turn up at all, skipping five Cobra meetings that discussed coronavirus in January and February and only chairing his first on 3 March, several weeks after the scale of the crisis had become apparent. Situated in the basement of the Cabinet Office, not far from Churchill\u2019s war rooms, the Cobra suite of meeting rooms is the closest thing to a White House situation room that Whitehall has. Holding a Cobra meeting in front of the bank of screens conveys urgent action like nothing else in British politics. Civil servants caution that Cobra is not necessarily at the heart of how British government should be run. It was designed \u2013 after Britain watched West Germany\u2019s hapless response to the 1972 Munich hostage crisis \u2013 to give a cross-government focus on an emergency incident, a terror attack or a mass-casualty disaster. Officials say it is not part of the normal Whitehall machine. Some of its meetings, which tend to be hardly reported, are attended only by civil servants. Others are chaired by departmental ministers \u2013 Amber Rudd, when home secretary, chaired a Cobra meeting during the Skripal crisis, for instance. The presence of the prime minister is by no means necessary, although in each case the decision to hold a lower-level meeting should have been signed off by No 10. The system is designed to be resilient, so in theory it does not matter who chairs it: the brief is so detailed for whoever takes the meeting that they can lead the ministers and officials present \u201chowever stressed they are\u201d. As the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said: \u201cIt is perfectly normal for the prime minister to delegate to the health secretary, or whoever the relevant secretary of state is, to chair Cobra. This is a normal, proper course of government.\u201d But as Gordon Brown\u2019s former press aide Damian McBride pointed out over the weekend, during a foot and mouth crisis in 2007, Brown \u201cdidn\u2019t just attend every Cobra meeting, he chaired them all\u201d. That may have said a lot about Brown\u2019s approach to running government, to the point where he micromanaged detail, but it also showed a prime minister ready to engage with the issue at hand. Chairing a Cobra meeting is a prime minister\u2019s choice, former officials say, and it is one way of highlighting the need for an early cross-government focus on a crisis such as coronavirus. Instead the government has repeatedly looked like it is behind the curve, as shown by the desperate attempts to ramp up testing, the calls for ventilator manufacturers to come forward, and the struggles to ensure there is enough protective equipment for NHS staff.",

      "body": "<p>These are the weirdest of times. Oil prices, which during the last crisis hit $147 a barrel, have just turned negative. That\u2019s right. Crude is so cheap they are giving it away.</p> <p>So much for the idea of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">top</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/10/opec-russia-reduce-oil-production-prop-up-prices\">-level deal</a> to put a floor under oil prices. Little more than a week ago, all the talk from Donald Trump was of how he had banged heads together and forced Russia and Saudi Arabia into production curbs that would bring global supplies of crude more into line with demand. On Monday night, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund\">price of US benchmark crude </a>was -$38 a barrel.</p> <p>The reason for an unprecedented one-day collapse in the price is partly technical. Crude for June delivery is trading at more than $20 a barrel. That said, the chances of a binding deal always looked fanciful. The oil cartel Opec does not have the power it once wielded, even when the group is expanded to include Russia. </p> <p>The west\u2019s shutdown means oil demand has plummeted. There are supertankers out at sea full to the brim with crude at a time when storage facilities \u2013 especially in the US \u2013 are close to capacity. The number of active US rigs has fallen by 35% in the past month, because many are now uneconomic.</p> <p>The cost of crude will eventually start to rise again, but not because of Trump\u2019s browbeating, nor because of a Moscow-Riyadh deal, but because there is a more powerful force at work: the price mechanism.</p> <h2>Sunak\u2019s startup support scheme responds to a real threat</h2> <p>Rishi Sunak\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">decision to support innovative start</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-rishi-sunak-offers-fast-growing-uk-companies-125bn-in-loans\">up companies</a> is the latest example of political cross-dressing by the government. First it was higher public spending, then it was stepping in to subsidise jobs.

      "bodyText": "These are the weirdest of times. Oil prices, which during the last crisis hit $147 a barrel, have just turned negative. That\u2019s right. Crude is so cheap they are giving it away. So much for the idea of a top-level deal to put a floor under oil prices. Little more than a week ago, all the talk from Donald Trump was of how he had banged heads together and forced Russia and Saudi Arabia into production curbs that would bring global supplies of crude more into line with demand. On Monday night, the price of US benchmark crude was -$38 a barrel. The reason for an unprecedented one-day collapse in the price is partly technical. Crude for June delivery is trading at more than $20 a barrel. That said, the chances of a binding deal always looked fanciful. The oil cartel Opec does not have the power it once wielded, even when the group is expanded to include Russia. The west\u2019s shutdown means oil demand has plummeted. There are supertankers out at sea full to the brim with crude at a time when storage facilities \u2013 especially in the US \u2013 are close to capacity. The number of active US rigs has fallen by 35% in the past month, because many are now uneconomic. The cost of crude will eventually start to rise again, but not because of Trump\u2019s browbeating, nor because of a Moscow-Riyadh deal, but because there is a more powerful force at work: the price mechanism. Sunak\u2019s startup support scheme responds to a real threat Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to support innovative startup companies is the latest example of political cross-dressing by the government. First it was higher public spending, then it was stepping in to subsidise jobs. Now it is the ultimate throwback to the 1970s: picking winners. Under the chancellor\u2019s new scheme, the government will provide loans to companies in which private investors have already put money. If the loans can\u2019t be repaid, the Treasury will pick up an equity stake at a knockdown price, providing a potential upside for the taxpayer if the company does \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 come up with the latest big thing in artificial intelligence or a treatment for Covid-19. The evidence from the flurry of Treasury action since the UK went into lockdown suggests it is wise to study the detail before making a judgment on a scheme\u2019s merit. But notwithstanding the need to study the small print, Sunak\u2019s decision to intervene is welcome. For decades the idea that the government could second-guess the markets and identify companies with growth potential has been a term of political abuse in the UK, but what happened 40 or 50 years ago was not really about picking winners so much as bailing out losers. The case for providing financial support for innovative firms is strong, not least because many of them are startups, and so don\u2019t qualify for help under the other packages the chancellor has announced. Even in the best of times, companies that tend to burn through cash quickly and are some distance away from making a profit can find life challenging. There are plenty of reasons for that: banks that are unwilling to lend; a much less developed venture capital industry than in the US; a longstanding difficulty in turning ideas into commercial products. Sunak, with his background in the hedge fund industry, has taken personal interest in the package for innovative firms, and it is right that the chancellor is responding to the very real threat that the firms of the future will be decimated by the pandemic. This is a high-risk sector and there will be companies that go bust, taking the state\u2019s money with them. Sunak has sought to guard against that by insisting government money be matched by private investment. If there is a quibble, it is about the fact that he has initially only pledged \u00a3250m to the Future Fund, and that may not be enough.",

Local television images on Monday showed hundreds of families, including young children, trekking along highways with their belongings on their backs as they made long journeys to family homes. Poor Peruvians have been trying to leave Lima since last week, many saying they had to choose between hunger or homelessness in the city or risking exposure to Covid-19 as they attempt to return home. \u201cHere in Lima there are no longer any jobs, there is no longer any way to pay for food, we do not have any more savings,\u201d Maricela de la Cruz told the Associated Press. \u201cWe have done everything possible to stay the 30 quarantine days.

While the Brazilian leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has consistently flouted social distancing rules and downplayed the Covid-19 pandemic, Vizcarra is widely seen by Peruvians to have reacted decisively to the pandemic, deploying troops and the police to enforce a lockdown and a nightly curfew. Vizcarra said on Monday that the weeks ahead would be the most difficult and would require \u201ceveryone\u2019s highest capacity to respond\u201d. \u201cThe number of patients is close to exceeding the capacity of the health service,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 21 April. Top stories Australia has recorded its lowest daily increase in Covid-19 cases since early March. But half of Australian voters think it\u2019s too early to consider easing coronavirus-related restrictions. Thousands of jobs are at risk with Virgin Australia set to go into voluntary administration \u2013 the biggest airline collapse in Australia since Ansett failed in 2002. A group of 13 Aboriginal organisations from across the Northern Territory say people in remote communities are running out of fresh food and other essential items because local stores can\u2019t source enough supplies. A report found dozens of Victorians have felt \u201cintimidated\u201d, \u201cfearful\u201d and \u201cdiscriminated against\u201d after being targeted by police enforcing the state\u2019s lockdown laws. And Peter Lewis has analysed whether Australians trust the federal government enough to download its coronavirus tracing app. US oil prices have just turned negative for the first time on record, as North American producers run out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic. A top infectious diseases official in the US has warned there could be a surge in cases if states move too quickly to lift restrictions. Dr Anthony Fauci said real economic recovery is not going to happen unless the virus is under control. The US has recorded more than 40,000 Covid-19 deaths as small rural hospitals find it difficult to obtain personal protective equipment. Countries around the world are considering easing coronavirus restrictions but the prospect of a \u201csecond wave\u201d has many experts concerned. The death rate from Covid-19 continues to fall in Spain, and infections fell in Italy for the first time since the beginning of its outbreak. But the UK is still in the grip of the worst of it, recording 449 deaths overnight. Questions about Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership at the outset of the crisis remain. More than 140,000 firms have applied for help from the UK government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme. A World Health Organisation study has found only a tiny proportion of people display no symptoms after being infected. Australia Labor and the Greens will push to disallow a proposed change by the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, that would allow employers to change workers\u2019 conditions with little notice. The new regulation would allow employers to provide just 24 hours\u2019 notice to change to pay, hours, leave and penalty rates. There\u2019s fresh hope about saving Kangaroo Island\u2019s dunnart from extinction after the tiny marsupial was caught on camera in a new location. The unique mouse-like species lost more than 90% of its habitat in the January bushfires. Malcolm Turnbull says Tony Abbott\u2019s \u201canti-Muslim\u201d rhetoric while PM was dangerous. Turnbull accused his predecessor of inflaming animosity against Muslims in a wide-ranging interview with ABC\u2019s 7.30. The world The death toll in a mass shooting in Nova Scotia in Canada has been revised upwards to 18 people, including the gunman. It\u2019s the country\u2019s deadliest mass shooting, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police believe the figure could rise. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his main rival, Benny Gantz, have agreed to form a national unity government, ending a year-long political crisis that has seen the country hold three back-to-back elections. Court documents have revealed text messages showing Harry and Meghan repeatedly tried to make contact with her estranged father in the days before their wedding in early 2018. The Duchess of Sussex is suing the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for alleged invasion of privacy, breach of copyright and misuse of personal data. Recommended reads Wendy Syfret wants you to watch The Bold Type. The optimistic and hopeful show offers a \u201ccandy-coloured\u201d view of life for three millennial women who work in magazine publishing (one played by Australian actor Aisha Dee). \u201cBefore, it was often frustrating to see your reality romanticised and warped. But as that reality recedes into the past, it has become comforting to revisit some version of it,\u201d she writes. In a time of social distancing and almost-constant crisis, a rose-coloured reality has its charms. Israeli historian and author Yuval Noah Harari believes coronavirus won\u2019t change our attitude to death. He writes that scientific and technological revolutions have made humans so successful at prolonging life that our worldview has profoundly changed: \u201cFor most of history, humans meekly submitted to death. Up to the late modern age, most religions and ideologies saw death not only as our inevitable fate, but as the main source of meaning in life.\u201d There\u2019s much to love about the humble toastie, now more than ever. Working from home lunch? Toastie. Cooking as part of a home-school curriculum? Toastie. One of those bread loaves you baked to stave off existential dread is actually edible? Toastie. Here are 10 recipes for melted delight, ranging from the classic (ham and cheese) to the adventurous (content warning: haggis). Listen On Full Story today is the story behind Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cmiracle\u201d drug: hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been used to treat malaria and other diseases for 65 years. It\u2019s been hailed by some, including the US president, as a Covid-19 cure, but there\u2019s scant evidence it is effective. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

Prof Jodie McVernon, director of Doherty Epidemiology, told the ABC\u2019s Q+A program on Monday she was concerned there was \u201cdogma out there\u201d that a vaccine for the virus could be found within a year to 18 months. McVernon said there were \u201cno certainties here\u201d and while she hoped a vaccine could be found \u201cit isn\u2019t a guarantee\u201d. She said: \u201cThat\u2019s why this needs to be a much more nuanced discussion about how we learn to live with this new virus, how we adapt to it over time, how we mitigate its risks and harms, how we keep looking for new therapies and other treatments that might reduce the death toll \u2026 and hoping for a vaccine, but being aware it may not come. That is important.\u201d In a discussion about \u201cherd immunity\u201d, McVernon said a \u201clet it rip\u201d strategy that some have advocated for was \u201cclearly not going to be our policy\u201d in Australia. But she explained while herd immunity was a way to achieve a long-term level of protection in society either by vaccine or by infection, \u201cwe don\u2019t know whether a single exposure to [Covid-19] is enough to be in the clear forever\u201d. She said: \u201cI think we need to understand much more about the biology of the virus before we would feel that was a safe outcome, even given the undesirable path to getting there.\u201d She called for a \u201cmore nuanced\u201d discussion about the way Australia and the world may have to live with the virus if a vaccine couldn\u2019t be developed quickly. In a seperate discussion, just hours before the program went to air, reports emerged that Virgin Australia was about to go into administration, putting thousands of jobs at risk. Sally McManus, secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, asked why governments could not buy a stake in the airline to help secure the jobs and then sell the equity at a later date. She said even though governments have always said they should not be \u201cin the business of picking winners\u201d, the pandemic was \u201ca good reason to suspend these normal orthodoxies\u201d. \u201c[Governments] don\u2019t want to interfere in the market. But the market has stopped. It\u2019s been shut. All the airlines have had to be grounded, not because of some market failure or business decisions, it\u2019s been because of the pandemic.\u201d Neville Power, chairman of the government\u2019s advisory group the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission, said Australia needed to \u201cmake sure that we have two competitive airlines\u201d. He said while the commission did have a role to play, it was too early to say what the best approach would be. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of work going on behind the scenes to understand the issues, the specific issues that are facing Virgin and for that matter all the airlines, and to work out what\u2019s the best approach to that. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget Virgin has some very powerful major shareholders that can also be contributing to this. It\u2019s not just down to government. \u201cAnd I think under the right conditions, then Virgin can be maintained and kept as a second airline in Australia. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fully played out yet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Confirmed global death toll approaches 170,000 According to Johns Hopkins University, at least 169,794 people have died and 2,468,733 have been infected since the outbreak began. By far the greatest number of cases has been recorded in the US, which has reported 782,159. Spain, Italy, France, Germany and the UK have also recorded more than 100,000 cases each. The figures are likely to underestimate the true scale of the outbreak due to suspected underreporting and differing testing regimes. Oil prices fall to historic lows The US oil market has collapsed into negative prices for the first time in history as North America\u2019s oil producers ran out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic. The price of US crude oil fell by more than 105% as rising stockpiles threatened to overwhelm oil storage facilities. This is the lowest level since futures contracts began trading in 1983. UK hospital deaths total rises by 449 The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care said 16,509 people had died in UK hospitals since the outbreak began, an increase of 449 on the day before. A total of 386,044 people have been tested, of whom 124,743 have tested positive. WHO chief says \u2018nothing hidden from US\u2019 Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said the body wants \u201call countries to get the same message immediately because that helps countries to prepare well and to prepare quickly\u201d, after criticism from the US president Donald Trump over the timeliness of its warnings about the pandemic. US anti-lockdown rallies \u2018could cause Covid-19 surge\u2019 As healthcare workers in the states of Colorado and Pennsylvania stage counter-protests against rightwing anti-quarantine rallies that continue to spread across the US, some experts have warned such rallies could cause a surge in cases. Several nurses gathered in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Monday, where a protest against stay-at-home orders was taking place. The nurses carried signs urging people to go home. Spain\u2019s death rate continues to fall The country reported 399 deaths in 24 hours, lower than Sunday\u2019s figure of 410. A total of 20,852 people have died in Spain, with over 200,000 infected and more than 80,000 cured. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is expected to ask parliament to extend the national lockdown until 11 May. Italy sees fall in infections For the first time since the outbreak began, Italy announced a fall in the number of people currently infected \u2013 down 20 to 108,237. It said 454 more people had died, 21 more than the previous day, bringing the death toll to 24,114. \u201cThis is positive data as it shows the number of people who are currently positive with the virus is declining,\u201d Angelo Borrelli, the chief of Italy\u2019s civil protection authority, told reporters.",

It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.</p>\n    <p>While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is the WHO under fire from Trump?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump has presented the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/against-humanity-trump-condemned-for-who-funding-freeze\">freezing of US funding to the WHO</a>&nbsp;as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. The allegation that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. And the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/10/trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus-state-department-usaid-budget-cuts/\">when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution</a>&nbsp;by half.</p>\n    <p>The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus. While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 the potential for a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a>&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">study carried out in Santa Clara, California</a> by Stanford University and released as a \u201cpre-print\u201d without peer review, found that 50 to 85 times more people had been infected with the virus than official figures showed.</p> \n<p>Santa Clara county had 1,094 confirmed cases of Covid-19 at the time the study was carried out, but antibody tests suggest that between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected by early April, most of whom did not develop symptoms.</p> \n<p>But even those high figures mean that within the whole population of the county, only 3% have been infected and have antibodies to the virus.

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the intelligence agency, has launched the suspicious email reporting service with a simple request of the public: forward any dubious emails to <a href=\"mailto:report@phishing.gov.uk\">report@phishing.gov.uk</a>, and the NCSC\u2019s automated scanning system will check for scam emails and immediately remove criminal sites.</p> \n<p>\u201cTechnology is helping us cope with the coronavirus crisis and will play a role helping us out of it, but that means cybersecurity is more important than ever,\u201d said Ciaran Martin, chief executive officer of the NCSC. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have created a new national reporting service for suspicious emails \u2013 and if they link to malicious content, it will be taken down or blocked.

      "bodyText": "Short-eared owls, curlews and mountain hares have returned to Yorkshire moorland that was devastated by fire a year ago, the National Trust has said. Rangers feared whole populations of rare animals were wiped out when about 700 hectares (1,730 acres) of peatland habitat on Marsden Moor in West Yorkshire were scorched in April 2019 in a blaze that was started by a disposable barbecue and took fire crews four days to put out. National Trust staff worked through the winter to repair the habitat for wildlife and to put in place measures to prevent future fires from spreading, helped by \u00a3100,000 from a public fundraising appeal. Recent sightings of rare birds that nest on the ground, such as curlew and skylarks, as well as sightings of mountain hares over the winter have raised hopes for rangers that there were more survivors than feared from the fire. But the trust said the threat of fire remained, and it urged the public and landowners to take care during the dry weather at a time when fire services are stretched by coronavirus. Fire services have already issued warnings to members of the public to take care if exercising on moors, and to landowners not to carry out controlled burning, which is often used on grouse moors to boost conditions for red grouse. The National Trust said that in the last month alone, three separate fires had broken out on or near the south Pennines moor. To defend against wildfires, the trust said it had taken steps to \u201cre-wet\u201d the peat to curb fires and help tackle climate change by ensuring the peatland soils are storing carbon. Rangers and volunteers have planted tens of thousands of sphagnum moss plugs, built leaky dams to hold water on the moor, and cut vegetation breaks near car parks and alongside roads to stop fire from spreading. Tom Harman, the lead ranger at Marsden Moor, said: \u201cIt\u2019s really positive to see wildlife returning to Marsden Moor after everything that happened last year. Many hands made it happen and they have worked so hard. \u201cBut while the landscape might appear to have recovered, it\u2019s just one kind of grass that has grown back \u2013 no heather, no moss, no flowers.\u201d He added: \u201cAfter several smaller fires already this spring, we know the risk of another big fire hasn\u2019t gone away.

In revealing more detail of a previously announced plan to have students return from week three of term two, the premier said: \u201cDefinitely from May 11 \u2026 students will start going back to school.\u201d Schools will have additional cleaning protocols and may even have temperature checks for children. \u201cInitially, it will just be a day a week,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cAnd then progressively two days, and then we hope by the end of term two we\u2019ll be in a position to have students going back to school in a full-time capacity by term three.\u201d NSW is in the final week of Easter holidays. The first week of term two was to be next Monday, 27 April. Berejiklian stressed it would be months before schools returned to normal operation. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure we\u2019ve used this time not just to build up our online capacity, in case children, or a proportion of them do need to continue learning from home, but we\u2019ve also made sure we have enough hand sanitisers, soap and all those things which make a school community feel safe, not just be safe. \u201cSchools will also have capacity for temperature checks where they think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d The state\u2019s education minister, Sarah Mitchell, paid tribute to schoolteachers and principals for managing the transition to remote learning during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic: \u201cTheir innovation and the work that they have done to move learning to at home and online has been phenomenal.\u201d The minister said while the government had outlined a broad plan to return schools to full capacity by term three, individual schools would be given \u201cflexibility and discretion\u201d as to how to implement their returns. \u201cWe want them to make sure they are having about a quarter of students on campus each day, but how they break that group up will be a matter for them. \u201cBut we are asking them to certainly consider family groupings, keeping siblings together, so that that will make it a lot easier for parents as we transition back to normal schooling.\u201d Mitchell said extra measures would be taken to protect students and staff. \u201cWe will have extra cleaning, extra sanitiser, extra health provisions, including forehead thermometers, and also extra health equipment in our sick bays. And we\u2019ll also be asking parents to stagger drop-off and pick-up times, and recess and lunch breaks within our schools.\u201d Queensland began term two on Monday, with the state government\u2019s new online learning portal overwhelmed by 1.8 million students trying to access it. The system crashed after just 30 minutes and remained down on Tuesday morning. Only 12% of students in the state physically attended school on Monday, with the rest trying to learn from home. Victorian schools are set to remain closed until the end of term two, but the premier, Daniel Andrews, said those restrictions might be eased if Covid-19 cases remained stable and new infections low. \u201cIf we were continuing to see very stable numbers \u2026 then of course we would always reserve the right to look at those restrictions.\u201d In Western Australia, the government has said schools will be open for all children from the start of term two on 29 April but attendance will be voluntary. \u201cAll parents and carers can choose to send their children,\u201d said the premier, Mark McGowan. \u201cIf parents don\u2019t feel comfortable sending their kids to school, for whatever reason, they will not be obligated to do so. \u201cHowever, year 11 and 12 students are very strongly encouraged to attend.\u201d McGowan said the plan for term two would be reviewed at the end of week three.",

And when faced with a pandemic, the government sprung into action earlier than anywhere else in India.</p> \n  <p>Health minister, KK Shailaja, who swiftly earned the nickname \u201cCoronavirus Slayer\u201d, was the first in the country to assemble a taskforce in mid-February to begin aggressively contact tracing, testing and quarantining any possible cases. The state also closed all schools, restaurants and banned gatherings before any other and began setting up public sinks and hand sanitiser dispensers in public places, even at bus stops. The state has one of the highest testing rates in India, though it has also faced a shortage of testing kits.</p> \n  <p>And when prime minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24 with four hours notice, causing havoc for the millions of migrant workers stuck thousands of miles from home. The Kerala authorities set up camps and provided provisions for their three million \u201cguest workers\u201d, preventing the dangerous exodus of people trying to get back home. A total of almost 19,000 relief camps have since been set up in Kerala, providing three meals a day. In comparison, in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state which has one of the highest numbers of migrant workers, just 2,000 camps have been set up.</p> \n  <p>Those in the camps are being given regular health checks and they even made arrangements to charge migrant workers phones, set up a helpline call centre which speaks five Indian languages. They also established a counselling service and when protests broke out in the camps by the migrant workers from northern states that they were only being fed rice, their diet was adapted to suit northern India tastes, including chapati, dal and pickle.

It is the first known case in Borno, the epicentre of jihadist conflict that ravaged the region for over a decade. <br><br>According to a statement by MSF this morning, the aid worker, whose identity has not been revealed, tested positive in a post-mortem test. MSF said its teams \u201chave strengthened infection prevention measures, hygiene facilities, infection control and isolation spaces.\u201d<br><br>Authorities are now working to trace the worker\u2019s contacts and abate a spread of the virus within one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. <br><br>Almost two million people are displaced in northeast Nigeria, with almost 3 million in urgent need of food aid according to the World Food Programme. Several humanitarian organisations operate in the region, providing essential help. The insurgency has decimated the key services millions in the region rely on, including its health system.<br><br>On Sunday night, the UN said a major priority is to decongest refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands live in squalid conditions, unable to return to their homes. Yet it is a huge challenge as many areas across Borno and the north-east remain unsafe, exacerbated by a recent withdrawal of soldiers into so called super-camps. After relentless attacks by jihadists, soldiers have redeployed to better defend their positions but NGOs in the region say it has left many towns more vulnerable to insurgents.<br><br>There are 627 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country of 200 million people. Yet the daily rise in cases is gradually accelerating, with 86 new cases confirmed yesterday. Nigerian authorities have only tested about 7,000 people, and whilst countries around the world are struggling to boost testing capacity, many West African countries have tested more per million people. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d80ef8f08b7689b031aba\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:01:19.677Z\">12.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">US scuppers G20 coronavirus statement on strengthening WHO</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US hostility to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics.</p> \n  <p>The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body\u2019s China-centric approach, reflected \u2013 in his view \u2013 by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia\">Saudi Arabia</a>, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-scuppers-g20-coronavirus-statement-on-strengthening-who\">Read more here.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:28:11.285Z\">at 12.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9d71c78f08b7689b031a0e\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T11:00:48.220Z\">12.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the latest developments around the world on the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper reported</strong>.

He said Japan\u2019s initial approach \u2013 to identify and contain infection clusters \u2013 had worked well until major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka started reporting significant rises in cases from the second half of March.</p> \n  <p>\u201cJapan\u2019s government should have changed strategy earlier,\u201d Iwata said, referring to the shift to wider testing combined with social distancing. \u201cThere was a tremendous delay and that has caused huge problems,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Hospitals initially designated to treat patients with the illness had become unable to deal with the growing number of cases, leaving other hospitals unprepared to fill the treatment gap. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t prepared and your staff aren\u2019t trained, you can\u2019t just admit Covid-19 patients,\u201d Iwata said. \u201cMany hospitals are not ready to fight against Covid-19. That\u2019s why [there have been reports] of ambulances going from one hospital to another\u201d in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and other cities.</p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cWe needed to change strategy immediately, but traditionally, Japan isn\u2019t good at doing that. When we have a plan A we are poor at converting it into a plan B.

Local governors can request that people stay home and that nonessential businesses close, but there are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance. In Tokyo, many places have closed their doors, but some bars, restaurants and cafes remain open, with many of the city\u2019s streets far from empty.<br><br>Iwata said the lack of urgency implicit in the measures meant people still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/clash-looms-in-japan-as-tokyo-governor-says-abes-covid-19-measures-not-enough\">hadn\u2019t understood the importance of staying home and social distancing</a>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe government didn\u2019t send the right message to people \u2013 that you need to distance yourself from others to block the route of transmission.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve fired up a new blog at the link below \u2013 follow me there for the latest updates: The US president ended today\u2019s briefing citing a range of different numbers for the potential deaths the US could have experienced, saying if the country hadn\u2019t done lockdowns, there could have been 700,000 deaths, a million deaths, or maybe \u201cmillions\u201d. As of today, there have been more than 41,000 deaths recorded in the US. Experts fear that the country could experience surges and second waves if states reopen too soon and if there is not enough testing and contact tracing in place. Get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. That White House Press Briefing is now over. We\u2019ll bring you a summary shortly. Asked why he didn\u2019t take the virus seriously in the early phases of its spread in the US, the president repeated his claims about that his travel restrictions against China made a difference and saved many lives: \u201cPeople should say I acted very early.\u201d In fact, the administration\u2019s travel policy did not cut off all travel from China. Although non-US citizens were prohibited from entering the country if they had traveled to China within the previous two weeks, American citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members were exempt. Similarly, Trump\u2019s European travel restrictions exempted citizens, residents and their families. And initially, the restrictions didn\u2019t apply to the UK and Ireland, as well as most Eastern European countries. Epidemiologists have told the Guardian that these policies likely had little impact, as they were enacted after the virus was already spreading within the US. \u201cWe are in a war. This is a World War Two this is a World War One,\u201d says Trump. Watch the White House press conference live below: Trump is back on the World Health Organization. The WHO \u201ccovered up for China,\u201d he says repeatedly. He also says he\u2019s going to win \u201cin a landslide\u201d in November. He adds that stopping arrivals from China and Europe were very difficult decisions that he took, which, he says, Dr Deborah Birx herself has said saved \u201ctens of thousands of lives\u201d. The truth here is obviously that tens of thousands more could have been saved. The current death toll in the US, the highest in the world, is 41,816, according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed infections, at 783,000, is almost four times higher than those in the next worst-affected country, Spain, which has 200,210. Spain has 20,852 deaths. Trump is being asked, just after saying \u201cI cannot tell a lie,\u201d (a quote from a made up story about George Washington confessing to chopping down his father\u2019s cherry tree), why he feels that criticism of the administration doing too little testing too late is a bipartisan, personal attack. He responds that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t view it as personal at all\u201d: If we have enough tests to go into phase 1, why is the governor of Maryland having to get half a million tests from South Korea? Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir is asked. He responds: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the governor of Maryland is doing in South Korea but there\u2019s excess capacity every day.\u201d Trump then attacked Hogan for securing tests, saying, \u201cHe could\u2019ve saved a lot of money ... He needed to get a little knowledge, that would\u2019ve been helpful.\u201d Regarding testing facilities in his state, Hogan just told CNN \u201cmore than half [of those listed by the federal government] in Maryland were federal facilities that we have desperately been trying to get help from, or military facilities\u201d. From my colleague Sam Levin: Earlier in the conference, vice president, Mike Pence, praised the testing efforts in Arizona, Florida, California, Michigan, and other states. He also claimed the US currently has \u201cenough testing capacity\u201d for every state to start phase one of the White House recommendations for re-opening their economies. In fact, a number of governors have expressed concerns that the testing capacity is not yet adequate for reopening the country. Most prominently this week, Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland has said his state was dealing with a shortage and negotiated to get 500,000 tests from South Korea. Trump says he will look into stopping oil shipments from Saudi Arabia, and that his administration will either ask congress\u2019 permission to buy oil, \u201cor we will store it.\u201d It\u2019s quite a graph: Trump is back on the podium and says that testing might not even be that important (it is). Now he is talking about oil \u2013 as the market collapses to negative pricing. \u201cNobody\u2019s ever heard of negative oil before but it\u2019s for a short term,\u201d Trump says. Just before this he said again, \u201cIt\u2019s for the short term. A lot of people got caught.\u201d The oil decline was largely a \u201cfinancial squeeze\u201d, he said. Asked if he would like Opec+ to make more cuts, he said \u201cwe\u2019ve already done that\u201d. He said oil producers need to \u201cdo more by the market\u201d in terms of production cuts. The full story on the price drop below: The US oil market has collapsed into negative prices for the first time in history as North America\u2019s oil producers run out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic: US vice president Mike Pence said the US has enough tests for those states that are ready to reopen \u2013 that meet the conditions for Phase 1 \u2013 and that the US will continue to ramp up testing in the meantime. Fact check: testing quality Trump claimed the US is \u201cway advanced\u201d on testing. In fact, some of the initial coronavirus tests sent out to states were seriously flawed. Part of the problem came from the CDC shunning the World Health Organization (WHO) template for tests, and insisted on developing a more complicated version that correctly identified Covid-19, but also flagged other viruses \u2013 resulting in false positives. Other countries \u2013 after their first coronavirus case \u2013 swiftly asked private companies to develop their own tests. South Korea, which recorded its first case on the same day as the US, did so within a week. The US only allowed laboratories and hospitals to conduct their own tests on 29 February, almost six weeks after the first case was confirmed. You can watch the White House press conference live below: \u201c\u2018Testing\u2019 is a big word,\u201d says Trump. \u201cRemember when it was all ventilators? Now the US is the king of ventilators. \u201cSo they said, \u2018Oh, now we\u2019ll get him on testing.\u2019\u201d Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now, sticking with Trump\u2019s press conference, where he is talking about what he is calling \u201cthe plague, the scourge\u201d of coronavirus. Get in touch with me on Twitter: @helenrsullivan. Todd Semonite, the Army Corps of Engineers chief, is here at the press conference talking about hospital work during coronavirus. Trump took a break from talking about the pandemic to request that Semonite provide an update on construction of the president\u2019s border wall, which continues during the Covid-19 crisis. Trump told Semonite he could stay to keep watching the press conference, but Semonite declined, saying he had a lot of building to continue doing. Read more on the continued construction of the border wall: The president also said there are efforts to ensure Americans have access to tests, including African Americans and Latinos who have been particularly hard hit by coronavirus. Overall, the US had administered more than 3.5m coronavirus tests so far, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Recently, it matched the rate of testing per capita of South Korea, though countries, including Germany, have tested a larger proportion of its population. From a very slow start, the US, with a population of 329 million, had ramped up to a testing rate of one in every 100 people \u2014 similar to South Korea. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 63 people. The UK, however, is behind, having tested only 1 in 230 people. In America, despite the recent increase in testing, backlogs are reported in labs across the country, and many people with symptoms \u2014 including health workers \u2014 are still struggling to access tests. Read more: Trump praised a conservative journalist, Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, calling him \u201crespected\u201d. CNN\u2019s fact checker notes that the president is not always a fan: Trump has complained again about the media coverage of ventilators, saying: \u201cVentilators, ventilators, ventilators! ... It was all ventilators ... We did a great job with the ventilators.\u201d He said \u201cat some point soon\u201d, the US would be helping Mexico and Italy with ventilators. It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months. The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d Read more: Trump said New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, is coming to the White House tomorrow, and also implied Cuomo praised him today and that states like New York have the supplies they need. The governor of New York, however, said in a late March briefing that the Trump administration had forced the states into a bidding war: \u201cYou have 50 states competing to buy the same item,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all wind up bidding up each other and competing against each other, where you now literally will have a company call you up and say, \u2018Well, California just outbid you.\u2019 It\u2019s like being on eBay with 50 other states, bidding on a ventilator.\u201d Yesterday, Trump played misleading clips of a Cuomo press conference: Trump claimed at the start of the press conference that the coronavirus rate was better in the US than many other places in the country. While the death rates in the US, both in comparison to the number of confirmed cases and in comparison to the population, are relatively good, they are not the best in the world based on the most reliable available data - which even experts agree may not be all that reliable. Research by the US\u2019s Johns Hopkins University showed that as of April 13, the death rate in the US was 4% of cases and 6.73 deaths per 100,000 population. That is significantly better than rates in hard hit countries such as Italy, Spain, the UK and France, and similar overall to Iran, which was also an early hotspot. But death rates are higher in the US than Germany, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and many other countries. The death rate in China had been recorded as 4% of cases and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population. That was before the Chinese government increased the official death toll from Wuhan, the original base of the outbreak, by 50%. And there are ongoing questions about all of China\u2019s reported numbers in relation to the coronavirus. Meanwhile, the New York Times has published a long and useful article detailing the enormous difficulties in pinpointing death rates in different countries and even different areas and populations within countries. The virus swept in so quickly and is still so relatively new that we are only now grasping that there may be huge numbers of people who have or had Covid-19 without showing symptoms, have not been tested or who died at home or in a care home without that death every being verified as resulting from coronavirus. The New York Times gives a rough rule of thumb that, according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4% of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide. In Washington, the US president Donald Trump is at the podium now, talking about his guidelines for reopening the country. Supplies of masks to the NHS could be affected if the general public in the UK are advised to wear them, according to Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers. The US car rental company Hertz plans to lay off 10,000 employees to cut costs amid the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout. The company will incur employee termination costs of about $30m (\u00a324m), it said in a regulatory filing. The terminations were effective 14 April for non-union employees and effective 21 April for union employees, the company said. Saudi Arabia has extended the suspension of praying in the Grand Mosque and Prophet\u2019s Mosque during the holy month of Ramadan to stem the spread of the virus, the presidency of the Two Holy Mosques said on Twitter citing its president general Sheikh Dr. Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz Al-Sudais. For a little background on the official rebuttals emanating from Whitehall this week, see this piece by my colleagues Jim Waterson and Rowena Mason: Public Health England has launched an unusually strident attack on an attempt by Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun columnist, to transfer blame for failings in preparation for the Covid-19 outbreak from politicians to government advisers. On Monday evening, PHE published a press release on its gov.uk website dismissing Kavanagh\u2019s claims in a point-by-point rebuttal, variously describing his assertions as \u201cwrong\u201d, \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, and \u201cnonsense\u201d. Writing in the Sun newspaper on Monday, Kavanagh had defended Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to holiday in Mustique and spend his weekends in the country as the pandemic gathered steam. \u201cPresidents and prime ministers have a lot on their plates,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhen it comes to health alarms, they rely on experts.\u201d It was, claimed Kavanagh, the \u201csprawling\u201d PHE, an \u201cinflexible, politically correct quango\u201d, that was culpable for a deficient stockpile of personal protective equipment, and it had \u201cdragged its feet\u201d over getting hold of ventilators for seriously ill patients, and that it had resisted offers of \u201coutside help\u201d with filling shortages. PHE said in its response: PHE is not responsible for determining what stock is held in the pandemic stockpile. We are responsible for developing the UK guidance on PPE and advising how to keep clinicians safe. The DHSC is responsible for the procurement of PPE on behalf of the NHS, not PHE. \u2026 PHE does not source or procure ventilators or beds on behalf of the NHS \u2026 PHE is not responsible for the supply of PPE. The DHSC and NHS England is leading this work including dealing with offers of help from private companies. A spokesperson for PHE said the Sun had not put its claims to the agency before publishing Kavanagh\u2019s column. As healthcare workers in the US states of Colorado and Pennsylvania staged counter-protests against rightwing anti-quarantine rallies that continue to spread across the nation, some experts warn such rallies could cause a surge in coronavirus cases. In the UK, an emergency consultant has died after contracting Covid-19. Manjeet Singh Riyat, who died on Monday, has been described as \u201cthe father of the current Emergency Department\u201d by his colleagues at the Royal Derby Hospital. The emergency medicine consultant, Susie Hewitt, has said: Manjeet was enormously valued and much loved as a colleague, supervisor and mentor as well as for his wise council and discreet support in tough times. For many, Manjeet was considered the father of the current Emergency department in Derby and many more will reflect on how his inspiration has shaped their own careers. The English Football League is to consider preventing clubs who defer the wages of their players from spending money in the transfer market. In a move to be discussed between the league and its clubs this week, the proposal would necessitate that any money owed to playing staff be paid before a club could add to their squad or increase the collective wage bill. The idea for a new mechanism, whose details remain uncertain, is one of a number of proposals to be discussed as attempts are made to stave off crisis in the face of the pandemic. A broad range of ideas, up to the possibility of a wage cap, will be under consideration. Any relaxation of lockdown measures could trigger an exponential rise in cases, UK government scientific advisers have warned ministers, amid a cabinet split about how quickly to ease restrictions. With the prime minister, Boris Johnson, still recuperating at Chequers, his senior ministers have been at loggerheads over whether the public health and economic impact of the lockdown will soon begin to rival the consequences of the virus itself. Back to the UK, where the Speaker of the Commons has said Wednesday\u2019s \u201chybrid\u201d session will see screens placed around the chamber to allow him and the minister present to see their colleagues as they pose questions and make statements. Hoyle added that, if successful, the House will consider moving to a fully virtual Parliament, including remote voting. In times of crisis, we must find new ways of working ... Our new virtual parliament means that MPs are playing the fullest part in the national effort to stay home, protect the NHS and save lives. Kuwait will extend the suspension of work in the public sector including at government ministries until 31 May and expand a nationwide curfew to 16 hours, a government spokesman has said. He told a televised news conference that the 4pm-8am curfew will go into effect at the start of the holy fasting month of Ramadan, which could fall on Thursday or later this week depending on the sighting of the new crescent moon. In the UK, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has said he hopes parliament will resume virtually this week and that in future votes may even be held remotely. The House has survived being burned down by the great fire of 1834 and bombed during the Second World War. We now face a new challenge, Covid-19, an invisible killer that has claimed so many lives already. It means that when we come back from the Easter recess, our MPs and the House of Commons will have to work in a different way. Instead of returning to our hallowed green benches, I am hoping that from Wednesday we can meet virtually instead. It will be a historic moment in our 700-year history to have MPs contributing to Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, urgent questions and statements via video link from the safety of their own homes and offices. Pope Francis has postponed two major international Catholic church events by a year because of the uncertainties caused by the pandemic, the Vatican has said. While it has already postponed events and trips that had been planned for this year, this is the first time the outbreak has affected its long-term planning. The World Meeting of Families, which was due to take place in Rome next year, was postponed to 2022. World Youth Day, which was scheduled for 2022 in Lisbon, was postponed until 2023. Both events, which take place in a different location every few years, draw large crowds and involve international travel by most of the participants. They last for several days and the pope traditionally closes both. The Guardian reported over the weekend that a record 160m barrels of oil was being stored in \u201csupergiant\u201d oil tankers outside the world\u2019s largest shipping ports, including the US Gulf, following the deepest fall in oil demand in 25 years because of the coronavirus pandemic. The last time floating storage reached levels close to this was in 2009, when traders stored more than 100m barrels at sea before offloading stocks when the economy began to recover. The price collapse in North American oil markets accelerated because it is the last day oil producers can trade barrels that are scheduled for delivery next month, when oil storage is expected to reach capacity. The US oil market has collapsed into negative prices for the first time in history as North America\u2019s oil producers run out of space to store an unprecedented oversupply of crude left by the pandemic, Jillian Ambrose and Martin Farrer write. The price of US crude oil has fallen by more than 105% on Monday as rising stockpiles of crude threaten to overwhelm oil storage facilities. It is the lowest level since futures contracts began trading in 1983. The crash in demand caused by the pandemic has forced oil producers in Canada to start paying buyers to take the glut of oil barrels they cannot store, causing the country\u2019s benchmark oil price to plunge into negative territory for the first time. The global benchmark price for oil, known as Brent crude, has fallen by more than 7% to around $26 a barrel on Monday due to fears that the virus could plunge the global economy into a deep recession. Bjornar Tonhaugen, the head of oil at Rystad Energy, has said: The real problem of the global supply-demand imbalance has started to really manifest itself in prices. As production continues relatively unscathed, storages are filling up by the day. The world is using less and less oil and producers now feel how this translates. I am now handing the live blog over to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. Thanks everyone. The World Health Organization chief has warned that the worst is still ahead of us in the coronavirus outbreak, reviving international concern just as many countries ease restrictive measures aimed at reducing its spread. The director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, didn\u2019t specify why he believed the outbreak that has infected some 2.5 million people and killed over 166,000 could get worse. He and others, however, have previously pointed to the likely future spread of the illness through Africa, where health systems are far less developed. \u201cTrust us. The worst is yet ahead of us,\u201d Tedros told reporters from WHO headquarters in Geneva. \u201cLet\u2019s prevent this tragedy. It\u2019s a virus that many people still don\u2019t understand.\u201d The World Health Organization insisted Monday that it sounded the alarm on the novel coronavirus right from the very start and had hidden nothing from Washington about the deadly pandemic. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said there were no secrets at the UN agency after facing scathing criticism from Washington, which has accused the organisation of initially downplaying the outbreak in China. \u201cWe have been warning from day one that this is a devil that everyone should fight,\u201d Tedros told a virtual briefing in Geneva. Tedros said the presence of embedded US government secondees working at the WHO headquarters in Geneva meant there was nothing being concealed from Washington. Oil has plunged below $5 (\u00a34) a barrel as the coronavirus pandemic affects global economies. Buyers in Texas are offering as little as $2 a barrel for some oil streams, raising the possibility that producers may soon have to pay to have crude taken off their hands. Below is a tweet from Bloomberg showing the fall. I am moving into my last 40 minutes on the blog, so if you want to share are any last minute comments, thoughts or news tips with me then please do via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com A crowd of hundreds has protested against tough social isolation measures taken against coronavirus in southern Russia, clashing with riot police and issuing demands that the local governor resign. The protests took place on a central square in Vladikavkaz, the capital of Russia\u2019s North Ossetia region, where locals demanded a relaxation of tough anti-coronavirus measures, including the closure of businesses, and greater financial support for those who had lost their jobs. Video posted to social media appeared to show protesters pelting the police with rocks, and police making several arrests. Kavkaz.Realiya, a local branch of RFERL, estimated the crowd at 700 people. Police had broken up the protests by Monday evening. According to Russian media, the protests were called by Vadim Cheldiev, an opera singer and activist who has publicly doubted the existence of a coronavirus pandemic. Late last week, he issued a call for locals to protest and violate the \u201cself-isolation regime\u201d under which Russians are expected to shelter at home. \u201cIt\u2019s all just fake,\u201d he said in one video address posted on Facebook. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad more people are starting not to believe in it.\u201d He was arrested and charged with spreading false information about coronavirus, a charge that can now lead to years in prison if that information contributes to someone\u2019s death. Pregnant women in Uganda will no longer need permission to travel to hospital during the Covid-19 lockdown, following reports that some women had died in labour because they were unable to access health services in time. President Yoweri Museveni said on Sunday that women would no longer require special permission from local authorities to travel to hospitals and health centres during the lockdown, which has been extended until 5 May. Reuters reported this month that at least seven women had died because they were forced to walk to hospital when they were in labour. Two babies were also reported to have died as a result of the restrictions. \u201cThe transport ban in Uganda caused immense harm,\u201d said Nakibuuka Noor Musisi, from the Center for Health, Human Rights and Development. \u201cPregnant women and all people in need of health services never should have been subjected to it. While we welcome this development, it has come far too late for many who have already died or suffered preventable complications as a result.\u201d Last week, 12 civil society groups wrote to the Ugandan prime minister and the World Bank calling for pregnant women and children to be exempt from the transport ban. They also want to see restrictions eased for other people with serious and urgent health issues. \u201cChildren, people living with HIV or TB, and people with other chronic illnesses such as sickle cell anemia, diabetes and cancer must be able to obtain prompt health services even as the government responds to Covid-19,\u201d said Lillian Mworeko, from the International Community of Women Living with HIV Eastern Africa. \u201cUnreasonable movement restrictions on people who have urgent health needs is a clear violation of our rights.\u201d According to the Ministry of Health, Uganda has 55 confirmed cases of the virus and no deaths. Italy reported 454 new deaths from coronavirus on Monday, 21 more than on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 24,114. For the first time, the number of people who are infected fell by 20 to 108,237. \u201cThis is positive data as it shows the number of people who are currently positive with the virus is declining,\u201d said Angelo Borrelli, the chief of Italy\u2019s civil protection authority. Meanwhile, the total cases to date, including victims and survivors, rose by 2,256 to 181,228, the smallest increase since 10 March. To date, 48,877 people have recovered. Pressure on hospitals in Bergamo, the Lombardy province worst hit by the virus, is beginning to ease as the pandemic slows. The Chinese couple who were the first confirmed cases in Italy in late January have been discharged from Rome\u2019s San Filippo Neri hospital, where they underwent rehabilitation following over three weeks in intensive care at the Spallanzani hospital for infectious diseases. \u201cThey are in excellent condition and sent a letter of thanks to the hospitals which saved them and cared for them,\u201d said Alessio D\u2019Amato, health councillor for the Lazio region. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that he understood why some people are protesting the closing down of businesses in response to the coronavirus but argued relaxing restrictions needed to be done in a way that prevented further outbreaks. \u201cYou don\u2019t need protests to convince anyone in this country that we have get back to work and we have to get the economy going and we have to get out of our homes. Nobody,\u201d Cuomo told a briefing. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, said: For WHO we are open we don\u2019t hide anything... We want all countries to get the same message immediately because that helps countries to prepare well and to prepare quickly... Not only the US but all countries get information immediately. He added that \u201canyone dying is the father, grandmother\u201d of someone. \u201cIt\u2019s life and that is why we prefer to see the individuals. faces and people. They are not numbers or averages, they are people.\u201d \u201cThat is why we don\u2019t have secrets and as soon as we get information we pass it. We want to save lives, even if it is one life.\u201d Albania, which has recorded one of Europe\u2019s lowest numbers of coronavirus cases, sent 60 more nurses to help treat patients in hard-hit neighbour Italy on Monday. Ogerta Manastirliu, the health minister, saw the nurses off at Rinas airport and said the move was meant \u201cto show hope and solidarity with the friendly Italian people, who have helped us over the years\u201d. Albania has reported 584 cases of coronavirus and 26 related deaths as of Monday. Hello everyone. I running the global live blog now until 7pm GMT, so please do stay in touch with me to share any thoughts or information with me. My contact details are below. Thanks. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Tedros says that more than 600 hospitals around the world may be ready to enrol patients in WHO\u2019s solidarity clinical trials of drugs, and that the body would ship 180m surgical masks to countries this month and next month. Tedros says that easing restrictions is not the end of any epidemic and that it will require \u201csustained effort\u201d on behalf of governments and individuals. So-called lockdowns can help to \u201ctake the heat out of a country\u2019s epidemic\u201d, but can\u2019t end it alone, he says. Governments must ensure they can \u201cdetect, test, isolate and care for every case and trace every contact\u201d. The head of the World Health Organization is opening this afternoon\u2019s press conference (which you can watch at the top of this blog). Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus starts by thanking musicians and entertainers for this weekend\u2019s One World: Together at Home concert, which was broadcast across multiple television and streaming channels around the world. The Austrian government has said that roughly a tenth of the country\u2019s population is registered for a state scheme aimed at preventing layoffs that enables employers to keep staff on their books while only paying for hours actually worked. The scheme, introduced soon after Austria went into coronavirus lockdown roughly a month ago, is a form of \u201ckurzarbeit\u201d, or shorter working hours, a model widely used in German-speaking countries. Reuters reports that employees registered for it and who earn less than \u20ac5,730 a month receive 80-90% of their salary. The company pays only for hours they have actually worked and the government makes up the difference. The Austrian department for labour and social affairs said: The 63,189 (approved company) corona-kurzarbeit applications are securing 871,039 jobs. That is an increase of almost 50% compared to last week. That is roughly 9.8% of Austria\u2019s population of 8.9 million, or 19.1% of its workforce of 4.6 million. Despite the scheme already being in place, unemployment shot up last month to 12.2% by a national measure or more than 500,000 people, its highest level since the data series began in 1946. Hospitality, construction and transport were the sectors with the biggest increases. Reuters is reporting that three migrants the US deported two weeks ago to Haiti, on a flight that raised objections from human rights advocates, have tested positive for coronavirus while in quarantine in the Caribbean country. A Haitian health ministry source told the news agency: \u201cThese people who were in quarantine were tested and three \u2026 came back positive.\u201d Reuters was unable to independently verify the information. Several US politicians had also opposed the deportation flight to Haiti given the risk of spreading the virus further in the poorest country in the Americas. The Caribbean nation had 25 confirmed cases when the flight landed, compared with more than 380,000 in the US. It now has 47 but that number could rise swiftly. A major outbreak of coronavirus could be devastating for Haiti, which has about 100 ventilators for 11 million residents. America\u2019s acting Department of Homeland Security secretary, Chad Wolf, has announced that the US, Mexico and Canada are extending restrictions on non-essential travel across their shared borders for another 30 days. He wrote on Twitter: In the UK, the Guardian is running a project to remember the NHS workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus. If you would like to share any further names and stories with us, or feel there are people we have missed, then please drop an email to sarah.marsh@theguardian.com. We hope to document and pay tribute to those who die working on the frontline of the pandemic. We will be adding to the cases in a database and hope to examine these deaths further. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she imagined the next European Union budget would look very different and bigger than that which was discussed before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOne can discuss about new treaties, but this will take two or three years to find solutions,\u201d Merkel told reporerts. \u201cWe\u2019ll need quick answers to address this pandemic and Germany will participate in answers of solidarity that go beyond the 500 billion euros that we already have.\u201d Hello everyone. I am back from my lunch-break and running the global live blog now until 7pm GMT, so please do stay in touch with me to share any thoughts or information with me. My contact details are below. Thanks very much. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, is giving an update on the city\u2019s coronavirus crisis right now. You can watch the press conference below. De Blasio says he has an urgent message to the US federal government: \u201cWe need more surgical gowns in New York City and we need them now.\u201d More than 14,400 coronavirus deaths have been reported in New York City to date \u2013 representing more than third of the US total of 41,000 deaths from the virus. The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating diplomatic \u201cfractures\u201d, heightening US-China rivalry and weakening multilateralism, France\u2019s foreign minister has said. In an interview with France\u2019s Le Monde newspaper, Jean-Yves Le Drian was quoted as saying: It seems to me that we are witnessing an amplification of the fractures that have been undermining the international order for years. The pandemic is the continuation, by different means, of the struggle between powers. My fear is that the world after (the outbreak) will strongly resemble the world before, but worse. Le Drian does not explicitly name the world powers but one assumes he means the US and China. Donald Trump has questioned whether China was \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for the global spread of the coronavirus and if it was a \u201cmistake that got out of control\u201d. Beijing has rejected mounting calls for an international investigation into the source of the virus, saying earlier on Monday that any suggestions of a cover-up were \u201cnot in line with facts\u201d. The Le Monde interview is behind a paywall but this is the link. Russia has quarantined thousands of soldiers who took part in rehearsals for a Victory Day parade that appeared to flout physical distancing guidelines brought in to stem the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. The defence ministry said it would be sending the soldiers, estimated to number 15,000, back to their bases, where they would be put under a two-week quarantine. The ministry did not indicate that any of the soldiers had been infected with the coronavirus. This is a great 10-minute film on the volunteers helping to keep Italy\u2019s ambulance services running at night. It follows a day in the life of Matteo, who juggles his job as a watch salesman \u2013 and looking after his newborn baby boy, Tommi \u2013 while volunteering as an emergency responder at night in Milan. He is one of hundreds of people giving up their free time to help alleviate the city\u2019s stretched ambulance service, where 80% of the callouts are for patients with Covid-19 symptoms. Hello. This is Josh Halliday again, taking over while Sarah has a quick break. The coronavirus has swept through a hostel in the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, infecting 138 of the 175 asylum seekers housed there, a municipal official said. Residents were evacuated from the hostel on Sunday and taken to Lisbon\u2019s Central Mosque for testing after one of them tested positive for the virus, city councillor Carlos Castro told Reuters. The few who did not test positive will be taken back to the hostel, which has been decontaminated. \u201cWe are doing all we can to ensure the safety of these people, and to ensure the safety of everyone in the neighbourhood,\u201d Castro said. Monica Farinha, the head of the Portuguese council of refugees (CPR), said the case had been handled smoothly but her organisation was concerned about the possibility of contagion in other hostels where social distancing is difficult. Vittoria, aged 13, and 11-year-old Carola became social media sensations after they posted video of their game played between two rooftop terraces in Liguria, north-west Italy. on Saturday. Italy is under lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. China has rejected Australia\u2019s call for an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic. Washington and several allies have accused China of failing to adequately respond to the viral disease threat in the weeks after it was first detected in the central city of Wuhan late last year. US president Donald Trump also cut funding to the World Health Organization after accusing it of mismanaging the crisis and covering up the seriousness of the initial outbreak before it spread around the world and killed more than 165,000 people. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the accusations disrespected \u201cthe Chinese people\u2019s tremendous efforts and sacrifices\u201d in fighting the contagion. \u201cAny question about China\u2019s transparency in the prevention and control of epidemic situation is not in line with facts,\u201d Geng told a regular press briefing. He was speaking in response to a question about Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, who a day earlier said her country would \u201cinsist\u201d on the investigation into the response by Beijing and the WHO. There have been questions about China\u2019s recording of Covid-19 infections, as it repeatedly changed its counting criteria at the peak of the outbreak. Authorities in Wuhan initially tried to cover up the outbreak, punishing doctors who had raised the alarm online in December. Chinese scientists have rejected conspiracy theories pushed by some in the US government claiming the virus could have originated at a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan. Trump has suggested that China could have been \u201cknowingly responsible\u201d for spreading the infection and could face consequences as a result.

Speaking with supporters in Brasilia, he also opposed the view of a fan who called for the country\u2019s supreme court to be shut, with Bolsonaro saying Brazil was a democratic country and the top court would remain open. In the US, Shake Shack Inc said it will return the small business loan it received from the US government to help with the coronavirus lockdown, becoming the first major firm to do so. The company will immediately return the entire $10 million US Small Business Administration (SBA) loan as it was able to raise additional capital, chief executive Randy Garutti and founder Danny Meyer said. Last week, it raised about $150 million in an equity offering. The loan is aimed at helping small companies keep paying their employees and their basic bills during the shutdowns so that they are able to reopen quickly when public health allows. More than 25% of the total $350 billion fund went to fewer than 2% of the firms that got relief, including a number of publicly traded companies with thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales. This led to a backlash from smaller establishments and mom-and-pop restaurants, one of the hardest-hit sectors as diners stay at home due to lockdowns. Several franchises of McDonald\u2019s Corp and Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc are also said to have applied for the loan. Shake Shack, which runs around 189 restaurants with about 45 employees in each outlet, said the money it received could be reallocated to the independent restaurants \u201cwho need it most, (and) haven\u2019t gotten any assistance\u201d. Iran has reported 91 new deaths from the novel coronavirus. The latest figure comes as the government allowed more economic activity to resume after a gradual reopening in the past 10 days. After nearly a week of declining fatalities, there has been a slight rise in the past few days for the Islamic republic, one of the world\u2019s hardest hit. The sanctions-hit country had shut down all non-essential economic activity in mid-March, weeks after its coronavirus outbreak first came to light. But top officials argued that Iran\u2019s battered economy could not remain shuttered, and president Hassan Rouhani has allowed low-risk businesses to reopen since 11 April. Shops in passages and bazaars were the latest businesses that were permitted to resume trading as part of Iran\u2019s gradual reopening of its economy. Nearly all retailers were open at north Tehran\u2019s Tajrish Bazaar, said an AFP correspondent who visited the sprawling complex on Monday. But health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour appealed for people to remain vigilant as he announced the latest tolls from the deadly virus. \u201cWith some businesses reopening and movement increasing, observing health protocols and social distancing become more and more necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not mean we should be less careful, but the exact opposite,\u201d he told a televised news conference. Germany will cover the cost for treating novel coronavirus patients taken in from European Union neighbour countries as a gesture of goodwill, health minister Jens Spahn said on Monday. Germany has been spared the worst of the coronavirus crisis seen in some of its hard-hit European neighbours, and has taken in patients, mainly from France, to relieve pressure on their overburdened healthcare systems. A total of 229 foreign patients have been treated in Germany, a spokesman for the foreign ministry said Monday \u2013 130 from France, 44 from Italy and 55 from the Netherlands. Their treatment has so far cost about \u20ac20m ($21.7m), according to Spahn. \u201cGermany will cover the treatment costs of these patients, that is what we understand by European solidarity,\u201d Spahn said ahead of a meeting of ministers tackling the virus crisis on Monday. \u201cThe willingness and capacity is there to admit more if necessary,\u201d he added. The number of coronavirus deaths and infections in Germany has remained well below some of its neighbours. Thousands of people in Tel Aviv staged a protest against Benjamin Netanyahu while attempting to maintain physical distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters in Rabin Square wore masks and tried to keep 2 metres apart while voicing their anger at the prime minister, who is under criminal indictment in three corruption cases, in which he denies any wrongdoing. The UN children\u2019s agency on Monday appealed for $92.4m in new funds for the Middle East and North Africa to help combat the effects of coronavirus on already poverty-stricken areas. \u201cThe region has the biggest number of children in need in the world due to ongoing conflicts and wars,\u201d said Ted Chaiban, Unicef director for the Middle East and North Africa, in a statement. The combination of a lack of \u201cor inadequate basic services, years of conflict, poverty, deprivation and now Covid-19 are hitting vulnerable children the most, making their hard lives simply unbearable\u201d, he added. Nearly 25 million children across the region are in need, including many who are refugees and internally displaced, the statement said. The majority were uprooted due to armed conflicts in Iraq, Libya, the Palestinian territories, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, it said. The devastating effects of population lockdowns \u2013 introduced to forestall the spread of coronavirus \u2013 on employment and business will drag around eight million more people into poverty regionally, an estimated half of them children, Unicef added. Around 110 million children are now stuck at home rather than in school, it said. While overall India may have recorded its highest spike in cases on Monday, in the southern state of Kerala it is looking like a very different story. Robust, proactive and compassionate measures by the Kerala government appear to have successfully flattened the curve of cases within the state, and the \u201cKerala model\u201d is now being widely touted as the example for other Indian states to follow. Only three of 402 reported cases have died so far, while 67% of patients have been cured, India\u2019s best recovery rate. The Kerala government is so confident they have the virus under control that on Monday they allowed some restaurants, hairdressers and small workplaces in specific zones to re-open, and cars back on the roads on an odd-even licence plate scheme- a sharp contrast to the rest of the country which remains under a strict lockdown until at least 3 May. Kerala was the first state in India to record a coronavirus case in January, a student who had returned from Wuhan, but trouble really began in late February when a couple who had returned from Italy skipped the virus screening and did not consult a hospital for over a week when they started showing symptoms. As a popular tourist destination with a huge population of both expatriates and migrant workers who constantly travel in and out of the state, Kerala was always going to be vulnerable to coronavirus. But governed by a coalition of left wing and communist parties, Kerala already has the best healthcare system in India, as well as the highest literacy and life expectancy rates. And when faced with a pandemic, the government sprung into action earlier than anywhere else in India. Health minister, KK Shailaja, who swiftly earned the nickname \u201cCoronavirus Slayer\u201d, was the first in the country to assemble a taskforce in mid-February to begin aggressively contact tracing, testing and quarantining any possible cases. The state also closed all schools, restaurants and banned gatherings before any other and began setting up public sinks and hand sanitiser dispensers in public places, even at bus stops. The state has one of the highest testing rates in India, though it has also faced a shortage of testing kits. And when prime minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24 with four hours notice, causing havoc for the millions of migrant workers stuck thousands of miles from home. The Kerala authorities set up camps and provided provisions for their three million \u201cguest workers\u201d, preventing the dangerous exodus of people trying to get back home. A total of almost 19,000 relief camps have since been set up in Kerala, providing three meals a day. In comparison, in Uttar Pradesh, India\u2019s most populous state which has one of the highest numbers of migrant workers, just 2,000 camps have been set up. Those in the camps are being given regular health checks and they even made arrangements to charge migrant workers phones, set up a helpline call centre which speaks five Indian languages. They also established a counselling service and when protests broke out in the camps by the migrant workers from northern states that they were only being fed rice, their diet was adapted to suit northern India tastes, including chapati, dal and pickle. In one camp, a Bengali kitchen was established. Across the state, mobile health workers are visiting the elderly and vulnerable. Nonetheless, experts are warning against celebrating the state\u2019s success too early, especially as cases nationwide continue to steeply increase, and Kerala reported two new cases on Monday. On Sunday the Ministry of Home affairs also issued a rebuke to the Kerala state government for easing restrictions, with Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla issuing a thinly veiled warning against states that were \u201cdiluting\u201d the lockdown. China\u2019s health authority called for a stronger and more rigorous testing regime to ensure that the new coronavirus does not escape detection, whether in travellers arriving from abroad or from other parts of the country. All localities must improve their testing capabilities, including those at border crossings, and report any epidemic information in a timely manner, the National Health Commission cited its director Ma Xiaowei as saying. Ma made the comments on Saturday, but they were released by the ministry on Monday. China, where the new virus emerged late last year, reported 12 new confirmed cases on April 19, the lowest since March 13. Despite the downtrend, officials remain concerned about the re-emergence of local transmissions in parts of the country, including Beijing, where a central district has been re-classified as high-risk following three recent local infections. Ghana has partially ended a three-week lockdown imposed in its capital Accra and the city of Kumasi from today. The West African country has changed its strategy to fight the Covid-19 outbreak, making it an outlier in Africa. Public and religious gatherings will still be banned and its borders will remain closed but many have begun to return to work and can go out as long as they wear masks and maintain social distancing measures. In a televised address on Sunday night, president Nana Akufo-Addo said, \u201clifting these restrictions doesn\u2019t mean we are letting our guard down.\u201d Authorities would reinstate a lockdown on specific locations where outbreaks occur, he said. Confirmed cases of Covid-19 are still rising in Ghana - with 1042 infections and 9 deaths - but authorities feel their increasing testing capacity means they can pursue a different strategy. If they aggressively trace contacts of those who\u2019ve been infected, officials believe they can afford to ease the lockdown to help the most economically vulnerable. 68,000 people have been tested so far, the second highest in Africa. After five weeks on a luxury Italian cruise ship, 168 passengers disembarked in Barcelona on Monday. The liner set sail on 5 January from the northern Italian city of Venice on a round-the-world tour, and not a single case of coronavirus has been found onboard. With 1,800 passengers, the 12-deck Costa Deliziosa docked early on Monday to allow Spanish passengers to disembark on its penultimate stop before heading back to Italy. The 300-metre ship entered port after receiving the green light from Madrid, days after French officials refused to let it disembark its 460 passengers at the southern port of Marseille. \u201cThe boat has arrived. All the Spanish nationals have disembarked and are on their way home,\u201d said a spokesperson for vessel owner Costa Cruises. Those authorised to leave disembarked in small groups and were bussed to the city centre, said an AFP correspondent who witnessed the ship\u2019s arrival. President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Russia had managed to curb the coronavirus crisis but the peak of the outbreak still lay ahead. The number of Russian confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed 47,000 on Monday with a death toll of 405. Hello.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com An aid worker for the humanitarian agency Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) has died in Borno State, northeast Nigeria on Sunday from Covid-19. It is the first known case in Borno, the epicentre of jihadist conflict that ravaged the region for over a decade. According to a statement by MSF this morning, the aid worker, whose identity has not been revealed, tested positive in a post-mortem test. MSF said its teams \u201chave strengthened infection prevention measures, hygiene facilities, infection control and isolation spaces.\u201d Authorities are now working to trace the worker\u2019s contacts and abate a spread of the virus within one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. Almost two million people are displaced in northeast Nigeria, with almost 3 million in urgent need of food aid according to the World Food Programme. Several humanitarian organisations operate in the region, providing essential help. The insurgency has decimated the key services millions in the region rely on, including its health system. On Sunday night, the UN said a major priority is to decongest refugee camps, where hundreds of thousands live in squalid conditions, unable to return to their homes. Yet it is a huge challenge as many areas across Borno and the north-east remain unsafe, exacerbated by a recent withdrawal of soldiers into so called super-camps. After relentless attacks by jihadists, soldiers have redeployed to better defend their positions but NGOs in the region say it has left many towns more vulnerable to insurgents. There are 627 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country of 200 million people. Yet the daily rise in cases is gradually accelerating, with 86 new cases confirmed yesterday. Nigerian authorities have only tested about 7,000 people, and whilst countries around the world are struggling to boost testing capacity, many West African countries have tested more per million people. US hostility to the World Health Organization scuppered the publication of a communique by G20 health ministers on Sunday that committed to strengthening the WHO\u2019s mandate in coordinating a response to the global coronavirus pandemic. In place of a lengthy statement with paragraphs of detail, the leaders instead issued a brief statement saying that gaps existed in the way the world handled pandemics. The failure to agree on a statement will underline the extent to which the pandemic has become a theatre for a wider global disagreement between the US and China in which other nation states are finding themselves increasingly forced to take sides. Donald Trump has suspended US payments to the WHO in protest at what he regards as the body\u2019s China-centric approach, reflected \u2013 in his view \u2013 by its failure to challenge China sufficiently over the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. Tawfiq Al-Rabiah, the health minister for Saudi Arabia, which was hosting the virtual summit, abruptly cancelled a planned press conference on Sunday, saying he urgently needed to attend a domestic coronavirus taskforce meeting. Read more here. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the latest developments around the world on the coronavirus pandemic. The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper reported. Citing an internal document, the paper reported that Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez plans to make a formal proposal to his EU colleagues during a summit on Thursday. The global number of deaths topped 165,000 with more than 2.4 million confirmed cases, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. US deaths passed 40,000 on Sunday \u2013 nearly a quarter of the global total \u2013 with infections at just under 760,000, or just under a third of the world\u2019s total. Donald Trump was accused of using another White House coronavirus briefing to broadcast a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise. The US president dimmed the lights and played two selectively edited videos on screens behind the briefing room podium featuring Cuomo, whose state has been hardest hit by the deadly pandemic. Several countries began to ease their lockdown restrictions. Australians returned to the beach in Sydney but only for exercise. India allowed some industrial and agricultural firms to reopen, while Iran opened some shopping malls and intercity highways. A Japanese specialist in infectious diseases has said he is \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about the likelihood of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead next year. New Zealand\u2019s PM, Jacinda Ardern, has extended the country\u2019s level-4 lockdown for a week, after which schools and daycare centres will be allowed to open, as well as some businesses. Chancellor Angela Merkel told the leadership of her party that if Germany spent too much on additional coronavirus rescue programmes, Italy and Spain might point to Europe\u2019s largest economy and say it has enough money, participants in the call told Reuters. Merkel, a Christian Democrat (CDU), reiterated her view that launching eurobonds would be the wrong path. Myanmar shipped hundreds of recently released Rohingya inmates back to the country\u2019s restive western borderlands on Monday, after fears that its overcrowded prisons could become hotbeds for runaway coronavirus outbreaks. Men, women and children belonging to the stateless and long-persecuted Muslim minority were among nearly 25,000 prisoners freed last week by a presidential pardon to mark the country\u2019s April New Year celebrations. A Navy vessel transported the group from Yangon to western Rakhine state, where most Rohingya live under tight movement restrictions and in conditions Amnesty International has condemned as \u201capartheid\u201d. More than 600 disembarked near state capital Sittwe, while another 200 were taken further north to townships on the border with Bangladesh, state immigration department chief Soe Lwin told AFP. \u201cThey will be quarantined,\u201d he added, without giving further details. Some small shops in Germany reopened on Monday as the country took a cautious step toward returning to normal, though Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a stark warning against complacency in the face of the pandemic. From florists to fashion stores, the majority of shops smaller than 800 square metres (8,600 square feet) were allowed to welcome customers again in a first wave of scaling back lockdown measures introduced last month. Merkel and regional state premiers announced the decision to reopen last week, but were careful to cast it as a cautious first step. The government is facing increasing pressure to ease restrictions, especially from industries eager to get business back on track. Merkel said Monday she was \u201cgreatly concerned\u201d the public could let its guard down too fast, speaking in a telephone conference with leaders from her centre-right CDU party. She urged the public to maintain social distancing measures, such as keeping 1.5 metres (five feet) apart and avoiding gatherings of more than two people, voicing her \u201cscepticism\u201d and \u201chuge concern\u201d over the population\u2019s discipline. In the UK, Prince Philip, the 98-year-old husband of Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth, made a rare statement on Monday to thank those involved in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. As we approach World Immunisation Week, I wanted to recognise the vital and urgent work being done by so many to tackle the pandemic; by those in the medical and scientific professions, at universities and research institutions, all united in working to protect us from Covid-19. On behalf of those of us who remain safe and at home, I also wanted to thank all key workers who ensure the infrastructure of our life continues; the staff and volunteers working in food production and distribution, those keeping postal and delivery services going, and those ensuring the rubbish continues to be collected. Philip, who is staying with the queen at her Windsor Castle home during the outbreak, retired from public life in May 2017 and has been rarely seen in public since then. The Swiss death toll from the new coronavirus has reached 1,142, the country\u2019s public health ministry said on Monday, rising from 1,135 people on Sunday. The number of positive tests also increased to 27,944 from 27,740 on Sunday, it said. The slowdown in the number of new cases has allowed the Swiss government to start relaxing its lockdown restrictions from April 27. The Spanish government will propose to its EU partners that they create a 1.5 trillion euro ($1.63 trillion) recovery fund financed through perpetual debt to aid countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, a discussion paper shows. Prime minister Pedro Sanchez will outline the proposal to his European colleagues during a summit on Thursday, in a bid to lead the negotiations looking for an acceptable solution after the Netherlands and Germany ruled out common debt issuance, a foreign ministry source told to Reuters. The new fund proposed by Spain would be financed by perpetual debt backed by the EU budget, and countries would count it as transfers and not debt. \u201cIt would be a different mutualisation scheme than we had in mind...but it is an option that can be agreed by all,\u201d the source said. The European Commission would act as the main borrower in the scheme that would use the EU budget as a last resort to leverage the new debt. The Spanish proposal is aligned with that presented by EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn. According to the three-page Spanish discussion paper, seen by Reuters, the transfer of funds should be front-loaded to start on the first day of 2021 and be executed during the next two to three years. Sri Lanka\u2019s election commission is meeting with government officials on Monday to discuss ways to avoid a possible constitutional crisis if the country fails to hold parliamentary elections before a mandated deadline of June 2 because of the coronavirus. The commission must decide whether to hold the polls, which could expose more people to the virus, or let the country plunge into its second constitutional crisis in less than two years. Sri Lanka reported 24 new infections on Monday, its most in a single day. It now has a total of 295 confirmed cases, with seven deaths and 96 recoveries. We will be dealing with legal questions and whether it is safe, said Ratnajeevan Hoole, one of three election commissioners. Hello. I am going to be running the live blog for the rest of the day, bringing you the latest news and updates from around the world. Please stay in touch and share any information with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com China has again hit back at international criticism of its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, on Sunday called for an independent investigation into the source of the pandemic and \u201cthe openness with which information was shared\u201d by China, amid concern that officials covered-up the true extent of the virus before it spread around the world. But in Beijing on Monday, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Payne\u2019s remarks were \u201centirely without factual basis\u201d and that questioning the country\u2019s transparency was unfounded and showed a lack of respect for the sacrifices of its people. \u201cChina expresses deep concern and resolute opposition to this,\u201d Shuang told reporters during a daily briefing. On the theme of lockdown restrictions being eased, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent Kim Willsher has more from France: French schools will begin to open next month but the return to classes will be gradual, the prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe has said. In an address last week, Emmanuel Macron announced nurseries, primary and secondary schools would reopen on 11 May. Philippe reiterated the president\u2019s fears that certain children were unable to work from home and for \u201csocial reasons\u201d were falling through the cracks, saying it would be a \u201cserious danger for the nation if they were lost\u201d, but said it was out of the question that all classes opened at once. Philippe said: Our aim is to find a good method and that method will be progressive. They will not open everywhere on 11 May \u2026 but we have to start opening schools for the continuity of national life. Philippe said the government was considering various options, including having half a class in rotation, or opening schools in areas where there have been few or no Covid-19 cases before others. Asked about teachers who had threatened to stay off work for fear of catching the virus in schools, Philippe said the coronavirus crisis had shown that many jobs dismissed as low level, from cleaners to supermarket shelf-stackers, had shown themselves to be essential. \u201cTeachers are also essential,\u201d he said. The key to ending the lockdown was the rate of contamination \u2013 meaning how many people one person contaminated with the virus would pass it on to \u2013 Philippe said. The lockdown had led to fewer contacts, bringing the contamination rate down to one contaminated person spreading the disease to 0.6 others. When the lockdown is lifted the authorities will be looking at keeping the rate at one person contaminating at the most one other, the PM added. However, he warned the French not to plan too far ahead, saying weddings, parties, and travel outside of France were not immediately on the cards. \u201cI don\u2019t have answers today \u2026 given the barrier rules, it doesn\u2019t seem reasonable that a marriage of say 200 people gathered in a confined place is to be envisaged. For how long I don\u2019t know,\u201d Philippe said. During the marathon two-hour 15-minute press conference, he promised the government would give detailed plans of how the end of the lockdown would happen in the next two weeks. Spain has reported 399 coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, lower than Sunday\u2019s figure of 410 and confirming the downward trend. A total of 20,852 people have died of the disease in Spain, with over 200,000 infected and more than 80,000 cured. Spanish PM Pedro S\u00e1nchez is expected to ask parliament tomorrow to extend the lockdown until 11 May. As of 27 April, it\u2019s expected that parents will be allowed to take children under 12 years old out for exercise, though there are complaints that this leaves 12- to 16-year-olds in limbo. There are no signs as yet of lifting the restrictions under which people are only permitted to leave their houses to go to work, to buy food or for medical reasons, although there is growing pressure to allow people out for short periods of exercise. As world leaders grapple with the competing needs of public health and struggling economies, a growing number have begun easing their lockdown restrictions in the past 24 hours. In Australia, three of Sydney\u2019s beaches were cautiously reopened on Monday but only for exercise. \u201cActivities such as sitting on the sand, sun-baking or gathering in groups will not be permitted,\u201d said the local mayor Danny Said. India allowed some industrial and agricultural work to resume, even as the country recorded its single biggest-day rise in coronavirus cases. In Iran, where the outbreak has killed at least 5,000 people, some social distancing rules were relaxed last week and on Monday some major shopping centres and inner-city highways were reopened. Stores from high-end malls to the meandering alleyways of Tehran\u2019s historic Grand Bazaar opened their doors, the Associated Press reports, though the government limited their working hours until 6 pm. Restaurants, gyms and other locations remain closed. In Europe, Germany, Poland, Norway, the Czech Republic and Albania are beginning to ease their lockdowns \u2013 though France and Spain have decided against relaxing measures at this stage. Beijing and the Hong Kong government are using the pandemic as a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to crack down on dissent and the growing pro-democracy movement, according to a senior protest leader arrested over the weekend. My colleague Helen Davidson has spoken with Lee Cheuk Yan, a veteran politician and activist who was arrested along with 14 other high-profile people on Saturday. The arrests came amid a series of acts by authorities seen as alarming intrusions on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, ahead of elections in September. Lee told the Guardian the arrests \u2013 which were condemned by the UK, US and Australian governments and human rights groups \u2013 would have had people \u201cpouring out on to the street to protest\u201d in normal times. \u201cBut \u2026 Hong Kong people are very alert to the concern of infection, so they are using the chance of the pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a golden opportunity for them.\u201d Read the full report here. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Afghanistan has passed 1,000, triggered by an increase of infections in the capital Kabul, my colleague Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. The health ministry said there had been 30 new cases and three deaths in the past 24 hours, pushing to total number of infections to 1,026 and fatalities to 36. The government also confirmed that a fourth doctor had died from Covid-19 in the country and that 110 health workers have so far been tested positive (more than one in 10 of the total number of cases). Afghanistan is struggling with a shortage of diagnostic testing equipment known as \u201cRNA extraction kits\u201d, which scientists use to isolate the RNA (ribonucleic acid) in samples of the novel coronavirus. Over the weekend, Ferozuddin Feroz, the country\u2019s health minister, said that Afghanistan, a country of about 30 million, has about 50,000 testing kits \u201cbut RNA extraction kits are not enough\u201d. He added that talks are being held with Chinese and Japanese officials about the issue. The ministry\u2019s spokesman said Afghanistan will receive 5,000 RNA extraction kits from World Health Organization on Monday and \u201cwe have also started rapid testing and hope to get some 100,000 more kits from several countries in the future\u201d. Singapore has confirmed an additional 1,426 cases of Covid-19 infection, a record daily jump that took the city-state\u2019s tally to 8,014. Its health ministry said the vast majority of the new cases were among migrant workers living in dormitories. As many as 90% of infections have reportedly been linked to these workers. Singapore\u2019s number of deaths currently stands at 11. The latest rise means the city-state, which has a population of 5.6 million, has seen its total confirmed cases soar from 2,800 to more than 8,000 in the past seven days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The table below from World in Data shows that Singapore has one of the highest rates of infections in Asia as a proportion of its population, with 555 cases per 1 million people. This is higher than Kuwait and Armenia, which have slightly smaller populations, but much lower than Qatar, which has 1,189 cases per million people and has a similarly high number of migrant workers. Hong Kong authorities have reported zero new cases of Covid-19 today. The last time Hong Kong had no new cases was on 5 March. After initially keeping the number of people infected with Covid-19 below 100 in the first months of the outbreak, Hong Kong saw big rises in confirmed cases after people began returning from overseas in March. It has now recorded 1,026 cases of Covid-19. The daily rate of new cases has been in the single figures for over a week. The city is currently under strict - but sometimes complicated- social distancing rules, including no more than four people gathering together. Bars, pubs and clubs, as well as gyms, game halls, and beauty parlours are closed. The Spanish government is to propose that the European Union create a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) fund to aid recovery in countries worst-hit by the coronavirus crisis, Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper is reporting. Citing an internal document, the paper reports that Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez plans to make a formal proposal to his EU colleagues during a summit on Thursday. The fund proposed by the Spanish government would be financed by perpetual debt raised by the 27-country EU and the cash sent to the different countries would count as transfers and not debt, the newspaper said. India has recorded its biggest single-day rise in coronavirus cases, the Associated Press reports. as the government eased one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns. An additional 1,553 cases were reported over the past 24 hours, raising the total past 17,000. At least 543 people have died and epidemiologists forecast the peak may not be reached before June. The shelter-in-place orders imposed in India on 24 March have halted all but essential services. But from Monday, limited industry and farming were allowed to resume where employers could meet social distancing and hygiene norms. Migrant workers were also allowed to travel within states to factories, farms and other work sites. If you\u2019ve not yet had a chance, please do take a moment to read this superb report from the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, from Wuhan in China\u2019s Hubei province. As Wuhan and the rest of China slowly returns to normal, Kuo reports on a residual anger towards the government. The outbreak \u2013 which has claimed the lives of at least 4,000 people in China, most of them in Wuhan \u2013 has left a \u201csmall but significant group of residents\u201d in the city \u201cseeking answers, compensation or simply an apology from officials who took weeks to notify the public of the threat\u201d from the virus. You can read the piece in full here. In the last few hours, the World Health Organization has published a tally of new confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths in the Western Pacific Nations. Japan, which initially appeared to have the virus under control, reported 390 new cases on Sunday \u2013 taking its total to 10,751 and fatalities to 171. In China, where the rate of infection has fallen sharply, 12 new cases were reported \u2013 down from 16 a day earlier. Of the 12, eight were imported, China\u2019s national health commission said. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s global liveblog on the coronavirus pandemic. This is Josh Halliday in Manchester, UK, and I\u2019ll be steering you through the next few hours. I will be handing over to my colleagues in London shortly, but if you are just joining this blog and want to get up to speed quickly, you can find our latest edition of Coronavirus\u2013 at a glance, below. In case you missed our coverage of Trump\u2019s press conference earlier, here he is telling a reporter who challenged him to keep her voice down. CBS reporter Weijia Jiang asked Trump why he waited so long \u201cto warn people the virus was spreading like wildfire\u201d in February \u201cinstead of holding rallies with thousands of people?\u201d An irritated Trump touted his China travel ban as proof he acted fast. Jiang persisted with her point and said: \u201cWhen you issued the ban, the virus was already here,\u201d to which Trump said: \u201cDo your research.\u201d And from the same press briefing, you can see Trump reading out positive news stories on his administration\u2019s handling of the crisis, as the US death toll passed 40,000. There\u2019s a lot of commentary and some anger today in the British press over delays supply of vital protective equipment for hospitals. The Times focuses on the lockdown and the Telegraph leads on problems with stay-at-home schooling. As I mentioned earlier, US oil prices dipped to a 20-year low as deep concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus continue. You can read Martin Farrer\u2019s global wrap of events below: Oil prices have slumped to their lowest for two decades as doubts grew about Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of ending the US lockdown and investors braced for a week of potentially damaging figures about the impact of the coronavirus on the world economy. The price of US crude oil plunged almost 20%, to below $15, in early trading on Monday \u2013 its lowest point since 1999 \u2013 as stockpiles continued to build owing to a crash in demand caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Concerns have been heightened by the growing standoff between the US president and state governors over whether the US can begin to lift restrictions on movement and businesses. It came as the heads of all the UN\u2019s major agencies issued a graphic warning of the risk of coronavirus to the world\u2019s most vulnerable countries after disclosing that international donors had pledged only around a quarter of the $2bn the UN requested for its emergency Covid-19 response in March. At a daily media briefing that grew increasingly tetchy, Trump said on Sunday night that 4.18 million Americans had been tested for the coronavirus and that the widespread operation was paving the way for parts of the country to reopen for business. \u201cThat\u2019s a record anywhere in the world,\u201d he claimed. But governors accused the president of being \u201cdelusional\u201d and said they could not embark on Trump\u2019s recommended three-phrase programme to ease stay-at-home restrictions because the testing regime was still not good enough. Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, a Democrat, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union he had been \u201cfighting\u201d for testing. \u201cFor the national level to say that we have what we need, and really to have no guidance to the state levels, is just irresponsible, because we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Maryland\u2019s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, agreed and said it was \u201cabsolutely false\u201d to say that governors had enough testing capacity. Despite the huge fall in the oil price \u2013 seen as a barometer of the prospects for the global economy \u2013 there were signs from other parts of the world that economies could soon begin getting back to normal. In Germany, smaller shops were set to reopen on Monday for the first time in a month after politicians declared the coronavirus \u201cunder control\u201d. From florists to fashion stores, the majority of shops smaller than 800 square metres (8,600 square feet) will be allowed to welcome customers again, in a first wave of relaxations to strict curbs on public life introduced last month. Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional state premiers announced the decision to reopen last week, though they have been careful to cast it as no more than a cautious first step. On the other side of the world, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the country\u2019s stringent lockdown would be eased next Monday barring any major upsets. She said the measures had \u201cstopped a wave of devastation\u201d but even under the revised regime, most New Zealanders would still be required to stay at home most of the time. Meal deliveries would be permitted and shops would be allowed to re-open providing they only sell goods online. In Australia, some beaches in Sydney were reopened in a sign that the country was moving towards normalising daily life. The government wants at least 40% of the population to download a tracing app on their phones to help track cases of the disease before lockdown curbs are eased. Here\u2019s some more from Justin McCurry in Toyko on Kentaro Iwata, an expert in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, who has cast doubt on the Olympics in Japan being able to go ahead next year. Iwata warned that Japan\u2019s hospitals were struggling to deal with Covid-19 patients, adding that the government\u2019s response to the recent rise in infections had been too slow. He said Japan\u2019s initial approach \u2013 to identify and contain infection clusters \u2013 had worked well until major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka started reporting significant rises in cases from the second half of March. \u201cJapan\u2019s government should have changed strategy earlier,\u201d Iwata said, referring to the shift to wider testing combined with social distancing. \u201cThere was a tremendous delay and that has caused huge problems,\u201d he said. Hospitals initially designated to treat patients with the illness had become unable to deal with the growing number of cases, leaving other hospitals unprepared to fill the treatment gap. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t prepared and your staff aren\u2019t trained, you can\u2019t just admit Covid-19 patients,\u201d Iwata said. \u201cMany hospitals are not ready to fight against Covid-19. That\u2019s why [there have been reports] of ambulances going from one hospital to another\u201d in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe and other cities. He added: \u201cWe needed to change strategy immediately, but traditionally, Japan isn\u2019t good at doing that. When we have a plan A we are poor at converting it into a plan B. Bureaucrats don\u2019t like admitting that their original plan failed \u2013 that was the main shortcoming.\u201d Japan has so far avoided a catastrophic outbreak \u2013 with a large number of deaths \u2013 seen in the US and some European countries, with just over 10,000 cases and around 160 deaths, according to the health ministry. Tokyo reported 107 new infections on Sunday, bringing the total in the capital to more than 3,000 - the highest among the country\u2019s 47 prefectures. To relieve pressure on hospitals, the government has secured 210,000 hotel rooms around the country to accommodate patients with mild or no symptoms, Kyodo news agency said. \u201cI\u2019m half encouraged and half discouraged,\u201d Iwata said of the situation in Japan. \u201cI\u2019m relieved to see newly infected people is relatively stable. My biggest fear was that we would have thousands of daily cases like New York, which hasn\u2019t happened. Even if testing rates have been low in Japan, these numbers are much better than the worst-case scenario.\u201d The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other areas in early April that has since been widened to cover the entire country. Local governors can request that people stay home and that nonessential businesses close, but there are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance. In Tokyo, many places have closed their doors, but some bars, restaurants and cafes remain open, with many of the city\u2019s streets far from empty. Iwata said the lack of urgency implicit in the measures meant people still hadn\u2019t understood the importance of staying home and social distancing. \u201cThe government didn\u2019t send the right message to people \u2013 that you need to distance yourself from others to block the route of transmission. And the most effective way to stop transmissions is a lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cJapan doesn\u2019t have the legal means to enforce a lockdown, but that doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 you can still tell people what they should and shouldn\u2019t do. That could have been communicated continuously and effectively, even without penalties in place.\u201d Here\u2019s a summary of the main points on coronavirus today: Global infections stand at 2,404,071 and deaths at 165,229. US deaths passed 40,000 on Sunday \u2013 nearly a quarter of the global total \u2013 with infections at just under 760,000, or just under a third of the world\u2019s total. President Trump said some governors had \u2018gone too far\u2019 in their lockdown restrictions in a bad-tempered press briefing in which he clashed with several reporters. The president again criticised the WHO and China over the pandemic but also said he was prepared to give Iran help to fight the virus. Domestically, he said a deal on aid for businesses was close to being agreed with the Democrats. New Zealand\u2019s PM, Jacinda Ardern, has extended the country\u2019s level-4 lockdown for a week, after which schools and daycare centres will be allowed to open, as well as some businesses. She warned New Zealanders to: \u201ckeep your bubble as small as possible - you can expand your bubble a small amount to include family members, vulnerable people or caregivers\u201d. The country\u2019s virus death toll stands at 12. China reported just 12 new cases on Monday, down from 16 a day earlier, with no new deaths for the third day in a row. There were also 49 new asymptomatic cases reported on Monday. On Friday China revised its death toll up significantly, including by 50% in Wuhan. A leading Japanese infectious diseases expert says he is \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about the likelihood of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead next year. Kentaro Iwata, a professor at Kobe University Hospital said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the Olympics are likely to be held next year. People will be coming from hundreds of nations ... and although Japan might have the disease under control by next summer, I don\u2019t think that will be the case everywhere.\u201d South Korea\u2019s new cases remained under 20 for the third day in a row. On Monday it announced 13 new infections, bringing the nation\u2019s total infections to 10,674. Germany will take its first steps back towards normality on Monday, with smaller shops in some regions opening up for the first time in a month after politicians declared the coronavirus \u201cunder control\u201d. From florists to fashion stores, the majority of shops smaller than 800 square metres (8,600 square feet) will be allowed to welcome customers again, in a first wave of relaxations to strict curbs on public life introduced last month. Italy said on Sunday that deaths rose by 433, the lowest daily tally in a week, and the number of new cases slowed to 3,047 from a previous 3,491. That\u2019s a rise of just 1.7%. The total number of deaths now stands at 23,660 \u2013 second only to the United States. Iran will extend leave for prisoners for one more month, President Hassan Rouhani announced on Sunday, after the country temporarily released 100,000 detainees to combat the spread of coronavirus. Spain registered a sharp drop in its daily death toll on Sunday with 410 new fatalities. Its death toll reached 20453, with 195,344 infections. The 4,218 new cases announced on Sunday represented an increase of 2.4%. We\u2019ve heard a good deal about the protests in the US to reopen the Us economy, and President Trump tweeting \u201cLiberate\u201d in support of the rallies. here\u2019s the other side, captured in a picture from Denver, showing nurses opposing protestors. Germany takes first step in lifting coronavirus restrictions Germany will take its first steps back towards normality on Monday, with smaller shops in some regions opening up for the first time in a month after politicians declared the coronavirus \u201cunder control\u201d. From florists to fashion stores, the majority of shops smaller than 800 square metres (8,600 square feet) will be allowed to welcome customers again, in a first wave of relaxations to strict curbs on public life introduced last month. Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional state premiers announced the decision to reopen last week, though they have been careful to cast it as no more than a cautious first step. While the first shops will open their doors on Monday, each of Germany\u2019s 16 states is set to lift the restrictions at a slightly different pace. In some states such as the capital Berlin, reopening will take a little longer. Merkel, who has been praised for her handling of the coronavirus crisis, is hoping to reinvigorate the ailing German economy, which officially entered into recession last week. Germany has been one of the countries worst hit by Covid-19, with 139,897 confirmed cases and 4,294 deaths as of Sunday, but also one of the quickest to react. On Friday, the Robert Koch Institute for public health announced that the rate of infection - the number of people each ill person contaminates - had dropped below one for the first time, leading Health Minister Jens Spahn to declare the virus \u201cunder control\u201d. Yet Merkel has warned that Germany\u2019s success remains \u201cfragile\u201d. A ban on gatherings of more than two people and a requirement to stand more than 1.5 metres apart from others in public areas remain in force. Cultural venues, bars, leisure centres and beauty salons will also remain closed for the time being, while large-scale public events such as concerts and football matches have been banned until 31 August. Schools will also be partially reopened in the coming weeks, with most states set to welcome back older students from 4 May. Germany hopes to combine the lifting of restrictions with a more efficient tracing of the spread of Cobid-19. The country hopes to ramp up testing - it has already tested around two million people - and aims to produce around 50 million protective masks a week from August. Though not yet obligatory, Merkel said her government \u201cstrongly advises\u201d wearing a mask in public. A Japanese specialist in infectious diseases has said he is \u201cvery pessimistic\u201d about the likelihood of the Tokyo Olympics going ahead next year. Speaking to journalists in an online briefing on Monday, Kentaro Iwata, a professor at Kobe University Hospital, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the Olympics are likely to be held next year. People will be coming from hundreds of nations ... and although Japan might have the disease under control by next summer, I don\u2019t think that will be the case everywhere.\u201d Iwata, who was critical of the Japanese government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in February, added: \u201cIn that sense I am very pessimistic about holding the Games next summer, unless they are held in a different way, such as with no spectators or in limited numbers.\u201d Iwata is not the first expert to question Tokyo\u2019s ability to host the Games from 23 July to 8 August, 2021, after the coronavirus outbreak forced local organisers and the International Olympic Committee [IOC] to postpone them for a year. Devi Sridhar, chair of global health at the University of Edinburgh, said last week that hosting the event in just over a year\u2019s time would be \u201cvery unrealistic\u201d unless a vaccine became available. \u201cIf we do get a vaccine within the next year then actually I think that (the Olympics) is realistic,\u201d Sridhar said, according to the BBC website. \u201cThe vaccine will be the game changer - an effective, affordable, available vaccine. If we don\u2019t get a scientific breakthrough then I think that looks very unrealistic.\u201d John Coates, the head of the IOC\u2019s coordination commission, told reporters last week that it was still \u201ctoo early to say\u201d if the outbreak could further impact the Olympics, including forcing another delay or banning spectators. Here\u2019s our New Zealand reporter, Charlotte Graham-McLay, in Wellington, on Ardern\u2019s announcement: New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has announced that the country will remain at the strictest level of national lockdown for another week, before loosening restrictions marginally. \u201cWe have stopped a wave of devastation,\u201d Ardern has told a news conference, referring to the four weeks of stringent restrictions that have kept all New Zealanders at home unless they are going to supermarkets or the doctor. Twelve people have died of Covid-19 in the country. Nine new cases of the virus were recorded on Monday. The so-called \u201clevel four\u201d alert level \u2013 the strictest possible \u2013 was due to end at 23:59 on Wednesday night, after beginning on 25 March. Ardern said it would remain in place until a minute before midnight next Monday 27 April instead. After that, level 3 restrictions will be implemented, still requiring most New Zealanders to stay home most of the time. Meal deliveries will be permitted and shops will be allowed to re-open providing they only sell goods online. Schools and daycare centres will re-open, but only for children whose parents must work, and only for students up to Year 10 (about 14 years old). Everyone is required to work from home if they can. Ardern has won praise at home and globally for her decision to shut down New Zealand when just over 200 people had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and no one had died. She acknowledged that adding to the proposed four weeks of lockdown by several days would be tough for New Zealanders, but added that people had \u201csacrificed too much for us to lose those gains now.\u201d Ardern said figures showed New Zealanders with Covid-19 had passed it on to less than one person each, against a global average of 2.5 transmissions of the virus per person infected. Her government will decide on 11 May whether the level-3 alert will remain in place for longer, or whether it can be lifted to level 2 \u2013 which would give more social and business freedoms to New Zealanders. Ardern is laying out the rules of what level-three lockdown will look like. She says they include: Schools and daycares will reopen for those who need them Some businesses can reopen, but Ardern urges that people must make sure their businesses are safe for people and allow social distancing People can still go outside for exercise, and can travel to the park or beach to do so, but Ardern urges people to \u201cstay regional\u201d, to exercise as safely as possible and to stay two metres away from anyone \u201coutside their bubble\u201d People can slightly expand their social circle. But the prime minister has warned New Zealanders to: \u201ckeep your bubble as small as possible - you can expand your bubble a small amount to include family members, vulnerable people or caregivers\u201d Wash your hands, sneeze into your elbow Jacinda Ardern says New Zealand has \u201cbroken the chain of transmission\u201d, reducing the transmission rate to 0.48, meaning that each infected person infects less than half a person. Ardern has thanked all New Zealanders for their work to stop \u201cthe uncontrolled explosion of Covid-19 in New Zealand\u201d. As a result, she says the country willmove out of alert level four lockdown in a week\u2019s time - at 11:59pm on Monday 27 April. \u201cWe will hold at alert level three for two weeks and review how we are tracking,\u201d she says. Over the next week, some preparation work will be permitted, for example allowing people to re-enter their business premises to prepare for reopening. Some joyful news from Thailand now, where environmentalists say they have found the largest number of nests of rare leatherback sea turtles in two decades on beaches bereft of tourists because of the coronavirus pandemic. Thailand currently has 2,765 infections and has seen 47 Covid-related deaths and has imposed a range of restrictions on residents including a ban on international flights and an appeal to citizens to stay home. The measures have seen a collapse in tourist numbers, but freed up the beaches for wildlife. Since last November, environmentalists have found 11 nests, the highest number in 20 years. No nests of the leatherback sea turtle had been found in the five years previous. \u201cThis is a very good sign for us because many areas for spawning have been destroyed by humans,\u201d said Kongkiat Kittiwatanawong, the director of the Phuket Marine Biological Center. \u201cIf we compare to the year before, we didn\u2019t have this many spawn, because turtles have a high risk of getting killed by fishing gear and humans disturbing the beach.\u201d Leatherbacks are the world\u2019s largest sea turtles. They are considered endangered in Thailand, and listed as a vulnerable species globally by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. They lay their eggs in dark and quiet areas, scarce when tourists thronged the beaches. People have also been known to dig into their nests and steal eggs. In case you missed it, the Guardian\u2019s Edward Hellmore writes that New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, stepped up his campaign for increased federal funding for US cities during the coronavirus crisis, asking Donald Trump whether his administration was \u201cgoing to save New York City or are you telling New York City to drop dead?\u201d De Blasio\u2019s dramatic language came during his press conference on Sunday, after he warned last week that he planned to cut a further $2bn from the city\u2019s municipal services budget due to the economic downturn. He said the city was likely to lose at least $7.4bn in tax revenue over the current and next fiscal year. De Blasio has criticized the $2tn coronavirus relief package that Trump signed last month, saying New York only received $1.4bn from the stimulus, compared with around $58bn for the airline industry. He has called for the next package, which congressional and administration leaders say they are \u201cclose\u201d to reaching a deal on, to include tens of billions for states, cities and municipalities. You can read the full story on this by below: I mentioned earlier the details of President Trump\u2019s combative White House briefing, during which he played a clip of New York\u2019s governor Andrew Cuomo. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith in Washington writes ... Donald Trump has been accused of using another White House coronavirus task force briefing to broadcast a \u201ccampaign ad\u201d in which New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, one of his most trenchant critics, appeared to shower him with praise. The US president dimmed the lights and played two selectively edited videos on screens behind the briefing room podium featuring Cuomo, whose state has been hardest hit by the deadly pandemic. \u201cWhat the federal government did, working with states ... was a phenomenal accomplishment,\u201d the governor said in the first clip. \u201cThese were just extraordinary efforts and acts of mobilisation, and the federal government stepped up and was a great partner, and I\u2019m the first to say it. We needed help and they were there.\u201d But the films were played just two days after Cuomo, who has emerged as one of the most prominent Democrats during the crisis, eviscerated Trump in scathing 15-minute remarks. \u201cFirst of all, if he\u2019s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. \u201cSecond, let\u2019s keep emotion and politics out of this and personal ego if we can because this is about the people and our job and let\u2019s try to focus on that.\u201d You can read David Smith\u2019s full story below. South Korea reported fewer than 20 new cases of coronavirus for the third day in a row. On Monday it announced 13 new infections, bringing the nation\u2019s total infections to 10,674. On Sunday the country reported single-digit figures (8) of new cases, for the first time in two months. The country\u2019s centre for disease control said seven of those cases came from overseas. Chinese state media is reporting that the mega city of Shanghai will hold a late night shopping festival in May to boost consumption. Guatemala\u2019s President Alejandro Giammattei says a total of 50 migrants deported from the United States have tested positive for coronavirus, including 14 sent to the Central American nation on a flight on Tuesday. Most of the Guatemalan deportees that have tested positive for coronavirus arrived from the United States on a Monday flight. US crude crashed to below $15 a barrel on Monday, its lowest level for over two decades, as concerns about a virus-triggered demand shock and lack of storage eclipsed an output cut deal. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US benchmark, fell more than 19% to $14.73 a barrel in early Asian trade, before markets steadied and it clawed back some ground to $15.78 a barrel. International benchmark Brent dropped 4.1%to $26.93 a barrel, before rising and stabilising at $28.11. Oil markets have plunged in recent weeks as lockdowns and travel restrictions to fight the coronavirus around the world batter demand for the commodity. The crisis was compounded after Saudi Arabia, kingpin of exporting group OPEC, launched a price war with non-OPEC member Russia. Riyadh and Moscow drew a line under their dispute earlier this month when they and other countries agreed to cut output by almost 10m barrels a day to boost virus-hit markets. But prices have continued to fall heavily, with analysts saying the cuts will not be enough to make up for massive falls in demand caused by the pandemic. An aid worker employed by humanitarian agency Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) died in the northeast Nigerian state of Borno after contracting the new coronavirus, a spokesman for the organisation has said. Reuters reports that Borno is at the centre of one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, spawned by a decade-long Islamist militant insurgency that has left 7 million people in need of aid. The death of an aid worker in a part of Africa\u2019s most populous country where camps house many of the roughly two million people displaced by the insurgency will prompt fears of Covid-19 spreading among malnourished people, many of whom suffer from other diseases. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said on Sunday thatit had recorded a cumulative total of 627 confirmed cases and 21 deaths \u2013 including one in Borno. On Saturday it was announced that the chief of staff of Nigeria\u2019s President Buhari had died from Covid-19. Abba Kyari was the top official aide to Buhari and one of the most powerful men in Nigeria. Like Buhari, he was in his 70s, and he had underlying health conditions, including diabetes. More than 150 Australian economists on Monday warned the government against easing social distancing rules aimed at halting the spread of the new coronavirus even as the rate of infections slowed to a multi-week low. Australia has so far avoided the high numbers of coronavirus casualties reported around the world after closing its borders and imposing restrictions on public movement. On Monday, its two most populous states reported just seven new cases in the previous 24 hours: six in New South Wales and only one new case in Victoria. It\u2019s the lowest number of new infections since four were recorded on 10 March. The economists issued an open letter to call on the government to prioritise containing the spread of coronavirus. \u201cWe cannot have a functioning economy unless we first comprehensively address the public health crisis,\u201d the group of 157 economists from Australian universities wrote. There are 6,612 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Australia. Seventy people have died. Debate in the country has turned to the yet to be launched tracing ap, which the government wants Australians to take up to help monitor Covid-19 when restrictions are lifted .... and in Sydney, residents in the city\u2019s east have welcomed the reopening of several beaches in the Randwick council areas \u2013 Clovelly, Coogee and Maroubra \u2013 for exercise only. The city\u2019s famous Bondi Beach remains closed. You can follow all of our Australian updates on the Australian live blog here. Novak Djokovic, the 17 time grand slam tennis champion, says he\u2019s \u201copposed\u201d to vaccination and would face a difficult choice if one became available for Covid-19. Reuters reports that during live Facebook chat with several fellow Serbian athletes, Djokovic, who most recently won the Australian Open in January, said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to be forced\u201d to receive a vaccine. \u201cPersonally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn\u2019t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\u201d Djokovic reportedly \u201cBut if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don\u2019t know. \u201cHypothetically, if the season was to resume in July, August or September, though unlikely, I understand that a vaccine will become a requirement straight after we are out of strict quarantine and there is no vaccine yet. China has published its daily figures for the virus, reporting 12 new cases for 19 April, down from 16 a day earlier, with no new deaths for the third day in a row. There were also 49 new asymptomatic cases reported on Monday. Of the total new cases , eight were imported, down from nine on the previous day, the National Health Commission said in its daily bulletin. There were four cases of local infection, including three in the northeastern border province of Heilongjiang and one in Inner Mongolia. On Friday China revised its death toll up significantly, including by 50% in Wuhan. It came after weeks of scepticism, from both within and outside China, over the officially reported figures. Officials said Friday\u2019s revision was the result of incorrect or delayed reporting and not because information had been suppressed. The number of deaths caused by the novel coronavirus in the Netherlands rose by 83, Dutch health authorities said on Sunday, which was the smallest reported daily increase since 26 March . The total number of deaths among people known to have been infected with the coronavirus increased to 3,684, while the number of confirmed infections rose by 1,066 to 32,655. France reports another 395 coronavirus deaths, as hospital admissions continue to decline. The new deaths \u2013 227 in hospitals and 168 in nursing homes \u2013 brought France\u2019s total epidemic death toll to 19,718. More than 12,000 have died in the pandemic. A total of 30,610 people were being treated for a coronavirus infection in hospital, 29 fewer overall than the day before as hospitalisations declined for the fifth day in a row. The prime minister, Edouard Philippe, told the briefing that the country\u2019s nationwide lockdown since 17 March was starting to bear fruit. \u201cWe are scoring points against the epidemic,\u201d he said, adding the \u201csituation is improving progressively, slowly, but surely. However, he insisted, \u201cwe are not out of the health crisis yet.\u201d Spain registered a sharp drop in its daily death toll on Sunday with 410 new fatalities \u2013 the lowest in almost a month, Agence France-Presse reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a number that gives us hope,\u201d said health ministry emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we are under 500 dead since the daily tolls began to climb.\u201d The total number of fatalities in Spain, the third hardest-hit country in the world after the United States and Italy, has reached 20,453, the health ministry said. Infections rose to 195,344, with 4,218 new cases in the past 24 hours, an increase of just 2.4%. But Simon admitted the daily fall could be explained by the lower registration of fatalities over the weekend. Such a drop is often followed by a rise at the start of the week. Nevertheless, he said that the number of deaths, hospital and intensive care admissions were on a downward trend \u201cwhich clearly indicates that the transmission of the disease has substantially decreased.\u201d Health Minister Salvador Illa also said Spain had achieved its objective of \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of transmissions. The latest figures have given some relief to the country\u2019s overwhelmed health system.In Madrid, regional president Isabel Diaz Ayuso said a makeshift morgue set up at an ice rink would close on Wednesday. And one unit of a field hospital that was set up inside Madrid\u2019s conference centre to treat up to 1,500 people with coronavirus was closed on Friday. The Spanish authorities believe the country reached the peak of the pandemic on 2 April when they had counted 950 deaths in 24 hours. But they are not ready to recommend a lifting of the nationwide lockdown, one of the tightest in Europe. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Saturday announced he would ask parliament to extend the lockdown by two weeks to 9 May . The restrictions currently in place would however be loosened slightly to allow children time outside from 27 April, Sanchez said. Italy\u2019s official daily toll from coronavirus edged down to 433 on Sunday, the lowest figure in one week. The total number of deaths reported by the civil protection services since the start of Italy\u2019s health crisis in February now stands at 23,660 \u2013 second only to the United States, which has more than 40,000 deaths. Sunday\u2019s figure in Europe\u2019s worst affected nation was the second lowest in one month. The 3,047 new virus infections represented a rise of just 1.7%. Agence France-Press reports that the new infection rate is being watched close by Italian government as it deliberates on how to exit its lockdown imposed over the first half of March. The current restrictions are due to be lifted on 4 May, and the government is trying to determine which businesses to allow to resume operations, and whether to let people out of their homes. The conference has now wrapped up. One of the last things Trump was asked about was whether he has been inciting violence by calling for people to liberate states. \u201cThey\u2019ve got cabin fever,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to get back. They want their life back. Their life was taken away from them. And you know, they learned a lot during this period. They learned to do things differently than they have in the past and they\u2019ll do it hopefully until the virus has passed. And when the virus passes, I hope we\u2019re going to be sitting next to each other at baseball games, football games, basketball games, ice hockey games. I hope we\u2019re going to be sitting next to each other. The Masters is going to have 100,000 people, not 25 people watching at the course.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many American flags at a rally as I\u2019ve seen at these rallies. These people love our country. They want to get back to work. Things are really going downhill at the White House briefing. CNN\u2019s reporter has just asked Trump if he was duped by President Xi on the virus. \u201cYou people are so pathetic at CNN\u201d is Trump\u2019s response. In terms of actual news from this press conference, the top line seems to be that he says a deal with the Democrats is close on the latest relief bill for small businesses and workers ... and could be resolved as soon as tomorrow. Trump also criticised the WHO and China for their handling of the pandemic and implied that the World Trade Organization hadn\u2019t been doing a very good job either. And he said he would offer Iran aid over the virus if asked. We\u2019re going to get straight into Donald Trump\u2019s daily news conference, where angry exchanges with journalists are continuing in the question and answer phase. He\u2019s just been asked by a CNN journalist why he (Trump) finds it necessary to play video clips in his conferences praising his response to the virus. Trump is very unhappy about the question. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is I\u2019m standing up for the men and women that have done such an incredible job,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing is about me.\u201d He continued: \u201cYou are fake news, you are CNN,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re never going to treat me fairly, many of you. And I understand that. I got here with the worst, most unfair press treatment they say in the history of the United States for a president. They did say Abraham Lincoln had very bad treatment, too.\u201d This followed two angry exchanges with female journalists. One asked him why he didn\u2019t warn Americans about the virus earlier. Trump responded by asking the reporter which network she was from (CBS). She followed up her question and he tells her to \u201crelax\u201d. He didn\u2019t answer and went back to his stock answer that he put a ban on flights from China in the end of January. He then got quite angry. In a back and forth with the reporter, Trump told her to \u201ckeep your voice down\u201d, then raised his voice over her, including saying that she should say to him \u201cthank you very much for (my) good judgement\u201d. He has since digressed to what he calls the poor treatment of General Michael Flynn, who was briefly a national security adviser to the president. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador before Trump took office and the president is considering pardoning him. Trump says the FBI treated him badly and describes the FBI as \u201chuman scum\u201d. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Here\u2019s a summary of the main news to get us started: The global death toll is approaching 165,000, according to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The total number of infections worldwide is at 2,394,291. President Trump criticises the WHO, China and World Trade Organization at his daily press conference, and also says he would be prepared to give aid to Iran over the pandemic. US deaths have passed 40,000, with more than 755,000 infections. US governors have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting tensions between the president and state leaders over coronavirus testing and pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures. Italy said on Sunday that deaths from the coronavirus pandemic rose by 433, the lowest daily tally in a week, and the number of new cases slowed to 3,047 from a previous 3,491. Turkey\u2019s death toll has passed 2,000, with the announcement of 127 new deaths bringing the official death toll to 2,017. Poland recorded its biggest spike in coronavirus cases on Sunday with 545 new infections registered, a day before the country plans to ease some of its restrictions. Iran will extend leave for prisoners for one more month, President Hassan Rouhani announced on Sunday, after the country temporarily released 100,000 detainees to combat the spread of coronavirus. Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and US president Donald Trump have agreed on a phone call to cooperate in protecting healthcare and economies from the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. The British government will charter flights to repatriate the most vulnerable Britons stranded in New Zealand this week. France has doubled its production of face masks from 4m to 8m a week and there are now enough for essential healthcare and frontline staff. Peru has reported over 15,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest tally in Latin America after Brazil. The country has reported a total of 15,628 cases and 400 deaths, according to the health ministry. Tunisia is extending its lockdown to 4 May, then it will ease restrictions gradually on some economic activities, prime minister Elyes Fakhfakh has said. Thousands of Israelis have demonstrated against prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu while maintaining social distancing measures, calling on Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party not to join in a coalition led by a premier charged with corruption.
