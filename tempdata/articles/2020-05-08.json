It enjoyed 120 consecutive months of job growth and the lowest unemployment rate it saw in many years. It was making measurable progress in paying down pension obligations. </p> <p>Three months later, said Newsom, the state is facing a shortfall of tens of billions. </p> <p>Almost $12 billion in unemployment has been released just since March 15. Those job losses will soon trickle down to local governments, making messes out of next year\u2019s budgets and forcing tough decisions. </p> <p>Every budget around the globe will in some way be impacted by the pandemic, but the losses have outsized impact in a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world. </p> <p>\u201cThis moment is directly related to COVID-19, not mismanagement. But because of this pandemic, these revenue shortfalls are bigger than even the state of California,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. This will be challenging ... But my optimism is conditioned on this: more federal support,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Moving forward will require a historic level of partnership between states and federal governments, he said. While the CARES Act has been profoundly beneficial, the enormity of the moment demands even more support. </p> <p>\u201cThis is bigger than all of us and we really need the fed government to do more and help us through this moment. We punch above our weight in this state. We\u2019ll come back stronger than ever. Because we know a lot more than we did before this crisis,\u201d Newsom said. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eb472508f08c0a2409b9c2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-07T20:53:39.107Z\">9.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California:</strong></p> <p>Coronavirus hasn\u2019t impacted each California region uniformly, and counties will be able to apply for reopening variances, or some customization of the plans, provided certain conditions are met, governor <strong>Gavin Newsom </strong>said today.</p> <p>\u201cThese counties that want to move deeper into the second phase [of reopening] have to do so with concurrence with their hospital systems, board of supervisors. We\u2019re interested in argument and will try to provide some flexibility. But it\u2019s a health-first frame,\u201d Newsom said. </p> <p>Among the conditions: health officials must attest that they\u2019ve had no more than one case per 10,000 people in the last 14 days, no deaths in the past two weeks, and that they could handle a surge in hospitalizations from coronavirus. </p> <p>They must also be able to conduct 1.5 tests for every 1,000 residents, have 15 contact tracers, or \u201cdisease detectives\u201d per 1,000 residents, can support homeless residents, and skilled nursing facilities must have a two week supply of personal protective equipment on hand. </p> <p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t meet the guidelines, we aren\u2019t able to accommodate that and will enforce in a thoughtful and judicious way.

Experts in Italy urged intensified efforts to identify new victims and trace their contacts. And France, which hasn\u2019t yet eased its lockdown, has already worked up a re-confinement plan in the event of a new wave.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be a second wave, but the problem is to which extent. Is it a small wave or a big wave? It\u2019s too early to say,\u201d said Olivier Schwartz, head of the virus unit at France\u2019s Pasteur Institute.</p> <p>In the US, with about half of the states easing their shutdowns to get their economies restarted and cellphone data showing that people are becoming restless and increasingly leaving home, public health authorities are worried.</p> <p>Many states have not put in place the robust testing that experts believe is necessary to detect and contain new outbreaks.</p> <p> And many state governors have pressed ahead before their states met one of the key benchmarks in the Trump administrations guidelines for reopening - a 14-day downward trajectory in new illnesses and infections.</p> <p>\u201cIf we relax these measures without having the proper public health safeguards in place, we can expect many more cases and, unfortunately, more deaths,\u201d said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington.</p> <p>Cases have continued to rise steadily in places such as <strong>Iowa and Missouri</strong> since the governors began reopening, while new infections have yo-yoed in <strong>Georgia, Tennessee and Texas</strong>.</p> <p>Lipkin said he is most worried about two things: the reopening of bars, where people crowd together and lose their inhibitions, and large gatherings such as sporting events, concerts and plays. The US needs testing and contact tracing resources it doesn\u2019t yet have, Lipkin said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that we are in a critical moment of this fight.

      "bodyText": "Evening Summary That\u2019s all from me, Kari Paul, for today. Here are the top news stories to be aware of as you go into the evening. The US death toll has surpassed 75,000 people, making it more than twice the second highest death toll in the UK of 30,000 deaths. On Thursday, senator and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren joined New York City officials in calling for better protections of frontline workers, including sick pay and protection for whistleblowers. In a vote of 49 to 45 on Thursday, the Senate failed to override a veto from Donald Trump of a war powers resolution limiting his authority to use military force in Iran which was proposed in response to Trump\u2019s killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. After being tapped today by Republican representative Kevin McCarthy to chair a new China task force, top GOP lawmaker Mike McCaul disclosed hundreds of thousands of dollars of family holdings in a major Chinese tech company that has been linked to censorship and surveillance. A 1996 court document obtained by The Tribune in San Luis Obispo, California indicates former Senate staffer Tara Reade told her ex-husband she was sexually harassed while working for Joe Biden in 1993. It is the first physical corroboration of Reade\u2019s accusations. Outbreaks of coronavirus around the United States have been linked to people flying from New York City, a report from the New York Times today showed. Outbreaks of coronavirus around the United States have been linked to people flying from New York City, a report from the New York Times today showed. \u201cWe now have enough data to feel pretty confident that New York was the primary gateway for the rest of the country,\u201d said Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. Some 72% of the cases in Minnesota, 78% of cases in Wisconsin, and 100% of cases in Iowa are genetically similar to those of New York City, implying that it was spread from that hotspot. New York\u2019s failure to act quickly meant the virus was spread far and wide before it could be contained, the report showed: By mid-March, when President Trump restricted travel from Europe, the restrictions were essentially pointless, the data suggest, as the disease was already spreading widely within the country. A 1996 court document obtained by The Tribune in San Luis Obispo, California indicates former Senate staffer Tara Reade told her ex-husband she was sexually harassed while working for Joe Biden in 1993. She did not specifically accuse Biden of the harassment, according to the document, nor did she make any mention of sexual assault. The document comes from Reade\u2019s then-husband Theodore Dronen, who at the time was contesting a restraining order Reade had filed against him days after he filed for divorce. Drone wrote that Reade told him of \u201ca problem she was having at work regarding sexual harassment, in U.S. Senator Joe Biden\u2019s office.\u201d The filing marks the only known written record corroborating Reade\u2019s account of sexual harassment by Biden. According to the document, Reade told Dronen she had \u201ceventually struck a deal with the chief of staff of the Senator\u2019s office and left her position.\u201d \u201cIt was obvious that this event had a very traumatic effect on (Reade), and that she is still sensitive and effected (sic) by it today,\u201d Dronen wrote. Read the full report here. Wearing a mask in public to stop the spread of coronavirus, a precaution that is the official recommendation of the Centers of Disease control and prevention, has suddenly become a political statement in our strange times. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say they\u2019re wearing a mask when leaving home, 76% to 59%, according to a recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. From the Associated Press: While not yet as loaded as a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, the mask is increasingly a visual shorthand for the debate pitting those willing to follow health officials\u2019 guidance and cover their faces against those who feel it violates their freedom or buys into a threat they think is overblown. Inconsistent messaging from various government officials and health departments have contributed to the conflict over whether to wear a mask. Health officials initially said wearing masks was unnecessary, but weeks later the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending wearing cloth masks in crowded public situations. For weeks Donald Trump has refused to wear a mask, even while touring a mask factory that requires the use of masks. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019m going to be doing it,\u201d he said of the mask recommendation, when it was first announced. After being tapped today by Republican representative Kevin McCarthy to chair a new China task force, top GOP lawmaker Mike McCaul disclosed hundreds of thousands of dollars of family holdings in a major Chinese tech company that has been linked to censorship and surveillance. The lawmaker disclosed ties to Tencent Holdings under Congressional ethics rules. The company owns Chinese social media platforms WeChat and QQ and signed a deal in Marchto collaborate with Huawei, a firm that has essentially been blacklisted by the Trump administration over security concerns. \u201cCompanies like Tencent and Huawei are espionage operations for the Chinese Communist party, masquerading as telecom companies for the 21st century,\u201d Republican Senator Ted Cruz said previously. McCaul\u2019s wife has purchased shares in the company as recent as late February, the disclosure revealed. An attorney for McCaul said that the lawmaker is not the owner of the shares. \u201cCongressman McCaul did not purchase any shares in China\u2019s Tencent Holdings or any other Chinese company,\u201d the attorney said. \u201cCongressman McCaul\u2019s wife has assets she solely owns and a third party manager made the purchase without her direction.\u201d The ties to Tencent have called into question McCaul\u2019s ability to impartially lead a panel focused on scrutinizing China. In a statement, McCaul described his mission in being on the task force as developing \u201cnew and enduring policy solutions that, among others, enhance our economic strength and create jobs, protect our national security, rethink our supply chains and grow our competitive edge in technology.\u201d Officials say at least 138 employees at a meat packing plant in Hanford, California have tested positive for coronavirus. The company, which employs about 900 workers at two plants in Hanford and Vernon, is continuing to operate, according to the LA Times. The meat industry is facing scrutiny as more Covid-19 outbreaks emerge from factories where employees work long hours in close contact with one another, putting them at higher risk for infection. Relatives of workers are calling on the plant to close due to the high number of cases, the LA Times reported. In a vote of 49 to 45 on Thursday, the Senate failed to override a veto from Donald Trump of a war powers resolution limiting his authority to use military force in Iran. The bill was introduced by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine in February, and later passed in the House in March and came as a response to Trump killing Iranian general Qassem Soleimani without Congressional approval, leading to escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Trump vetoed the bill Wednesday night, calling it a \u201cvery insulting resolution\u201d introduced by Democrats \u201cas part of a strategy to win an election on November 3 by dividing the Republican Party.\u201d On Thursday, senator and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren joined New York City officials in calling for better protections of frontline workers. \u201cIf these essential workers are willing to get out there and put their own health at risk \u2014 sometimes putting their families\u2019 health at risk \u2014 then the very least the rest of us can do is make sure that they have some genuine protection,\u201d Warren said during a virtual town hall. \u201cThat means both medical protection and it means economic protection.\u201d Warren joined the lawmakers to push for frontline workers to receive paid sick leave, increased pay and whistleblower protections. She specifically cited Amazon\u2019s firing of several whistleblowers who protested frontline conditions in recent weeks, including Chris Smalls, who staged a walk out from a New York City area warehouse to protest lack of protections. A worker from that warehouse has since died from Covid-19. \u201cOne of the things that this Covid-19 crisis has shown us is truly who are the essential workers in our country and, guess what, it turns out it\u2019s not the investment bankers,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt turns out it\u2019s the doctors and nurses \u2014 bless them all \u2014 but it\u2019s also the people who are mopping the floors in the hospitals, the people who are making deliveries, the people who are stocking the grocery store shelves.\u201d In some lighter news, US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has jumped on the bandwagon and started to play Animal Crossing, the Nintendo game that has taken our quarantined nation by storm. After it was reported she had joined the app, Ocasio-Cortez opened up her direct messages on Twitter to allow users to give her tips on the game and invite her to their virtual \u201cislands\u201d. She said the process has granted her \u201cfaith in humanity\u201d as users took the opportunity to ask her to surprise spouses and loved ones with a virtual visit. Nurses are protesting the federal government\u2019s failure to protect frontline healthcare workers outside the White House, with lines of 88 pairs of white nurse\u2019s shoes to represent workers who have died on the job. The protest, organized by National Nurses United, comes as nurse appreciation week has fallen in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic in America. How many of these nurses died \u2026 bc our government failed to act, to lead, to protect them,\u201d protesters said, wearing masks and standing six feet apart. \u201cWe stand here today, our hearts full of pain, but also with determination and demanding action. It is past time for this president and Congress to act.\u201d The US death toll from coronavirus has now surpassed 75,000 people, according to the counter from Johns Hopkins University, marking a grim milestone in the global pandemic. Deaths in the US are the highest globally, followed by the UK at 30,000 deaths. The proceeding countries with the highest numbers of deaths are Italy with 29,958 and Spain with 26,000. The death toll is expected to continue to rise as the US begins to reopen, with up to 3,000 deaths a day forecasted. Kari Paul here, blogging from the West Coast for the next few hours. Stay tuned for more news. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Tara Reade called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race. In Reade\u2019s first on-camera interview since Biden denied her sexual assault allegation last week, the former Senate staffer said of the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, \u201cYou should not be running on character for the president of the United States.\u201d The justice department filed a motion to drop its criminal case against former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The president and his allies celebrated the move, while Democrats expressed outrage, noting that Flynn himself pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017. One of the president\u2019s personal valets has tested positive for coronavirus. The White House said Trump and Mike Pence have tested negative since they learned of the valet\u2019s positive result. Another 3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. About 33 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past seven weeks, likely foreshadowing some grim numbers for tomorrow\u2019s jobs report. The White House is reportedly blocking the release of CDC guidance on reopening businesses. According to reports, the guidance urges businesses to slowly reopen while continuing to observe social distancing, while the president has pushed for a rapid reopening despite fears of a surge in coronavirus cases. Kari will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: Even as deaths attributed to coronavirus climb higher, topping 90 deaths in the past 24 hours, according to California\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom, the state is bracing for a devastating impact to the state budget that will threaten schools and public services. Just 90 days ago, California projected a budget surplus of $6 billion. It enjoyed 120 consecutive months of job growth and the lowest unemployment rate it saw in many years. It was making measurable progress in paying down pension obligations. Three months later, said Newsom, the state is facing a shortfall of tens of billions. Almost $12 billion in unemployment has been released just since March 15. Those job losses will soon trickle down to local governments, making messes out of next year\u2019s budgets and forcing tough decisions. Every budget around the globe will in some way be impacted by the pandemic, but the losses have outsized impact in a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world. \u201cThis moment is directly related to COVID-19, not mismanagement. But because of this pandemic, these revenue shortfalls are bigger than even the state of California,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. This will be challenging ... But my optimism is conditioned on this: more federal support,\u201d he added. Moving forward will require a historic level of partnership between states and federal governments, he said. While the CARES Act has been profoundly beneficial, the enormity of the moment demands even more support. \u201cThis is bigger than all of us and we really need the fed government to do more and help us through this moment. We punch above our weight in this state. We\u2019ll come back stronger than ever. Because we know a lot more than we did before this crisis,\u201d Newsom said. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: Coronavirus hasn\u2019t impacted each California region uniformly, and counties will be able to apply for reopening variances, or some customization of the plans, provided certain conditions are met, governor Gavin Newsom said today. \u201cThese counties that want to move deeper into the second phase [of reopening] have to do so with concurrence with their hospital systems, board of supervisors. We\u2019re interested in argument and will try to provide some flexibility. But it\u2019s a health-first frame,\u201d Newsom said. Among the conditions: health officials must attest that they\u2019ve had no more than one case per 10,000 people in the last 14 days, no deaths in the past two weeks, and that they could handle a surge in hospitalizations from coronavirus. They must also be able to conduct 1.5 tests for every 1,000 residents, have 15 contact tracers, or \u201cdisease detectives\u201d per 1,000 residents, can support homeless residents, and skilled nursing facilities must have a two week supply of personal protective equipment on hand. \u201cIf they can\u2019t meet the guidelines, we aren\u2019t able to accommodate that and will enforce in a thoughtful and judicious way. But we\u2019re confident the vast majority of people will work with us,\u201d Newsom said. Newsom\u2019s remarks come just after state regulators descended on two rural, California counties to shut down pubs, restaurants and salons that had opened, in defiance of Newsom\u2019s statewide order. Additional details for reopening will be released next week, on Tuesday. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: The path toward reopening California is coming into focus, as governor Gavin Newsom today announced guidelines that businesses will have to follow as they move toward reopening. Starting tomorrow, retailers that sell books, clothing, toys and flowers will be able to reopen for curbside pickup, so long as they adhere to physical distancing guidelines, have hands-free ways to pay for goods, and have adequate personal protective equipment. Manufacturers will also have to make changes, possibly closing breakrooms and moving them to open-air rooms. Moving further into the second phase of reopening, shopping malls, outdoor museums and dine-in restaurants will be able to open their doors, so long as the counties looking to reopen do so in partnership with hospital systems and public health officials. Newsom expressed particular reservation at the notion of reopening nail salons, stating that they played a part in spreading the earliest recorded cases of coronavirus cases. Tara Reade addressed questions about her views on Russia during an interview with former Fox New host Megyn Kelly. Reade, who has accused Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her when she was a young Senate staffer, expressed frustration about people \u201ctalking about things that have nothing to do with 1993.\u201d Reade specifically cited allegations that she was a Russian agent, which were tied to a Medium post she wrote in 2018 praising Vladimir Putin. \u201cThat incites people,\u201d Reade said of the allegations. \u201cI got a death threat from that because they thought I was being a traitor to America. These are serious things.\u201d Vox explains more on those accusations: [C]ritics pointed to that now-deleted 2018 Medium post in which Reade called Putin \u2018a compassionate, caring, visionary leader\u2019 and said, \u2018To President Putin, I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe, just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do, with eyes of love.\u2019 In the same post, she wrote that she left government work in her 20s in part because \u2018I love Russia with all my heart\u2019 and \u2018I could not stand to watch the deception and xenophobia that came from my own American government.\u2019 Reade told Vox that when she wrote the praise of Putin, she had \u2018watched a bunch of Noam Chomsky\u2019 and was working on a novel set in Russia. She says she no longer feels the same way about Putin since learning more about domestic violence in Russia. But \u2018this conversation isn\u2019t about Russia,\u2019 she told Vox. \u2018Joe Biden wasn\u2019t asking me about my feelings about Russia when he had his hands where they weren\u2019t supposed to be.\u2019 In her interview with Tara Reade, Megyn Kelly noted that Joe Biden has said an accuser should be treated with \u201cthe presumption that at least the essence of what she is talking about is real.\u201d Kelly asked Reade if she thought Biden had treated her with that presumption. She said no and went on to criticize his surrogates for siding with the former vice president in the matter. \u201cIt\u2019s been stunning actually how some of his surrogates with the blue checks ... have been saying really horrible things about me and to me on social media,\u201d Reade said. The former Senate staffer added that she has been hacked and received a death threat since accusing Biden of sexual assault. \u201cEvery person that maybe has a gripe against me -- an ex-boyfriend or an ex-landlord or whatever it is -- has been able to have a platform rather than me,\u201d Reade said. Tara Reade, who has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, called on the presumtive Democratic nominee to drop out of the presidential race. Reade sat with former Fox News host Megyn Kelly for her first on-camera interview since Biden denied her allegation last week. Kelly released the first clip from the interview, in which she asked Reade if she thought Biden should drop out. \u201cI wish he would,\u201d Reade said. \u201cHe won\u2019t, but I wish he would.\u201d Asked what she would like to say to Biden, Reade replied, \u201cI want to say, you and I were there, Joe Biden. Please step forward and be held accountable. You should not be running on character for the president of the United States.\u201d On another topic, Trump told reporters that he had \u201cvery little contact\u201d with his valet who tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019ve had very little contact, personal contact, with this gentleman. Know who he is, good person, but I\u2019ve had very little contact, Mike has had very little contact with him,\u201d Trump said, referencing the vice president. However, reports have indicated that the valet delivered the president\u2019s meals, which would indicate they were in frequent contact with each other. Trump noted that he and Mike Pence have both tested negative since they learned of the valet\u2019s test result. But the president interestingly questioned the value of coronavirus tests in light of the news. \u201cIt just shows you the fallacy \u2013 what I\u2019ve been saying, testing is not a perfect art. No matter what you do, testing is not a perfect art,\u201d Trump said. Public health experts have emphasized that widespread testing and tracing are crucial to safely reopening the economy. Trump claimed that Michael Flynn had been \u201ctargeted\u201d by the Obama administration, even though the former national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. \u201cHe was targeted by the Obama administration, and he was targeted in order to try to take down a president,\u201d Trump said moments ago in the Oval Office. The president expressed a desire for retribution against government officials who handled Flynn\u2019s case. \u201cI hope a lot of people are going to pay a big price because they\u2019re dishonest, crooked people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re scum. They\u2019re human scum.\u201d As a reminder, the president himself acknowledged in 2017 that Flynn had lied to the vice president and the FBI about his interactions with the Russian ambassador to the US. It\u2019s important to note that it\u2019s unclear how the federal judge overseeing Michael Flynn\u2019s case will react to the justice department\u2019s motion to drop the case. In 2018, Judge Emmet Sullivan delayed Flynn\u2019s sentencing to give the former official more time to cooperate with federal investigations, rather than agreeing to the relatively lenient sentence recommended by the prosecution. \u201cIf you want to postpone this, and come back at some later point ... that\u2019s fine with me,\u201d Sullivan said at the time. \u201cI have to caution you that the sentence imposed today may not be the same sentence you would get after cooperation ends,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cI cannot assure you that if you proceed today, you will not receive a sentence of incarceration.\u201d The chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, said he intended to call the attorney general to testify about the decision to drop Michael Flynn\u2019s case. Attorney general William Barr was scheduled to appear before the committee on March 31, but that hearing was indefinitely delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. As the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee lambasted the decision to drop Michael Flynn\u2019s case, the panel\u2019s top Republican celebrated the news. Congressman Jim Jordan, who has been one of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders during the Russia investigation and the impeachment inquiry, \u201cJustice for the General.\u201d The Ohio Republican added, \u201cNow it\u2019s time to hold someone accountable.\u201d But given that Democrats control the House, Republicans are unlikely to be able to pursue any kind of investigation of the FBI over their handling of the case. Congressman Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, said the justice department\u2019s decision to drop Michael Flynn\u2019s criminal case was \u201coutrageous.\u201d \u201cFlynn PLEADED GUILTY to lying to investigators. The evidence against him is overwhelming. Now, a politicized DOJ is dropping the case,\u201d Nadler said in a tweet. The New York Democrat added that the decision \u201cwarrants an immediate explanation,\u201d hinting at a possible congressional investigation. Despite Trump\u2019s claim today that Michael Flynn is an \u201cinnocent man,\u201d the president himself said in 2017 that his former national security adviser had lied to the vice president and the FBI, as seen in this tweet from the time. Flynn initially pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, but he later tried tried to revoke the guilty plea, part of a larger strategy by his new legal team to take a more confrontational stance toward the government. The White House was reportedly informed of the justice department\u2019s decision to drop the criminal case against Michael Flynn earlier this morning. Moments ago in the Oval Office, Trump celebrated the decision to abandon the case against his former national security adviser. \u201cHe was an innocent man,\u201d Trump said, according to the Guardian\u2019s David Smith, who\u2019s on White House pool duty today. \u201cNow in my book he\u2019s an even greater warrior.\u201d As a reminder, Flynn himself pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in 2017. But Trump said of the government officials who pursued the case, \u201cThey\u2019re human scum.\u201d The AP has more on the justice department\u2019s filing that it is dropping the criminal case against Michael Flynn: In court documents being filed Thursday, the Justice Department said it is dropping the case \u2018after a considered review of all the facts and circumstances of this case, including newly discovered and disclosed information.\u2019 The documents were obtained by The Associated Press. The Justice Department said it had concluded that Flynn\u2019s interview by the FBI was \u2018untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn\u2019 and that the interview on January 24, 2017 was \u2018conducted without any legitimate investigative basis.\u2019 The U.S. attorney reviewing the Flynn case, Jeff Jensen, recommended the move to Attorney General William Barr last week and formalized the recommendation in a document this week. The justice department appears to be rebuking the FBI in its own filing, which is a rather remarkable development. It is sure to only intensify accusations from the president\u2019s critics that his administration is politicizing the justice department. Earlier this afternoon, it was announced that prosecutor Brandon Van Grack had moved to withdraw himself from Michael Flynn\u2019s case. With the news that the justice department intends to drop the criminal case against Flynn, it seems likely that Van Grack, the top prosecutor in the case, disagreed with the department\u2019s decision. Van Grack worked as one of the top lawyers on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, and he stayed on the Flynn case even after Mueller\u2019s work concluded. The justice department is dropping the criminal case against Michael Flynn, according to a court filing. Trump has signaled interest in pardoning Flynn, his former national security adviser, in recent weeks, insisting Flynn was unjustly pursued by the FBI. However, in 2017, Flynn himself pledged guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with the Russian ambassador to the US. Here\u2019s the court filing: Donald Trump is receiving the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, in the Oval Office right about now and we\u2019re awaiting any public comments from that meeting - and especially what the president might have to say about the reports that one of his personal valets has tested positive for coronavirus. Those operating around Trump at the White House apparently don\u2019t routinely wear face masks. One commenter on Twitter compared this to a certain laissez-faire, even macho, attitude in the seventies to not wearing seat belts. Re-opening brings \u201cdread\u201d on both sides of Atlantic As Europe and the US loosen their lockdowns against the coronavirus, health experts are expressing growing dread over what they say is an all-but-certain second wave of deaths and infections that could force governments to clamp back down. \u201cWere risking a backslide that will be intolerable, said Ian Lipkin of Columbia University\u2019s Center for Infection and Immunity, The Associated Press writes. Elsewhere, German authorities began drawing up plans in case of a resurgence of the virus. Experts in Italy urged intensified efforts to identify new victims and trace their contacts. And France, which hasn\u2019t yet eased its lockdown, has already worked up a re-confinement plan in the event of a new wave. \u201cThere will be a second wave, but the problem is to which extent. Is it a small wave or a big wave? It\u2019s too early to say,\u201d said Olivier Schwartz, head of the virus unit at France\u2019s Pasteur Institute. In the US, with about half of the states easing their shutdowns to get their economies restarted and cellphone data showing that people are becoming restless and increasingly leaving home, public health authorities are worried. Many states have not put in place the robust testing that experts believe is necessary to detect and contain new outbreaks. And many state governors have pressed ahead before their states met one of the key benchmarks in the Trump administrations guidelines for reopening - a 14-day downward trajectory in new illnesses and infections. \u201cIf we relax these measures without having the proper public health safeguards in place, we can expect many more cases and, unfortunately, more deaths,\u201d said Josh Michaud, associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington. Cases have continued to rise steadily in places such as Iowa and Missouri since the governors began reopening, while new infections have yo-yoed in Georgia, Tennessee and Texas. Lipkin said he is most worried about two things: the reopening of bars, where people crowd together and lose their inhibitions, and large gatherings such as sporting events, concerts and plays. The US needs testing and contact tracing resources it doesn\u2019t yet have, Lipkin said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that we are in a critical moment of this fight. We risk complacency and accepting the preventable deaths of 2,000 Americans each day,\u201d epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers, a professor at Johns Hopkins, told a House subcommittee in Washington. Britain, with over 30,000 dead, the second-highest death toll in the world behind the US, plans to extend its lockdown but has begun recruiting 18,000 people to trace contacts of those infected. Latest statistics: confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide have almost reached 3.8 million, with 265,000 deaths. The US has 1.2 million confirmed cases and a death toll so far of 73,000, according to Johns Hopkins University statistics. New York extends moratorium on evictions over non-payment of rent during crisis New York governor Andrew Cuomo just extended to August 20 a moratorium on evictions, from residential or commercial properties, as a result of non-payment of rent related to the economic and health hardships caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The state had a ban on such evictions in place until the end of June. Cuomo said: \u201cPeople literally are worried about being able to pay rent, related to this Covid situation...we are going to take additional steps.\u201d He\u2019s banning late payment fees and also going to allow people to use the security deposit as a payment \u201cand they can repay it over a prolonged period of time,\u201d he said. He said it was difficult to predict the next few months, but an extension of the moratorium was important. \u201cNo-one can be evicted for non-payment of rent because of Covid until August 20th and we\u2019ll see what happens between now and then. I hope it gives families a deep breath,\u201d he said. Amid sudden, mass unemployment across the US, rent worries are widespread and growing, prompting rent strikes in some places. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: One of Trump\u2019s personal valets has reportedly tested positive for coronavirus. A spokesperson for the president confirmed a White House employee, who is a member of the US military, tested positive for the virus, but the aide did not specificy the employee\u2019s role. Another 3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. About 33 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past seven weeks, likely foreshadowing some grim numbers for tomorrow\u2019s jobs report. The White House is reportedly blocking the release of CDC guidance on reopening the country. According to reports, the guidance outlines a slow reopening of non-essential businesses, while Trump has expressed a desire to quickly reopen the economy despite health concerns. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to temporarily block a ruling requiring the justice department to give Congress certain grand jury material from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. The Washington Post reports: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in March cleared the way for Congress to access secret evidence from Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election in one of a set of separation-of-powers lawsuits between House Democrats and the Trump administration. Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the Supreme Court on Thursday that if it does not put the order on hold, \u2018the government will have to disclose those materials on May 11, 2020, which would irrevocably lift their secrecy and possibly frustrate the government\u2019s ability to seek further review.\u2019 Much has happened since Mueller testified to Congress -- including the impeachment and acquittal of Trump over the Ukraine controversy -- but Democrats have said they are still seeking additional information about the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Rich McHugh, a former supervising producer for NBC News, said he also participated in Megyn Kelly\u2019s interview with Tara Reade. The New York Times reported last week that Fox News was the only major news network who had offered to interview Reade on camera about her allegation of sexual assault against Joe Biden. Once the Times published its piece, Reade said at least two networks -- CNN and CBS -- had reached out about a potential interview. But the former Senate staffer has apparently rejected all those offers to sit down with Kelly, who is not currently affiliated with a network. Megyn Kelly announced she conducted an on-camera interview with Tara Reade, marking Reade\u2019s first on-camera interview since Joe Biden denied her allegation of sexual assault. Reade has claimed Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993, when she was working as a staffer in his Senate office. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee denied the claim last week. \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally, it never, never happened,\u201d Biden told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. Kelly previously worked for Fox News and famously grilled Trump on his offensive comments about women during a 2015 Republican primary debate, prompting the then-candidate to later say Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d Kelly left Fox for NBC News, but she was removed from her hosting role after making offensive comments about blackface. She left the network last year. Without mentioning Donald Trump or his administration, New York governor Andrew Cuomo moments ago dismissed as \u201can absurd argument\u201d the notion of weighing an increased death toll from the coronavirus against reopening the US economy. \u201cPeople are talking about, we should reopen the economy it\u2019s more important than public health...and that\u2019s the underlying argument and discussion that you hear going on right now...to say we either have to have a strong economy or protect public health, no, that\u2019s a false choice,\u201d Cuomo said at his daily briefing earlier. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s not one or the other, it\u2019s both. We have to reopen, get the economy running and we have to protect public health. This is not a situation where you can go to the American people and say \u2018how many lives are you willing to lose to reopen the economy?\u2019...you start to hear what, to me, are these absurd arguments \u2018if we reopen people will die but people were going to die anyway\u2019...that is not a justification in my mind.\u201d This week, the White House pivoted sharply away from emphasizing its own federal guidelines on societal restrictions to focus on reviving America\u2019s devastated economy, fueling anxiety that the president and his top political team have made a political calculation to put his economy-driven re-election chances ahead of saving maximum US lives. While touring a face mask production line in Arizona on Tuesday, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d This followed his own top public health expert, Anthony Fauci warned against premature reopening of the US while asking in an interview: \u201cHow many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back to what you want to be some form of normality sooner rather than later?\u201d Cuomo said that with the current stay-at-home order in New York state set to expire on May 15, he is looking at the extent and pace of reopening plans for different regions of the large state. He said that although the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths in New York is not coming down as fast as was hoped, they are declining steadily and it showed that measures such as social distancing, wearing masks and gloves and hand-cleansing were working. \u201cIn New York the numbers are coming down dramatically, in the rest of the US it\u2019s going up. When [what we are doing] is working, stay the course. We are going through hell, but it\u2019s working so we are going to keep going,\u201d he said. More than 40 other states are planning to begin reopening in the coming days even though the coronavirus numbers in many are still going up. Cuomo also praised former presidents Abraham Lincoln, John Adams, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D Roosevelt for what he characterized as their public emphasis on facts and data. He quoted Lincoln as saying: \u201cLet them know the truth and the country is safe\u201d, a clear dig at the president\u2019s frequently misleading spinning of facts in his public addresses on the coronavirus and his latest penchant for comparing himself to Lincoln - and hosting a town hall-style event last Sunday from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy also announced the formation of a Republican task force to investigate China\u2019s \u201ccover-up\u201d of coronavirus information. \u201cWe have learned more about Covid and one thing has become very clear: China\u2019s cover-up directly led to this crisis,\u201d McCarthy told reporters today. \u201cThe Communist Party of China hid the seriousness of this disease, led a propaganda campaign blaming the US, used their supplies to exert influence and continue to refuse international experts to investigate what happened.\u201d Trump has also sought to blame China for the spread of coronavirus, even though the president repeatedly said earlier this year that he believed Beijing had the virus under control. McCarthy said he tried to create a China task force in coordination with House Democrats, but he claimed Democratic leadership abandoned the plans at the last minute. \u201cFor more than a year I have worked with the leadership of the Democratic Party to put together a bipartisan committee on China with an equal number of Republicans and an equal number of Democrats,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI did get to that agreement, we got to the point to actually name the individuals, so far that one reporter has actually wrote the story, but did not post it yet, before the Democrats pulled back a few months ago. Well, we cannot wait any longer.\u201d House minority leader Kevin McCarthy finally named Republican members to the select committee reviewing the coronavirus response. Minority whip Steve Scalise, Republican conference chairwoman Liz Cheney, congressman Jim Jordan, congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer, Jackie Walorski and Mark Green will serve on the select committee. McCarthy has criticized the committee, which is aimed at ensuring the appropriate distribution of government funds from the coronavirus relief packages, as \u201cImpeachment 2.0,\u201d implying it is meant to dig up dirt against Trump. Jordan, who was one of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders during the impeachment inquiry, echoed that sentiment in a statement announcing his appointment. \u201cThank you Leader McCarthy for the opportunity to work with colleagues to help fight for the truth and push back against this blatant attempt to use the coronavirus pandemic for partisan ends,\u201d Jordan said. One of the studies being used by the White House reportedly shows that two more weeks of social distancing could help prevent hundreds of thousands of coronavirus infections. The Daily Beast reports: The study, which was put together by PolicyLab at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, is in the hands of top coronavirus task force officials and people working with the team, sources confirmed to The Daily Beast. It projects that if officials move too quickly and too aggressively to reopen in mid May, individual counties could witness hundreds, if not a thousand-plus, more coronavirus cases reported each day by August 1. Just two weeks more social distancing, the study projects, could reduce infections substantially\u2014with potentially hundreds of thousands of fewer cases if the projections are conservatively expanded out to all 3,000-plus counties across the country. The report is notable because the president has been expressing support for states starting to ease their social distancing restrictions, and the study specifically warns that such steps could cause significant spread of the virus. Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi said she still hopes the House will be able to return next week, despite concerns about reconvening as the Washington region\u2019s number of coronavirus cases continues to climb. Democratic leaders originally said the House would reconvene this week, but they reversed that decision after a consultation with the attending physician of the Capitol. The Senate returned on Monday. Pelosi made clear that members would only return \u201cwhen the sergeant at arms and the Capitol physician say that we can.\u201d The speaker added, \u201cWhen we come back, and I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s next week, we\u2019ll have the proxy voting initiative on the floor.\u201d The House originally planned to vote on a measure allowing members to temporarily vote by proxy last month, but Pelosi backed off from that after Republicans expressed strong opposition to the proposal. A number of Republican members are still criticizing the idea of allowing proxy voting, but it appears Pelosi intends to move forward anyway. The president and the vice president are regularly tested for coronavirus using the rapid Abbott Labs test. Since last month, anyone who is going to be in close contact with Donald Trump or Mike Pence are also required to be tested to limit the risk of them contracting the virus. Reporters attending White House briefings have also received tests and had their temperatures checked when they arrive. One of Trump\u2019s personal valets has tested positive for coronavirus, according to a report from CNN. A spokesperson for the president confirmed in a statement that a member of the US military who works at the White House had received a positive test result. According to CNN, the valet is a member of the US Navy. \u201cWe were recently notified by the White House Medical Unit that a member of the United States Military, who works on the White House campus, has tested positive for Coronavirus,\u201d deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said in the statement. \u201cThe President and the Vice President have since tested negative for the virus and they remain in great health.\u201d According to CNN, the valet started exhibiting symptoms Wednesday morning, and the president was subsequently tested again once the valet\u2019s result came back positive. Former New Jersey governor Chris Christie said the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to throw out the convictions of his two former aides \u201cends a 6 1/2 year political crusade.\u201d \u201cWhat cannot be undone is the damage that was visited upon all of the people dragged through the mud who had nothing to do with this incident by the prosecutorial misconduct and personal vindictiveness of Paul Fishman,\u201d Christie said in a statement, referring to the US attorney who led the \u201cBridgegate\u201d investigation. The former Republican governor also blamed senior leaders at the justice department under Barack Obama for \u201cpermitting this misconduct to happen right under their noses.\u201d The Supreme Court has unanimously thrown out the convictions of two former New Jersey officials implicated in the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal. Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni were found guilty of fraud and conspiracy for their roles in creating a massive traffic jam for residents of Fort Lee, New Jersey, whose Democratic mayor refused to endorse then-governor Chris Christie\u2019s 2013 reelection. Writing for the court, justice Elena Kagan said the scheme had \u201cjeopardized the safety of the town\u2019s residents,\u201d but she concluded that \u201cnot every corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime.\u201d At her White House briefing yesterday, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked if the administration would release more detailed guidance on how and when businesses should start reopening. \u201cIn the phased approach there are some recommendations for how, for instance, restaurants should reopen on the distancing that\u2019s required,\u201d McEnany replied. \u201cSo I would argue that our phased approach does take that into account.\u201d Those comments may attract more scrutiny now that reports have emerged of the White House blocking detailed CDC guidance on the reopening of businesses. According to the AP, the guidance specifically included advice on how restaurants should space out tables and make use of apps for table waits as they start to look toward reopening. Good morning, live blog readers. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Joanna Walters. The report that guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been blocked from release has caused concern that the Trump administration is sidelining health experts to paint a rosier economic picture. Here\u2019s more from the AP\u2019s report: The 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled \u2018Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,\u2019 was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen. It was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told the guidance \u2018would never see the light of day,\u2019 according to a CDC official. ... The rejected reopening guidance was described by one of the federal officials as a touchstone document that was to be used as a blueprint for other groups inside the CDC who are creating the same type of instructional materials for other facilities. The guidance contained detailed advice for making site-specific decisions related to reopening schools, restaurants, summer camps, churches, day care centers and other institutions. It had been widely shared within the CDC and included detailed \u201cdecision trees,\u201d flow charts to be used by local officials to think through different scenarios. The AP notes that states can receive additional CDC guidance if they directly reach out to the agency to seek experts\u2019 insight, and it seems likely that many governors will do just that following the publication of this report. But the White House\u2019s decision to block the guidance\u2019s release, reportedly because it advocated too slow of a reopening, will only intensify questions over whether Trump can be trusted to share the most accurate information as the coronavirus crisis continues to unfold. The nation\u2019s largest nurses union will line white shoes outside the White House to protest the administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The protest comes during nurses appreciation week in the US, and one day after President Trump signed a proclamation lauding nurses for rushing into the pandemic, \u201cundaunted by danger, personal sacrifice\u201d. The protest is organized by National Nurses United, which represents more than 155,000 nurses. The union also represents hospitals in New York City, one of the hardest hit locations in the country. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Lauren Aratani report: Another three million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to extract its terrible toll on the US jobs market. Some 33 million jobless Americans have now made claims in the past seven weeks. The latest figures from the US labor department come ahead of the first official monthly report on the American jobs market since the pandemic triggered lockdowns across the country. In March, the official unemployment rate in the US was 4.4%, close to a 50-year low, but economists predict it could now be as high as 20%, a level unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. The pace of layoffs has overwhelmed state unemployment systems across the country. Over a million people in North Carolina have now made unemployment insurance benefit claims, equivalent to 20% of the state\u2019s workforce. Some four million have applied in California and the state\u2019s jobless benefits fund is \u201cvery close\u201d to running out, governor Gavin Newsom said this week. A group of prominent doctors organized by the advocacy group Avaaz have taken out a full page ad in the New York Times today, criticizing social media and tech companies for spreading \u201cviral misinformation\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic. Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube and Pinterest have all worked to link to official sources when people search for common terms around the pandemic, such as \u201cCovid-19\u201d or \u201chydroxychloroquine\u201d. However, misinformation has still circulated broadly. Conspiracy theories led some to believe new 5G cellular systems caused the pandemic. Nearly one-third of Americans believe the conspiratorial claim that the virus was developed in a lab in Wuhan, China, surveys show. \u201cStories claiming cocaine is a cure, or that COVID-19 was developed as a biological weapon by China or the US, have spread faster than the virus itself,\u201d the group said. \u201cTech companies have tried to act, taking down certain content when it is flagged, and allowing the World Health Organization to run free ads. But their efforts are far from enough.\u201d Experts said social media companies efforts are \u201ctoo little too late,\u201d according to previous Guardian reporting. Praising them, \u201cis like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.\u201d \u201cThe tsunami of false and misleading content about the coronavirus is not an isolated outbreak of disinformation, it\u2019s part of a global plague,\u201d the doctors said. \u201cOn Facebook, we have seen claims that chlorine dioxide helps people suffering from autism and cancer; that millions of Americans were given a \u2018cancer virus\u2019 via the polio shot; that ADHD was \u2018invented by big pharma\u2019. The list goes on.\u201d Good morning, US live blog readers, there is already a lot going on in the world of US politics and the coronavirus crisis today, so stay tuned. What we know so far: The Trump administration has shelved a report prepared by its own federal public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), that detailed draft recommendations for how to reopen US society safety - according to numerous reports. The news was first brought to us by The Associated Press. Others are also reporting this out now. The recommendations were reportedly requested by White House task force member Dr Deborah Birx but are understood to be felt to be too cautious by the political leaders, and CDC was told it \u201cwould never see the light of day\u201d. The CDC is now reportedly considering issuing the guidelines to individual states. Nurses are going to stage a protest outside the White House this morning to throw light on the dozens of their fellows who have died of the coronavirus while working on the health care front lines. Donald Trump will meet with Texas governor Greg Abbott in the Oval Office this afternoon and the president and Melania Trump will give remarks later at a prayer event in the White House rose garden. The latest unemployment figures are out and they are dire. All the details here.",

Two prosecutors have recused themselves, citing professional connections to Gregory McMichael. Documents and state records show the elder McMichael is a former police detective and district attorney investigator in Glynn county. The Guardian has contacted Gregory and Travis McMichael for comment. An outside prosecutor in charge of the case said he wants a grand jury to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. But that will not happen until at least mid-June, since Georgia courts remain largely closed because of the coronavirus. According to a police report from that day, the two men grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and began following Arbery after seeing him running. Gregory McMichael told police he and his adult son thought Arbery matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a recent break-in in the neighborhood. Arbery was not considered a suspect in any burglary. Gregory McMichael told police Arbery violently attacked his son. The video footage filmed by an anonymous individual and released this week contradicts that claim. Georgia law says a person can kill in self-defense \u201conly if he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily injury \u2026 or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.\u201d The law also says a person who provokes an attack or acts as \u201cthe aggressor\u201d can\u2019t claim self-defense. Arbery\u2019s family has called for immediate arrests after the video was released this week. \u201cI saw my son come into the world,\u201d Arbery\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, said. \u201cAnd seeing him leave the world, it\u2019s not something that I\u2019ll want to see ever.\u201d The civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Arbery\u2019s father, said the video calls into question the claims made by the McMichaels in the police report. \u201cThey are heartbroken,\u201d Crump said of the family.

According to the Times of India, the dead included an eight-year-old girl, and 5,000 people had fallen sick. Residents complained of breathing problems, rashes and sore eyes, it added. Authorities advised people to wear wet clothes and masks, avoid eating uncovered food and consume bananas and milk to \u201cneutralise the effect of the gas\u201d. LG Chem and federal authorities in New Delhi said on Thursday that the leak at the plant, which makes polystyrene products used in manufacturing electric fan blades, cups and cutlery and containers for cosmetic products, had been contained. Gas from styrene, a principal raw material at the plant, leaked during the early hours of Thursday, authorities said. The factory, operated by LG Polymers, a unit of LG Chem, was in the process of reopening after a weeks-long lockdown imposed by Indian authorities to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, local officials and the company said. Jagan Mohan Reddy, chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, said in a televised address on Thursday that the leak occurred because the styrene had been stored for a long period of time. The incident had echoes of one of the worst industrial disasters in history when gas leaked from a pesticide plant in the central Indian city of Bhopal in 1984.

      "bodyText": "The controversial reality TV chef Pete Evans will exit My Kitchen Rules, Seven\u2019s defining show of the decade which slumped badly in the ratings this year. Evans, a self-styled health guru held one of the most lucrative jobs in television despite a series of controversies related to his views on health and nutrition. But in the end it was the ratings that spelt the end for Evans who was earning close to $1m for his role on the Seven cooking show and other appearances on the network. Promoting a paleo diet and unscientific health claims \u2013 while enjoying a very high profile \u2013 led to several rebukes from the Australian Medical Association and scientists. Last month the Therapeutic Goods Administration fined Evans $25,200 for spruiking a $15,000 light machine to fight coronavirus. On Friday the Guardian reported Evans had come under fresh criticism for promoting the coronavirus views of David Icke, the British conspiracy theorist. Evans urged his Instagram followers to watch a three-hour-long interview in which Icke simultaneously claims Covid-19 is \u201ca fake pandemic with no virus\u201d and links infections to 5G antenna installations. There is also no suggestion his departure from My Kitchen Rules is related to the social media post. Seven has not made any public comment about Evans\u2019 departure but Guardian Australia has confirmed he is leaving the show. Sources say he may still appear on Better Homes and Gardens. The lacklustre performance of MKR after 10 years on air and Seven\u2019s dire financial situation led to what has been described by the network as an \u201camicable\u201d parting of the ways. The network said Evans left to pursue other endeavours. MRK, which Evans has co-hosted with Manu Feildel, was beaten by Nine\u2019s Married at First Sight, Australian Survivor and ABC\u2019s 7.30, and had its lowest ratings in 2020. Seven has not confirmed that MKR will be back, only that announcements will be made later in the year. Guardian Australia has contacted Evans for comment. In 2017 Evans\u2019s documentary The Magic Pill, which claimed that following his paleo diet guidelines for five weeks could drastically reduce symptoms of diabetes, cancer and autism, was labelled \u201csilly\u201d and \u201charmful\u201d by the Australian Medical Association. In 2015 the Public Health Association of Australia, said a recipe in an Evans cookbook for DIY baby milk formula, made from liver and bone broth, contained 10 times the maximum safe daily intake of vitamin A for babies.",

The chief executive, Robert Thomson, said there was a fresh wave of cost-cutting ahead for the group, including a \u201cstrategic review of our Australian newspaper holdings\u201d that could signal further job losses at the company\u2019s smaller mastheads. He said he was giving up three quarters of his bonus, while Murdoch, who is executive chairman, had forgone his entire bonus. News Corp said the mammoth loss was primarily driven by the company\u2019s decision to slash the valuation of its troubled Australian subscription TV business, Foxtel, which has been struggling to compete against streaming services, and reclassify its US coupon business News America Marketing as an asset held for sale. (The business was sold earlier this week, after the end of the quarter.) However, revenue also fell 8% compared with the same period last year, to US$2.27bn, due to falls in news advertising revenue, lower subscription revenue from Foxtel and the weak Australian dollar. Thomson said the results \u201cdemonstrate the strength of News Corp and the power of our premium content\u201d. He said the company had US$1.4bn in \u201ccash and cash equivalents\u201d on hand and the ability to borrow an additional US$750m. Following the sale of News America Marketing the company was \u201ccontinuing to simplify our company to highlight the intrinsic value of our core businesses, including the strategic review of our Australian newspaper holdings, focusing on our larger brands and our digital reach\u201d, he said. \u201cClearly the pandemic will have an impact on our results in the fourth quarter, but all of our businesses are embarking on cost-cutting programs intended to deal with short-term need but also to ensure that the company is well-equipped to prosper in a decidedly different business environment after the crisis abates.\u201d The hunger for information about the coronavirus has sent readership numbers skyrocketing during the pandemic, but many news organisations have struggled to convert the extra attention into dollars due to the devastation the shutdown has wrought on big advertisers such as retailers. News Corp last month suspended printing 60 regional Australian titles after real estate, event and restaurant ads dried up. In March the chief executive of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, warned staff it was \u201cclear that some job losses will be inevitable\u201d due to the crisis. To cut costs, some staff have also been asked to take leave or work a shorter week. However, Thomson said subscriptions were up at News Corp\u2019s Dow Jones division, which includes its financial masthead, the Wall Street Journal.

Labor\u2019s economics team, including the shadow assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, accused the government of trying to \u201cblame the victims of fraud enabled by a system it created\u201d by suggesting the incident was caused by their failure to protect their own data. \u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d they said. \u201cThe government has designed a system for speed, not accuracy. \u201cWith more than a million applications for early access to superannuation, Australians cannot afford their government to be complacent.\u201d Labor pointed to a letter sent to the government on 20 April from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Industry Super Australia and the peak body for super trustees calling for more protections. While supporting the early release of super, the peak bodies said they were concerned that suggestions to increase safety were ignored. These included a plan to forward the money to the ATO to pass on to taxpayers \u201cprior verification of bank account details submitted via MyGov by the ATO against member account details held by banks\u201d, and a demand to indemnify funds against fraud or money laundering risks. They warned that super funds would be liable for fraud, but were also required to release funds within five days, putting trustees in the \u201cunenviable situation\u201d of having \u201climited scope\u201d to minimise the risk of fraud. On 1 May the assistant minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, responded, saying the superannuation sector needed to \u201cplay its role in assisting Australians most in need\u201d, referring to Scott Morrison\u2019s invocation of \u201cthe need for \u2018Team Australia\u2019 to step up\u201d. Hume said an \u201cATO pays model\u201d would delay payments and the ATO had no authority to do so, meaning months of delay to pass required legislation. Hume said the ATO had \u201csubstantial checks in place to guard against fraud\u201d including two-factor authentication for 80% of users, verifying bank account information in real time, and text messages to applicants that would provide \u201can additional opportunity to prevent fraudulent withdrawals\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Trouble is brewing for the world\u2019s tea producers as the coronavirus lockdown shut down the harvest in several important regions, including the picking of India\u2019s \u201cchampagne of teas\u201d. Despite forecasts of increased demand from drinkers stuck at home across the world, producers have become frustrated by the enforced quarantining of their workforce, with India\u2019s output expected to drop by 9% in 2020. Lockdown measures in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam halted work for more than a month. The global coronavirus outbreak escalated at the worst possible time for Indian tea producers, just as the most valuable harvest of the year was ready to be plucked. India has very specific production periods, experts said, called flushes. The prized first flush of Darjeeling, the \u201cchampagne of teas\u201d harvested in the country\u2019s north-eastern, has been severely hit. This harvest, which is generally picked between March and April, accounts for as much as 40% of annual revenue. Other tea exporting countries, including China, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, have also experienced disruption, though Kenya - the main supplier of tea to the UK - has so far avoided major problems. The International Tea Committee has predicted the country may see output rise by 15% this year. \u201cBecause of the weather, [Kenya] can produce tea all year round,\u201d said Ibi Idoniboye, senior market analyst for Mintec. Operations have also been affected in Sri Lanka, where tea production in the first quarter of the year declined to the lowest levels in decades. Exports have also suffered compared with the same period last year, falling 14.1 million kilograms to 59.5 million kilograms. The country\u2019s weekly tea auctions, a 125-year-old tradition, were held online for the first time in April to comply with social distancing measures. The auctions, usually held in Colombo, are among the biggest in the world and attract around 200 people. \u201cThis [the pandemic] is the first time tea production was affected in a country wide level,\u201d said Roshan Rajadurai of the Planters\u2019 Association. Work stopped completely for a couple of days, he said, but the government allowed agricultural activities to resume again. Hundreds of thousands of workers continue to work plucking the tea. Other areas of productions, for example packaging, are not operating at full capacity. On top of the complications posed by the Covid-19 outbreak, tea producers have also faced an unprecedented drought, added Rajadurai. Meanwhile, in Vietnam exports fell 2.5% in volume to 26,000 tonnes during the first quarter of 2020. While there hasn\u2019t been any disruption to supply of tea in the UK, it is likely that prices will continue to rise, driven by the disruption to operation and speculation over shortages, said Idoniboye. \u201cI\u2019d expect to see that tea will still be appreciating for the next few weeks but at some stage it will hit a ceiling,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "The origin of the coronavirus has opened up a new battlefield between the Murdoch press and just about everyone else \u2013 and given the Daily Telegraph\u2019s Sharri Markson an international platform on Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News. Following in the footsteps of her colleague Miranda Devine, who also made it onto Fox News, Markson told Tucker Carlson Tonight the \u201cbombshell dossier\u201d she had uncovered showed some of the world\u2019s foremost intelligence agencies were investigating whether the virus was linked to a lab in Wuhan. The Tele has devoted several front pages to the Wuhan lab this month, including Saturday\u2019s report which cited a 15-page dossier compiled by \u201cconcerned western governments\u201d that says that China deliberately suppressed or destroyed evidence of the coronavirus outbreak. But security agencies say there is no current evidence to suggest coronavirus leaked from a Wuhan research lab, and Markson herself says \u201cscientific consensus is that the virus came from a wet market\u201d. Markson told Carlson that \u201cleftwing sections of the media\u201d in Australia don\u2019t want to believe the virus may have leaked from a laboratory, and the Fox News host congratulated her for \u201can amazing piece of journalism\u201d that he was ashamed to say \u201cno one in America\u201d had uncovered first. But back home not everyone was as fawning. The political editor-at-large did not take criticism of her stories lying down, responding to Media Watch\u2019s critique of the Wuhan lab theory with a mocking tweet: \u201cABC media reporter, Paul Barry, thinks he knows more than the Five Eyes intelligence agencies which are currently investigating the origins of the Coronavirus, along with Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo!! Hilarious.\u201d On Thursday the Nine newspapers cast doubt on her story, saying the dossier is unlikely to be an intelligence document and more likely just a research report, based on publicly available information including news reports. Markson responded by accusing the journalists of trying to expose her confidential sources. Trump and \u2018our 2004 Miss Universe\u2019 Another Australian reporter, Ebony Bowden, also made a splash in the United States this week, with an interview she conducted, along with colleague Steven Nelson, with Donald Trump for the New York Post. It was a career highlight for the young Australian reporter who said the president asked after \u201cour 2004 Miss Universe Jennifer Hawkins\u201d when he found out she was Australian. Women\u2019s Day redux One of the casualties of Bauer Media\u2019s extensive cuts in Australasia this past month \u2013 some 500 staff and more than a dozen magazines \u2013 was surprisingly back on the shelves weeks after it was axed and all the staff were let go. New Zealand\u2019s number 1 weekly magazine, Woman\u2019s Day, was on sale again, a month after the company walked away from its entire operation in NZ, axing magazines that had been published since the 1930s. But the magazine, which looked just like the NZ favourite, was just a rejig of the Australian Woman\u2019s Day by Bauer Media in Oz, hastily rebadged as a Kiwi production by the addition of a few local stories. Former staff told The Spinoff the local copy had been filed weeks ago before they were given their marching orders by Bauer. \u201cIt\u2019s weird seeing our work from five weeks ago suddenly appear like that in a magazine we didn\u2019t know was happening,\u201d one staffer said. Daily Mail\u2019s Stefanovic scoop For the Daily Mail there is nothing too trivial that doesn\u2019t make a good long headline. When Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic had a baby with new wife Jasmine Yarborough this week the website jumped on the story with the latest angle about his ex-wife journalist Cassandra Thorburn. \u201cKarl Stefanovic\u2019s ex Cassandra Thorburn grabs coffee in Sydney as she\u2019s spotted for the first time since the Today host welcomed a child with new wife Jasmine Yarbrough,\u201d was the headline. Yep, \u201cgrabs a coffee\u201d was enough for a story. Thorburn had been \u201cspotted in public for the first time\u201d since the baby was born, readers were told, alongside three paparazzi shots of the 49-year-old \u201cdressed casually in leggings, a lightweight jacket and trendy sunglasses while grabbing coffee in Sydney on Monday\u201d. A magnet for tabloid media, Stefanovic\u2019s personal life continues to play out in the press daily. In somewhat of an own goal Stefanovic recently launched a publicity blitz in an attempt to improve the persistently low ratings for the Today show on Nine. Stefanovic sat down with the Daily Mail and News Corp to talk about his personal life despite railing against the intrusion of the press in 2017. From Courier-Mail to the police The Courier-Mail\u2019s national political editor, Renee Viellaris, is known for her hardline stance on asylum seekers and has written several memorable anti-refugee stories including the 2017 one in which Manus Island detainees were portrayed as having \u201cholidays at an idyllic island\u201d. More recently she interviewed Peter Dutton\u2019s wife so she could tell the world he wasn\u2019t a monster. \u201cHe is a really good man. He is a really good father and he\u2019s not a monster,\u2019\u2019 Kirilly Dutton, 45, told the Sunday Mail. A regular on the Bolt Report, who has joined the ABC\u2019s Insiders panel with David Speers this year too, Viellaris told Sky News earlier this year she agreed with Dutton that \u201cactivist doctors\u201d use the medevac legislation as a backdoor into Australia. It\u2019s perhaps no surprise then that Viellaris has resigned to join the Australian Federal Police\u2019s media unit, where Dutton is the responsible minister. Daily Telegraph apologises The Daily Telegraph has published a 250-word apology to former Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns, who sued the Sunday Telegraph in the supreme court of Victoria for publishing a front-page story which alleged that the notorious Sydney brothel The Kastle had become his second home. Under the headline \u201cKing of the Kastle\u201d in August last year, reporter Amy Harris, who was named along with editor Mick Carroll in the suit, said Johns had spent up to 18 hours a day at the brothel the previous two weeks. \u201cThe story was wrong,\u201d the Telegraph said. \u201cMr Johns was not leaving the brothel and the Sunday Telegraph accepts he has never been there at any other time. \u201cMr Johns was in the area because he had been visiting a friend who lived in the vicinity of The Kastle. \u201cWe retract the story and we wish to extend a genuine and public apology to Mr Johns and his family for the error and the harm caused.\u201d But the apology didn\u2019t end there. It went on to detail Johns\u2019s \u201chighly decorated\u201d career, including Aria awards, albums, concerts and \u201cchart-topping singles\u201d. \u2018Factually inaccurate\u2019 on ABC funding Our story on Monday that the Coalition had stripped $783m in funding from the ABC since 2014 has been described as \u201cfactually inaccurate\u201d by the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, in a story in the Daily Telegraph, which rubbished the claims made in a report by the progressive thinktank Per Capita. \u201cTo claim the ABC has been \u2018defunded\u2019 is at odds with the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe numbers show that ABC funding in 2019-20 is higher than in 2013-14 and will be higher again in 2021-22.\u201d The minister\u2019s criticism was picked up by Andrew Bolt, who said on his Herald Sun blog that you can\u2019t trust the ABC with \u201cour money\u201d. But the figures in the Per Capita report are from the government\u2019s own budget papers and Senate estimates, and are entirely accurate. The minister is not wrong about the total budget \u2013 operational funding plus transmission costs \u2013 being higher than it was in 2013-14 but that is due to inflation. The Daily Telegraph claimed the report was inaccurate because it said the ABC lost $148.8m over eight years for an Australia Network contract \u201cthat was never awarded in the first place\u201d. But the contract was awarded by the previous Labor government and was subsequently cancelled by the Abbott government. Another Tele claim \u2013 that the report understates the ABC\u2019s budget by $183.7m \u2013 is also incorrect. The $187m is for transmission funding, which is always assessed separately from operational funding for the national broadcasters, a practice accepted by both sides of politics. Transmission is a fixed cost that goes to Broadcast Australia. The figures in the Per Capita report align with academic research by Michael Ward published by The Conversation last year . The ABC\u2019s managing director and the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, argued over semantics at Senate estimates earlier this year when the minister said the government had maintained funding but David Anderson said the \u201cindexation pause\u201d amounted to a cut. Leaked photos \u2018appalling\u2019 Media outlets took a different approach to leaked photos of former AFL player and coach Dean Laidley, taken while he was in police custody. Deputy commissioner Shane Patton described the leak as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d after two photos, one from Laidley\u2019s official police file and another of him wearing a long blonde wig and a dress inside the custody area of a Melbourne police station, were published by the Herald Sun and the West Australian. The Age in Melbourne, and Guardian Australia, chose not to run the pictures. Despite the outcry over the invasion of privacy, and condemnation from the Victorian police commissioner, the pictures appeared in the Australian, Fox Sports and other News Corp papers throughout the week. Two police officers have been suspended over the leaked photos and are expected to be charged with criminal offences.",

Previous hearings heard that the port agent for Carnival Australia, which operates the Ruby Princess, arranged for two ambulances to immediately transfer two sick passengers to Royal Prince Alfred hospital when it docked on 19 March. One of those passengers later tested positive for Covid-19 and died. In a transcript of a call to an ambulance officer, Peter Dilonardo, just after midnight on 19 March, Butchart said: \u201cCan you guys just treat it as corona \u2026 We will put our pilot on, we will tell our pilot to wear all the PPE.\u201d In other parts of the exchange, Butchart told Dilonardo: \u201cThis could be front page news in the morning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s such a political thing at the moment \u2026 so we\u2019ve got to be mindful,\u201d Dilonardo replied. In the transcript tendered to the inquiry, Dilonardo told Butchart: \u201cUnless we know they\u2019re cleared, they\u2019re not positive for it, we treat everybody the same as if they actually have it. So we\u2019re to use all the universal precautions.\u201d Butchart replied: \u201cOh well, they\u2019re going treat as [if] it\u2019s corona then. Cause this will be if it is a corona, then it\u2019ll be you know tomorrow Ruby Princess [sic]\u201d. Dilonardo: \u201cYeah like all the others have been.\u201d Butchart: \u201cIt\u2019s the same. It\u2019s the sister ship is [sic] the one that went up in Japan.\u201d Dilonardo: \u201cOh OK. Oh geez.\u201d Butchart: \u201cThat was the Diamond Princess, this is the Ruby Princess.\u201d Dilonardo: \u201cBloody hell. I mean it\u2019s so political at the moment, it\u2019s such a hot topic.\u201d Butchart: \u201cAnd they\u2019ve got 20 people in isolation.\u201d The inquiry continues.",

      "body": "<p>In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill\u2019s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation.</p> <p>Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson\u2019s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority.</p> <p>The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain\u2019s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain\u2019s future role in this changed world.</p> <p>Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson\u2019s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground.</p> <p>Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a \u201cwatershed moment for humanity\u201d, and a chance for \u201ca world reset\u201d.</p> <p>Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK\u2019s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain\u2019s strategic posture.</p> <p>The question of the UK\u2019s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, \u201ca flagship for dysfunction\u201d can be set aside until the US elections.</p> <p>For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder.</p> <p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for \u201ca deep dive\u201d into the role of China, adding vaguely: \u201cWe cannot have business as usual.\u201d The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry.</p> <p>The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/29/johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-huawei-5g-plans-for-britain\">the Huawei deal</a> will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all paying the price for Beijing\u2019s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade \u2013 and put the rest of the world\u2019s health at risk,\u201d says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It\u2019s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk.</p> <p>Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2015/oct/27/where-does-britain-draw-the-line-with-saudi-arabia-and-china\">David Cameron\u2019s Operation Kowtow</a>\u201d and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: \u201cJust as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America\u2019s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: \u201cIt is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi \u2013 setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage \u2013 is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09077ac6cc0d9df384c3f896ca2985860032d0f6/0_141_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soldiers help to carry out Covid-19 testing in Plymouth. In a post-coronavirus world, the case for traditional defence spending is weakened.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MoD/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this context, British alliances with Japan and South Korea, rivals to China, will be at a premium.</p> <p>But a faultline on China is emerging in the Tory party. The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: \u201cWe can\u2019t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can\u2019t be dependent on China, but we can\u2019t be without a framework of cooperation with China.\u201d</p> <p>McDonald agrees: \u201cThere is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. \u201cIt is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered \u2013 through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.\u201d</p> <p>But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. \u201cWe need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.\u201d<br> China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">delayed until the middle of next year</a>, is to be a success.</p> <p>Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. \u201cBuild back better\u201d has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages.</p> <p>But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has <a href=\"http://sdg.iisd.org/events/2020-un-biodiversity-conference/\">also been postponed</a>, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation.</p> <p>Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain\u2019s diplomats. He argues that: \u201cAny tension that undermines the existing international architecture \u2013 whether it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wto\">WTO</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">WHO</a>, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] \u2013 anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets.</p> <p>\u201cYou can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.\u201d</p> <p>Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/04/no-more-deal-or-no-deal-no-10s-brexit-diktat-to-foreign-office\">no-deal Brexit</a> on to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\">\u00a3300bn coronavirus hit</a> to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable.</p> <p>Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. \u201cIf you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival \u2013 the survival of businesses and the economy \u2013 then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated.</p> <p>Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. \u201cThe budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,\u201d Niblett says.</p> <p>In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-putting-world-on-track-for-new-great-depression-says-who\">13% and 34%.</a> Covid\u2019s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing.</p> <p>In this deglobalising world, Johnson\u2019s promise in Greenwich to be \u201ca superhero champion\u201d of free trade looks incongruous. The US \u2013 with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal \u2013 is in free fall.</p> <p>Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important.</p> <p>At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened.</p> <p>The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system.</p> <p>In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests.</p> <p>Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials \u201cwill have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP\u201d.</p> <p>There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK\u2019s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus.</p> <p>Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/complacent-uk-draws-global-criticism-for-covid-19-response-boris-johnson\">near the bottom of the class</a>, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on \u201cherd immunity\u201d and then abandoning the policy.</p> <p>Niblett argues that \u201cBrexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"474b8ea51dc251dd3a9480feb52b244383b0b4c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/474b8ea51dc251dd3a9480feb52b244383b0b4c7/0_182_5981_3589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson Visits a laboratory in Bedford in early March\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson visits a laboratory in Bedford in early March. The UK\u2019s strong medical research base gives him a platform from which to engage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cOn global health we will have taken a knock. Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo\u2013US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.\u201d</p> <p>Miliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be \u201cbrutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance\u201d.</p> <p>He sees one cause of optimism. \u201cThis may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled \u201chealth is global\u201d. The paper argued that health should be seen as \u201can agent for good in foreign policy\u201d so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy.</p> <p>The UK may have been trounced in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\">election to head the WHO in 2017</a>, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK\u2019s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide.</p> <p>Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river \u201cin the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London\u201d.</p> <p>The nation\u2019s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In making his landmark post-Brexit speech in February under Sir James Thornhill\u2019s baroque painted ceiling in the Royal Hospital, Greenwich, Boris Johnson believed he had found the perfect setting to paint his own picture of Britain charting a new course as a free-trading, independent, open and liberal nation. Like the painting above him, eulogising the triumph of William and Mary over the popish and tyrannical French, Johnson\u2019s speech was an optimistic and patriotic piece of work. It offered a distinctive vision of British prosperity and diplomatic superiority. The speech had no hint that the world he described, and Britain\u2019s place in it, was under any existential threat. But the past three months have left UK foreign policy thinkers suddenly searching in the fog for Britain\u2019s future role in this changed world. Indeed, as the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson\u2019s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground. Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a \u201cwatershed moment for humanity\u201d, and a chance for \u201ca world reset\u201d. Ministers have postponed the foreign and security policy review, due to have been published this autumn, to devote time to fighting the virus. Yet the UK\u2019s most senior diplomats, including at foreign office executive committee level, are already examining Britain\u2019s strategic posture. The question of the UK\u2019s greatest ally, the US, currently, in the words of the former foreign secretary David Miliband, \u201ca flagship for dysfunction\u201d can be set aside until the US elections. For most British analysts, the most pressing foreign policy question for the UK will be its relations with China. Will the divisions between the US and China deepen so much that, regardless of the outcome of the US election, all nations, including the UK, are sucked into its vortex, requiring Britain to choose? If so, multilateral solutions become harder. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has spoken of the need for \u201ca deep dive\u201d into the role of China, adding vaguely: \u201cWe cannot have business as usual.\u201d The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has backed an inquiry. The mood towards Beijing on the Tory benches, already sceptical, is turning ugly and suggests at minimum that the Huawei deal will not survive in its current form, placing other Chinese infrastructure projects in the UK at question. \u201cWe are all paying the price for Beijing\u2019s decision to ignore the science, prioritise trade \u2013 and put the rest of the world\u2019s health at risk,\u201d says Tom Tugendhat, the liberal internationalist chair of the foreign affairs select committee. His committee is relentlessly pressing the foreign office for clear strategy on China. It\u2019s clear that his committee will at minimum demand the UK adopt takeover rules that sees Chinese investment as a security risk. Nick Timothy, Theresa May\u2019s former special adviser and a long-term China sceptic, has lambasted \u201cDavid Cameron\u2019s Operation Kowtow\u201d and identified the chief culprit as George Osborne and the Treasury. He says: \u201cJust as Harold Macmillan had perceived that, as British power declined, we should play Athens to America\u2019s Rome, Mr Osborne thought he could pull off a geopolitical pivot that would strengthen Britain for decades to come.\u201d Echoing the US State Department, Timothy adds: \u201cIt is surely now obvious that China is also a strategic rival to the west as a whole. It is an autocratic and oppressive state, with wildly different values and interests to our own. Its policy towards Asia, Africa and elsewhere is inevitably imperialistic. And its modus operandi \u2013 setting debt traps for countries to gain leverage over them and engaging in mass industrial espionage \u2013 is a danger to our interests and those of our allies.\u201d In this context, British alliances with Japan and South Korea, rivals to China, will be at a premium. But a faultline on China is emerging in the Tory party. The Foreign Office is urging caution, making the case for keeping a few bridges unburnt. The former foreign secretary Lord Hague told Policy Exchange: \u201cWe can\u2019t solve global problems without China. And global problems are some of our most pressing and obviously most existential. The Covid-19 crisis is an example of such a dramatic world crisis. So we can\u2019t be dependent on China, but we can\u2019t be without a framework of cooperation with China.\u201d McDonald agrees: \u201cThere is no problem that the world faces today that can be addressed, still less solved, without the active participation of China.\u201d Miliband also argues that a balance needs striking. He says he has no illusions about China. \u201cIt is obvious that the Chinese state is being very confident in its response to Covid-19, describing it both as a success and the product of its one-party system. Their message is being effectively delivered \u2013 through aid supplies and diplomatic outreach around the world. It is much harsher than before, with crackdowns at home and favour-buying abroad.\u201d But that does not mean cooperation with China should be seen as appeasement, Miliband argues. \u201cWe need to worry about a democratic recession, and the debate about whether democracies or autocracies coped best in this crisis is materially relevant to lives around the world, but it is really important this debate does end up excluding the need for institutions that encompass both democratic and autocratic regimes.\u201d China is not just a seminar discussion for the UK. Britain needs China on board if its chairmanship of the UN climate change conference, set for Glasgow in November but now delayed until the middle of next year, is to be a success. Even now the best UK diplomats are pressing China to adopt bolder carbon emission targets for 2030. McDonald has said he hopes the coronavirus crisis will lead to greater Chinese ambition. \u201cBuild back better\u201d has long been part of UK disaster relief thinking, and has now become the slogan of those preparing green post-coronavirus stimulation packages. But there are countervailing forces. Many of the building blocks for Glasgow have been removed. An EU-China meet-up scheduled for September and seen as a moment for China to float new targets has been cancelled. A Chinese-hosted conference on biodiversity, a chance to discuss carbon sinks and nature based solutions, has also been postponed, while governments are under pressure to save industries such as aviation. Above all, even under a Democrat presidency, relations between China and the US will be on a downward curve, making a climate change agreement more difficult. Tim Benton, head of the Chatham House energy and environment programme, foresees an uphill task for Britain\u2019s diplomats. He argues that: \u201cAny tension that undermines the existing international architecture \u2013 whether it is WTO, WHO, UNFCCC [the UN framework convention on climate change] \u2013 anything that creates stress is going to get in the way of reaching climate change targets. \u201cYou can imagine there is so much to-ing and fro-ing between major powers vying for their own nationalistic interest that climate change just gets pushed further down the agenda because economic reconstruction is seen as so much more important.\u201d Economic reconstruction leads to the Brexit question. For many diplomats, the thought of piling a no-deal Brexit on to a \u00a3300bn coronavirus hit to the UK economy looks less like an act of self-harm, and more like a death wish. McDonald, speaking to the foreign affairs select committee, held out the faint hope that it was still an open question whether the PM might yet revisit the timetable. Robin Niblett, Chatham House director, senses Johnson will not delay, but instead look for a short-form agreement. \u201cIf you think that by the summer, the politics may get nastier with inquests about how we got into quite such a mess, and the money for what was called levelling up has been diverted to survival \u2013 the survival of businesses and the economy \u2013 then Johnson may feel politically he has to follow through on Brexit. Once you delay, you lose your agency and Brexit is about agency, as much as it is about control.\u201d Miliband predicts the UK and the EU might settle for an outline deal that leaves details to be negotiated. Either way, the integrated review will have to work with changed assumptions about both resources and security. \u201cThe budget for global Britain promises to be brutal,\u201d Niblett says. In the UK, growth is due to fall 7% this year. The World Trade Organization sees world trade declining by between 13% and 34%. Covid\u2019s lasting legacy may be a switch away from just-in-time imports towards shorter supply chains and national sourcing. In this deglobalising world, Johnson\u2019s promise in Greenwich to be \u201ca superhero champion\u201d of free trade looks incongruous. The US \u2013 with which the UK seeks to sign a signature free-trade deal \u2013 is in free fall. Yet Johnson fervently believes that the coronavirus only strengthens the case for a free-trade deal. Any scrap of extra growth becomes important. At the same time, definitions of security are in flux. In the view of Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute, the virus ranks alongside the cold war or 9/11 in terms of its security implications. The original concept of the walled state as protector has been reasserted, but the case for traditional defence spending has weakened. The army has had its role in the UK crisis, but the aircraft carrier has proved irrelevant, acting as much as an incubator as a shield from the virus. If the new stealth bomber is a pathogen, vaccines are the new missile defence system. In a post-coronavirus comprehensive spending review it will be health and not defence that will be first in the queue for the distribution of dwindling resources, Chalmers suggests. Beatrice Heuser, professor of international relations at Glasgow University, predicts defence officials \u201cwill have to cook their books like hell to reach the Nato target of spending at 2% of GDP\u201d. There is a final issue for Britain: relevance. Many analysts also fear that the UK\u2019s credibility as a leading convening power on the whole nexus of issues of the climate crisis, global health and development has taken a hit by its performance over coronavirus. Bill Gates may right to say that no country is likely to get an A grade for its pandemic preparedness, but judging by the European press the UK is currently near the bottom of the class, labelled, rightly or wrongly, as leading on \u201cherd immunity\u201d and then abandoning the policy. Niblett argues that \u201cBrexit was such a shock to people that thought Britain was pragmatic and had a sense of its national interest. Now the almost wilful lack of preparation over coronavirus makes it feel like Britain just assumed it was separate, an island off the coast of Europe, and it has discovered it is not. It does play into a lethal combination of incompetence and hubris that has been used against Britain for a while now. \u201cOn global health we will have taken a knock. Even though our scientific and university calling card remains unparalleled, the NHS was held up to a mirror and it has been shown at best to be underfunded. We could be put into an Anglo\u2013US box of just-in-time living, and that seems less worthy of imitation. Soft power is all about attraction and people wishing to imitate you.\u201d Miliband also issues a warning that Britain will need to be \u201cbrutally honest about its mistakes or risk irrelevance\u201d. He sees one cause of optimism. \u201cThis may be the first global crisis where it is British universities seeking a vaccine, British companies developing contact tracing apps, British NGOs framing global connections. It is these institutions that may lead government rather than government provide the lead.\u201d The Foreign Office is also urging Johnson to recognise there is a hard-won reputation on which he can draw. As far back as 2008, the UK government published a cross-government white paper entitled \u201chealth is global\u201d. The paper argued that health should be seen as \u201can agent for good in foreign policy\u201d so the UK was in at the birth of health diplomacy. The UK may have been trounced in the election to head the WHO in 2017, but there are influential Brits all around the international health set-up. UK\u2019s strong medical research base, large aid budget and an interventionist mindset gives Johnson the platform from which to engage. The natural instinct within Whitehall is to be a player, but it will require leadership that only a prime minister can provide. Greenwich, according to Nicholas Hawksmoor, writing in 1728, was chosen as the site of Royal Hospital because it was located on the bend in the river \u201cin the View of all the World and in the Sight of the Grand Emporium London\u201d. The nation\u2019s wealth and global outlook were seen as interdependent. It will be up to Johnson to decide if and how he honours that tradition.",

      "bodyText": "The Covid-19 pandemic could \u201csmoulder\u201d in Africa for several years after killing as many as 190,000 people in the coming 12 months, the World Health Organization has said. The WHO warned last month that there could be 10m infections on the continent within six months, though experts said the pandemic\u2019s impact would depend on governments\u2019 actions. A study released by the organisation this week predicts that between 29 million to 44 million people could become infected in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail. This \u201cwould overwhelm the available medical capacity in much of Africa\u201d where there are only nine intensive care unit beds per million people. \u201cWhile Covid-19 likely won\u2019t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smoulder in transmission hotspots,\u201d said the director of the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa region, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. \u201cCovid-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.\u201d The research looked at 47 countries in the WHO African Region with a total population of one billion. More than 51,000 people in Africa have been infected and 2,012 have died. The total number of cases has risen sharply in the past week. \u201cOverall \u2026 we are looking at community spread in some countries \u2026 We are estimating that this will peak in four to six weeks if nothing is done,\u201d Moeti told reporters on Thursday. Most countries have imposed lockdowns of varying severity that appear to have slowed the spread of the virus. \u201cWe have to recognise that African governments are doing a lot,\u201d said Stephen Karingi, a director at the UN Economic Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa. \u201cProjections were that we would be in a war situation by now, but because of the measures taken by governments and communities, transmission rates are lower than we\u2019ve seen elsewhere.\u201d It is unclear, however, how effective the measures have been in some places and there are concerns about the level of testing carried out on the continent. Africa has carried out a fraction of the number of tests in other regions, at around 685 per million people, and there are fears that the official statistics do not reflect true extent of the pandemic in Africa. Somalia was forced to dramatically revise official statistics after it became clear that the deaths of hundreds of people from the virus in the unstable East African country had gone unrecorded. Authorities in Nigeria also initially denied that a major outbreak in the northern city of Kano was Covid-19, and there are widespread concerns that Tanzania is concealing the severity of its outbreak to protect the president, John Magufuli, who has refused to ban religious services and large gatherings. Tanzania has declared at least 480 confirmed cases and 18 deaths, the fourth highest total in eastern Africa. The data is from Sunday, the most recent day the government has released figures for. Magufuli has said the imported coronavirus test kits were faulty after they returned positive results on a goat and a pawpaw fruit. Dr John Nkengasong, the head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Thursday that the tests were working very well and that African states were not testing enough. \u201cIf we test we will find \u2026 we cannot be complacent.

There has been community transmission in South Africa for several weeks, but experts expect the pandemic to peak between July and early September. The effort to contain the disease in South Africa, where there have been 7,808 cases and 150 deaths, has been lauded as one of the most successful in the world. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, the South African government\u2019s chief adviser, said the country had been on a similar trajectory to the UK for three weeks before its outbreak took a different turn. \u201cWe put 30,000 community health workers on the ground and decided to actively go out and look for outbreaks, and stem the tide before cases reached hospitals,\u201d Karim said.

      "bodyText": "Congressional investigators in Washington are demanding information about loans and other funds that the Trump Organization has requested from foreign governments, including Britain, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The demand for information follows a media report last month that said the Trump Organization was seeking UK and Irish bailout funds to cover wages of employees who had been furloughed from the company\u2019s golf properties in Europe due to the pandemic. In a letter to Eric Trump, the president\u2019s son and vice president of the Trump Organization, Carolyn Maloney, the Democratic chairwoman of the House oversight and reform committee, suggested the decision to seek funding in the UK was problematic and potentially a violation of the US constitution, which calls for a president to have undivided loyalty to the US. The US Congress has already passed legislation prohibiting US taxpayer funds from being used to benefit companies in which Donald Trump holds a stake. \u201cApart from the grave emoluments clause problems your actions cause in the United States, officials in the United Kingdom have raised serious concerns about using their own taxpayer funds to bail out President Trump\u2019s companies,\u201d Maloney wrote. She pointed to reported remarks by Martin Ford, a councillor in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where one of Trump\u2019s two Scottish luxury properties is located, who said he did not believe UK taxpayers ought to be helping Trump given the president\u2019s own personal wealth. \u201cThe huge tab for this will be borne throughout the whole population through higher taxes,\u201d Ford told Bloomberg News. In her request, Maloney called on Eric Trump to deliver by 21 May \u201call documents and communications relating to the Trump Organization\u2019s application for any loans or other funds from any domestic or foreign government entity, including the British government\u201d. The congresswoman is also seeking all documents and communications between the Trump Organization and any US federal employees and officials that relate to the novel coronavirus. Bloomberg News reported in April that the Trump Organization was seeking the bailout money to help pay for bartenders, bagpipers, and other employees who have been furloughed. Trump, who still retains a personal stake in the company, owns three golf resorts in the UK and Ireland. The demand for information by the powerful chairwoman of the House oversight committee, which has the power to subpoena documents and investigate \u201cany matter\u201d, does not automatically mean the documents will be delivered to Congress. The Trump administration has refused previous demands for information, in defiance of congressional authority. In a previous statement to USA Today, Eric Trump said the British government\u2019s job retention plan, which allows companies to seek government funds to pay for most of furloughed employees\u2019 salaries, was intended to help the company retain and support its staff. \u201cThe job retention plan created by the UK Government has nothing to do with the Trump Organization and does not benefit the business \u2013 it is solely about protecting people and their families who would otherwise be out of work,\u201d he said.",

We would huddle safe in our underground shelter, grabbed from my bed in the dark by my father, nestled among soil and spiders. As I grew older we played hiding from Germans in the wheatfields, and swapped pieces of fallen shrapnel. We were aware of mysterious worried chatter among the grownups. My father\u2019s Home Guard rifle stood in the hall.</p> <p>Then suddenly, in May 1945, there was this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/exhausted-relieved-yearning-for-change-britain-on-ve-day\">explosion of light</a>: brightness was everywhere. And excitement, laughter, joy. Everything was allowed. \u201cIt\u201d was over. Even our teachers relaxed, laughing too. The great deadly cloud of threat lifted. We knew from the song that, \u201cSomewhere over the rainbow skies are blue, and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true\u201d. And they had. It was our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU\">Over the Rainbow</a> moment.</p> <p>From my village, Hazel Grove, south of industrial, smoky Stockport, the clanging tram would take me to school and back every day. But VE Day was different: a corporation tram was decked out with lights on every surface, glittering like Cinderella\u2019s coach. As the evening darkened it came rattling down the track, through cheering crowds. At the terminal we were all gathered: families, shopkeepers, teachers, doctors. Even the vicar.</p> <p>For the first time I was allowed to gallivant off with friends. Suddenly all the young people joined hands, circling the now stationary tram, and skipped and danced round it into the night. Yes, the world would never be the same again: a future without war, without bombing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/08/rationing-second-world-war1\">rationing</a>, fear, damage, death. </p> <p>Today, 75 years later, I ask myself: will it be like this when the coronavirus is defeated?

But though we can\u2019t expect that instant euphoria, there are larger parallels.</p> <p>The war taught us many things: fellow feeling, shared values, resourcefulness. People grew their own fruit and veg, kept chickens. Of course, there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/aug/29/blitz-london-crime-flourish-blackout\">black market</a>; petty crime increased, and the rich dined at the Dorchester.

There is a drive to make things better.</p> <p>During the war, improvements were already being mapped out: in 1942, William Beveridge (a Liberal) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/10/beveridge-five-evils-welfare-state\">published a report</a> attacking what he called the five giants: idleness, ignorance, disease, squalor and want. He first used the phrase \u201cfrom cradle to grave\u201d to describe universal provision, and his study would be a blueprint for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education\">postwar welfare state</a>.</p> <p>In 1944 Rab Butler ( a Tory) saw through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/22/1944-education-act-butler-policy-today\">Education Act</a>, which completely transformed schooling in Britain by abolishing fees for all state secondary education. It also introduced the 11-plus exam, splitting educational options: I, the granddaughter of factory workers, passed, and went to a grammar school. This was all happening even as we battled the enemy in the Mediterranean and Normandy. It was based on creating a more equitable society, and there was a wide consensus this should be so. It translated into a Tory defeat in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/26/in-praise-1945-general-election\">1945 general election</a>. Churchill was shocked: hadn\u2019t he won the war for us? But change was pressing forward.</p> <p>Will change on a similar scale come to us in the coming years? Who is doing the planning right now?

It is, like Covid-19, a global issue. In confronting the one, as we already are doing, we could also seize the chance to confront the other.

It also introduced the 11-plus exam, splitting educational options: I, the granddaughter of factory workers, passed, and went to a grammar school. This was all happening even as we battled the enemy in the Mediterranean and Normandy. It was based on creating a more equitable society, and there was a wide consensus this should be so. It translated into a Tory defeat in the 1945 general election. Churchill was shocked: hadn\u2019t he won the war for us? But change was pressing forward. Will change on a similar scale come to us in the coming years? Who is doing the planning right now? Who is setting out the blueprint for a fairer society? The ever growing disparity of wealth \u2013 between individuals, between countries \u2013 is probably the major blight of our present world order. It is, like Covid-19, a global issue. In confronting the one, as we already are doing, we could also seize the chance to confront the other. It is an opportunity that may not come again. \u2022 Joan Bakewell is a broadcaster, writer and Labour peer",

Morrison said he hoped step three could be achieved in July, but it would be up to each state and territory when they moved from one step to the next. Below are some of the areas that will be opened up at each stage, according to the plan \u2013 and you can see the timeline for easing restrictions in each state here. Step One Step one will see us connecting with more friends and family, and see businesses, educational campuses and sporting facilities start to reopen. Restrictions on gatherings will be relaxed, allowing for: Non-work gatherings of up to 10 people in public Up to five visitors to your home Up to 10 guests at a wedding, in addition to the couple and the celebrant Up to 20 mourners allowed at a funeral if indoors, and 30 if outdoors Religious gatherings with up to 10 attendees Employees should continue to work from home if it is suitable for them and their employer, though all businesses should develop a Covid-safe plan to prepare for staff returning to the workplace.

Step one will also see children back in classrooms and in playgrounds in their communities, and universities and technical colleges increasing face-to-face teaching where possible. Some sporting facilities will be made available once again. Indoor gyms will stay closed, but up to 10 people at a time will be able to: Use community centres, outdoor gyms, playgrounds, and skate parks Take part in outdoor organised sport, like golf and boot camps. While interstate borders will most likely remain closed to tourists, intrastate travel to regional areas for recreation should start back up. Hostels and hotels will be open for accommodation, but caravan parks and camping grounds could remain closed to tourists in some states and territories. Queensland has announced it will move to stage 1 on 15 May, and Tasmania will do so on 18 May, subject to public health advice. Other states have yet to specify the date.

One of the government\u2019s Sage scientific advisers told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly damaging \u2026 If people are primed to look at things in a certain way, it will shape how they receive the information. So on Sunday they will be looking for the green lights and they won\u2019t notice the red lights. It\u2019s a really powerful way of influencing people.\u201d Johnson is due on Sunday to detail how restrictions will actually be eased, with the confusion prompting Dominic Raab to stress that changes will be modest and people should continue to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/07/pm-will-announce-modest-changes-to-uk-lockdown-says-raab\">follow physical distancing guidelines over the bank holiday weekend</a>.</p> \n<p>China has said it is \u201calways open to cooperate\u201d with World Health Organization investigations into the origins of the coronavirus, despite the WHO saying it has made repeated requests to be involved and had no response. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/global-report-china-open-to-cooperate-with-who-on-virus-origin-as-trump-repeats-lab-claim\">The conflicting statements</a> come amid a deepening row between China and the US over accusations the outbreak began in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 a claim China denies and for which the US is yet to provide evidence.

Boris Johnson\u2019s government is facing fierce criticism and warnings that it is priming the public to give up on the lockdown, after a rash of headlines pointed to a significant easing next week. One of the government\u2019s Sage scientific advisers told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly damaging \u2026 If people are primed to look at things in a certain way, it will shape how they receive the information. So on Sunday they will be looking for the green lights and they won\u2019t notice the red lights. It\u2019s a really powerful way of influencing people.\u201d Johnson is due on Sunday to detail how restrictions will actually be eased, with the confusion prompting Dominic Raab to stress that changes will be modest and people should continue to follow physical distancing guidelines over the bank holiday weekend. China has said it is \u201calways open to cooperate\u201d with World Health Organization investigations into the origins of the coronavirus, despite the WHO saying it has made repeated requests to be involved and had no response. The conflicting statements come amid a deepening row between China and the US over accusations the outbreak began in a Chinese laboratory \u2013 a claim China denies and for which the US is yet to provide evidence. An editorial in the Communist party\u2019s Global Times newspaper said: \u201cTo win in the elections, there is nothing else White House can do than to pass the buck to China.\u201d Australia has outlined a three-step plan for easing restrictions. Step one will include gatherings of 10 people, the return of interstate travel and the reopening of playgrounds and small cafes. And the eyes of the football world will be on the Jeonju World Cup Stadium in Korea tonight when the K-League becomes the first major competition to resume play. Our live blog coverage continues and here is how things look at a glance. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Here\u2019s to victory in Europe \u2013 RAF jets will roar over Britain to mark this 75th anniversary of VE Day. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will lead a two-minute silence from Scotland on a day of celebration and commemoration which also includes a \u201cnational toast\u201d, an address by the Queen, and a nationwide sing-a-long of Vera Lynn\u2019s We\u2019ll Meet Again. Original plans for VE Day 75 were cancelled due to Covid-19, so national events have been adapted. The public in lockdown is encouraged to celebrate Victory in Europe from their gardens, doorsteps and living rooms. Here is a timeline of official events. Boris Johnson visited Westminster Abbey on Thursday to pay his respects, and will observe Friday\u2019s two-minute silence from Downing Street, from where he will also speak with second world war veterans via video call. * * * Evacuations widen after Indian gas leak \u2013 Indian officials have evacuated more people from the area around a chemical plant in Andhra Pradesh that leaked toxic gas, killing at least 11 people and sickening hundreds more. LG Chem said there was not a second leak but it had asked for a widened evacuation as a precaution because of concerns tank temperatures could rise: \u201cWe are taking necessary measures, including putting water into the tank.\u201d Gas from styrene, a principal raw material at the plant, leaked during the early hours of Thursday, authorities said. People were exposed in their homes and collapsed in the streets. A local police commissioner, RK Meena, said that by Thursday afternoon 11 people had been confirmed dead. The Times of India said 5,000 people had fallen sick. * * * Two charged with black jogger\u2019s murder \u2013 A white ex-policeman and his son have been arrested over the death of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man who was shot while jogging in Georgia, US. Overnight the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, had been arrested and charged with murder and aggravated assault. Arbery was killed on 23 February just outside the port city of Brunswick. The men, who pursued him in a pickup truck, told police they believed Arbery was a burglar. * * * Andrew faces chalet lawsuit \u2013 Prince Andrew is caught in a dispute over a Swiss ski chalet with reports legal proceedings have been launched against him over an unpaid bill. Le Temps newspaper said Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, bought the holiday home in the Verbier ski resort for \u00a318.3m in 2014. They did not meet a December 2019 payment deadline for part of that sum, the newspaper reported.

      "bodyText": "The corporate watchdog is looking into a new investment product issued by Mayfair 101, the group that has bought the cyclone-ravaged Dunk Island resort, after alleging in court that it had misled people by comparing its previous offerings to bank term deposits. On Thursday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued a general warning against advertisements that compare fixed-interest products to bank term deposits as part of a broader crackdown on potentially misleading marketing by investment groups. The increased focus on investment advertising comes after federal court action in which Asic accused Mayfair 101 of misleading and deceptive conduct in advertising and marketing two of its products, M+ Fixed Income and M Core Fixed Income, by comparing them to term deposits. During that court case Asic also raised concerns about the solvency of Mayfair 101, after founder James Mawhinney said in an affidavit that the group would need to find new sources of money to fund its commitments if the two products were banned. On 16 April the court ordered Mayfair 101 not to advertise the two products, which it had heavily promoted through website termdepositguide.com and in newspaper ads, and into which investors have pumped a total of $140m. The following week, on 22 April, Mayfair 101 launched a new product, a \u201cproperty bond\u201d, that it said would be used \u201cto power Mission Beach and Dunk Island revival\u201d. Dunk Island is Mayfair 101\u2019s flagship project. The company bought it from the family of Linc Energy founder Peter Bond for $31m last year, and launched its plans to revitalise the entire area at a glitzy party on the island attended by Instagram influencers, the singer Ricki-Lee and independent MP Bob Katter. As Guardian Australia has reported, the investment group needed cash totalling $135m by September to complete the purchase of more than 200 properties in the Mission Beach area, close to Dunk Island. Mayfair 101 is defending itself against Asic\u2019s legal actions and has previously said it is committed to completing the project. \u201cThe group has the support of some significant investors who consider our strategy in Mission Beach to be timely given the desire for people to live in lower-density regions,\u201d it told Guardian Australia in late March. The group has previously said its financial products are \u201cfully compliant\u201d with the law and that it \u201chas cooperated with all Asic\u2019s information requests and has already added additional information to its website and materials to further ensure investors are fully informed about the risks and rewards of its investment products\u201d. The federal court has ordered Asic not to issue a specific warning against Mayfair 101\u2019s products without giving the company two days\u2019 notice. However, Thursday\u2019s warning does not name any product issuers and Asic\u2019s warning is also aimed at other companies offering similar products. Bird said anxious investors were looking for safe options amid the coronavirus crisis. \u201cWe\u2019d hate to see them think, \u2018I need to do something safe with my money,\u2019 and end up in one of these products,\u201d she said. She said Asic was also aware of Mayfair 101\u2019s new high-interest \u201cAustralian Property Bonds\u201d, which are advertised as \u201can effective way to generate a yield on your idle money with the security support of registered first mortgages over properties of your choice in Australia\u2019s upcoming tourism mecca \u2013 Mission Beach, Queensland\u201d. \u201cWe are looking at that product,\u201d she said. However, she declined to say what action Asic might take over the bonds, which offer interest rates of up to 9.2% a month. Asic\u2019s head of investment managers, Rhys Bollen, said other types of advertising Asic was looking at included representations that funds invested in cash when in fact they did not, as well as statements about the assets backing investments and the ease of withdrawal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build on this theme over the next little while,\u201d he said. Mayfair 101 has been contacted for comment.",

      "bodyText": "United Nations chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has said the coronavirus pandemic has unleashed a \u201ctsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering\u201d, and appealed for an all-out effort \u201cto end hate speech globally.\u201d The UN secretary-general said anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and on the streets, and highlighted the spread of antisemitic conspiracy theories and Covid-19-related anti-Muslim attacks. His comments came as China said it was \u201calways open to cooperate\u201d with World Health Organisation (WHO) investigations into the origins of the coronavirus, as Donald Trump repeated claims that the outbreak originated in a Wuhan laboratory. Trump\u2019s claims, for which the US is yet to provide evidence, have fuelled tension between the two superpowers and placed a crucial trade deal between the two countries in jeopardy. The global death toll from the outbreak passed 269,500 on Friday and the WHO warned that deaths in Africa could reach 190,000. As speculation swirled about where the virus originated, Guterres said migrants and refugees have been vilified as a source of the virus and then denied access to medical treatment. \u201cWith older persons among the most vulnerable, contemptible memes have emerged suggesting they are also the most expendable, \u201che said. \u201cAnd journalists, whistleblowers, health professionals, aid workers and human rights defenders are being targeted simply for doing their jobs.\u201d Guterres called on political leaders to show solidarity with all people, on educational institutions to focus on digital literacy at a time when extremists are seeking to prey on captive and potentially despairing audiences. He called on the media, especially social media, to remove racist, misogynist and other harmful content, on civil society to strengthen their outreach to vulnerable people, and on religious figures to serve as models of mutual respect. \u201cAnd I ask everyone, everywhere, to stand up against hate, treat each other with dignity and take every opportunity to spread kindness,\u201d Guterres said. The secretary-general stressed that Covid-19 \u201cdoes not care who we are, where we live, what we believe or about any other distinction\u201d. His global appeal to address and counter Covid-19-related hate speech follows his April 23 message calling the coronarivus pandemic a human crisis that is fast becoming a human rights crisis. On Thursday foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, said China supported WHO efforts to investigate the source of the virus, and \u201care always open to cooperate with the WHO on matters, including on the question of origin\u201d. \u201cChina agrees to make a conclusion on the origin of the virus at an appropriate time,\u201d Hua said. Late on Thursday Trump insisted that \u201csomething happened\u201d at the Wuhan lab. \u201cProbably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,\u201d he said. Chinese officials and state media have reacted harshly to the claims, accusing Trump, Pompeo, and US officials of blaming China to cover up US failings in its outbreak-response, and seeking to improve Trump\u2019s electoral chances. The US is among a number of countries, including Australia, calling for an independent investigation into the source of the outbreak and for China to allow access, but the US has largely stood alone in pushing the theory that the virus originated at a Chinese laboratory, specifically the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The comments by Hua on Thursday appear at odds with information provided earlier by the WHO and confirmed just hours before Hua\u2019s press conference, which suggested repeated requests for involvement had gone unanswered. A spokesman confirmed to the Guardian on Thursday that the WHO\u2019s emergency committee had recommended on 23 January, then again on 30 January, and again during its joint mission to Wuhan that \u201cWHO and China investigate the animal source of the outbreak\u201d. The spokesman said the committee \u201creiterated its call for cooperation in an investigation\u201d last week, and that the WHO had also made multiple inquiries with China about domestic investigations. As of Thursday afternoon \u201carrangements for a meeting on the subject\u201d were understood to still be in planning stages. The Guardian has sought further updates. In other coronavirus developments: Australia outlined a three-step plan for easing restrictions. Step one will include gatherings of 10 people, the return of interstate travel and the reopening of playgrounds and small cafes. India has ramped up output of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine hailed by US President Donald Trump as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the fight against coronavirus. New Zealand weighed into the debate about Taiwan joining the WHO, saying it has a lot to offer the world after its success in controlling the outbreak. Mexico recorded its highest daily number of cases of 1,982. The White House has reportedly blocked release of CDC guidance on reopening businesses. North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un has sent a letter to Chinese leader Xi Jinping congratulating him on China\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in controlling the virus. Despite the row between Beijing and Washington, Chinese vice premier Liu He, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and United States trade representative Robert Lighthizer held a phone call late on Thursday in which they spoke about the phase one trade agreement between the two countries signed earlier this year. The two sides agreed there was \u201cgood progress\u201d and that they expect to meet the obligations under the deal. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2020 to clarify that 1,982 was the number of daily cases in Mexico, not daily deaths as an earlier version had implied.",

But the three-month break from payments \u2013 typically worth \u00a3755 a month \u2013 will come to an end much sooner than this crisis. What next?</p> <p>Boris Johnson will set out Britain\u2019s lockdown exit strategy this weekend. We\u2019re told its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/picnics-and-sunbathing-on-cards-as-pm-expected-to-allow-more-time-outside\">sunbathing and picnics straightaway</a>, maybe schools and cafes opening by the end of June, and pubs and restaurants by the end of August \u2013 so long as social distancing is maintained. Try choreographing that in a Friday night bar.</p> <p>The reality is that hotels, pubs, cinemas, restaurants, conference centres, music venues, gyms and all the trades that supply them are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal ahead of next year. Add to that the collapse in the aviation industry \u2013 employment in whole towns such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/crawley-worst-uk-coronavirus-job-losses-aviation\">Crawley</a>, near Gatwick, is being wiped out \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty inevitable that millions of people will remain out of work throughout this year.</p> <p>The Bank of England is projecting a 14% dive in GDP and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/uk-economy-to-shrink-by-25-percent-and-unemployment-to-double-warns-bank-of-england-coronavirus\">doubling in unemployment,</a> much, but not all of it, reversed next year.</p> <p>The current mortgage payment-holiday sticking plaster isn\u2019t enough. When, from June, the three-month period arranged by borrowers and their banks expires (and the chancellor also begins to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">unwind the furlough scheme</a>) huge numbers of householders will still need help. And there\u2019s no word from government yet about what, if anything, comes next.</p> <p>Here are a few ideas kicking around the mortgage industry which the chancellor could consider:</p> <h2><strong>A mandatory extension of the three month payment holiday to six months</strong></h2> <p>Banks would automatically have to grant an extension, with no impact on the borrower\u2019s credit record. But banks are likely to bridle at this; while 1.6m home loans on holiday may seem relatively manageable in a country of 27 million households, by value they add up to about 20% of their total mortgage book. Half a year without any income from one-fifth of their loans won\u2019t push any bank or building society into insolvency, but may present serious financing issues for some.</p> <h2><strong>A qualified extension of the payment holiday, with many more hoops to jump through</strong> </h2> <p>This is the more likely option. The banks, to their credit, put the new payment holiday systems in place extraordinarily rapidly (funny the things Britain is good at \u2013 payment systems rather than virus testing or PPE production). Privately, they believe that a not insignificant number applied for a payment holiday as a \u201cnice to have\u201d rather than a necessity. If they are to prolong the current holidays, the banks want to be much more selective about who they give it to.</p> <h2><strong>A vastly improved welfare net for the unemployed with mortgages</strong><em> </em></h2> <p>The crisis has revealed to the middle classes how threadbare Britain\u2019s welfare system really is. If you are unemployed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/11/universal-credit-how-claim-coronavirus-lay-offs-benefits\">applying for universal credit</a>, you can\u2019t access mortgage support until you have been claiming benefits and not earning for nine months. The calculation of the benefit is, inevitably, absurdly complicated. And it\u2019s not even really a benefit \u2013 it\u2019s a loan that accrues interest and has to be paid back.

      "bodyText": "Currently 1.6 million homeowners are not paying their mortgages after taking a \u201cpayment holiday\u201d at the start of the coronavirus crisis. But the three-month break from payments \u2013 typically worth \u00a3755 a month \u2013 will come to an end much sooner than this crisis. What next? Boris Johnson will set out Britain\u2019s lockdown exit strategy this weekend. We\u2019re told its sunbathing and picnics straightaway, maybe schools and cafes opening by the end of June, and pubs and restaurants by the end of August \u2013 so long as social distancing is maintained. Try choreographing that in a Friday night bar. The reality is that hotels, pubs, cinemas, restaurants, conference centres, music venues, gyms and all the trades that supply them are unlikely to return to anywhere near normal ahead of next year. Add to that the collapse in the aviation industry \u2013 employment in whole towns such as Crawley, near Gatwick, is being wiped out \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty inevitable that millions of people will remain out of work throughout this year. The Bank of England is projecting a 14% dive in GDP and a doubling in unemployment, much, but not all of it, reversed next year. The current mortgage payment-holiday sticking plaster isn\u2019t enough. When, from June, the three-month period arranged by borrowers and their banks expires (and the chancellor also begins to unwind the furlough scheme) huge numbers of householders will still need help. And there\u2019s no word from government yet about what, if anything, comes next. Here are a few ideas kicking around the mortgage industry which the chancellor could consider: A mandatory extension of the three month payment holiday to six months Banks would automatically have to grant an extension, with no impact on the borrower\u2019s credit record. But banks are likely to bridle at this; while 1.6m home loans on holiday may seem relatively manageable in a country of 27 million households, by value they add up to about 20% of their total mortgage book. Half a year without any income from one-fifth of their loans won\u2019t push any bank or building society into insolvency, but may present serious financing issues for some. A qualified extension of the payment holiday, with many more hoops to jump through This is the more likely option. The banks, to their credit, put the new payment holiday systems in place extraordinarily rapidly (funny the things Britain is good at \u2013 payment systems rather than virus testing or PPE production). Privately, they believe that a not insignificant number applied for a payment holiday as a \u201cnice to have\u201d rather than a necessity. If they are to prolong the current holidays, the banks want to be much more selective about who they give it to. A vastly improved welfare net for the unemployed with mortgages The crisis has revealed to the middle classes how threadbare Britain\u2019s welfare system really is. If you are unemployed and applying for universal credit, you can\u2019t access mortgage support until you have been claiming benefits and not earning for nine months. The calculation of the benefit is, inevitably, absurdly complicated. And it\u2019s not even really a benefit \u2013 it\u2019s a loan that accrues interest and has to be paid back. The designers of the system evidently never envisaged the enormous, if temporary, dislocation brought on by a pandemic. UK Finance, the group that represents the banks, told me they are \u201ccarefully considering options for those who may need further support at the end of the three-month payment holiday period\u201d. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, may want to give them a bit of a hard nudge. We are going to need something more robust in place in weeks, not months. Meanwhile the forgotten millions in this story are tenants in the private rented sector. Economically, this crisis is devastating the young, many of whom were working in low-paid jobs in the hospitality and services sector. When the furlough scheme ends and the temporary ban on evictions lapses, the prospects for many in their 20s and 30s is grim. There are payment holidays for mortgage holders and landlords, loans for businesses, bailouts for big firms, but for tenants, almost nothing.

There\u2019s a worry that, with other countries opening up, the UK could be left behind. The prime minister\u2019s former business adviser Andrew Griffith \u2013 elected as an MP in December \u2013 has warned that every day the UK economy is in lockdown, and its competitors aren\u2019t, means lost business.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion we\u2019re completely fucked,\u201d says one MP. \u201cThere were people who said the government would get credit for its response.

Another adds: \u201cPeople like lockdown?

Labour could in time join with Tory rebels to try to force the Commons to return.</p> <p>And a lost vote could be a sign of things to come. With a majority of 80, Johnson remains in a strong position. But, under him, No 10 doesn\u2019t devote much time to keeping MPs on side, and the problems are racking up. Many MPs are still stung over a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/boris-johnson-reshuffle-whos-in-whos-out-at-a-glance\">reshuffle</a> that left a number of ambitious middle-aged politicians on the sidelines. The vote due this summer on allowing Huawei to help build the UK\u2019s 5G network is on course to be lost \u2013 with moderate MPs now taking a hardline stance on Chinese influence in the wake of coronavirus.</p> <p>Meanwhile, any increase in taxes to pay off the debts caused by the crisis could be a hard sell. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realise is a lot of the new intake haven\u2019t spent years planning for high office. They\u2019ll just do what they think is right,\u201d one MP told me.</p> <p>Even if Johnson can turn around the mood in his party on Sunday night, his party management problem may be only just beginning.</p> <ul> <li><p>Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p></li> </ul>",

Wait until the furlough scheme ends.\u201d With the chancellor looking at ways to bring the scheme to a gradual close, there\u2019s a concern that, without a clear strategy for reopening businesses across different sectors, mass unemployment beckons. Johnson could turn things around on Sunday by setting out a clear outline for the next few months \u2013 but as one MP puts it, expectations are \u201cvery high\u201d. Others still hold the view that it\u2019s time to cut the government some slack. \u201cI might not like lockdown but the current figures just don\u2019t suggest we should be rushing to relax things,\u201d says a more supportive Tory MP. Should the situation deteriorate, one MP predicts that the government could start to lose parliamentary votes. Labour could in time join with Tory rebels to try to force the Commons to return. And a lost vote could be a sign of things to come. With a majority of 80, Johnson remains in a strong position. But, under him, No 10 doesn\u2019t devote much time to keeping MPs on side, and the problems are racking up. Many MPs are still stung over a reshuffle that left a number of ambitious middle-aged politicians on the sidelines. The vote due this summer on allowing Huawei to help build the UK\u2019s 5G network is on course to be lost \u2013 with moderate MPs now taking a hardline stance on Chinese influence in the wake of coronavirus. Meanwhile, any increase in taxes to pay off the debts caused by the crisis could be a hard sell. \u201cWhat they don\u2019t realise is a lot of the new intake haven\u2019t spent years planning for high office. They\u2019ll just do what they think is right,\u201d one MP told me. Even if Johnson can turn around the mood in his party on Sunday night, his party management problem may be only just beginning.

Covid-19 has been a tragedy for the UK and countless other nations. But as it eases, some aspects of life will change. More bikes on the roads is one where it could change for the better.</p> <h2>1. Remember \u2013 it\u2019s safer than you might think</h2> <p>Safety, and just as importantly, perceived safety, is perhaps the biggest barrier to more cycling. And if you start riding regularly, a scary incident or two with a motor vehicle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/11/female-cyclists-bad-driving-harassment-study-uk-women-men-near-miss\">is inevitable</a> at some point. But while the UK\u2019s streets could and should be much safer for cycling, very serious incidents remain rare, with a serious injury or death <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/686969/pedal-cycle-factsheet-2017.pdf\">once every million miles</a> ridden.</p> <h2>2. You\u2019ll be doing yourself a lot of good</h2> <p>About 100 cyclists are killed a year in the UK. But how many people die because of ailments connected to long-term physical inactivity? <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/physical-activity-applying-all-our-health/physical-activity-applying-all-our-health\">About 100,000</a>. Everyday cycling is <a href=\"https://www.eltis.org/sites/default/files/case-studies/documents/anderson_et_al_2008_all-cause_morality_5.pdf\">one of the </a><a href=\"https://www.eltis.org/sites/default/files/case-studies/documents/anderson_et_al_2008_all-cause_morality_5.pdf\">best ways</a> to improve your health. Even a fairly sedate pace counts as moderate activity, and if you rack up half an hour of this, five times a week, you\u2019re already past the recommended minimum for aerobic activity.</p> <h2>3. The health benefits massively outweigh the risks</h2> <p>Studies <a href=\"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.0901747\">have calculated</a> that even in the UK, the benefit\u2013risk ratio is about seven to one. This even includes pollution. A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412019337122\">new study</a> has found that the health gains from both walking and cycling outweigh the risks from smog even in cities like Beijing and New Delhi.</p> <h2>4. You\u2019ll be doing others a lot of good</h2> <p>This might not be your primary motivation, but it all counts. If you cycle rather than drive, you\u2019re sparing others the associated noise, danger, climate emissions and pollution of car use. This last is particularly relevant given studies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/is-air-pollution-making-the-coronavirus-pandemic-even-more-deadly\">linking high levels of pollution</a> to worse outcomes from coronavirus.</p> <h2>5. You\u2019ll enjoy it \u2013 really*</h2> <p>For most people, commuting is a chore. Yes, on a train or bus you can listen to a podcast, and a car might feel like precious time alone to think. But your destiny is not in your hands. Bikes have the near-magical ability to, 99% of the time, deliver you to your destination within more or less a minute of when you expected, often with a smile on your face. Bike travel is on a human scale, and at a human speed. It simultaneously gets you places fast, but keeps you in touch with the environment and people around you. All this can become quite addictive.</p> <p>*Not every single day. But most days.</p> <h2>6. You don\u2019t have to dress up in Lycra</h2> <p>There is nothing wrong with donning the full <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=mapei+cycling+kit&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN3-LI1aHpAhVDihoKHRZ1BIgQ2-cCegQIABAA&amp;oq=mapei+cycling+kit&amp;gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzICCAA6BAgAEEM6BggAEAgQHjoGCAAQBxAeOggIABAIEAcQHlDGiAJY6JkCYOWbAmgAcAB4AIAB5QGIAb0JkgEFMC44LjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZw&amp;sclient=img&amp;ei=r_OzXs3LHsOUapbqkcAI&amp;bih=696&amp;biw=1391&amp;hl=en-GB#imgrc=X_irBWBHv5MqKM\">1990s-style Mapei team colours</a> for your ride to work if you prefer, and then having a shower and a change of clothes when you arrive. But for many people this can feel like a chore \u2013 not least making sure you have the necessary clean shoes and jacket at the office. So why not cycle in your work clothes? If your commute isn\u2019t too long or hilly, you don\u2019t need to arrive a sweaty mess. If it is long and/or hilly, you could get an e-bike (see below). The key is not to carry a bag on your back: think about panniers or \u2013 my personal choice \u2013 a basket or crate at the front of the bike. You may also want mudguards, and maybe a chain guard, but this is all fairly simple stuff.</p> <h2>7. Don\u2019t be afraid to rely on bike shops</h2> <p>It is a long time ago now that bike shops were intimidating places, staffed by unsocialised types who \u2013 as in one now reformed London outlet I shall not name \u2013 would sigh heavily if you couldn\u2019t immediately remember the difference between Presta and Schrader inner tube valves. They tend to be very welcoming and happy to talk about anything from a new bike to the best puncture-proof tyres. Most people who run or work in bike shops tend to love cycling. Bike shops are permitted to be open even under the lockdown, as they are considered essential services. Some are not open, but even then it\u2019s worth giving them a ring.</p> <h2>8.

Yes, you do get help from an electric motor, but e-bikes are not cheating. Studies <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259019821930017X?via%3Dihub#bb0015\">have shown</a> that e-bike users tend to get about as much physical activity as those on ordinary bikes, mainly because they tend to use them more often and ride further.</p> <h2>9.

      "bodyText": "Australians may soon be allowed to gather outside in groups of 10 or have up to five visitors at their homes, as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions that will differ from state to state. Scott Morrison has unveiled a three-step plan for restarting economic and social life across the country, setting out an \u201caspirational\u201d target of July for the final phase, when most workers would be back in their workplace, interstate travel would be up and running again, and pubs and clubs would reopen. Speaking after a meeting with state and territory leaders on Friday, the prime minister said he hoped to build momentum to \u201cget Australians back up on their feet and moving ahead with confidence\u201d but acknowledged the need to \u201cwalk before we run\u201d to avoid large new outbreaks of Covid-19 infections. And with many countries still facing severe difficulties containing the virus, Morrison also warned that international travel was unlikely to resume any time soon, with the possible exception of the mooted \u201cbubble\u201d with New Zealand. The exit plan comes as the Reserve Bank argues a V-shaped economic recovery is still \u201cplausible\u201d, but with a warning that a lot hinges on the return of household and business confidence after restrictions are eased. Phase one In the first step of easing the national \u201cbaseline\u201d restrictions, non-work gatherings of up to 10 people would be allowed, along with social events at home with up to five visitors in addition to normal residents. Cafes and restaurants \u2013 which have been restricted to takeaway orders until now \u2013 would be allowed to seat up to 10 patrons at a time, so long as they had four square metres of space per person. More generally, people would be urged to work from home \u201cif it works for you and your employer\u201d \u2013 a change in emphasis from the previous guidance that bosses should allow people to work from home where possible. The first phase would also allow for the opening of retail stores; an increase in face-to-face learning at universities and technical colleges; and the opening of outdoor gyms, playgrounds and skate parks with a limit of 10 people. Childcare centres and schools would be open, the plan says, subject to state and territory arrangements. The maximum number of wedding guests would increase to 10, while funerals could have up to 20 mourners indoors and 30 outdoors. In the first phase, religious gatherings may also have up to 10 attendees. Phase two and three The second step would allow for slightly larger gatherings and more businesses reopening, but pubs and casinos would likely remain closed. The third step would allow non-work gatherings of up to 100 people, while cafes, restaurants and food courts could operate with seating for that same number, and authorities would consider opening bar areas and gaming rooms. Morrison said while the national cabinet had an aspiration to move through the three steps by July, the pace would \u201cbe totally up to the states and territories\u201d and \u201csubject to the health advice\u201d. \u201cPremiers and chief ministers have asked me to stress there should be no expectation of step one starting on day one \u2013 unless they are, indeed, already there,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Canberra. Premiers and chief ministers will announce their moves over the coming days, while the national cabinet will consider a \u201cstocktake\u201d of progress every three weeks. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, described the three-step plan as a \u201cmenu\u201d and argued it would not be safe to have an identical approach across the nation. Andrews, who will outline his plan on Monday, warned that some countries had eased lockdowns too quickly and then been forced to impose even tighter restrictions. \u201cWhether it be popular or not \u2013 I will not make decisions that make that more likely,\u201d Andrews said. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, set out a timetable for restrictions to be eased from 15 May (stage 1), 12 June (stage 2) and 10 July (stage 3). From 15 May, Queenslanders will be able to gather in homes with a maximum of five people and outdoors with 10; beauty salons will be reopened; open homes allowed; and dining in pubs and cafes in outback areas limited to 20 people. Andrew Barr, the chief minister of the Australian Capital Territory, announced an easing of restrictions from midnight, allowing gatherings of up to 10 people in indoor and outdoor settings, although he advised Canberrans to avoid large crowds and keep 1.5m apart from others. Earlier, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, reaffirmed her calls for easing of restrictions to be done in a gradual way so that \u201cwe don\u2019t lose ground\u201d. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, who will announce his plans on Sunday, signalled his state was likely to ease restrictions more quickly than the eastern states as it currently had just nine active cases of Covid-19. Australia has so far had 6,899 confirmed cases, with 97 deaths, but authorities point to a slowing in new cases in recent weeks. Warning on health precautions The chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, urged Australians to continue to maintain physical distancing, or the country \u201ccould lose the battle that we have won so well so far\u201d. While the need for health precautions continue, the ongoing economic costs of the crisis were laid bare in the Reserve Bank\u2019s May economic statement on Friday. It estimated the Australian economy would shrink by 8% in the June quarter, and by a further 6% in the December quarter, but then recover to 7% growth in June 2021 and 6% in December 2021. The scenario is based on \u201cthe relaxation of domestic activity restrictions over coming months, with most of these restrictions lifted by the end of the September quarter\u201d. Under this scenario, unemployment would peak at 10% in the June 2020 quarter, before creeping down to 6.5% in June 2022. In an \u201cupside scenario\u201d where domestic restrictions could be eased faster, combined with greater public confidence in health outcomes, unemployment could return to 5% in \u201ca couple of years\u201d. But if restrictions needed to be reimposed or household and business confidence remains low, unemployment would \u201cdrift down much more gradually\u201d. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, seized on the figures, telling reporters in Canberra the sustained projected unemployment and fall in household incomes showed the economy would not \u201csnap back\u201d as suggested previously by Morrison. Albanese, who is giving a headland speech on the post-coronavirus recovery on Monday, said the slump \u201crequires a government response\u201d and \u201congoing government action in the economy\u201d. Morrison sidestepped two questions about whether he would guarantee economic supports would not be wound back. Morrison confirmed that the second round of $750 payments would be sent out in July but said the government would take decisions \u201cone step at a time\u201d on the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy and the coronavirus supplement that boosts the jobseeker allowance. He noted both programs had a \u201clegislative life\u201d (six months), but said jobkeeper would be reviewed at the end of June. \u201cI can give them the certainty that I want them to be back in their jobs, where they don\u2019t need it,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this plan is about. Not to keep people on income support from the taxpayer, but to have a wage that\u2019s provided by a business that\u2019s successful and earning again and going forward and creating a strong economy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Chile\u2019s rightwing president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, has prompted a firestorm of criticism after naming an open supporter of Augusto Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship as the country\u2019s new minister for women\u2019s rights and gender equality. Controversy over the appointment of Macarena Santelices \u2013 who is also the dictators\u2019s great-niece \u2013 has focused on a 2016 interview in which she praised the \u201cgood side\u201d of the 1973-90 dictatorship in which more than 3,000 people were murdered or disappeared by security forces and many thousands more imprisoned and tortured. She also came under criticism for her outspoken comments against immigrants. Taking office on Wednesday, Santelices denied she had ever \u201cendorsed or justified\u201d human rights violations and appealed to Chileans to \u201cjudge me on what I do from today onwards, as a woman\u201d. But activists said her comments about the period of military rule \u2013 during which at least 316 women were raped while under torture, 11 of whom were pregnant \u2013 were entirely incompatible with her new role. \u201cThis appointment is a flagrant provocation and demonstrates the government\u2019s total disdain for what the Chilean feminist movement is demanding,\u201d said Romina Parada, co-founder of the feminist collective Baila Capucha Baila. \u201cAs far as our collective are concerned, we still don\u2019t have a minister for women\u2019s rights and gender equality,\u201d she said. Santelices studied journalism and worked for several national media outlets before becoming the mayor of Olmu\u00e9, a small town in the lush valleys of central Chile, in 2012. She resigned in October 2019 to run for the governorship of Valpara\u00edso under the banner of the rightwing Independent Democratic Union \u2013 a party founded in 1983 to preserve the political and economic legacy of the dictatorship. The post had been vacant for 54 days since Santelices\u2019s predecessor, Isabel Pl\u00e1, resigned after months of criticism that she had been ineffectual in the role. \u201cWe are extremely concerned by the government\u2019s continued appointments of non-specialist ministers who are wholly unqualified and unprepared for this role,\u201d lamented B\u00e1rbara Sep\u00falveda, the executive director of Chile\u2019s association of feminist lawyers. \u201cThis is a decisive step backwards for women\u2019s rights and sexual diversity in Chile \u2013 it cannot be the case that civil society organisations such as ours continue to bear the weight of upholding the country\u2019s commitment to international human rights standards,\u201d she said. Santelices\u2019s appointment comes amid a growing wave of women\u2019s activism in Chile, two months after more than a million women marched in Santiago on International Women\u2019s Day. So far this year, Chile has seen 14 femicides and 34 cases of attempted femicide. Calls to a domestic violence helpline increased 125% over the final 10 days of March after the imposition of a coronavirus lockdown. In March, Pi\u00f1era signed a new law that broadened the definition of femicide to include perpetrators known to the victim rather than just formal partners or cohabiters. \u201cDuring a period in which patriarchal violence has increased, the president has appointed somebody with no experience or training in gender issues,\u201d explained Javiera Manzi, a spokeswoman for the Coordinadora Feminista 8M organisation. \u201cWe will not allow a person who embodies everything we stand against to lead this ministry, and as such demand her immediate removal from the role.\u201d The hashtag #WeHaveNoMinister has trended on social media since her appointment and several other feminist and transgender rights organisations \u2013 including Sep\u00falveda and Parada\u2019s collectives \u2013 have joined calls for Santelices\u2019s resignation.",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m a care worker in Liverpool, where I go from house to house providing support to elderly and vulnerable people. Some of them have become like family to me. When the virus began to ripple across the UK, I became extremely worried about the risks I could pose to those in my care.</p> <p>I asked the manager of our company if our working practices would change to avoid spreading the virus. The answer was no; against my better instincts, I carried on work as usual. In the weeks that followed, many of the people we look after cancelled their care packages. With their own family members now furloughed, they didn\u2019t need us to look after them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Clients pay more to be taken out, so these visits bring in more money for the company. But they\u2019re a huge infection risk</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like many care workers in the UK, I\u2019m on a zero-hours contract. My hours plummeted to between four and eight a week, amounting to less than the \u00a395 a week we can get from statutory sick pay, and definitely not enough to live on. Though my manager reassured me there would be more hours, there weren\u2019t \u2013 and he refused to furlough me in case there were staff shortages later on.</p> <p>Work became increasingly stressful. Our team of carers had to make boxes of gloves last as long as possible. Face masks or visors were out of the question, and hand sanitiser quickly ran out. We continued as if it were business as usual. One client was discharged from hospital with pneumonia (she hadn\u2019t been tested for coronavirus as it was still early in the pandemic). I was instructed to carry on her calls as normal \u2013 taking her out to get shopping and fresh air \u2013 despite government advice about social distancing. Knowing I could put her life at risk if I had the virus, or contracted it from her and passed it to others, I refused.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/i-worked-care-home-sacked-speaking-out-ppe-coronavirus\">I worked in the care sector \u2013 and I was sacked after speaking out about lack of PPE | Nadia Whittome</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over time, the anxiety became unbearable. I wasn\u2019t sleeping, worried about infecting my family and terrified about the prospect of passing the virus to the people in my care. Eventually my GP signed me off work owing to stress. Now I receive \u00a395 statutory sick pay (my employer won\u2019t top this up).</p> <p>I\u2019m not at work, but many of my colleagues still are. It\u2019s heartbreaking that many of them face a choice between forgoing the wages they need to support their families or going to work, where they could infect the elderly and vulnerable because they don\u2019t have the equipment to protect themselves or others. Our local MP raised the issue of PPE with our manager, who informed my colleagues shortly afterwards that some masks would be available. But there was a catch: my colleagues were only given a few single-use masks and were told to reuse them unless they became soiled.</p> <p>During a pandemic, this business-as-usual approach is deadly. Vulnerable people continue to be put at risk when carers take them out in their cars. Clients pay more to be taken out of their houses, on top of receiving personal care at home, so these visits bring in more money for the company \u2013 but they\u2019re a huge infection risk and exactly the kind of thing that shouldn\u2019t be taking place right now.</p> <p>For many carers, \u00a395 in sick pay isn\u2019t enough to live on. Some weeks ago, one of my colleagues received a letter from the NHS informing her she belongs to the highest risk category due to underlying conditions, and that she should shield herself. Our employer said she could stop work, but she wouldn\u2019t be furloughed \u2013 and would only receive sick pay, rather than her wages.</p> <p>She\u2019s the sole breadwinner in her family. So rather than taking time off on \u00a395 a week, she continues to put her own life at risk by going to work. She\u2019s out of the house for 14 hours a day and of these, only six are spent delivering care \u2013 the rest of the time is spent travelling between clients. The costs of travel aren\u2019t reimbursed by employers, nor is the time spent travelling remunerated.</p> <p>Almost anyone can get a job as a care worker, but not many can last in the industry. The crisis has shone a light on how we\u2019re treated, and regarded by the rest of society: no PPE and no furlough, nobody seems to care. But even before this pandemic, it had become clear to me that carers are some of the most undervalued workers in our society.</p> <p>That\u2019s why I joined Unison and got involved in the <a href=\"http://www.unisonnw.org/care_workers_vs_covid_19\">care </a><a href=\"http://www.unisonnw.org/care_workers_vs_covid_19\">workers vs C</a><a href=\"http://www.unisonnw.org/care_workers_vs_covid_19\">ovid-19 campaign</a>. The social care system \u200bneeds changing from top to bottom. The staff and those they look after deserve so much more. When I mentioned the union to my company, my manager said I could expect to lose my job if I raised the matter again. But I\u2019ve decided to speak out. Together with other colleagues and carers, I\u2019m campaigning for more PPE, for sick pay that actually covers the costs of living \u2013 and for a pay rise for all care workers.</p> <p>In Liverpool, we\u2019ve had a breakthrough; the city\u2019s council <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/plans-6m-spent-coronavirus-hit-18131109\">has invested \u00a36m</a> to ensure care companies give full sick pay to those needing to self-isolate. Though this will make a huge difference to care workers across the city, it unfortunately doesn\u2019t extend to people like me and my colleague who received the NHS letter, who work for a private care company that isn\u2019t commissioned by the local council.</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/i-worked-care-home-sacked-speaking-out-ppe-coronavirus\">as Nadia Whittome</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/i-worked-care-home-sacked-speaking-out-ppe-coronavirus\"> has said</a>, many care workers face recrimination if they raise their concerns about the lack of safety protections at work. I\u2019d like other councils across the UK to pledge similar commitments to those of Liverpool city council, extending proper sick pay to care workers and ensuring they have adequate protection. That\u2019s the only way carers, who we clap for doing one of the most important jobs in society, will be able to stay safe.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m a care worker in Liverpool, where I go from house to house providing support to elderly and vulnerable people. Some of them have become like family to me. When the virus began to ripple across the UK, I became extremely worried about the risks I could pose to those in my care. I asked the manager of our company if our working practices would change to avoid spreading the virus. The answer was no; against my better instincts, I carried on work as usual. In the weeks that followed, many of the people we look after cancelled their care packages. With their own family members now furloughed, they didn\u2019t need us to look after them. Like many care workers in the UK, I\u2019m on a zero-hours contract. My hours plummeted to between four and eight a week, amounting to less than the \u00a395 a week we can get from statutory sick pay, and definitely not enough to live on. Though my manager reassured me there would be more hours, there weren\u2019t \u2013 and he refused to furlough me in case there were staff shortages later on. Work became increasingly stressful. Our team of carers had to make boxes of gloves last as long as possible. Face masks or visors were out of the question, and hand sanitiser quickly ran out. We continued as if it were business as usual. One client was discharged from hospital with pneumonia (she hadn\u2019t been tested for coronavirus as it was still early in the pandemic). I was instructed to carry on her calls as normal \u2013 taking her out to get shopping and fresh air \u2013 despite government advice about social distancing. Knowing I could put her life at risk if I had the virus, or contracted it from her and passed it to others, I refused. Over time, the anxiety became unbearable. I wasn\u2019t sleeping, worried about infecting my family and terrified about the prospect of passing the virus to the people in my care. Eventually my GP signed me off work owing to stress. Now I receive \u00a395 statutory sick pay (my employer won\u2019t top this up). I\u2019m not at work, but many of my colleagues still are. It\u2019s heartbreaking that many of them face a choice between forgoing the wages they need to support their families or going to work, where they could infect the elderly and vulnerable because they don\u2019t have the equipment to protect themselves or others. Our local MP raised the issue of PPE with our manager, who informed my colleagues shortly afterwards that some masks would be available. But there was a catch: my colleagues were only given a few single-use masks and were told to reuse them unless they became soiled. During a pandemic, this business-as-usual approach is deadly. Vulnerable people continue to be put at risk when carers take them out in their cars. Clients pay more to be taken out of their houses, on top of receiving personal care at home, so these visits bring in more money for the company \u2013 but they\u2019re a huge infection risk and exactly the kind of thing that shouldn\u2019t be taking place right now. For many carers, \u00a395 in sick pay isn\u2019t enough to live on. Some weeks ago, one of my colleagues received a letter from the NHS informing her she belongs to the highest risk category due to underlying conditions, and that she should shield herself. Our employer said she could stop work, but she wouldn\u2019t be furloughed \u2013 and would only receive sick pay, rather than her wages. She\u2019s the sole breadwinner in her family. So rather than taking time off on \u00a395 a week, she continues to put her own life at risk by going to work. She\u2019s out of the house for 14 hours a day and of these, only six are spent delivering care \u2013 the rest of the time is spent travelling between clients. The costs of travel aren\u2019t reimbursed by employers, nor is the time spent travelling remunerated. Almost anyone can get a job as a care worker, but not many can last in the industry. The crisis has shone a light on how we\u2019re treated, and regarded by the rest of society: no PPE and no furlough, nobody seems to care. But even before this pandemic, it had become clear to me that carers are some of the most undervalued workers in our society. That\u2019s why I joined Unison and got involved in the care workers vs Covid-19 campaign. The social care system needs changing from top to bottom. The staff and those they look after deserve so much more. When I mentioned the union to my company, my manager said I could expect to lose my job if I raised the matter again. But I\u2019ve decided to speak out. Together with other colleagues and carers, I\u2019m campaigning for more PPE, for sick pay that actually covers the costs of living \u2013 and for a pay rise for all care workers. In Liverpool, we\u2019ve had a breakthrough; the city\u2019s council has invested \u00a36m to ensure care companies give full sick pay to those needing to self-isolate. Though this will make a huge difference to care workers across the city, it unfortunately doesn\u2019t extend to people like me and my colleague who received the NHS letter, who work for a private care company that isn\u2019t commissioned by the local council. And as Nadia Whittome has said, many care workers face recrimination if they raise their concerns about the lack of safety protections at work. I\u2019d like other councils across the UK to pledge similar commitments to those of Liverpool city council, extending proper sick pay to care workers and ensuring they have adequate protection. That\u2019s the only way carers, who we clap for doing one of the most important jobs in society, will be able to stay safe.",

I know, I know, not terribly Upside, and not perhaps the uplifting romp we need during times of crisis. And perhaps a bit keen, though I said I\u2019d picked it up, not that I\u2019d finished it.</p> <p>But on this very peculiar day, when we mark the end of one titanic struggle 75 years ago while grappling with another, Stalingrad speaks to us through the ages. The forbearance, courage, sacrifice of the individual for the common. The acceptance that there was to be no way around this misery. You just had to go through it.</p> <p>If our grandparents and great-grandparents were able to endure six years of ruin, death, uncertainty, hunger, existential threat and genocide, then we can overcome coronavirus. It\u2019s a doddle by comparison. And who knows, we may already be over the worst, though my suspicion is that, in Europe at least, this is just the end of the beginning.</p> <p>My grandmother used to tell me that the war wasn\u2019t so bad. The community spirit was amazing, the sense of purpose palpable, the nation united, the friendships unshakeable, the hardships worth it.</p> <p>Remarkably, this is what we have seen and heard week in week out in the Upside since March.

When there is time, I promise I will collate these into something bigger, maybe a five-act play or a rock opera. It\u2019s been an extraordinary period of self-reflection, new wisdoms, self-actualisation \u2026</p> <p>Mel O\u2019Gorman wrote a paean to a daughter thousands of miles away. Here is an extract:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Dear Daughter,</p> <p>The upside of a situation like this one is that is forces us to focus fiercely on what matters. When we think we are near to extermination we jerk on our chains of complacency and become very clear on the things that truly matter. One of these for me are the unspoken conversations that we neglect to have or are embarrassed to have in the usual social mill when everyone is around and having fun together in the unending social whirl. Or our social habit of cool nods to the neighbours who are always strangers.</p> <p>This is now a quieter time, a blessed lull in the world that was speeding so fast with so many lost opportunities for real conversation. Now as we are all forced to look within we can see so clearly that the precious links between us all had become frayed and ragged.</p> <p>I hope that you are feeling this change in our mode of connecting. I hear it more clearly now every morning in the birdsong that heralds each new day with its melodies of pure joy. I also hear it in the news reports with more and more evidence about the kindness of people to each other. I see neighbours no longer taking each other for granted. Or involved in really helping each other for the first time. Reporting on this before was seen as dead news. Now it is at the centre of our locked down lives. We are learning again that how we celebrate ourselves and each other is the key to our happiness in this chaotic and rapidly changing world.</p> </blockquote> <p>Maria Andrea Melo Cruz got in touch from Spain</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My learning is that there is something magical about stopping, not having scheduled appointments, or having the obligation to meet friends. From this lockdown I get the pause, the silence and the ability to know what really matters. All we need is a little food, an important reason to live, to be loved and a someone to love. This coronavirus teaches us that we can really live with very little. The constant travelling, the full schedule, the compulsive shopping are all things that are totally expendable. In my case I now only eat twice a day, wake up at 5:30 to meditate, read newspapers from around the world every day and practice yoga. All this makes me feel really happy.</p> </blockquote> <p>Priya Ohri wrote in from Birmingham</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have learnt that this time could be spent creating a documented account of your life. The ups, the downs, what you\u2019ve learnt, what mistakes you\u2019ve made. I don\u2019t mean an exasperated comprehension of what the news is telling you, but what you, personally, want to tell the next generation in years to come.

      "bodyText": "Guardian colleagues have been up to all sorts during lockdown \u2013 when they\u2019ve not been working hard that is. At least three have acquired pets and many are digging up the garden or allotment. Potato printing, street chalk drawing, spring cleaning, DIY, it\u2019s all going on. One particularly ingenious staffer is knitting woollen hats for boiled eggs. Me, I\u2019ve picked up a book I\u2019ve always meant to read \u2013 Vasily Grossman\u2019s Stalingrad. I know, I know, not terribly Upside, and not perhaps the uplifting romp we need during times of crisis. And perhaps a bit keen, though I said I\u2019d picked it up, not that I\u2019d finished it. But on this very peculiar day, when we mark the end of one titanic struggle 75 years ago while grappling with another, Stalingrad speaks to us through the ages. The forbearance, courage, sacrifice of the individual for the common. The acceptance that there was to be no way around this misery. You just had to go through it. If our grandparents and great-grandparents were able to endure six years of ruin, death, uncertainty, hunger, existential threat and genocide, then we can overcome coronavirus. It\u2019s a doddle by comparison. And who knows, we may already be over the worst, though my suspicion is that, in Europe at least, this is just the end of the beginning. My grandmother used to tell me that the war wasn\u2019t so bad. The community spirit was amazing, the sense of purpose palpable, the nation united, the friendships unshakeable, the hardships worth it. Remarkably, this is what we have seen and heard week in week out in the Upside since March. This week: \u2022 How Covid 19 rescued the homeless \u2022 The babies born in lockdown \u2022 Lego, laughter and learning: how libraries are thriving \u2022 Why the coronavirus might create a more equal society \u2022The bunting boom \u2022 Will the pandemic replace capitalism with something better? \u2022 10 ways to help others \u2022 JK Rowling\u2019s generosity \u2022 Cities shape green renaissance for the post-virus world And in non-Covid news \u2022 The people who throw nothing away \u2022 Finland\u2019s universal basic income improved mental wellbeing \u2022 Not just weeds: the rebel botanists using graffiti to name forgotten flora \u2022 My favourite book as a kid (series) (Note: we have dispensed with the item that tells you how long these pieces take to read. Please let us know if you want that reinstated.) Lucky numbers Further indications here that this illness is more widespread than official figures suggest, meaning both that overall mortality rates will be lower than currently surmised \u2013 and that immunity will greater (though not great) within the population at large. What we liked This seems promising: a microbe that stops mosquitoes from being infected with malaria, and hence from transferring it on to people. Courtesy the BBC. Back on the virus, we liked this Washington Post piece \u2013 did Ohio get it right? And this NPR article on how school leavers might get the graduation they deserve. And finally, I read this Atlantic piece. Not the cheeriest of stories, but the bravery and the writing are both deeply impressive. What we heard Your lockdown learnings continue to pour in. When there is time, I promise I will collate these into something bigger, maybe a five-act play or a rock opera. It\u2019s been an extraordinary period of self-reflection, new wisdoms, self-actualisation \u2026 Mel O\u2019Gorman wrote a paean to a daughter thousands of miles away. Here is an extract: Dear Daughter, The upside of a situation like this one is that is forces us to focus fiercely on what matters. When we think we are near to extermination we jerk on our chains of complacency and become very clear on the things that truly matter. One of these for me are the unspoken conversations that we neglect to have or are embarrassed to have in the usual social mill when everyone is around and having fun together in the unending social whirl. Or our social habit of cool nods to the neighbours who are always strangers. This is now a quieter time, a blessed lull in the world that was speeding so fast with so many lost opportunities for real conversation. Now as we are all forced to look within we can see so clearly that the precious links between us all had become frayed and ragged. I hope that you are feeling this change in our mode of connecting. I hear it more clearly now every morning in the birdsong that heralds each new day with its melodies of pure joy. I also hear it in the news reports with more and more evidence about the kindness of people to each other. I see neighbours no longer taking each other for granted. Or involved in really helping each other for the first time. Reporting on this before was seen as dead news. Now it is at the centre of our locked down lives. We are learning again that how we celebrate ourselves and each other is the key to our happiness in this chaotic and rapidly changing world. Maria Andrea Melo Cruz got in touch from Spain My learning is that there is something magical about stopping, not having scheduled appointments, or having the obligation to meet friends. From this lockdown I get the pause, the silence and the ability to know what really matters. All we need is a little food, an important reason to live, to be loved and a someone to love. This coronavirus teaches us that we can really live with very little. The constant travelling, the full schedule, the compulsive shopping are all things that are totally expendable. In my case I now only eat twice a day, wake up at 5:30 to meditate, read newspapers from around the world every day and practice yoga. All this makes me feel really happy. Priya Ohri wrote in from Birmingham I have learnt that this time could be spent creating a documented account of your life. The ups, the downs, what you\u2019ve learnt, what mistakes you\u2019ve made. I don\u2019t mean an exasperated comprehension of what the news is telling you, but what you, personally, want to tell the next generation in years to come. What you want to recall from this stilted time. How we lived in our homes, what we saw in our community, what we cooked, how we fought. The list is endless. Whatever you choose to write, you will look back at your aide memoir and appreciate the freedom you once lost. While J Montagu, currently in Dorset, was more elliptical The sound of the cuckoo, A tadpole growing legs, Pricking and sprouting And I HATE HOME SCHOOLING. :-) Where was the Upside? At the first Upside Livestream event with Mo Gawdat, an hour-long conversation that managed to cover death, happiness, entropy and Forrest Gump. We\u2019ll have a video of the proceedings in next week\u2019s newsletter. Also with the charity Feed the Frontline, which has coordinated the donations of more than 20,000 food parcels to hospitals across the UK. Thanks for reading.

As long as they do so in a safe way, I don\u2019t see a problem.\u201d Roberts clarified he had not received firm proposals from the Premier League, whose clubs are awaiting the government\u2019s update on the lockdown, expected to be eased slightly on Sunday night, before clarifying their plans further at a meeting on Monday. Several clubs, including Brighton and Aston Villa, have publicly stated opposition to neutral venues, arguing that playing at home better preserves sporting integrity and can be as safe as neutral venues. The EFL has said it does want to play matches at home grounds. Roberts, speaking to ITV, said football people talking about sporting integrity needed to consider the casualties of Covid-19: \u201cIn the broader context, where the country has seen 30,000, and rising, deaths, some of the people making these comments need to get a grip because we\u2019ve all got a responsibility \u2013 yes to make progress for the benefit of the country, but equally to do it in a way that minimises the risk that anything we do adds to that death toll.\u201d",

AFL players, league confirms</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From AAP: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The AFL won\u2019t mandate its players to have a flu vaccination ahead of the season resumption and will leave the decision up to footballers and their respective club doctors.</p> \n   <p>NRL players are required to either have the flu vaccination or sign waiver forms as rugby league works towards a planned 28 May season restart.</p> \n   <p>But the AFL maintains flu shots will be at the discretion of players and club staff, not a league-wide policy.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWhile the AFL recommends players and officials to get a yearly flu shot, the decision is ultimately that of the player and club doctor as to whether they wish to do so,\u201d an AFL spokesperson said.</p> \n   <p>On Friday morning, Gold Coast Suns captain <strong>David Swallow</strong> questioned whether flu vaccinations should be compulsory in the AFL if players weren\u2019t comfortable with them.</p> \n   <p>The NRL had amended its original waiver form on Thursday after several players refused to sign it on religious or conscientious grounds.</p> \n   <p>On Friday, three Gold Coast Titans players, including <strong>Bryce Cartwrigh</strong>t, were stood down by the NRL for refusing to take the flu shot, on the advice of Queensland health officials.</p> \n   <p>The other two players were believed to be <strong>Nathan Peats</strong> and <strong>Brian Kelly</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Peats later said on Twitter he was not anti-vaccination and had avoided the flu jab due to an adverse experience while at South Sydney back in 2012 \u2013 but was now planning to have the shot on Friday afternoon.</p> \n   <p>Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> backed any decision by state governments to apply a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy to the NRL.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

possibility of domestic travel from next month. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAll the signs are pointing to green shoots of domestic travel from June,\u201d Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director <strong>Simon Westaway</strong> said, according to AAP. </p> \n  <p>Westaway said while there was a long way to go before tourism returned to normal, members had already expressed their excitement about the plan for the way out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s really important about today is that there has been a level of certainty put out there,\u201d he said</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe level of uncertainty has been a big part of the angst for our industry.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But he said the biggest challenge facing tourism operators was the ongoing closure of state borders.</p> \n  <p>He said if businesses in the sector could be given confidence about when they would reopen, that would help stimulate its recovery.</p> \n  <p>Despite the easing of restrictions in some states from next week, Westaway said he didn\u2019t expect every 4WD would be on the road straightaway.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think people are going to be a bit circumspect to a degree,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI think

\u201cfailing\u201d the government did not implement them before the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> \n  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> and <strong>Stephen Jones</strong> said in a statement: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>It is a failing of the Morrison Government that the Banking Royal Commission recommendations were not implemented in full before the COVID-19 crisis.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We join with consumer groups in holding the Government to account until they keep their promise with the Australian people and implement the recommendations.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Labor calls for the Royal Commission implementation delays to be limited to no more than 6 months.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The Government resisted the Banking Royal Commission for years, voted against it 26 times and have dragged their feet on implementation.</em></p> \n   <p><em>After receiving the Banking Royal Commission\u2019s final report, Prime Minister Morrison and Treasurer Frydenberg took six months to release an implementation timetable.</em></p> \n   <p><em>One year after the report was on their desks, the Government had only completed 6 out of the 76 recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Labor acknowledges the role that the banks are playing in the current crisis.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We support a strong banking system and the recent measures that have added needed liquidity and financial support during COVID-19.</em></p> \n   <p><em>But the Australian public also have an expectation that the Banking Royal Commission recommendations will be implemented.</em></p> \n   <p><em>With almost half the workforce on JobKeeper or JobSeeker, consumers need to be sure that they are protected from financial misconduct.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We agree with consumer groups who wrote to the Treasurer on 16 April 2020 expressing concerns.</em></p> \n   <p><em>While there is a reasonable case for a six-month extension to deadlines, the Australian community still expects to see action on the Banking Royal Commission.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Australians just want fair treatment from our financial institutions.</em></p> \n   <p><em>It is Josh Frydenberg\u2019s job to make sure that still happens.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll leave it there for tonight. Have a fantastic Friday night. See you soon. Let\u2019s whip around the main developments of the day. The PM announced the national cabinet\u2019s three-stage \u2018roadmap\u2019 to ease Covid-19 restrictions. Some states \u2013 Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania \u2013 then indicated their own initial changes to restrictions, which they will enact in the coming days. Victorians were told the government will outline an easing of restrictions on Monday, while New South Wales said only that it will be making no changes this week. The Reserve Bank of Australia forecast the unemployment rate will hit 10% in June, and won\u2019t climb down to 6.5% until June 2022. The worrying Cedar Meats cluster in Melbourne\u2019s west reached 71 cases. Three NRL players were stood down for not getting the flu shot. And, moments after Scott Morrison concluded his press conference today, the government delayed the implementation of recommendations from the banking royal commission. The Australian Hotels Association, essentially the nation\u2019s pubs lobby, has claimed the national cabinet\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d out of the Covid-19 pandemic will hurt its members. \u201cHotels have been left blindsided,\u201d the AHA chief executive, Stephen Ferguson, said on Friday, according to AAP. \u201cThey basically will not be able to reopen their businesses until stage three of the recovery process.\u201d Ferguson said the plan failed to account for venues with large floor space and most would be forced to remain closed. \u201cWe are told only 10 people can sit and have a meal in a pub restaurant area even if that area could safely socially distance 50 or 100,\u201d he said \u201cWhy can only 10 people be allowed in a dining area of a huge venue that could safely socially distance 120?\u201d People are cramming into supermarkets and work side-by-side on building sites, he said. \u201cWhere is the consistency?\u201d He warned that many operators were already struggling with mounting debts after being closed for more than a month and the recovery plan could force some to close their doors permanently. \u201cHotels have done the right thing, put the health of staff and patrons first the moment this pandemic hit \u2013 and we will continue to do so \u2013 but common sense needs to prevail here too,\u201d he said. This is not strictly a Covid-19 story, but a very interesting piece from Paul Karp on the so-called \u2018sports rorts\u2019 scandal. The Digital Transformation Agency has finally released the source code for the Android and iOS apps for Covidsafe. It\u2019s being hosted on Github and there\u2019s a lot of interesting T&amp;Cs there, including agreeing to stop accessing the code if DTA ask. It\u2019s unclear why it took so long to release the code, given the UK released the code for its NHS app overnight (which, incidentally, had fixed the iPhone bluetooth issue that has dogged the Singapore and Australian apps). We will get a better idea of how it all works once developers have had a chance to go through it in the coming days. There are now calls for the server side code (that is the code on the government\u2019s server for storing your registration data and data should you test positive) to be released. That will probably be less likely. Daniel Hurst and Paul Karp filed this report on Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference today, where he announced the \u201croadmap\u201d to ease Covid-19 restrictions in coming weeks. From AAP: The AFL won\u2019t mandate its players to have a flu vaccination ahead of the season resumption and will leave the decision up to footballers and their respective club doctors. NRL players are required to either have the flu vaccination or sign waiver forms as rugby league works towards a planned 28 May season restart. But the AFL maintains flu shots will be at the discretion of players and club staff, not a league-wide policy. \u201cWhile the AFL recommends players and officials to get a yearly flu shot, the decision is ultimately that of the player and club doctor as to whether they wish to do so,\u201d an AFL spokesperson said. On Friday morning, Gold Coast Suns captain David Swallow questioned whether flu vaccinations should be compulsory in the AFL if players weren\u2019t comfortable with them. The NRL had amended its original waiver form on Thursday after several players refused to sign it on religious or conscientious grounds. On Friday, three Gold Coast Titans players, including Bryce Cartwright, were stood down by the NRL for refusing to take the flu shot, on the advice of Queensland health officials. The other two players were believed to be Nathan Peats and Brian Kelly. Peats later said on Twitter he was not anti-vaccination and had avoided the flu jab due to an adverse experience while at South Sydney back in 2012 \u2013 but was now planning to have the shot on Friday afternoon. Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison backed any decision by state governments to apply a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy to the NRL. Australia\u2019s tourism industry has cautiously welcomed the national cabinet\u2019s roadmap for easing coronavirus restrictions, pointing to the possibility of domestic travel from next month. \u201cAll the signs are pointing to green shoots of domestic travel from June,\u201d Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director Simon Westaway said, according to AAP. Westaway said while there was a long way to go before tourism returned to normal, members had already expressed their excitement about the plan for the way out. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important about today is that there has been a level of certainty put out there,\u201d he said \u201cThe level of uncertainty has been a big part of the angst for our industry.\u201d But he said the biggest challenge facing tourism operators was the ongoing closure of state borders. He said if businesses in the sector could be given confidence about when they would reopen, that would help stimulate its recovery. Despite the easing of restrictions in some states from next week, Westaway said he didn\u2019t expect every 4WD would be on the road straightaway. \u201cI think people are going to be a bit circumspect to a degree,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see it progressively start to occur.\u201d My colleague Justine Landis-Hanley has compiled this explainer looking at the national cabinet\u2019s three-step plan for reopening Australia announced by Scott Morrison today. Labor has criticised the six-month delay of the banking royal commission recommendations, saying it is a \u201cfailing\u201d the government did not implement them before the Covid-19 pandemic. Anthony Albanese, Jim Chalmers and Stephen Jones said in a statement: It is a failing of the Morrison Government that the Banking Royal Commission recommendations were not implemented in full before the COVID-19 crisis. We join with consumer groups in holding the Government to account until they keep their promise with the Australian people and implement the recommendations. Labor calls for the Royal Commission implementation delays to be limited to no more than 6 months. The Government resisted the Banking Royal Commission for years, voted against it 26 times and have dragged their feet on implementation. After receiving the Banking Royal Commission\u2019s final report, Prime Minister Morrison and Treasurer Frydenberg took six months to release an implementation timetable. One year after the report was on their desks, the Government had only completed 6 out of the 76 recommendations made by Commissioner Hayne. Labor acknowledges the role that the banks are playing in the current crisis. We support a strong banking system and the recent measures that have added needed liquidity and financial support during COVID-19. But the Australian public also have an expectation that the Banking Royal Commission recommendations will be implemented. With almost half the workforce on JobKeeper or JobSeeker, consumers need to be sure that they are protected from financial misconduct. We agree with consumer groups who wrote to the Treasurer on 16 April 2020 expressing concerns. While there is a reasonable case for a six-month extension to deadlines, the Australian community still expects to see action on the Banking Royal Commission. Australians just want fair treatment from our financial institutions. It is Josh Frydenberg\u2019s job to make sure that still happens. The Nationals deputy leader, David Littleproud, said earlier today the Coalition deserves an \u201cuppercut\u201d for self-indulgent infighting ahead of the Eden-Monaro byelection. \u201cSelf-indulgence on any level is not accepted by the Australian people nor should it be. We deserve an uppercut,\u201d he told ABC television on Friday. \u201cYou have a look at yourself, you dust yourself off and get back to basics. We can\u2019t sugarcoat it, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d Littleproud\u2019s comments follow a feud between NSW Liberal transport minister Andrew Constance and Nationals NSW deputy leader John Barilaro. Both were touted for the byelection but failed to run, with Constance pulling out of the race 24 hours after throwing his hat in the ring. Constance quit the race after News Corp published text messages in which Barilaro purportedly called him a \u201ccunt\u201d. A few observers have noted we haven\u2019t heard from the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian after today\u2019s national cabinet meeting. The premier has just issued a statement, which confirms no changes to restrictions this week. She says: NSW welcomes the framework for the further easing of restrictions endorsed today by the National Cabinet. This framework provides a clear pathway to what citizens can look forward to in coming months. The NSW Government has already eased a number of restrictions listed under the first stage of the plan. As I stated earlier this week \u2013 there will be no further change to restrictions in NSW this week. NSW will continue to keep our citizens updated on our path forward. The Business Council is pleased with the roadmap laid out by the prime minister Scott Morrison today. \u201cThe national cabinet has laid out a clear roadmap to give the community and business confidence while also respecting the important advice from our health professionals,\u201d said chief executive Jennifer Westacott. \u201cBusiness will continue to work closely with governments on plans and protocols to ensure the economy opens up safely so that the health of our staff, customers and suppliers is protected. \u201cPeople can have confidence that businesses across Australia are putting in place detailed plans across their industries, so they can operate safely, but get people back to their work and their lives as quickly as possible. \u201cWe thank the entire Australian community for pulling together so effectively to get us to this milestone and congratulate the national cabinet on its continued willingness to respond and adapt to this evolving situation. \u201cAustralians have pulled together to contain Covid-19 and we\u2019ll need the same focus, cooperation and determination to set ourselves up for a strong recovery as we ease restrictions.\u201d Our Watch, which campaigns to prevent violence against women, says it is concerned about the number of women killed by a partner or ex-partner in the past week. Our Watch chief executive Patty Kinnersly said: \u201cSince March, Google searches on domestic violence have increased by 75% and the family court has reported an increase up to 40% in urgent applications.\u201d \u201cThese recent tragic murders are one horrifying part of a huge spectrum of violence against women in our society. \u201cWe know that while this violence takes many forms, the underlying driver is gender inequality. \u201cWe also know that crises tend to disproportionately affect women, often lead to increases in violence against them, and exacerbate existing gender inequalities across society.\u201d \u201cIf we are not considered, our response to Covid-19 could unintentionally reverse decades of progress towards gender equality. \u201cNow more than ever, governments, workplaces, and communities must remain committed to this goal.\u201d 1800 Respect \u2013 call 1800 737 732 or visit www.1800respect.org.au Lifeline \u2013 call 13 11 14 or visit www.lifeline.org.au AAP reports that the NT is keeping to its own plans for easing restrictions. The Northern Territory will stick with its existing plans for the lifting of restrictions imposed to combat the coronavirus pandemic in the wake new national measures released on Friday. Chief minister Michael Gunner indicated the territory would push ahead with its three-stage approach that will remove most restrictions on business and community activities by early June. The NT\u2019s changes began last weekend with parks reopening and outdoor weddings and funerals allowed along with real estate inspections and auctions. Stage two from May 15 allows for the reopening of restaurants, cafes, and bars as long as people purchase food. Non-contact sports can also start, and indoor activities will be allowed for those of less than two hours. That includes beauty salons, gyms, libraries and places of religious worship. The third and final stage from 5 June will remove the two-hour limit on indoor activities, and allow the reopening of bars and clubs without food being compulsory. Entertainment venues and cinemas will also reopen and team sports such as football and netball will be allowed. Businesses are required to complete a safety plan to ensure physical distancing and good hygiene. The internal border controls restricting access to areas that include indigenous communities will remain in place until 18 June and possibly longer. Further describing stage two, Gutwein says it would allow people to move around the state, including camping, overnight boats and holiday shacks. Gyms and bootcamps would be open to 20 people, while beauty services including tattoo parlours would also be allowed. Indoor sport would also be allowed. Note: This is Gutwein describing the possibility rules from after 15 June, if the advice allows it. Gutwein is laying out the state\u2019s roadmap. He says from 25 May, primary school students will return to school, as well as year 11 and 12 students. From 9 June, high school students from year 7 to 10 will also return to school. From 15 June, the state will move to stage 2, subject to health advice. \u201cOn June 15, gatherings will increase to 20 people at a time, both indoor and outdoor areas including restaurants, cafes, cinemas, museums, galleries, historic sites, religious gatherings and weddings,\u201d he says. From that point, it is expected up to 50 people would be allowed to attend a funeral. Gutwein says Tasmania will move to Stage 1 on 18 May, subject to public health advice. That would mean: Indoor and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people. Up to five visitors to a home. Restaurants, cafes and other venues can open for up to 10 people at a time. Border controls will remain in place. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein just addressed the media. He says from Monday, the government will ease some restrictions. That includes: 20 people will be able to attend funerals, up from 10 Aged care visits will move to one visit per week National parks to open for exercise, but only for people who live within 30km We\u2019re getting some reaction to the government\u2019s decision to delay the recommendations of the banking royal commission. \u201cThese reforms are crucial to help protect consumers from financial service industry practices that were shown to have caused severe and long-lasting harm to people across Australia,\u201d said the Consumer Action Law Centre chief executive Gerard Brody. \u201cWe appreciate that the fallout from Covid-19 has forced the government to drastically change its priorities and focus in the short-term. We consider a six-month deferral of these much-needed reforms a sensible compromise.\u201d \u201cAny further delay creates a greater risk that progress towards these reforms will be lost and consumers \u2013 particularly those most vulnerable \u2013 will continue to suffer.\u201d Thanks to Ben for his efforts today. I\u2019ll guide you through to the start of the weekend. Hope you can stick with us. Thanks for your company for the last couple of hours. It\u2019s now over to Luke Henriques-Gomes to take you onward. Go well. From AAP: Three Gold Coast Titans players, including Bryce Cartwright, have been stood down by the NRL for refusing to take the flu shot. Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young made the announcement on Friday after discussions with the NRL over its controversial flu vaccination policy. \u201cI\u2019ve had a discussion with [the NRL] this morning and they\u2019ve stood down those three players at the moment, until we work through what it means,\u201d Young said. There are now eight more coronavirus cases linked to the Cedar Meats processing facility \u2013 a total of 71 in the cluster. The Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, says: The department is working closely with the company, which agreed to close their facility for 14 days as a precaution to ensure all required steps are taken \u2013 including thorough contact tracing, identifying all close contacts, widespread testing and precautionary cleaning. All staff have been tested or are in the process of being tested. All staff are being provided with further information about potential exposure to coronavirus in the workplace, symptoms and quarantine requirements. The former prime minister Kevin Rudd has written for the Guardian, comparing thinly-sourced claims linking the origins of the coronavirus to a Chinese lab to the \u201cevidence\u201d that led us blindly into the Iraq war; the supposed (but non-existent) weapons of mass destruction. Rudd writes: China has much to answer for, including the ultimate origins of the virus. But if Trump\u2019s claim in the Wuhan laboratory saga ultimately ends up being disproven, either by the Five Eyes or by US intelligence itself, then the irony is that the net political winner will be China. Remember the humiliation when no WMD were found in Iraq? Beijing would seek to exonerate itself as a result of egregious presidential overreach \u2013 once again aided and abetted by the Murdoch media. This is why the watchword of any sophisticated intelligence agency is caution in endorsing premature conclusions until all the facts are on the table. Oh and while we\u2019re on the topic, don\u2019t call the footy anti-vaxxers \u201cconscientious objectors\u201d. That kind of assumes there is a level of consciousness about ignoring medical science. The consumer advocacy group Choice has backed the government\u2019s deferral of the recommendations of the banking royal commission. Choice CEO Alan Kirkland: Choice welcomes the government\u2019s continued commitment to implementing the Banking Royal Commission recommendations. A six-month deferral strikes a sensible balance between recognising the reality of these unprecedented circumstances and the need to legislate reforms to protect consumers, who will need this even more in the coming months. We look forward to working with the government to finalise the remaining reforms as soon as possible. Don\u2019t kiss the football. Restrictions also set for a staged easing in South Australia, the premier Steven Marshall says. The state\u2019s plan goes a bit further than those we\u2019ve heard from so far. It allows dining in outdoor dining at restaurants and cafes, for groups of up to 10 people, from Monday. We will be the only jurisdiction in the country which will be easing the ban on caravanning and camping. And we are wanting people to get out and explore our beautiful backyard here in South Australia, spend some money in regional South Australia, and of course help those economies move forward and create jobs. The acting CEO of the NSW Port Authority told her staff not to send an employee onto the Ruby Princess due to coronavirus concerns, an inquiry has heard. Emma Fensom told the special inquiry today that on 18 March, the night before the Ruby Princess docked in Sydney Harbour, she told the harbourmaster to \u201cdeny pilotage\u201d for the ship \u2013 meaning they would not send an employee on board to help it dock. She said that earlier in the night, the duty harbourmaster, Cameron Butchard told her that Royal Prince Alfred hospital had set aside \u201ctwo Covid beds\u201d for sick passengers. The inquiry heard previously that the port agent for Carnival Australia, who operate the ship, called NSW Ambulance to book paramedics. Fensom told the inquiry that after Butchard told her about the ambulances, she told him to \u201cdeny pilotage\u201d until they had more information. She also told the inquiry that Paul Mifsud, a manager of Carnival Australia, told her that \u201cNSW Health had not said the ambulances were for Covd-19\u201d. Mifsud also told her \u201cnor has NSW Health said there is Covid-19 on board\u201d, she said. Fensom said she did not try and contact anyone from NSW Health herself. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, asked her whether everything that Mifsud told her was \u201chearsay\u201d, in that they were things he was told by someone else. She agreed with his proposition that \u201cAll he as doing was passing on what somebody had told him.\u201d Fensom was also asked by counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, whether she was \u201cconcerned that there wasn\u2019t someone from NSW health for contact\u201d that night. She said she was concerned. Chief minister, Andrew Barr has announced the Australian Capital Territory will be easing restrictions from midnight, allowing gatherings of up to 10 people in indoor and outdoor settings. Barr advised Canberrans to avoid large crowds, keep 1.5m apart from others, continue to practice good hand hygiene and to \u201cstay home\u201d from work or school if you are sick. Some news on the ACT loosening its restrictions: Queensland\u2019s reopening plan is quite comprehensive. Stage 1 from 15 May Stage 2 from 12 June Stage 3 from 10 July The final phase appears to allow for the potential resumption of interstate travel \u2013 ie opening the closed border at the Tweed. The federal government has just announced it is delaying the implementation of the findings of the banking royal commission for six months. We\u2019ll have more detail on that soon, but a statement from the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says it will allow the financial services industry to focus their efforts on planning for the economic recovery. There is a \u201cclear Queensland plan\u201d to return to normality, the premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says. Starting Saturday week, the following will be allowed. Gatherings in homes with a maximum of five people. Gathering of 10 people in other places. Opening beauty salons (\u201cgood news for the ladies\u201d, says the premier. Weddings can have 10 guests. Funerals can have 20 guests indoors, 30 outdoors. Open homes will be allowed. Lagoons open for swimmers. Dining in pubs and cafes in outback areas (where there are no cases) limited to 20 people. The next stages will increase travel distances allowed and open more businesses in time for the June school holidays. And here\u2019s the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. She says there\u2019s no new cases overnight. We are dealing with the health crisis and economic crisis but I know that Queenslanders want certainty and they want a clear path forward in terms of what they can do and when that life can start returning back to some form of normality and of course this is going to be gradual, it will take time and we cannot rush these and do everything all at once. I want to reassure you that I am listening to my chief health officer and taking the very best health advice and we are also working constructively at the national cabinet. Hello all, and thanks to Michael McGowan for his contribution as we veer into another afternoon of constant updates and occasional sad reminders that it\u2019s Friday afternoon, but we won\u2019t be at the pub later. Expecting Queensland\u2019s premier, health minister and the chief health office up in a few minutes. The big question they should expect is about the NRL\u2019s return and whether the code\u2019s cluster of anti-vaxxers will be allowed to play in the state if they refuse a flu shot. Strap yourself in and here we go. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you this afternoon. We expect to hear from the Queensland and South Australian premiers soon, but I\u2019ll leave you in the very capable hands of my colleague Ben Smee. Thanks as always for reading. The Reserve Bank may think Australia\u2019s economy will come roaring back next year but there\u2019s some private sector data about pointing to the longer-term ripple effect of the coronavirus crisis. Rental website rent.com.au says about 60% of renters have either stopped working or had their hours cut due to the crisis, and 35% have asked for a rent reduction or deferral. Some 22% of those surveyed said their ability to pay the rent had been severely affected Making things worse, two-thirds of renters said they didn\u2019t feel comfortable seeking support from the real estate agent handling the property. Prime minister Scott Morrison has said there\u2019s a six-month ban on evictions, but in fact the issue is a state matter and the actual situation varies widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. If rents are merely deferred, rather than reduced, that just puts the rental crisis off, because once the holiday ends renters will suddenly be confronted with a balloon of rental payments they\u2019ve got no way to make. On the other hand, landlords are screaming blue murder about the prospect of a reduction in rental income. Yesterday, the Real Estate Institute of NSW, which has been leading the landlord charge, again complained about what it sees as a lack of support for landlords. In an open letter to NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, it complained that tenants had heard that they couldn\u2019t be evicted and gone on rent strike. It also complained that the Tenants Union had been given $250,000 to help tenants but \u201cno similar funding has been provided to support landlords\u201d. State governments have given landlords hit by Covid-19 tax breaks, but landlords say this won\u2019t fill the gap. In its letter, the REINSW isn\u2019t clear about what additional measures it actually wants. At this stage, with restrictions on the cusp of being eased, it\u2019s difficult to see any politician approving a cash handout for people who by definition have hard, saleable assets other than the family home - especially as state finances have been ravaged by the crisis and their ability to raise money is much more limited than the commonwealth\u2019s. On the other hand, the real estate lobby has traditionally been extremely powerful in Australia. Still on schools, if it isn\u2019t obvious yet, Andrews says: \u201cI\u2019ll have more to say about schools next week\u201d. The nature of that, I can\u2019t pre-empt, because there\u2019s still further work that has to be done ... we\u2019ve always said plan for the whole term, whole of term two being at home, unless you can\u2019t be. But if we could bring it forward, we would. But I\u2019m not announcing that today. We\u2019ll have some further things to say about schools next week. We\u2019ve always been keen to give parents as much notice as possible. We did that when we brought the school holidays forward. And, of course, we\u2019ll do that if and when those policy settings change. On schools, where Victoria has held a harder line to keeping children at home to other states, Andrews says the door \u201chas always been open\u201d to children returning to classrooms. We\u2019ve always said people should plan for term two, if you can learn from home, you must learn from home. But if that was to change, and could be done, could be changed safely, then we would give people as much notice as possible. So, that hasn\u2019t changed. Andrews likens the elements of step one in the rollback of restrictions to a menu. And we will choose elements of that and the respective timing for the rollout of each of those elements that best suit Victoria, that best suit the unique circumstances that we face. He says that when he makes announcements on Monday, \u201cit will take some time for different sectors, for different parts of the Victorian economy and Victorian community to be able to be ready for that change\u201d. Andrews says there will be an easing of some rules, but wont go into specifics until next week. So, I just urge Victorians \u2013 I know it\u2019s frustrating, I know we\u2019re getting very close to making an important step, to potentially, well, in fact, to easing a range of these rules. But now is not the time to become so impatient and so frustrated that we start doing the wrong thing and jeopardising the progress we\u2019ve all made together. Andrews says that nothing will change in Victoria today, or over the weekend. On Monday, and indeed throughout next week, I will have a series of announcements to make about changes to the rules. Those rules \u2013 that will not be all the rules going, and it won\u2019t necessarily be that the moment I announce something a change happens right then. There may be time required to move from announcing a change to the effect of that. The key point here is that, even at the end of next week, even at the end of May, there will still be rules in place. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking now. Here are those slides on steps one, two and three: And that\u2019s all from the prime minister and chief health officer. They\u2019ve just outlined a three-step roadmap for a reopening of the economy by July. We\u2019ll now wait to hear from the premiers about when exactly stage one will begin to be implemented. He\u2019s asked about US secretary of state Mike Pompeo seemingly walking back his comments about there being \u201cenormous evidence\u201d for the theory that the Covid-19 outbreak occurred in a Wuhan lab. He\u2019s since conceded it could be wrong. Morrison says: I think what is important is we find out, and the world doesn\u2019t yet know \u2013 I raised this at the meeting with international colleagues last night ... It\u2019s not directed at anyone, we just want to know what happened so it doesn\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s a pretty honest question, with an honest intent and an honest motive. Morrison is asked about the alleged super fraud: I mean, fraud is possible in any program, anywhere. Over my government experience, I have been in immigration, I have been in social services and I have been in Treasury, and I can tell you fraudsters try and have a crack at every single one of those systems every single day. So, the fact that people have tried to have a crack at this doesn\u2019t surprise me. The home affairs minister has already made comments on this. It\u2019s a serious fraud issue and that\u2019s why the precaution was taken to pause that for at least 24 hours while that\u2019s being addressed. The fact that there has been such a swift response, I think, demonstrates that there are protections in place and action is taken. And they should find them and they should lock them up. Brendan Murphy declines to swing at a question about whether NRL players should be forced to have flu shots: I think that\u2019s really a matter for the relevant state health authorities. I think, you know, I personally have a view that everyone should get a flu shot, and it\u2019s important. But I think that\u2019s a matter for the relevant states. There is no threshold for winding back the easing of restrictions though. It\u2019s \u201ccase specific\u201d, Morrison says. Morrison\u2019s general stance here seems to be that, if and when outbreaks occur, the general policy would not be to turn-around on easing restrictions: I mean, as I said the other day, it\u2019s like the emu and the kangaroo, they go forward, not backwards. And that\u2019s how this has to work. Premiers and chief ministers are very keen to ensure that you continue to move forward. But, he says, the government will \u201cact on the health advice\u201d in the event of a larger outbreak or significant rises in case numbers. And all of these steps, the key requirement as you move from one to the next is it\u2019s subject to the health advice. We\u2019ve always acted on the basis of the expert advice. And if the expert health advice that, God forbid, we\u2019re in a situation like you outline, then we would have to take the health advice in those circumstances. Morrison says he wants to see students back in classrooms as part of step one: I think it is important we all hold our nerve. That\u2019s why I was saying before these are cautious first steps but important first steps. You know, you can stay under the doona forever and you\u2019ll, you know, you\u2019ll never face any danger. But we\u2019ve gotta get out from under the doona at some time. And if not now, well, then when? Morrison is asked about broader international travel and says he \u201ccan\u2019t see that happening any time soon\u201d. There\u2019s nothing on our radar which would see us opening up international travel in the foreseeable future. There are already some very, very minor exceptions, where the Border Force can provide an exemption for outbound travel, but that\u2019s in areas like facilitating development aid in third [world] countries and things like that. It\u2019s a very limited set of circumstances. I\u2019ve already mentioned ... we could potentially consider how things for international students might work. But these are exceptions, not the rule. It is something that other countries are discussing, but, by and large, almost without exception I\u2019m not aware of any countries that are looking at that option at this point. Pubs reopening are part of step three, by the way (unless you\u2019re in the Northern Territory). Brendan Murphy is giving some clarification around the loosening on restrictions national cabinet has agreed to in \u201cstep one\u201d, but stresses not all of the states agree on all of the measures. He says step one means five people visiting a household, or 10 people in an outdoor gathering. So, 10 people training in a football field, it\u2019s 10 people getting together in a park. Again, hopefully with distancing. So, we got together and we looked at what was like a consensus position. Not every state agrees with every step, but we look at the relative risk of each thing. So, there\u2019s an absolute risk about gathering size. So, that\u2019s a protection, so that if things do break out, if we\u2019ve only got gatherings of 10, that means much less potential for transmission. So, some states, though, don\u2019t want to open cafes and restaurants initially, because they feel that their situation, they would prefer to take some time. On borders, Morrison says interstate closures have never been a recommendation out of national cabinet and that premiers have taken those decisions \u201cunilaterally\u201d so it will be up to states to remove them. But the road freight and the land-based freight transport, you know, goods are getting through, goods are moving around the country. And I understand there\u2019s a whole bunch of kegs on their way to Darwin as we speak, running up the high way. Much eagerly anticipated, I\u2019m sure. On international borders, Morrison says the government is speaking to New Zealand and is open to considering opening borders for international students in the future. Issues of international students, you\u2019ll note that it does come into the third step of the plan. And that is a possibility. And how you would work that through, well, they\u2019d have to be carefully tested. So, we are open to that, and we would be working with institutions to see how that could be achieved. But it has to be done according to those strict quarantine restrictions and how that\u2019s done, and how those costs are met. So, there\u2019s a lot of steps to work through. But, I mean, we\u2019re open to everything pretty much to get the Australian economy back and firing again as much as possible. We\u2019ve just gotta step through it carefully. Morrison: Outbreaks are not a reason to slow things down. Outbreaks are going to happen. All premiers and chief ministers understand that. And so it\u2019s how you respond to them. In this case, I mean, not all information is perfect. When you go into them. How long they have been going on, [is] not always clear. That\u2019s why I think some of these automated tools are very helpful to the premiers and health ministers in those jurisdictions. Each one of these is going to be tough. It\u2019s not a reason to slow things down. On the Victorian meatworks outbreak, Morrison says \u201cthey [outbreaks] are going to occur\u201d but that that Covid-safe app \u201cwould have sped things up\u201d in terms of contact tracing. He says the code behind the app will be released later today. At the top of the press conference Morrison said treasury modelling says these steps will see 850,000 jobs restored in the months ahead. He says that number includes those who may be on jobseeker or jobkeeper now. People stood down, going back to full employment. And those, that work is being done based on the steps you can see here today. So it\u2019s very much a function of how and when all of those steps are completed. And by July? That\u2019s the aspiration. But as we learned during the course of this Covid crisis, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainties. That\u2019s what we understand to be the value of doing this. Morrison is taking questions now. On the timing of step one, he says the premiers and chief ministers will announce their own timetables. They\u2019ll be announcing their own timetables for when they\u2019re making those statements. I think you can expect to see some of them later today, making some initial comments and I\u2019d expect to see them making further comments in the days ahead, over the weekend, and early next week. That\u2019s when you can expect them to outline those timetables. There\u2019s some states like Western Australia where step one has ticked the box. They\u2019re very much well advanced on that. South Australia, Northern Territory, quite similarly. But those on the east coast, a very different situation. They all got different starting points. The whole country has the same end point, to get to a Covid-safe economy He says step three will be \u201ca much more broader opening\u201d but that there is more discussion about what that will look like. \u201cBut step one, well defined, step two, a bit more work to be done, and step three, still a lot of discussion to be had before we can well define it properly.\u201d Murphy says step two \u201cwe\u2019re looking at larger gatherings of around 20, potentially in some states, they may look at some venues to go more than that. It includes opening things such as gyms, indoor fitness, beauty therapy, cinemas, and galleries. He says some interstate travel \u201cmay recur in that stage\u201d. The chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, is now outlining the steps in more detail. He has slides. Murphy says step one is \u201ccautious\u201d and \u201cgentle\u201d. Because we\u2019re in uncharted territory. There\u2019s not many countries in the world like Australia that\u2019s in a position to start gently relaxing measures with such low case numbers. We don\u2019t want to lose the control we\u2019ve got. We want to make sure that outbreaks that occur are managed and controlled. He\u2019s stressing that measures such as physical distancing, strict personal hygiene and making sure people stay home when unwell will remain in place. So in step one, it\u2019s essentially getting people in groups of 10 together, outdoors, particularly, staying working at home if it\u2019s going all right for you and your employer. Allowing 10 people in a one person a four sq metre distance in small cafes and restaurants. That means many won\u2019t be able to open, but many doing takeaway may want to put up enough distance tables to start gently serving 10 people at a time. Some libraries and community centres, again, with only small numbers of people. Morrison says national cabinet has agreed that it hopes to have moved through these three steps by July, but the pace will be up to the states and territories. He says people shouldn\u2019t expect step one to start \u201con day one\u201d. They\u2019ll be responsible for setting their own timetable and communicating that to their citizens and residents in their own states and territories. Premiers and chief ministers have asked me to stress there should be no expectation of step one starting on day one. Unless they are indeed already there. Moving on these steps will take some preparation. Movement from step to step, he says, will depend on \u201cmedical evidence [that] suggests that further easing will not present an undue risk, [that] widespread testing is identifying community transmission, and thirdly, public health actions are able to trace cases and trap local outbreaks\u201d. Step three, Morrison says, will see gatherings of up to 100 people. But its timing, he says, will depend on the success of the previous steps. \u201cBut most workers, by then, will be back in the workplace. Interstate travel will likely resume. Pubs and clubs with some restrictions will be open. And also possibly gaming venues. As I said, step three, step three, but also step two, will get greater definition as we move through the success of step one.\u201d Step two, Morrison says, \u201cwill allow larger size gatherings up to 20 people, including for venues such as cinemas and galleries, more retail openings on sector based Covid-safe plans, organised community sport, and beauty parlours, and you\u2019ll be pleased to know, barre classes open once again\u201d. Morrison is describing those three steps now. Step one will \u201cenable greater connection with friends and family\u201d. Things that will be allowed include: Gatherings up to 10 people, and five guests in your own home. Children back in classrooms and in playgrounds in their communities. Recreational activities such as golf, lap swimming and boot camps. Retail and small cafes and restaurants reopening. Interstate recreational travel starting again. An easing of restrictions for funerals with up to 30 attendees, outdoors, and 10 at weddings. Morrison: In this plan, we walk before we run. We know we need to be careful to preserve our gains, if we wish to reclaim the ground we lost, we cannot be too timid. There will be risks. There will be challenges. There will be outbreaks, there will be more cases, there will be set-backs. Not everything will go to plan. He says there will be \u201cinconsistencies\u201d and that states \u201cwill and must move at their own pace, and will cut and paste out of this plan to suit their local circumstances\u201d. Morrison announces that today national cabinet has agreed to a three-step plan \u201cand a national framework to achieve a Covid-safe economy and society\u201d. He says the goal is to move through all of these steps to achieve a \u201cCovid-safe economy in July of this year\u201d. Morrison says today is about moving ahead \u201cwith reopening our economy and our society\u201d. Today our focus is on the road back. With a clear plan, and a clear framework, that shows Australians the road ahead. The next step beyond this will be to build the confidence and momentum that will see our economy get back up and running and get Australians back up on their feet and moving ahead with confidence. And then we can reset our economy for growth in the years ahead. He begins by saying that \u201calways being thankful\u201d is a lesson our mothers teach us. We\u2019ve been doing a lot of that lately, I\u2019m sure. So many Australians are hurting right now. Lives turned upside down, painful separation from their loved ones. Livelihoods that they have spent a lifetime building, stripped away. Uncertainty about their futures and their family\u2019s future. The last few months have given us a reminder of the things that are really important, our health, our wellbeing, a strong health system. And all those who keep it strong. A growing economy. Our jobs and our incomes that rely on it. We cannot take this for granted. Every job matters. Whatever job you do. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking now. Albanese says the RBA\u2019s May statement \u201cputs to bed\u201d the prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s talk of a \u201csnapback\u201d in the economy and that \u201cwe\u2019ll wakeup one morning and the economy and everything will be back to the way it was. What the Reserve Bank estimates is that unemployment will hit 10%. That real household disposable income will fall by 8% in June, but it will also fall by 8% in December. What we\u2019re looking at here is long term impact on living standards of Australians as a result of the coronavirus crisis. And the government needs to acknowledge the idea of snapback is simply not going to work. They\u2019ll need to put in place measures that keep people in employment, that promote employment, and that promote economic activity if we\u2019re not going to have a prolonged down turn. Before that though, the opposition leader Anthony Albanese is speaking in Canberra. He\u2019s blasting the government over the alleged fraud of early access to superannuation, which may have deprived up to 150 Australians of $120,000 of retirement savings. When the government unwisely chose to allow early access to superannuation withdrawal, which will of course damage people\u2019s entitlements when it comes to their retirement, which will reduce the liquidity of superannuation funds, and distort the market investments that are made in the future by superannuation, Labor warned about the potential for fraud. Not only Labor, but the superannuation industry wrote to the minister on 1 May, on the very day that this fraud was uncovered, the minister wrote back and said nothing to see here. It\u2019s very clear that this suspension is not only necessary, it could have been foreseen and indeed, was foreseen by the superannuation industry and by Labor when we raised these issues in the national Parliament. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is due to address the media following National Cabinet at 12.30pm. The Reserve Bank of Australia has released its May statement on monetary policy, with some interesting forecasts that the economy is set to shrink by 8% this quarter but roar back in 2021. Under what looks like a V-shaped recovery, the RBA\u2019s baseline scenario is for the economy to shrink by 8% in the June quarter, 6% in the December quarter, but to recover to 7% growth in June 2021 and 6% in December 2021 - thanks to a massive recovery in household consumption. The baseline scenario is based on \u201cthe relaxation of domestic activity restrictions over coming months, with most of these restrictions lifted by the end of the September quarter\u201d except for large public gatherings and international travel. \u201cMuch of the decline is expected to be concentrated in services, such as travel and entertainment, most affected by activity restrictions,\u201d it said. The RBA predicts that unemployment would \u201cbegin to gradually decline from later this year\u201d but \u201cremain elevated for some time\u201d. After hitting 10% in June 2020, unemployment wouldn\u2019t creep down to 6.5% until June 2022. The RBA noted unemployment \u201cwould have been much larger were it not for the jobkeeper wage subsidy program\u201d and estimates that \u201ctotal hours worked are likely to contract by around 20% over the first half of 2020\u201d because labour-intensive industries such as hospitality have been hardest hit. While the baseline scenario is described as \u201cplausible\u201d the RBA warns it could be much better or much worse than that: It is possible to contemplate an upside scenario where most domestic restrictions on activity are relaxed a little sooner and the economy recovers somewhat faster than in the baseline scenario. The greater is public confidence in positive health outcomes, the more likely it is that the easing in restrictions on activity spurs a recovery in spending; better health outcomes elsewhere in the world would reinforce this positive dynamic. In such a scenario, the unemployment rate could return to around 5 per cent in a couple of years and the level of GDP would return to a path that is close to that implied in the forecasts published in the February Statement on Monetary Policy. Alternatively, if the lifting of restrictions is delayed or the restrictions need to be reimposed or household and business confidence remains low, the outcomes would be even more challenging than those in the baseline scenario. The unemployment rate would drift down much more gradually and the level of output would remain around its trough for several quarters and recover only slowly. A longer downturn would involve more job losses and business failures, and therefore more lasting damage to economic performance. AAP reports that Australia has partnered with international allies to provide rapid coronavirus testing kits to vulnerable Pacific island nations. The kits, which deliver results in under an hour, have been delivered to four Pacific countries and will reach another nine in the coming fortnight. Australia joined forces with New Zealand, the United States and the World Health Organisation to procure the vital equipment. There are serious concerns a coronavirus outbreak could devastate Pacific nations, many of whom are still reeling from the widespread destruction caused by a recent tropical cyclone. Many Pacific nations do not have the capacity to test for coronavirus, instead sending specimens to countries like Australia for results. Australia has also sent personal protective equipment, medical and hygienic supplies, and other essentials to Pacific countries and Timor-Leste. The federal government is coordinating flights to deliver essential services and humanitarian assistance, as well as quarantining Pacific nationals in Australia for two weeks before taking them home. On Twitter, the minister for international development and the Pacific, Alex Hawke, had this to say. I\u2019ll leave it to you to work out what or who he might be referring to. The Parliamentary Budget Office has released an update on the state of the federal budget in March, showing that increased welfare expenses due to Covid-19 stimulus packages are blowing out the deficit. The key stats are: In March 2020, expenses were $8.7 billion higher than March last year, driven by social security and welfare expenses being $6.5 billion higher The fiscal balance for the financial year up to the end of March was -$22.0 billion, compared with the -$13.8 billion expected in December\u2019s mid-year economic update The year-to-date underlying cash balance was -$22.4 billion compared with an expected -$12.5 billion. Australia\u2019s net debt at the end of March 2020 was around $430 billion, about $37 billion higher than the most recent forecast for the end of this financial year. Revenue for March 2020 was similar to March 2019, although since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced in mid-March and many businesses waited several weeks before laying off or standing down workers, the April results will likely show the decline in revenue as household income fell. Adelaide Crows coach Matthew Nicks has described the club\u2019s potential breach of South Australian laws banning public gatherings \u201can honest mistake\u201d. SA Police are investigating whether a group of players and an assistant coach from the club broke Public Health Orders by training together while in isolation in the Barossa Valley. It is also a breach of the AFL\u2019s training rules. On Friday, Nicks told radio station Triple M the club had \u201clet ourselves down\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some poor communication which has come to a point where unfortunately our players were in a position where we had more than two players training at once,\u201d Nicks said. Part of the approval was that we had the right to train in pairs and the intention was always to train in those pairs [but] our communication wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep them apart. We got it wrong \u2026 it\u2019s our mistake and we\u2019ll own that mistake. The club said it had been given approval by the AFL and SA Police to train at the resort providing it adhered to strict social distancing and training protocols. Nicks said the breach was \u201can honest mistake\u201d and that the clubs would \u201ccop\u201d whatever punishment was handed out. It\u2019s an honest mistake we\u2019ve made and the issue relates solely to us. It shouldn\u2019t be a representation of broader industry because this is a mistake we\u2019ve made. We understand that we\u2019ll cop it and we understand the AFL need to do what they\u2019ll do. We\u2019re just really disappointed. One of the four new confirmed Covid-19 cases in New South Wales is a staff member at Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House, bringing the total number of cases linked to the aged care home to 69. That includes 32 staff and 37 residents. Another is a close contact of a confirmed case and the remaining two are still under investigation. We expect that after the National Cabinet today the prime minister will outline a staged plan to begin easing some restrictions on things like sport, retail and social gatherings. But the states won\u2019t necessarily act on those immediately, or at the same time. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian has said there will be no changes before at least Monday, while Western Australian premier Mark McGowan said any changes there will be announced on Sunday. We do expect to see some changes in Tasmania today though. Premier Peter Gutwein is due to outline a timeline for how restrictions will gradually ease, following national cabinet. Broad limitations will remain until at least 15 May, but Gutwein is hopeful of making a move on national parks and reserves before then. He has also signalled increasing the number of people allowed at funerals, with the cap currently at 10. Tasmania confirmed one new Covid-19 case on Thursday, a man in his 60s from the south, taking the overall tally to 225. The NRL has been doing the heavy lifting entertaining us throughout the Covid-19 hiatus, but AFL club the Adelaide Crows has decided to pitch in. South Australian Police are investigating whether the Crows broke state rules banning gatherings of more than 10 people by training together while self-isolating in the state\u2019s Barossa Valley. A survey by the Transport Workers Union of over 850 Qantas workers has drawn heated denials from Qantas management, highlighting the gulf between staff and management over the airline\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. The survey showed 81% said Qantas did not put appropriate safety measures in place to deal with the risk of infection and 93% were concerned about their own and others safety at work. The union says Qantas has had one of the worst workplace clusters during the pandemic with at least 60 people infected nationally across the Qantas Group, including 34 in South Australia centring on the Qantas baggage room at Adelaide airport. 750 Qantas staff went into quarantine as a result of the outbreak. The survey also revealed that 47% of workers said they don\u2019t feel they can raise safety issues at work, with the vast majority saying this was because they didn\u2019t believe it would make a difference. National secretary Michael Kaine said it raised questions about how Qantas could be contemplating returning to the skies. \u201cIt is unthinkable that an airline like Qantas has been operating a business-as-usual approach in the midst of a global pandemic which is being transmitted across international borders primarily by individuals via air travel,\u201d he said. But Qantas has responded angrily, saying the union has wilfully misrepresented the situation at Adelaide airport, and dismissed the findings. \u201cWe completely reject the findings of the union\u2019 survey and question its validity. Qantas has a strong safety culture and acting on reports from employees is a key part of our safety management system,\u201d a spokesman said. The TWU and the Flight Attendants Association have been particularly concerned about the potential exposure of staff who are operating international repatriation flights, and exposure on flights which carried passengers from the Ruby Princess. A NSW harbourmaster has told an inquiry he \u201cdid not understand\u201d an email that told him to treat the Ruby Princess \u201cas if it has a positive Covid-19 result\u201d when it came into Sydney harbour. Cameron Butchart, who was the duty harbourmaster on 18 March, said NSW Health\u2019s assessment that it was \u201clow risk\u201d introduced \u201can unfortunate element\u201d into his decision making. The inquiry heard that Butchart received an email that it was NSW Port Authority policy that if there were Covid-19 tests on board a cruise ship, with results to come, it should be \u201ctreated as if it has a positive result\u201d. However, the email also said that NSW Health had assessed it as \u201clow risk\u201d, meaning health teams would not board and assess it. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, asked Butchart whether \u201cthe label low-risk has introduced an unfortunate element in your decision making?\u201d, and Butchart said it had. He said: \u201cI just picked up [from the email that] the ship is low risk, and NSW health will not be attending. \u2018Great\u2019.\u201d Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, adds that it should be mentioned that Butchart did have enough concern over the health of the ship that he did \u201ccancel the booking\u201d of the Ruby Princess to dock. That decision was later reversed. In contrast to the Victoria Police, here\u2019s an example of how New South Wales brief the media on Public Health Order breaches. In the past 24 hours they\u2019ve charged two people and fined three others. For each charge and fine, the NSW police provide a breakdown that looks like this: At about 10pm, officers from Mt Druitt Police Area Command were called to home on De Witt Place, Willmot in relation to a noise complaint. On arrival, police observed a group of at least 15 people inside the home celebrating a birthday. All non-residents were given warnings in relation to breaching Ministerial Directions and told to leave the home. Police were called back to the property about 11.35pm as the noise was continuing and a 27-year-old woman, who was not a resident and previously given a warning, was still at the property. She was subsequently issued a $1,000 PIN. The point is not that NSW have been perfect in their enforcement, but that unlike Victoria the public are able to provide some scrutiny over the way these emergency powers are being enforced. Ruby Princess commissioner Bret Walker SC has also remarked on prime minister Scott Morrison, saying that the PM did not have \u201cknowledge or a view based on evidence\u201d when he criticised Walker\u2019s questioning. Morrison told radio host Ray Hadley that Walker\u2019s questioning was \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201ca bit out of line\u201d, after NSW Health employee Kelly-Anne Ressler cried in the witness box on Tuesday. Walker says that the media coverage of this \u201cmay have created a common misunderstanding that the PM made suggestions to me about the conduct of this independent inquiry.\u201d Walker stresses this is not the case, and that Morrison did not say he had seen the entire context of the interview. \u201cHe made clear that he had not seen the proceedings that lead up to the unfortunate upset of the witness,\u201d Walker says. \u201cIt is clear from the PM\u2019s reported comments that to no extent at all was he suggesting that he had knowledge of or a view based on evidence.\u201d Victoria Police have issued 13 fines for breaches of Public Health Orders in the past 24 hours. It\u2019s an issue that has mostly gone unmentioned through the crisis, but Victoria has issued more fines for breaches of the PHOs than any other state during Covid-19, yet unlike in New South Wales police refuse to say where the fines were handed out or what they are for. Today, for example, the only explanation given by Victoria Police is that some fines were for \u201cseveral people holding gatherings at private houses\u201d. Good morning. Plenty around this morning so I\u2019ll get straight to it. The former Queensland premier and chief executive of the Australian Banking Association Anna Bligh is holding a press conference. She says that according to the ABA\u2019s data there have been 100,000 loan deferrals in the past week. More than half of those are mortgages. There have now been 643,000 loan repayment deferrals on mortgage and businesses since the Covid-19 crisis. We Almost 400,000 of those are mortgage deferrals. Bligh said the deferrals date to September: As we start to see the economy open up, we would expect to see many of those people wanting to get back to their repayments and to get back into paying their loans off as soon as they can. I think it is equally clear that there are going to be many thousands of people who are either not back in full employment or not back in any employment at the end of this six months. That\u2019s my spell concluded. Replacing me, my colleague Michael McGowan from the members\u2019 end. The fifth day of the special inquiry into the Ruby Princess has started with a bang. The inquiry has written to the editor-in-chief of the Australian newspaper, over what could be a contempt of the inquiry. Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, says he has to address an opinion article published yesterday in the Australian, written by former Daily Telegraph editor David Penberthy. That article said that the inquiry was \u201ca sham\u201d, after a NSW Health epidemiologist, Kelly Anne-Ressler, cried in the witness box under extensive questioning from commissioner Bret Walker. Scott Morrison later told a radio station that he thought Walker had been \u201ca bit out of line\u201d and too aggressive. Penberthy\u2019s article said Ressler should not have been asked to even give evidence, and that she was not on the four-person panel who made the decision over the ship. Beasley lists 10 reasons why Ressler should have appeared, including that she boarded the ship on the 8th, when NSW assessed it, and was in contact with the ship\u2019s doctor. He strongly denies that any member of the NSW government or cabinet has attempted to interfere in the inquiry. He then says he \u201chas no comments\u201d on whether the article constitutes \u201ca contempt\u201d of the commission, but that the senior solicitor for the inquiry has written to the editor of the Australian \u201cas to whether the comments in Penberthy\u2019s article might constitute a contempt\u201d. The newspaper has been requested to respond by noon today. Noice. Different. Unusual. Kel Knight is a man for our times. More of McGowan emphasising the point that some states - such as Western Australia, with low rates of infection and community transmission - will be able to ease restrictions earlier. Already, Western Australia has 75% school attendance rates: Victoria and New South Wales, they are clearly in far more trouble than Western Australia. So they will have a different point of view than Western Australia. The point I always make is that we have to be very, very careful with health, we have to be cautious and considered in what we do. But we do need to get people back to work. We can\u2019t have businesses and individuals\u2019 lives continuing to be destroyed. And if we can do it in a safe, secure, and health just way, that is the way forward we will go. Things are different \u201cover east\u201d McGowan says. The eastern seaboard, I would expect, would be more conservative, as they have been along this route. But, frankly, they have had a much bigger problem than we have. Our hard borders allow us to do more than the eastern states can. And so that initiative means we can potentially loosen restrictions to a greater degree than the eastern states. Western Australian premier Mark McGowan is updating his state\u2019s situation. The West has one new case overnight, a 29-year-old man who returned from overseas and has been in hotel quarantine since. Obviously it\u2019s that our streak of zero cases has come to an end. However, we always knew we would get more cases as people return from overseas or interstate. The good news here is that we have systems in place to ensure any spread of the virus is limited. Overnight we have recorded a further three recoveries. This means we have now had 534 people recover from Covid-19. And, as a result, we now have just nine active cases here in Western Australia, the first time we have hit single digits. Only four people are in hospital in total, with one in ICU. The number of people in our hospitals with the virus continues to fall. The Victorian health department has confirmed that a student from Marcellin College has tested positive for Covid-19 after coming in close contact with another person in the cluster. \u201cOne Marcellin College student has tested positive for coronavirus. The student is a household contact of a confirmed case with the Cedar Meats outbreak,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said in a statement. \u201cAs the student did not attend school while infectious the department has advised no further action is necessary by Marcellin College.\u201d A WorkSafe Inspector has also gone into isolation and is being tested after attending the factory on 23 April following a workplace accident. A worker severed his thumb at the factory and was rushed to Sunshine hospital. He was asymptomatic at the time but later developed symptoms and tested positive for Covid-19 on 26 April. \u201cThe WorkSafe Inspector was not onsite at the same time as the employee that later tested positive to coronavirus - and as such, was not a close contact,\u201d a spokesperson for the department said. \u201cThe WorkSafe inspector was contacted by DHHS as part of the wider investigation into the cluster and is being tested for coronavirus as a precaution. \u201cThe Inspector has not reported any symptoms and is self-isolating while awaiting results.\u201d A reminder, national cabinet will meet today to debate (and hopefully finalise) the roadmap out of Covid-19 lockdowns. Australians should expect a phased lifting of restrictions over months \u2013 with different parts of the country easing restrictions at different times. Relaxations are likely to be staged in four-week blocks. That meeting starts in about an hour. Expect to hear from state and federal leaders this afternoon. Australia is part of the global \u201cearly movers\u201d group of countries, but don\u2019t expect anything dramatic anytime soon. Think months, not weeks. The Australian government has pushed back at US claims the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan lab and has determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document. It is understood the Morrison government sees the promotion of the theory the virus leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan, China, as counterproductive to Australia\u2019s push to gain broad international support for an independent inquiry into the origins and overall handling of the pandemic. I might leave you there for this morning, but I\u2019m leaving you in good hands. Ben Doherty will be with you throughout the day. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said in a statement this morning that Covid-19 testing equipment has been delivered to a number of Pacific Island countries. Pacific Island countries will be equipped to more effectively detect and prevent the spread of COVID-19, with the arrival of new rapid diagnostic tests that build on Australia\u2019s partnership with our region to protect against the pandemic. Beyond immediate health security and safety concerns, our partnerships extend to working with Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste to plan for the economic recovery. Confidence in testing systems and community health is essential to this ... The first deliveries arrived in Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea and Nauru in recent days. Initial supplies will reach a further nine Pacific Island countries in the coming fortnight. Many Pacific Island countries have not had in-country capacity to test for COVID-19, and have had to send specimens overseas, including to Australia, for results ... The equipment includes testing machines and cartridges for individual tests. These produce rapid results from a basic nasal swab. Rapid detection is a key part of the region\u2019s pandemic response. The procurement and delivery of the testing equipment is a collaborative effort between Australia, New Zealand, the United States, the Pacific Community and the WHO. New Qantas flights from Los Angeles and London to Melbourne have built up hopes that Australian expats can bring their pets home. AAP reports: Australians hoping to fly home during the coronavirus pandemic have been given new options with Qantas announcing limited flights to Melbourne from Los Angeles and London. It also opens the potential for pets to be flown back to Australia. Previous special Qantas and Virgin Australia flights organised during the pandemic flew from LA to Brisbane. Brisbane does not have the facilities to quarantine pets, forcing Australians planning to fly home during the pandemic to leave their pets in the US or opt not to return to Australia. Under Australia\u2019s strict border rules cats and dogs must arrive directly into Melbourne Airport and be quarantined at a facility at Mickleham, near Melbourne. The Australian government has requested owners of pets planning to fly back to Australia on one of the new Melbourne flights to contact Qantas and their chosen pet carriers to check on animal transportation. Comment is being sought from Qantas. Gladys Berejiklian has also confirmed that no national cabinet meeting recommendations will be put in place in NSW in time for Mother\u2019s Day. But residents are allowed to have two adults guests over, along with any children in their care. Gladys Berejiklian has provided an update on how the NSW hotel quarantine program has gone: We are still welcoming Australians back from overseas in New South Wales. We have around 3,500 people still in hotels. I wanted to provide an update to say that since the borders were controlled, we have had over 13,000 people in hotels in New South Wales. Gladys Berejiklian says there have only been four new Covid-19 cases in the state overnight. If you want to get all caught up ahead of the national cabinet meeting today, may I suggest this report from Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy? She breaks down everything you need to know about the financial hopes and health worries surrounding lifting the lockdown. One of the biggest unfolding stories at the moment is Cedar Meats. The Melbourne factory has been linked to 62 cases, including a nurse, an aged care worker and now a schoolboy. Victorian politicians have been quick to talk about what a good job they have done containing the crisis, but there are still several days in late April with a big question mark hanging over them, as more information about who knew exactly what and when emerge. I spoke to a worker at Cedar Meats who says they were scared to stay at the factory after the first case was announced. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic in Australia. You have me, Matilda Boseley, with you for this morning. The big news today is that state, territory and federal leaders are linking up for a national cabinet meeting. The discussion will revolve around how Australia should approach lifting lockdown laws. But don\u2019t get too excited \u2013 any changes are likely to be cautious and gradual, and the easing of restrictions will come in four-week waves. While some states, like Queensland, lifted some restrictions on families visiting each other in time for Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday, the New South Wales and Victorian leadership has held firm, saying anything is discussed at today\u2019s meeting won\u2019t be put in place by the weekend. In case you are feeling a bit behind here, are the biggest things that happened yesterday to get you up to speed. The Newmarch House operator Anglicare appointed a special adviser to guide its response to a deadly Covid-19 outbreak at the facility. The cluster connected to a Melbourne meat factory, Cedar Meats, grew to 62 infected people. South Australia recorded its first case in two weeks. The NRL said players who objected to vaccines could apply for an exemption to train during the pandemic.",

We\u2019re well stocked after two months of doing nothing,\u201d said Wagner, 66, who is also a longtime Hollywood special effects operator. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta get these businesses open \u2026 though in LA and Malibu, we\u2019re not the kind to run around and carry banners and firearms to protest.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The economic fallout from the coronavirus has come to Silicon Valley, with major tech firms announcing layoffs in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Uber became the latest company to announce cuts, revealing in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will lay off 3,700 workers \u2013 roughly 14% of its global workforce. Uber cited the pandemic in its filing, saying Covid-19 had affected its entire business, including financial performance, investments in new products, ability to attract drivers, and corporate strategy. Uber\u2019s announcement came after several other tech companies said they were making cuts amid the crisis. Uber\u2019s biggest rival, Lyft, announced last week it would lay off 982 members of its staff and furlough another 288. Airbnb announced this week it would lay off 1,900 people \u2013 roughly 25% of its staff. The vaping company Juul announced in April it would lay off 800 members of its staff and move its headquarters to Washington DC. Yelp announced last month it would lay off 1,000 employees and furlough 1,100 more. WeWork announced in March it would lay off 250 employees and is expected to cut more jobs by the end of May. Big tech companies are not the only members of the industry affected. About 375 startups have laid off more than 42,000 employees since 11 March, according to a layoff tracking site. Yet not all tech firms are suffering in equal measure. In the first three months of 2020, Amazon made more than $33m per hour, according to its earnings report last week, boosted by a surge in ordering from customers locked down at home. The delivery startup Instacart had to hire 300,000 workers in less than a month as more people began to order groceries online. The online video conference tool Zoom, which was valued at $36 per share when it went public in 2019, is now valued at $150 per share and its user base recently surpassed 300 million. But with closed borders, travel bans, and stay-at-home orders around the world, travel-related tech companies are disproportionately affected, said Carl Uminski, a tech industry analyst and co-founder of the digital consultancy Somo. \u201cIt\u2019s well understood now that the impact Covid-19 has had on the entire travel industry is absolutely colossal,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only has the industry stopped, it will never be exactly the same again and nobody knows exactly what it is going to look like.\u201d Uber is attempting to make more cost-cutting measures. Dara Khosrowshahi, its chief executive, said he would forgo his own salary for the rest of the year and the company would re-evaluate investments in new products. It will also permanently close 180, or 40%, of its driver resource centers around the world.",

We\u2019re fed up. This has got to end.\u201d</p> <p>As of Thursday, there were 2,757 confirmed cases for the Navajo nation \u2013 whose rural territory stretches 27,000 sq miles over the south-western Colorado plateau across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. The official death toll stood at 88 <strong>\u2013 </strong>higher than 13 states \u2013 though the actual number of fatalities is likely to be much higher as the sickest patients requiring ventilators and intensive care are transferred to state hospitals.</p> <p>The virus has spread rapidly among the Navajo since the first case was confirmed at the end of March, even though the tribal government was among the first to issue a stay-at-home order, lock down schools and business, and impose evening and weekend curfews.</p> <p>Despite the unfolding crisis, it wasn\u2019t until Wednesday that the nation received its portion, around $600m, of federal coronavirus relief funding. It came six weeks after it was promised and a week after the government missed a congressional deadline for distribution, and only after suing the federal government over who is eligible for the money.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources of New York and New Jersey and yet it\u2019s taken six weeks for tribes to see this money,\u201d said Nez. \u201cThe federal response has been too slow.\u201d</p> <p>This slow, inadequate response by the government is nothing new.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NNPrezNez/status/1255589484722302977\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today we distributed food, water, fire wood, cleaning products, masks, and more to elderly and high-risk families in Pueblo Pintado and Torreon, NM to help fight COVID-19!

It\u2019s been extremely challenging to quarantine infected individuals because of inadequate basic infrastructure and widespread overcrowding, according to tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty.</p> <p>In part, the latter is down to cultural norms which mean multiple generations often live together, but it\u2019s also due to chronic housing shortages, complex federal restrictions on construction, high unemployment and poverty on the reservation.</p> <p>In tribal areas, 16% of American Indian and Alaska Native households live in overcrowded conditions \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html\">eight times </a><a href=\"https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdredge/pdr-edge-research-022117.html\">the rate of the rest of the population.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough hospital beds for individuals to recover, so we\u2019ve had to send people home where the virus is spread,\u201d said Nez. After multiple family outbreaks, up to 150 coronavirus patients will now be temporarily housed in three converted community gyms, instead of being sent home.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the quantity of homes, it\u2019s also about quality. About 30% of people do not have electricity, and so cook and heat their homes by burning coal or wood which irritates the lungs \u2013 potentially exacerbating the risk of severe Covid-19. That\u2019s on top of high rates of lung disease caused by decades of exposure to uranium mines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2e54c3afefb2ddd965e779ac039b0bac73ec4db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2e54c3afefb2ddd965e779ac039b0bac73ec4db/0_179_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A road sign outside Bloomfield, New Mexico, warns Navajos to stay home during their nation\u2019s 8pm to 5am curfew to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A road sign outside Bloomfield, New Mexico, warns Navajos to stay home during their nation\u2019s 8pm to 5am curfew to slow the spread of the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Hay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, depending on the season, as many as 40% do not have running water, according to research by the John Hopkins Centre for American Indian Health (CAIH). And the vast reservation is a food desert, with only 13 grocery stores, which means some people travel up to 150 miles to shop.</p> <p>\u201cSocial distancing isn\u2019t simple, when people have to move to survive,\u201d said Kanazbah Crotty.</p> <p>As a result, the average age for coronavirus cases among the Navajo is just 45 years old, according to Crystalyne Curley, spokeswoman for the operational command centre.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the lack of running water increases the risk of infectious diseases. But the crisis is also linked to childhood obesity \u2013 the number one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is seven times more common in native youth than the general population, according to Dr Allison Barlow, the CAIH director.</p> <p>\u201cThe clash of historic traumas, accumulated stressors and poor social determinants cannot be underestimated in what we\u2019re seeing now with coronavirus. There\u2019s such a complex constellation of risks piled up and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-outbreak-us-native-americans-health-services\">chronic underfunding </a>is part of that puzzle,\u201d said Barlow.</p> <p>According to Laura Hammitt, an infectious diseases specialist, the emerging epidemiological data suggests Covid-19 infections are more common and more severe in younger Navajo people than the general population. This is partly linked to underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and respiratory conditions \u2013 which are more prevalent among younger Native Americans than non-Natives. The average age of those who have died is 66 \u2013 significantly younger than in the US as a whole.</p> <p>The tribe continues to struggle to obtain enough testing kits and PPE, especially gowns and masks, and has been forced to rely on<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NNPrezNez/status/1256387754637750273\"> private donors including the actor Sean Penn.</a> Contact tracing is also still very limited, though a training program is now under way.</p> <p>Still, Nez has come under pressure from some <a href=\"https://www.azfamily.com/news/mayor-of-page-accused-of-racist-social-media-comment-toward-navajo-nation-president/article_e2e6efd6-8db4-11ea-a8a2-7f6976d702f6.html\">local mayors to</a> reopen tourist attractions, as states look towards easing lockdown restrictions despite public health warnings</p> <p>Nez added: \u201cLots of states are risking second spikes by not following professional advice. I love my people and we are not going to reopen prematurely.\u201d</p>",

It came six weeks after it was promised and a week after the government missed a congressional deadline for distribution, and only after suing the federal government over who is eligible for the money. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources of New York and New Jersey and yet it\u2019s taken six weeks for tribes to see this money,\u201d said Nez. \u201cThe federal response has been too slow.\u201d This slow, inadequate response by the government is nothing new. The US has repeatedly violated its treaty obligations by failing to adequately fund healthcare, education, housing, economic development and agricultural assistance for tribal nations, according to the National Congress of American Indians. As a result, the Navajo nation is beset with widespread structural, economic and health injustices which have helped coronavirus spread and hampered efforts to curtail it. Take housing. It\u2019s been extremely challenging to quarantine infected individuals because of inadequate basic infrastructure and widespread overcrowding, according to tribal council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty. In part, the latter is down to cultural norms which mean multiple generations often live together, but it\u2019s also due to chronic housing shortages, complex federal restrictions on construction, high unemployment and poverty on the reservation. In tribal areas, 16% of American Indian and Alaska Native households live in overcrowded conditions \u2013 eight times the rate of the rest of the population. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough hospital beds for individuals to recover, so we\u2019ve had to send people home where the virus is spread,\u201d said Nez. After multiple family outbreaks, up to 150 coronavirus patients will now be temporarily housed in three converted community gyms, instead of being sent home. It\u2019s not just the quantity of homes, it\u2019s also about quality. About 30% of people do not have electricity, and so cook and heat their homes by burning coal or wood which irritates the lungs \u2013 potentially exacerbating the risk of severe Covid-19. That\u2019s on top of high rates of lung disease caused by decades of exposure to uranium mines. In addition, depending on the season, as many as 40% do not have running water, according to research by the John Hopkins Centre for American Indian Health (CAIH). And the vast reservation is a food desert, with only 13 grocery stores, which means some people travel up to 150 miles to shop. \u201cSocial distancing isn\u2019t simple, when people have to move to survive,\u201d said Kanazbah Crotty. As a result, the average age for coronavirus cases among the Navajo is just 45 years old, according to Crystalyne Curley, spokeswoman for the operational command centre. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the lack of running water increases the risk of infectious diseases. But the crisis is also linked to childhood obesity \u2013 the number one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is seven times more common in native youth than the general population, according to Dr Allison Barlow, the CAIH director. \u201cThe clash of historic traumas, accumulated stressors and poor social determinants cannot be underestimated in what we\u2019re seeing now with coronavirus. There\u2019s such a complex constellation of risks piled up and chronic underfunding is part of that puzzle,\u201d said Barlow. According to Laura Hammitt, an infectious diseases specialist, the emerging epidemiological data suggests Covid-19 infections are more common and more severe in younger Navajo people than the general population. This is partly linked to underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and respiratory conditions \u2013 which are more prevalent among younger Native Americans than non-Natives. The average age of those who have died is 66 \u2013 significantly younger than in the US as a whole. The tribe continues to struggle to obtain enough testing kits and PPE, especially gowns and masks, and has been forced to rely on private donors including the actor Sean Penn. Contact tracing is also still very limited, though a training program is now under way. Still, Nez has come under pressure from some local mayors to reopen tourist attractions, as states look towards easing lockdown restrictions despite public health warnings Nez added: \u201cLots of states are risking second spikes by not following professional advice. I love my people and we are not going to reopen prematurely.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Some California businesses on Friday began opening their doors for business \u2013 at least partially. As states and counties across the nation contend with pressure to lift the stay-at-home measures that have destroyed local economies, California is taking an especially cautious approach, walking a fine line between political and economic pressure to reopen and the public health imperative to stop the spread of disease. Public health experts told the Guardian that while no US state was equipped with enough coronavirus testing and surveillance to feel fully confident reopening, California\u2019s slow, piecemeal recovery plan \u2013 though far from perfect \u2013 seemed like the least risky option. The plan Seven weeks after the governor, Gavin Newsom, ordered his 40 million constituents to shelter in place and all non-essential businesses to close, California on Friday entered phase two of its grand reopening plan. Some retail stores, including bookshops, florists, music stores, clothing and sporting goods retailers, can reopen if they organize curbside pickup. Some manufacturing and logistics in the retail supply chain can restart as well, as long as they follow safety and hygiene protocols. And local authorities are allowed to ease regulations further than the state guidelines if they meet certain testing and sanitation requirements. Phase three of the plan \u2013 potentially months away \u2013 could see salons, gyms, movie theaters and in-person church services resume. Phase four would end all restrictions. The timing Friday\u2019s reopenings come as California has avoided the surge of infections states like New York have seen. And although California has seen more than 61,000 cases and 2,500 deaths, its hospitals have not been overwhelmed. Last week, state officials reported the first week-over-week decline in Covid-19 deaths. The new guidelines also follow small but sustained protests across the state to demand a relaxation of regulations to revive the state\u2019s crippled economy, and some rural counties have partially reopened in defiance of the lockdown measures. The caveats However, California still hasn\u2019t seen the two weeks of declining cases that the White House suggested as a criterion for easing restrictions and that several European countries have used as a benchmark. The state also lacks the robust testing and tracking systems that countries such as Germany and South Korea have used. The state has ramped up its ability to administer and process tests, although for now, its rate of 29,414 tests a day is below the figure required by some analyses. Authorities are working to put a robust contact tracing effort in place to make sure those who test positive get the care they need and are able to isolate themselves until they recover. Although some counties and communities have spearheaded community-wide testing and tracing programs, overall, the state isn\u2019t at the point where its system is as widespread or efficient as a country like Germany\u2019s. Experts say California should also have a system in place to make sure vulnerable, unhoused populations have access to shelter and medical care \u2013 to prevent infection flare-ups in homeless shelters and encampments. Progress on those measures heavily varies county by county. And ideally, there would be a treatment or a vaccine before reopening, said Dr Richard Jackson, a professor emeritus at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and the former head of the California department of public health.

The Guardia Civil said the man, a Moroccan citizen, was arrested in the Catalan capital following a surveillance operation. The police force said in a statement that the man appeared to have been radicalised and linked to Isis for at least four years, but had kept a low profile online and offline until recently. Investigators, however, noticed a \u201cstriking and worrying\u201d change in his behaviour during the state of emergency declared by the Spanish government in response to the coronavirus, and became concerned that he was preparing to respond to Isis calls to carry out attacks in the western countries. \u201cSince the coronavirus began spreading across Europe, there have been a number of single-person terrorist attacks involving knives or vehicles,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe arrested man had used social media to proclaim his loyalty to Isis and his hatred for the west. Surveillance officers noticed that he had begun to disregard the lockdown rules set out in the state of emergency on a regular basis, and that he was taking important security measures as he ventured around Barcelona, suggesting he was carrying out a possible search for targets.\u201d The man had become \u201ctotally influenced by Isis propaganda\u201d and had sworn loyalty to the group, \u201craising real security fears\u201d. Sixteen people were killed in terrorist attacks in Barcelona and the Catalan coastal town of Cambrils in August 2017. Thirteen of the victims died and more than 100 were injured when a man drove a van down the busy La Rambla shopping street in Barcelona, mowing down pedestrians. It emerged later that the terrorist cell behind the atrocity was planning a much larger attack, including bombing the city\u2019s famous Sagrada Familia church. Spain suffered its worst terrorist attack in 2004, when 191 people were killed and more than 1,800 injured in a series of explosions on four crowded commuter trains in Madrid. Two weeks ago, Spanish police arrested a former British rapper turned Islamic State extremist, Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, one of the most wanted militants in Europe. British and other sources confirmed his identity a few hours after the national police force in Madrid said it had arrested an Egyptian national and two other men in a flat in the southern city of Almer\u00eda.",

That leaves states to choose their own paths out of lockdown. In California, the first to issue a stay-at-home order seven weeks ago, the state governor, Gavin Newsom, has announced the beginning of a tentative reopening, with some rural counties already defying lockdown restrictions. Experts say the Golden State\u2019s methodical four-step plan is the least worst in an array of risky options. Did the Trump Organization ask for a British bailout? Congress has passed legislation preventing US taxpayer funds being used to prop up companies in which Donald Trump holds a stake. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the Trump Organization seeking bailout funds from governments overseas. Now, Democrats are demanding more information about coronavirus cash the company has requested in the UK and other countries, to cover the wages of furloughed employees from the president\u2019s golf properties. Trump\u2019s valet tests positive. A member of the US military who works at the White House, reportedly as one of the president\u2019s personal valets, has tested positive for Covid-19. Uber is laying off thousands, while other tech giants boom Uber has announced plans to lay off 3,700 employees \u2013 about 14% of its entire global workforce \u2013 as the economic fallout from the pandemic sweeps through Silicon Valley. Lyft, Airbnb, Yelp and WeWork have all announced similar cuts in recent days. And yet, thanks to a lockdown boom in business for companies such as Netflix and Amazon, the tech-heavy Nasdaq share index has now recovered all of its coronavirus-related losses. Unemployment rose another 3 million last week. The total number of Americans to file jobless claims, in the seven weeks since lockdowns began, has now topped 33 million. The virus set off a global \u2018tsunami of hate and xenophobia\u2019 The UN secretary-general says the pandemic has caused a surge in \u201chate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering\u201d around the world, both online and on the street, from antisemitic conspiracy theories to Covid-19-related anti-Muslim attacks. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres made the remarks as China insisted it was \u201copen to cooperate\u201d with a World Health Organization investigation into the origins of the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Republican senators floated a proposal to rename the street outside China\u2019s embassy in Washington DC after the late Wuhan doctor who was punished by authorities for warning about the outbreak \u2013 a suggestion sure to enrage Beijing. Covid-19 could \u2018smoulder\u2019 in Africa over the coming years, the WHO has warned, saying the disease could kill up to 190,000 people on the continent in the next 12 months alone. Bogot\u00e1\u2019s gendered lockdown is putting trans people at risk of violent attacks, activists say. The Colombian capital is allowing men and women to venture out for essential activities on alternate days. How a plot to invade Venezuela fell apart One of the two US mercenaries captured in Venezuela this week has admitted that he and his group intended to raid the presidential palace in Caracas, abduct president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and spirit him back to the US \u201chowever necessary\u201d. Maduro has demanded the extradition of Jordan Goudreau, the former green beret who plotted the audacious operation in hopes of earning a $15m bounty from the US government. But that audacious plan quickly unravelled. In other news\u2026 The DoJ is dropping its prosecution of Michael Flynn, despite Trump\u2019s former national security adviser having pleaded guilty to lying to investigators \u2013 in one of the signature cases to arise from Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Two men have been charged over Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s death. A former police officer and his son face murder and aggravated assault charges for the shooting of the 25-year-old unarmed black man, who was killed while jogging through Brunswick, Georgia, in February. Tara Reade called for Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race. The woman accusing the former vice-president of a 1993 sexual assault, which he denies, made the remarks in an on-camera interview with Megyn Kelly. Armed black citizens escorted a Michigan lawmaker to work. State representative Sarah Anthony said she wanted to highlight what she saw as the failure of the Michigan capitol police to provide adequate protection during a protest involving armed white supremacists last week. Great reads Megan Thee Stallion on her quarantine collab with Queen B Her lyrical prowess has made her one of the hottest rappers in the US, but even Megan Thee Stallion was surprised when Beyonc\u00e9 wanted to remix her track Savage, she tells Yomi Adegoke. And Tara Joshi explains why it\u2019s a golden era for women in rap.

Are they just being used as part of a bigger political game by the Turkish government? Katy Fallon reports. Opinion: The Murdoch media are campaigning for Trump Rupert Murdoch\u2019s global media empire is stoking the Chinese lab coronavirus theory, says former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd. Why? To help re-elect Trump in 2020. There are three issues in this campaign: Trump\u2019s handling of the virus; how to dig the US out of its virus-induced economic hole; and who can be most hardline on China \u2013 the Donald or \u2018Beijing Biden\u2019, as the Republicans now seek to tag his Democratic opponent. There\u2019s little else on the table. Last Thing: five films for the whole family Plonking the kids in front of a film is one of the few reliable time-wasters of the lockdown era. But what if you want to watch with them, and you don\u2019t feel like another viewing of Trolls World Tour? Andrew Pulver picks five children\u2019s films that aren\u2019t just for children.

The Ohio state government has asked employers to report anyone who refuses to return to work because they are concerned about the coronavirus pandemic. Reported workers may be ineligible for unemployment benefits. The coronavirus has now claimed more than 73,000 lives in the US, more than a 1,000 of them in Ohio alone. Quarantine measures have triggered an unprecedented wave of job losses and the state\u2019s unemployment fund is in crisis. Ohio\u2019s department of job and family services has now asked employers \u201cto report employees who quit or refuse work when it is available due to Covid-19\u201d. The information collected on the \u201cCovid-19 Employee Fraud\u201d form can then be used to evaluate potential unemployment benefits claims from people who are refusing \u201csuitable work\u201d, and are thus ineligible for benefits.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a term we use in epidemiology to capture the essence of increases in deaths, or excess mortality, above and beyond normal expectations: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19056405\">\u201charvesting\u201d</a>. During heatwaves, or a bad season of influenza, additional deaths above what would be normally seen in the population fit this description. Harvesting usually affects older people and those who are already sick. Generally, it is viewed as a tragic, unfortunate, but largely unpreventable consequence of natural events. It carries with it connotations of an acceptable loss of life. It is, in a sense, what happens as part of a normal life in normal times. But the word also has darker connotations: those of sacrifice, reaping, culling. As such, while it may appear in textbooks of epidemiology, it doesn\u2019t occur in national influenza strategic plans or national discourse. The concept of harvesting is restricted to epidemiological circles.</p> <p>But what if politicians promote the notion of harvesting (while declining to use the term) where it is not a \u201cnatural\u201d consequence of events but a direct consequence of government policy? What if the medical and nursing world do <em>not</em> accept harvesting in these circumstances? What if a policy that results in harvesting cannot be articulated because it is unacceptable to the broader population? This is where we have got to with the coronavirus pandemic. Nowhere better exemplifies this tension between a policy and its popular acceptance than the effects of coronavirus in nursing homes.</p> <p>Coronavirus is tearing through our nursing home population in the UK. Even if official statistics are opaque, we know this anecdotally. More than <a href=\"https://www.mha.org.uk/news/policy-influencing/facts-stats/\">400,000 people live in UK care homes</a>. We are only now beginning to see the statistics in terms of confirmed cases. Estimates that more than <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-28/finally-the-statistics-tell-the-story-of-coronavirus-care-home-deaths-writes-paul-brand/\">3,000 people had died in care homes </a>by mid-April are likely to be gross underestimates. We can see this when we look at national <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/03/englands-excess-death-rate-among-highest-europe/\">excess mortality numbers</a>. These statistics, especially when we look at the elderly, paint a horrifying picture. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-deaths-how-does-britain-compare-with-other-countries\">Enormous numbers of deaths</a> among our most frail citizens are the result, both directly and indirectly, of the coronavirus crisis. The UK is leading Europe in this most awful of league tables. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/deputy-chief-scientist-we-need-to-get-to-grips-with-coronavirus-care-home-deaths\">more data about care home deaths</a> becomes available, I predict that we\u2019ll see how care homes have taken the full force of this epidemiological tsunami. We have to predict, because the numbers aren\u2019t yet available to inform us.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">Revealed: the secret report that gave ministers warning of care home coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Have we arrived at this predicament because the government\u2019s strategy went awry? And if so, why? My guess \u2013 which can only be provisional, as Sage\u2019s minutes aren\u2019t publicly available \u2013 is that scientists gave policymakers a scenario in February that the pandemic could be allowed to spread largely unhindered in the wider community. But if this approach were promoted, islands of elderly and vulnerable people would need to be created, and the residents on these islands would need to be protected. This strategy makes sense if we acknowledge comments about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">\u201cherd immunity\u201d</a> from Boris Johnson and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, alongside the initial decision not to roll out testing in the community. Remember, too, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-52450742/page/2\">Matt Hancock\u2019s assertion</a> that care homes \u201chave been a top priority from the start\u201d.</p> <p>If herd immunity was the initial strategy outlined by advisers, they would have known that harvesting older people could not be part of the equation. This isn\u2019t about science or politics \u2013 it\u2019s a simple question of humanity. If the government\u2019s strategy was to allow the virus to spread through the wider population, albeit at a slowed pace, residents in nursing homes would need to be protected.</p> <p>But this is not what happened. The initial strategy of allowing herd immunity to develop in the wider community was pursued, but the most vulnerable people were <em>not </em>protected. Though harvesting may not have been the government\u2019s intention, it became the de facto policy in the absence of adequate protections for older and vulnerable people. Had the government monitored care homes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/all-400000-gowns-flown-from-turkey-for-nhs-fail-uk-standards\">supplied adequate PPE</a>, rolled out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/sick-care-home-residents-not-tested-despite-uk-government-pledge\">testing in care homes</a> and reduced the exposure of their residents to visitors and other carers, the islands of vulnerable and elderly people would have been protected.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/parents-grandparents-boxers-singers-care-home-residents-who-have-died-from-covid-19-coronavirus\">Parents, grandparents, boxers, singers: care home residents who have died from Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s initial strategy, therefore, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/matt-hancock-government-policy-herd-immunity-community-surveillance-covid-19\">herd immunity</a> <em>and </em>harvesting. Operational implementation follows a strategy, not the other way round. Only belatedly did the government\u2019s strategy morph into one that sought to protect the elderly and reverse the harvesting, through widespread testing and contact tracing. But by then it was too late. Operations could not catch up.</p> <p>In the discipline of public health, we often use what are known as \u201clenses\u201d to explore how health systems function. Lenses are ways of looking at a health system that offers insights into its strengths and its weaknesses.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a term we use in epidemiology to capture the essence of increases in deaths, or excess mortality, above and beyond normal expectations: \u201charvesting\u201d. During heatwaves, or a bad season of influenza, additional deaths above what would be normally seen in the population fit this description. Harvesting usually affects older people and those who are already sick. Generally, it is viewed as a tragic, unfortunate, but largely unpreventable consequence of natural events. It carries with it connotations of an acceptable loss of life. It is, in a sense, what happens as part of a normal life in normal times. But the word also has darker connotations: those of sacrifice, reaping, culling. As such, while it may appear in textbooks of epidemiology, it doesn\u2019t occur in national influenza strategic plans or national discourse. The concept of harvesting is restricted to epidemiological circles. But what if politicians promote the notion of harvesting (while declining to use the term) where it is not a \u201cnatural\u201d consequence of events but a direct consequence of government policy? What if the medical and nursing world do not accept harvesting in these circumstances? What if a policy that results in harvesting cannot be articulated because it is unacceptable to the broader population? This is where we have got to with the coronavirus pandemic. Nowhere better exemplifies this tension between a policy and its popular acceptance than the effects of coronavirus in nursing homes. Coronavirus is tearing through our nursing home population in the UK. Even if official statistics are opaque, we know this anecdotally. More than 400,000 people live in UK care homes. We are only now beginning to see the statistics in terms of confirmed cases. Estimates that more than 3,000 people had died in care homes by mid-April are likely to be gross underestimates. We can see this when we look at national excess mortality numbers. These statistics, especially when we look at the elderly, paint a horrifying picture. Enormous numbers of deaths among our most frail citizens are the result, both directly and indirectly, of the coronavirus crisis. The UK is leading Europe in this most awful of league tables. When more data about care home deaths becomes available, I predict that we\u2019ll see how care homes have taken the full force of this epidemiological tsunami. We have to predict, because the numbers aren\u2019t yet available to inform us. Have we arrived at this predicament because the government\u2019s strategy went awry? And if so, why? My guess \u2013 which can only be provisional, as Sage\u2019s minutes aren\u2019t publicly available \u2013 is that scientists gave policymakers a scenario in February that the pandemic could be allowed to spread largely unhindered in the wider community. But if this approach were promoted, islands of elderly and vulnerable people would need to be created, and the residents on these islands would need to be protected. This strategy makes sense if we acknowledge comments about \u201cherd immunity\u201d from Boris Johnson and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, alongside the initial decision not to roll out testing in the community. Remember, too, Matt Hancock\u2019s assertion that care homes \u201chave been a top priority from the start\u201d. If herd immunity was the initial strategy outlined by advisers, they would have known that harvesting older people could not be part of the equation. This isn\u2019t about science or politics \u2013 it\u2019s a simple question of humanity. If the government\u2019s strategy was to allow the virus to spread through the wider population, albeit at a slowed pace, residents in nursing homes would need to be protected. But this is not what happened. The initial strategy of allowing herd immunity to develop in the wider community was pursued, but the most vulnerable people were not protected. Though harvesting may not have been the government\u2019s intention, it became the de facto policy in the absence of adequate protections for older and vulnerable people. Had the government monitored care homes, supplied adequate PPE, rolled out testing in care homes and reduced the exposure of their residents to visitors and other carers, the islands of vulnerable and elderly people would have been protected. The government\u2019s initial strategy, therefore, was herd immunity and harvesting. Operational implementation follows a strategy, not the other way round. Only belatedly did the government\u2019s strategy morph into one that sought to protect the elderly and reverse the harvesting, through widespread testing and contact tracing. But by then it was too late. Operations could not catch up. In the discipline of public health, we often use what are known as \u201clenses\u201d to explore how health systems function. Lenses are ways of looking at a health system that offers insights into its strengths and its weaknesses. I\u2019ve spent over 30 years analysing the intersection between health systems and infectious diseases in my research. During this time, I\u2019ve drawn upon influenza, Sars, tuberculosis, and HIV to examine health systems\u2019 frailties around the world. Today, if you need a lens to examine any country\u2019s response to coronavirus, look to its nursing homes. To understand the scandal of the UK\u2019s response to Covid-19, consider that it is the most vulnerable people who were sacrificed to an unacceptable, unarticulated strategy. Look to the hidden populations residing in nursing homes, those falling through the gaps between the NHS and the social support function of the state; look at what our government has done in our name, without our agreement.

That was downgraded to a \u201cprogressive\u201d approach, meaning up a bit, in May 2017.

A cut to finance investment in the fast-fibre network should have happened before now.</p> <p>The City, which had expected a light dividend trim rather than a full lockdown crew cut, was appalled. But boldness seems the correct choice. The pandemic has underlined the need for superfast broadband across the nation and BT was horribly exposed to yet another round of political argy-bargy. Best to get ahead of events.</p> <p>The good news for non-shareholders, therefore, is that BT is now equipped to spend big \u2013 or bigger \u2013 on fibre. Jansen has upped his target from 15m to 20m premises by the \u201cmid- to late-2020s\u201d, which represents a commitment of \u00a312bn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/bt-suspends-dividend-to-free-up-5g-broadband-investment-coronavirus\">BT suspends dividend to free up 5G and broadband investment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But shareholders themselves, once they\u2019ve overcome the shock of another downwards lurch in the share price, ought to view the reset positively. Assuming the last pieces of the regulatory fix fall into place, Jansen sees BT making a pre-tax return of 10%-12% on its fibre investment. The return is not without risk, but the terms are decent for infrastructure that could be used for half a century.</p> <p>The shame is that BT\u2019s boardroom was so slow to turn. Blame the old guard \u2013 led by former chairman Sir Mike Rake and former chief Gavin Patterson \u2013 that expended corporate energy fighting Ofcom and politicians over the pace of fibre investment. What was the point? The frustration tactics didn\u2019t work, and the dividend proved unaffordable anyway.</p> <p>An earlier divi sacrifice would not have spared BT shareholders\u2019 pain, obviously, but everybody would have been better off by now. BT\u2019s share price would surely be higher than today\u2019s 10-year low. And the UK\u2019s connectivity would rank higher in international league tables, which is rather more important. A lot of time was wasted on squabbles for no gain.</p> <h2>Virgin-02 strategic merger will not move digital mountains</h2> <p>The planned creation of Virgin-02 probably had zero influence on BT\u2019s investment thinking as the merger has been unveiled only this week. But a bigger rival should usefully intensify competition in future, right?</p> <p>Well, up to a point. The merging duo\u2019s corporate parents \u2013 Liberty Global for Virgin and Telefonica for 02 \u2013 are making a logical strategic move, but their primary motive looks to be financial. The new corporate beast will be saddled with debt on day one, allowing Telefonica to extract \u00a35.7bn in cash and Liberty \u00a31.4bn from the transaction.</p> <p>The joint venture will also be \u201cinvesting \u00a310bn in the UK over the next five years\u201d, announced the owners, which is a handy sum but is also only the aggregate of what Virgin Media and O2 would have been expected to spend anyway.</p> <p>In combination, there\u2019s an opportunity to spend more smartly by marrying 5G and broadband technology and offering consumers an integrated package. Liberty has had success on the continent that way. Yes, it\u2019s possible this is the moment when British punters decide \u201cquad play\u201d is more than marketing spiel.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear, though, a clever financial deal, with Liberty inserting large accumulated UK tax allowances, does not necessarily \u201cchange the digital landscape\u201d, which was the boast. It may do so in time, but no digital mountains have been moved yet.</p> <h2>Next beauty halls mark landlord-tenant power shift</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8792bf448a028bbe3608e361b87e01c0ba63e37e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8792bf448a028bbe3608e361b87e01c0ba63e37e/0_24_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Next is to transform five former Debenhams beauty departments into beauty halls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Next is to transform five former Debenhams beauty departments into beauty halls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s a rare sight: expansion in retail-land.

      "bodyText": "It was only a few years ago that BT\u2019s policy on dividends was to shoot for an increase of 10%, minimum, annually. That was downgraded to a \u201cprogressive\u201d approach, meaning up a bit, in May 2017. Now shareholders\u2019 rations are being suspended and, when a divi returns in the 2021-22 financial year, it\u2019ll be at half the old level. Chairman Jan du Plessis and the new (ish) chief executive, Philip Jansen, offered obligatory apologetic words to investors about a \u201cdifficult\u201d decision, but this was a case of bowing to the inevitable. A cut to finance investment in the fast-fibre network should have happened before now. The City, which had expected a light dividend trim rather than a full lockdown crew cut, was appalled. But boldness seems the correct choice. The pandemic has underlined the need for superfast broadband across the nation and BT was horribly exposed to yet another round of political argy-bargy. Best to get ahead of events. The good news for non-shareholders, therefore, is that BT is now equipped to spend big \u2013 or bigger \u2013 on fibre. Jansen has upped his target from 15m to 20m premises by the \u201cmid- to late-2020s\u201d, which represents a commitment of \u00a312bn. But shareholders themselves, once they\u2019ve overcome the shock of another downwards lurch in the share price, ought to view the reset positively. Assuming the last pieces of the regulatory fix fall into place, Jansen sees BT making a pre-tax return of 10%-12% on its fibre investment. The return is not without risk, but the terms are decent for infrastructure that could be used for half a century. The shame is that BT\u2019s boardroom was so slow to turn. Blame the old guard \u2013 led by former chairman Sir Mike Rake and former chief Gavin Patterson \u2013 that expended corporate energy fighting Ofcom and politicians over the pace of fibre investment. What was the point? The frustration tactics didn\u2019t work, and the dividend proved unaffordable anyway. An earlier divi sacrifice would not have spared BT shareholders\u2019 pain, obviously, but everybody would have been better off by now. BT\u2019s share price would surely be higher than today\u2019s 10-year low. And the UK\u2019s connectivity would rank higher in international league tables, which is rather more important. A lot of time was wasted on squabbles for no gain. Virgin-02 strategic merger will not move digital mountains The planned creation of Virgin-02 probably had zero influence on BT\u2019s investment thinking as the merger has been unveiled only this week. But a bigger rival should usefully intensify competition in future, right? Well, up to a point. The merging duo\u2019s corporate parents \u2013 Liberty Global for Virgin and Telefonica for 02 \u2013 are making a logical strategic move, but their primary motive looks to be financial. The new corporate beast will be saddled with debt on day one, allowing Telefonica to extract \u00a35.7bn in cash and Liberty \u00a31.4bn from the transaction. The joint venture will also be \u201cinvesting \u00a310bn in the UK over the next five years\u201d, announced the owners, which is a handy sum but is also only the aggregate of what Virgin Media and O2 would have been expected to spend anyway. In combination, there\u2019s an opportunity to spend more smartly by marrying 5G and broadband technology and offering consumers an integrated package. Liberty has had success on the continent that way. Yes, it\u2019s possible this is the moment when British punters decide \u201cquad play\u201d is more than marketing spiel. Let\u2019s be clear, though, a clever financial deal, with Liberty inserting large accumulated UK tax allowances, does not necessarily \u201cchange the digital landscape\u201d, which was the boast. It may do so in time, but no digital mountains have been moved yet. Next beauty halls mark landlord-tenant power shift Here\u2019s a rare sight: expansion in retail-land. Next is opening five standalone beauty halls in space that Debenhams vacated this week. It\u2019s an interesting experiment. And, since Next said its leases with the landlord Hammerson are \u201cflexible\u201d, there\u2019s an escape route if things don\u2019t work out as hoped. Therein lies the familiar part. The balance of power between landlord and tenant has shifted. Hammerson gets a new attraction, which will help to generate footfall in important locations like the Bull Ring in Birmingham, but it can\u2019t get the same rental security as in the old days. Needs must.",

      "bodyText": "The highly anticipated defamation trial brought by Victoria Cross recipient Ben Roberts-Smith against the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald will not go ahead next month after the federal court ruled a remote hearing under Covid-19 rules may breach national security. The delay in the case came as justice Anthony Besanko said he had to consider whether to delay the trial despite a submission that Roberts-Smith and his family are suffering from the ongoing publication of articles by the Nine newspapers. Australia\u2019s most decorated living soldier says he has received no speaking requests, was not invited to any Anzac Day events before they were cancelled and has developed severe insomnia and anxiety, Besanko said. Roberts-Smith alleges that Nine newspapers defamed him by suggesting he committed war crimes in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2012. The case was set down for mid-June but physical distancing rules mean it would have to be heard via weblink, which the court heard is not secure enough for closed hearings. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has ordered provisions of the National Security Information Act be applied to the Roberts-Smith case, making the trial impossible to hold via a weblink, Besanko said in a judgement that vacated the court date of 15 June. \u201cIn my opinion, an in-person trial is necessary for two independent reasons,\u201d Besanko said in reasons published on Friday afternoon. \u201cThe first reason is that such a trial is necessary to deal with the issues relating to, or arising from, the disclosure of national security information. \u201cThe second reason is that this is a trial where the credibility or reliability of the key witnesses may well be crucial in circumstances where the alleged imputations arising from the matters complained of are, as I have said, very serious indeed.\u201d Besanko said counsel for the war veteran submitted there should be good reasons for the trial not going ahead because any delay would exacerbate the suffering of Roberts-Smith and his family. The court was told that following a 60 Minutes broadcast and subsequent articles by Nine newspapers in September 2019, \u201cone of the applicant\u2019s daughters was told by another student that \u2018Your dad\u2019s a murderer\u2019\u201d. Counsel for Roberts-Smith alleges that when he was standing outside Channel Seven, where he is an executive, a car pulled up next to him and the driver pointed his fingers in a gun shape at the applicant and made shooting sounds \u2014 \u201cindicating that he was shooting the applicant\u201d. Besanko said the logistical challenges of a six-week trial involving a large number of witnesses and the potential increase in such challenges caused by the application of the National Security Information Act suggested it be postponed. Government solicitors told the court the request for an NSI arose after a subpoena sought documents from the secretary of the department of defence. \u201cThe subpoena identifies a broad range of documents and the commonwealth\u2019s position is that information in the documents relates to matters of \u2018national security\u2019, that is to say, \u2018Australia\u2019s defence, security, international relations or law enforcement interests\u2019 (s 8 of the NSI Act),\u201d Besanko said. \u201cHowever, the commonwealth\u2019s concern does not stop there. Matters disclosed in the outlines of evidence which have been filed and served, and evidence given by witnesses at the trial, both in chief and under cross-examination, may also involve matters of national security.\u201d A case management hearing has been set down for next week.",

And for those of us who grew up with Ty\u2019s voice circling our bedrooms, the shock resonates: this is an artist who touched so many with his humour and sharpness on the mic.</p> <p>While all eyes were on grime in the early 2000s, Ty was charting a journey to a frontier that had yet to be fully explored. In 2001, he released his debut album, Awkward,<em> </em>on Big Dada, one of the few labels that would give a home to UK hip-hop acts such as Roots Manuva, Juice Aleem and Speech Debelle. It was the year of era-defining US albums such as Jay-Z\u2019s The Blueprint and Nas\u2019s Stillmatic, when the mainstream had gone the way of the shiny suit. But across the Atlantic, Ty ushered in the UK\u2019s own hip-hop golden age, leaning towards the genre\u2019s soul, jazz and funk origins.</p> <p>Ty was a bridge. He showed that the divisions between UK hip-hop and the upstart genre, grime, were illusory; his music conjures memories of the Kung Fu club night at Camden\u2019s Underworld, where you\u2019d see grime and hip-hop heads shoulder to shoulder. He understood that many of the young MCs coming up in grime came from the same blocks and streets as the rappers in the hip-hop space. His appearance alongside Skepta and others on the remix of Bashy\u2019s Black Boys showed this; guest spots on other tracks such as Let It Go by Rukus \u2013 which flirts with the borders of grime and hip-hop \u2013 also revealed just how ambidextrous his flow was. By now it was 2007, and fans had firmly drawn lines between UK hip-hop, grime and road rap. But it was evident in Ty\u2019s collaborations that all genres were of the same genealogical tree.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6cad1e18b56f31729b6b059a533f2cc9b4e22692\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cad1e18b56f31729b6b059a533f2cc9b4e22692/0_0_1348_2073/650.jpg\" alt=\"Ty was a bridge between hip-hop and grime.\" width=\"650\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ty was a bridge between hip-hop and grime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, it\u2019s important to acknowledge Ty\u2019s staunch criticism of an industry that has historically failed to give UK hip-hop its proper due. UK hip-hop first made waves in the 80s with the likes of London Posse \u2013 Ty would later work with Posse member Rodney P as part of supergroup Kingdem with Blak Twang \u2013 but it struggled for attention in British media, first amid the Britpop indie boom, then later as grime had the shock of the new. As recently as 2018 Ty was complaining that \u201cour music is considered \u2018unclassic\u2019 by mainstream British culture. It\u2019s considered throwaway and vague.\u201d</p> <p>He also criticised some within the scene, drawing comparisons between more commercial rap music and what he saw as the greater integrity of hip-hop. In 2006 he said the British scene \u201cdeserves the cold shoulder it\u2019s getting because it\u2019s not pushed forward \u2026 what people are doing \u2026 is really rap music, which just focuses on the production of the music. Hip-hop is the whole thing.\u201d He concluded: \u201cI am treated like a little child in the UK because I do hip-hop.\u201d</p> <p>Arguably, though, the scene thrived out of plain sight and remained unadulterated. He could create comedy sketches informed by life experiences we could all relate to, such as on Hercules, about the acute anxieties of the school playground: \u201cBazooka Bubblegum, Space Dust and Wham! / Technicolour bed fluff meant I wasn\u2019t the man / For kiss chase, now that was a real trauma / girls would break down and cry if I caught them in a corner.\u201d Few songs carried depth and potency quite like The Nonsense from Awkward, with its bruised psychedelic soul, or The Willing from his Mercury-nominated second album Upwards, featuring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/01/tony-allen-the-afrobeat-pioneers-10-finest-recordings\">late Tony Allen</a>, who died just last week.</p> <p>For someone like me who grew up second-gen in a Nigerian household, hearing Ty work with someone who could have been his father, or grandfather, spoke to how intergenerational UK hip-hop has always been, and how Ty advocated for that. He founded a hip-hop education programme in the 1990s called Ghetto Grammar, but the work didn\u2019t stop when he signed to Big Dada \u2013 last year he hosted an event, Pass the Torch, a showcase of talent with Ty nourishing the next generation of MCs. On social media there\u2019s been an outpouring of love from artists such as Awate, Children of Zeus and Akala who all saw him as a mentor of sorts \u2013 the tributes pouring in show just how many people Ty poured his wisdom into.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqC2DGfSmaY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pqC2DGfSmaY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>There\u2019s an unsettling irony in Ty receiving so much love and praise in his passing when he was ignored for so long. But it\u2019s clear that, away from the media, he was the soundtrack to a lot of people\u2019s lives in the early 2000s and beyond, and it was the potency and depth in his lyricism and storytelling that drew us closer. Ty\u2019s work showed how much of a fallacy the divides in British rap have been \u2013 we would do well to do as he did and strive for excellence regardless of genre.</p> <p>There is no comparison to him; the old patronising framing of \u201cthe UK version of (insert US name here)\u201d won\u2019t work. Ty\u2019s artistry was unique, bound by his own lived experiences and the way he saw the world, communicated through his gift of repartee and sharpness. When the time comes to weave the tapestry telling UK hip-hop\u2019s whole story, Ty has to be one of the key threads.</p>",

For someone like me who grew up second-gen in a Nigerian household, hearing Ty work with someone who could have been his father, or grandfather, spoke to how intergenerational UK hip-hop has always been, and how Ty advocated for that. He founded a hip-hop education programme in the 1990s called Ghetto Grammar, but the work didn\u2019t stop when he signed to Big Dada \u2013 last year he hosted an event, Pass the Torch, a showcase of talent with Ty nourishing the next generation of MCs. On social media there\u2019s been an outpouring of love from artists such as Awate, Children of Zeus and Akala who all saw him as a mentor of sorts \u2013 the tributes pouring in show just how many people Ty poured his wisdom into. There\u2019s an unsettling irony in Ty receiving so much love and praise in his passing when he was ignored for so long. But it\u2019s clear that, away from the media, he was the soundtrack to a lot of people\u2019s lives in the early 2000s and beyond, and it was the potency and depth in his lyricism and storytelling that drew us closer. Ty\u2019s work showed how much of a fallacy the divides in British rap have been \u2013 we would do well to do as he did and strive for excellence regardless of genre. There is no comparison to him; the old patronising framing of \u201cthe UK version of (insert US name here)\u201d won\u2019t work. Ty\u2019s artistry was unique, bound by his own lived experiences and the way he saw the world, communicated through his gift of repartee and sharpness. When the time comes to weave the tapestry telling UK hip-hop\u2019s whole story, Ty has to be one of the key threads.",

They can\u2019t reach out to their normal support networks, family, friends, etc, because obviously they\u2019re locked down like everyone else.</p> <p>\u201cBut stalking is still going on.

      "bodyText": "Stalking support services and police forces have recorded a surge in perpetrators turning to online tactics to harass their victims during the coronavirus lockdown. Paladin, a national stalking advocacy service, and the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which runs the stalking helpline, reported a surge in cyberstalking involving social media, messaging apps and emails in the first four weeks of the lockdown. But the services and police warned there were still repeated examples of physical stalking despite the Covid-19 restrictions, including a case in which the perpetrator waited outside the victim\u2019s isolating parents\u2019 house when the victim dropped off essential goods. Police forces took part in a nationwide stalking awareness week in April but the chair of Paladin, Rachel Horman, remains critical of the police response to the crime, saying: \u201cThey don\u2019t take it seriously and that\u2019s not changed since the lockdown.\u201d Horman, a solicitor who works on stalking and domestic abuse cases, said Paladin had seen a 40% increase in contacts from victims \u2013 both by phone and email \u2013 since the lockdown was imposed. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s still a problem because they feel more isolated than ever. They can\u2019t reach out to their normal support networks, family, friends, etc, because obviously they\u2019re locked down like everyone else. \u201cBut stalking is still going on. Some people think that they\u2019re safer now because people can\u2019t go out the same. That\u2019s not the case. \u201cThe police unfortunately are still not taking stalking seriously, despite everything they say. The police will look at the incident in isolation without joining the dots together and looking at the whole picture.\u201d The Suzy Lamplugh Trust said nearly 1.5 million people in England and Wales are victims of stalking every year. The trust said there was a drop in contacts to the helpline initially as people adjusted to home isolation, but this has risen \u201cconsiderably\u201d with one caller describing feeling like a \u201csitting duck\u201d. In cases recorded by the trust, stalkers have used the coronavirus as a threat. One person told others that her victim, who ran a cafe, had the virus and did not wash her hands, and another threatening to give their victim the disease. The main stalking behaviours being reported to the helpline during the lockdown were unwanted phone calls, emails and text messages, and contacts over WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, the trust said. Suky Bhaker, the chief executive of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said: \u201cDuring the immensely difficult circumstances that many are experiencing amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, it is essential that victims of stalking are not forgotten and that essential services continue to support them.\u201d One police force, Nottinghamshire, reported a near doubling in stalking reports during the lockdown period, with 46 cases from 23 March to 19 April, compared with 24 cases during the same period last year. Some victims in the force area have been forced to close down their social media accounts after stalkers targeted them \u2013 on average, 100 times before they contacted police. The force has issued two stalking protection orders under the lockdown, with another one in the pipeline against a man in his 30s. Katy Bourne, the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, who was a victim of stalking, called on PCCs, police forces and criminal justice agencies to ensure that, despite the pandemic, they were still putting robust measures in place to keep victims safe. Bourne, the PCC for Sussex, said: \u201cStalkers now have 24 hours in the day, uninterrupted, to obsess over their victims.\u201d A stalking advocacy service in Bourne\u2019s force area, Veritas Justice, reported a 75% increase in cyber and online stalking activity. Bourne added: \u201cThe rise in cyberstalking due to the lockdown concerns me deeply. We know all too well that this behaviour causes extreme distress and can unfortunately escalate quickly. \u201cThe severity of risk to a victim is now defined by the amount of time invested by the perpetrator in their obsession. So, with many victims receiving over 100 text messages, emails, phone calls a day, we know that these strong fixations could have a more sinister outcome.\u201d Bourne said that when lockdown restrictions were eased, reports of physical stalking crimes were likely to rise as victims and their perpetrators have more freedom of movement, and there may be an increase in third-party reporting. Bourne said she was concerned that interim charging protocols for the Crown Prosecution Service did not specify stalking as a priority offence. \u201cWhile not all stalking cases will reach a crisis point, research has proved that early identification of stalking behaviours is ultimately about homicide prevention,\u201d she said. The UK national stalking helpline is on 0808 802 0300.",

Not a bad cameo, from the veteran, then.</p> <p>Jose Morais\u2019 side start their title defence with all three points, although Green Army fans might have liked to have seen a more emphatic scoreline, from a side that dominated both possession and territory.</p> <p>Sixteen shots to five for the home side, eight on target to Suwon\u2019s solitary effort. 59% possession - you\u2019d have to say, that was reasonably emphatic in the end.</p> <p>Suwon for their part started well with Terry Antonis lively in the heart of the Bluewings\u2019 midfield. His senseless straight red card for a rash challenge 75 minutes in ultimately helped cost his side a share of the spoils. In truth though, they never properly came to grips with the slick passing game of Jose Morais\u2019 chargers, did the visitors.</p> <p>Thanks for your company and emails tonight - apologies for those I couldn\u2019t include. We don\u2019t get to cover Korean football every week, but in a football-starved global context it\u2019s great to get a close look at some of the leagues around the world. It\u2019s been a factory line for producing young talent across the decades for the big clubs of England and Germany, but in its own right, the K-League is a very decent league.</p> <p>Jeonbuk Motors clinch it late, their title defence starts with a clean sheet and all three points. Good night!</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eb5481c8f08c0a2409ba1ab\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T11:55:19.739Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: Jeonbuk Motors 1-0 Suwon Bluewings</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 + 4 min: </strong>Ach, and would you believe the set piece doesn\u2019t clear the wall!

      "bodyText": "Lee Dong-Gook - the one-time Middlesborough striker, and legend of Korean football for Jeonbuk and earlier in his career, Pohang - is adjudged man of the match. Not a bad cameo, from the veteran, then. Jose Morais\u2019 side start their title defence with all three points, although Green Army fans might have liked to have seen a more emphatic scoreline, from a side that dominated both possession and territory. Sixteen shots to five for the home side, eight on target to Suwon\u2019s solitary effort. 59% possession - you\u2019d have to say, that was reasonably emphatic in the end. Suwon for their part started well with Terry Antonis lively in the heart of the Bluewings\u2019 midfield. His senseless straight red card for a rash challenge 75 minutes in ultimately helped cost his side a share of the spoils. In truth though, they never properly came to grips with the slick passing game of Jose Morais\u2019 chargers, did the visitors. Thanks for your company and emails tonight - apologies for those I couldn\u2019t include. We don\u2019t get to cover Korean football every week, but in a football-starved global context it\u2019s great to get a close look at some of the leagues around the world. It\u2019s been a factory line for producing young talent across the decades for the big clubs of England and Germany, but in its own right, the K-League is a very decent league. Jeonbuk Motors clinch it late, their title defence starts with a clean sheet and all three points. Good night! 90 + 4 min: Ach, and would you believe the set piece doesn\u2019t clear the wall! What a critical error - and our referee puts the whistle to the lips. It\u2019s the veteran, Lee Dong-Gook - this colossus of Korean football - who fashioned the key decisive moment with a headed goal from Son Jun-Ho\u2019s corner. They\u2019re top of the table, the reigning champions - and they continue their strong run of recent form against old rivals Suwon! 90 + 4 min: They\u2019re old rivals, but it\u2019s not been an especially spiteful contest, that Terry Antonis challenge aside. Suwon chase it here - is this a last chance to flood forward? Jeonbuk funnel back - but they\u2019ve conceded a freekick outside the box for a handball! We have a late, late set piece for Suwon! Does the \u2018keeper come up too? Big final chance for the Bluewings! 90 + 2 min: Kunimoto has looked lively since coming on - what a handy replacement he\u2019s appeared to be after the tricky Murilo went off. Ach, and having won the ball, Suwon have turned it over, can you believe, for a foul throw! Jeonbuk look to head to the corners and eat up valuable seconds. 89 min: Four additional minutes is the equation. Didn\u2019t appear too many stoppages, but there was that two-minute VAR break, I guess. A slimmer of home for Bluewings supporters? They need to get a foot on the ball first, as Jeonbuk play keep-ball around the back - moving from the front-third all the way back to the \u2018keeper. 88 min: A final change for Jeonbuk - but that will have to wait, as the game restarts. Kim Bo-Kyung makes way and Lee Soo-Bin comes on. 86 min: So, it\u2019s Suwon with a mountain to climb late on - and with just ten men! But for all they\u2019ve been on the back foot for large swathes of this second half, just one mistake, one lucky moment and they could be right back in this contest. It\u2019s really starting to teem with rain now - will that aid or hinder the visitors? They move the Canadian, Henry, up front as an auxiliary striker, at least for a set piece to try and chase the contest. 83 min: And there it is! And can you believe it - it\u2019s the 41-year-old veteran who\u2019s fashioned the opener. And that consistent near post policy from the corners finally pays off for the home side! He rose highest, having given the otherwise excellent Henry the slip, Lee Dong-Gook - and that is goal number 225 in the K-League. What a legend of the Korean game. And what a telling contribution this could prove! 83 min: Scrambled away! It\u2019s a desperate last intervention, at the expense of a corner, as Jeonbuk looked to pass that one through the box. Can they finally fashion something from this set piece? 81 min: We enter the final ten, and you have to say - if they hang on for a point here, Suwon, they\u2019ll be buzzing. They make their third change, and it is a defender for an attacker - Min Woo-Kim makes way for Jang Ho-Ik. So that clarifies that little mystery (see last post). 78 min: Another substitute from Suwon, and it\u2019s the skipper Yeom Ki-Hun who trots off for Seok Hee Han to come on. Is that a striker for a midfielder? I don\u2019t imagine the Bluewings are chasing this, so perhaps there will be additional tactical changes elsewhere in their structure to accommodate that. Some more emails coming through - Haram has written in: I\u2019m very excited that the Guardian does this MBM. I missed the first half but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see more exciting stuff in the second half. Jeonbuk Motors is the most successful club in Korean not just in terms of their record but also in terms of their fanbase. They had an average of about 20,000 fans per game last year and they\u2019re based in a city called Jeonju, which has 600,000 people. (Seoul FC comes the close second with a slightly less figure, but Seoul is a city of ten million people. You get the idea.) In any case, thanks for the commentaries. Hope we see the first goal soon! Cheers Haram - well it\u2019s definitely got more exciting now, thanks to that straight red card. Apologies also to my Faeroes-ese (sic?) readers - it\u2019s been drawn to my attention I accidentally wrote Icelandic football earlier! Mi scusi. 75 min - Red card! Ach, that\u2019s a nasty challenge, and it\u2019s the Australian Terry Antonis who is given his marching order for a rash slide that catches his opponent on the calf. And Suwon do shuffle their pack, and it\u2019s bad news for Australian viewers - it\u2019s Adam Taggart who comes off as well. This makes it a little more lively - can the ten-men Suwon hang on? They had red cards in both their ACL matches this season, the cup winners - they\u2019ll need to do it again with ten here. 72 min: Suwon now looking to shuffle their pack - perhaps to arrest the momentum of recent minutes which has been all with Jeonbuk. Subsitute to come shortly. 70 min: It\u2019s Jeonbuk still probing and testing, but for all their possession and territorial dominance they\u2019re yet to really open up this Suwon defence, which is now very much defending with a block of five. 68 min: There\u2019s some noise around the stadium - there are, as we said no fans in presence, so not sure if that\u2019s coming from outside the grounds or is being pipped in artificially. I imagine it\u2019s not the motley crew of gathered international journalists responsible for it. 64 min: This is turning into quite a sustained period of pressure for the home side, Jeonbuk, as they earn another corner. We\u2019ve got rain starting to fall in Jeonju, and again it\u2019s a fast whipped ball close to the \u2018keeper, who gets a strong fist away. They might need to try some variation at some stage, Jeonbuk. We\u2019ll see. 63 min: Jeonbuk with the corner, and again it\u2019s a punch clear from No Dong-Geon in the Suwon goal. He\u2019s been tested a few times from the set piece, perhaps a plan from the home coaching staff, but so far has stood up well to the inquisition. 62 min: An early sighter for Lee Dong-Gook. He\u2019s 41, the striker with over 100 caps for Korea and approaching 350 games for Jeonbuk. What a legend of Korean football - and that could have been some impact if he\u2019d been able to get a forehead on that clever lofted cross to the far post. 59 min: It\u2019s a long lofted ball into the box for Suwon, but Henry can\u2019t find a teammate in blue. He then does some good work defensively to deny Murilo. Jose Morais says he\u2019s seen enough, and Jeonbuk look ready to prepare a double substitute, as we approach the hour mark. It\u2019s the veteran Lee Dong-Gook who replaces Cho Kyu-Song, and the Japanese youngster Kunimoto who comes on for Murilo. 56 min: It was billed as a 3-4-3 pre-game, but Suwon are starting to revert to what looks decidedly like a 5-3-2, with the two wing backs dropping deeper and Kim Min-Woo sliding back into midfield. You\u2019d suggest that will only invite further pressure for the visitors - let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t set out the defensive stall too early, for the spectacle\u2019s sake alone. 55 min: Jeonbuk looking to overcome that non-penalty award setback immediately, as Murilo sends in a tantalising ball from a freekick. It only just evades the outstretched forehead of a teammate - that was a wicked curling effort, and the Suwon defence was really scrambling! 53 min: And it\u2019s no penalty! Well, love that from a neutral\u2019s perspective - in the A-League they\u2019d give a penalty just because they\u2019ve wasted everyone\u2019s time for two minutes and probably feel they should justify the break. But he took several looks at the that, Kim Woo-Seong, and said - no dice, game on! 51 min: A clever ball into the box for Jeonbuk, and we have a break in play as referee Kim Woo-Seong heads to the sideline to take a look at the VAR. Do we have a penalty! The ball bobbled between the bodies of two Suwon defenders, and appears to strike the hand of Doneil Henry - but does that meet whatever the present criteria for handball are? 48 min: A better start this half from Suwon who fire off the first shot in anger. Jeonbuk enjoyed 56% of the first half possession and dominated in terms of chances created, but it\u2019s fair to say no glaring chances went begging for either side. Second half! 45 min: And like Michael Finnegan, we begin again - just a handful of peanuts and some dutch salted liquorice for your humble scribe. No immediate signs of any half-time substitutes, but we\u2019ll bring you that information if it arises. An email in from Ravikiran: Hey Richard. It\u2019s been so long since football that I\u2019ve seriously decided to start following any active league that plays. Which K-League team should I be supporting? I support Liverpool if it helps to narrow things down.. Ha, I know the feeling. It\u2019s a good question - open to suggestions from those more in the know, but I\u2019d lean Seongnam for you, Ravikiran? On the basis that they were powerhouses 20 years ago but haven\u2019t won a title recently.. although by that basis, it\u2019s been 12 years since Suwon added to their four K-League crowns, so they could be your team, at least for this fixture. One of the more fun things I\u2019ve seen to help interested onlookers decide their new side was this from football in the Faeroes Islands: Although remember, a puppy isn\u2019t just for Christmas. I can\u2019t believe I went and got this Sk\u00e1la \u00cdtr\u00f3ttarfelag tattoo, in retrospect. So - your thoughts on that first 45? K-League aficinados, was this a fair indication of Korean football? Or are both sides still showing slight sluggishness after nearly half a year away from the bright lights of domestic competition? Jeonbuk for their part are looking the side more likely, but they\u2019ll be wary of the fact that last season\u2019s golden boot winner, Adam Taggart, has shown some sharp contributions - especially in combination with fellow Australian Terry Antonis. 45 + 2 min: Ooph! It\u2019s a fine save! He needed to be sharp, No Dong-Geon, but he got his body behind that flicked effort, that came through a host of bodies at the near post. And that\u2019s all we have for the opening stanza! A dramatic finish, and you\u2019ll fancy the visitors will be the more relieved party. Fifteen minutes to regather, and revisit their tactics for the second stanza. 45 min: A heavy challenge sees a free kick for Jeonbuk, as the fourth official indicates two additional minutes will be played. This time it\u2019s Jeonbuk building down the right, before they switch flanks in search of Murilo. They earn a corner, off the header of Doneil Henry. Can they cap the half with a goal? 43 min: Jeonbuk very much dictating proceedings in the shadow of half-time, as Lee Seung-Gi looks to wriggle free inside the box, but on this occasion his effort is a little more tame. Suwon will be looking for the half-time whistle, you\u2019d imagine. They\u2019re not being overrun, but it would be their coaching staff that are slightly more nervous in these sometimes game-defining minutes. 40 min: Patient stuff at the back from Jeonbuk once again before they fire a more direct pass forward, which falls kindly for Cho. Lee Seung-Gi then fires an effort goalwards - ooph! That\u2019s only just wide of the upright - that\u2019s a fine strike, from 25m out, and he had No Dong-Geon really scrambling. 38 min: Freekick to Jeonbuk, about 30m out. It\u2019s Son Jun-Ho with the long ranger blaster, but it clatters into the four-man wall! A good little patch of pressure this, for the home side, but we remain locked nil-nil. 36 min: Clever touch from Taggart releases a teammate but Jeonbuk snuff out the move. It\u2019s the tricky feet of Murilo again probing and testing the right-side of Suwon\u2019s defence, before Kim Bo-Kyung fashions a shot, that\u2019s deflected behind for a corner! They don\u2019t make the most of the chance, and the \u2018keeper comfortably comes and claims the set piece opportunity. 33 min: A nice switch sends Suwon\u2019s left wing back scampering forward, but Jeonbuk shuffle and reorganise. They\u2019re forced to clear long to prevent Antonis from getting on the ball in a dangerous part of the pitch, and Suwon build again from the back. 31 min: Han Kyo-Won with a shot! But it\u2019s brought back for offside, replays suggest correctly. It was a clever darting run from midfield to open the Suwon defence, but just marginally mistimed. Still, a warning sign from the home side. 28 min: The Canadian, Henry, goes through his opponent, Cho Kyu-Song, but the referee doesn\u2019t deem it a foul. Before Murilo tries to jink past one or two defenders near the edge of the box. Lovely feet from the Brazilian but he blazes his final effort high and wide! 25 min: Suwon forced to clear their lines once again. Jeonbuk are starting to harry and hurry their opponents in the centre of the park, their five-man midfield enjoying the edge on Suwon\u2019s nominal four-man line up. 23 min: A nice passage of play from Jeonbuk who thread their passes patiently, before drawing a throw in deep near the corner flag. They\u2019re enjoying the larger portion of the early territory, the home side. Can they make that pay early on? 21 min: A nice cut and thrust starting to develop now, as both sides look to break quickly in transition and catch their opponents. A first corner to Jeonbuk but it\u2019s headed clear at the near post by the Suwon defence. 18 min: Suwon with another chance to hit on the counter, but they can\u2019t make their passes stick and Jeonbuk stream forward in turn. It ends in a hopeful effort from Son Jun-Ho. And at the other end a first real chance! Fine hands from the \u2018keeper who gets down well to block Taggart\u2019s goalbound effort. Replays suggest he may have been in an offside position, the Australian striker, but it was nevertheless sharp goalkeeping from Sung Bum-Keun. 15 min: A shot of South Korean coach Paulo Bento up in the stands, watching on. Three\u2019s definitely a Portuguese flavour overhanging this match, with Jose Morais - the only foreign manager in the K-League this season - also leaving an impact on Korean football, winning his first domestic title with Jeonbuk. 14 min: Another early sighter for Jeonbuk - both sides appear content to slowly adjust the shooting radars, but again, no huge concern between the posts for Dong-geon. 12 min: A second booking! Jeonbuk\u2019s right back Lee Yong goes in the book for attempting to pull back his opposite number who had open pastures in which to run. It\u2019s been a little stop-start so far - let\u2019s hope the whistle doesn\u2019t dominate the early proceedings as both sides find their match fitness once again. 9 min: Suwon with a good chance to counter, but the ball in looking for Taggart is overhit and forces the striker wide. He then concedes the freekick with a raised boot in a challenge on Jeonbuk\u2019s Choi Bo-Kyung. And it\u2019s earned Taggart a yellow card! He was unsure pre-game about the \u201ctalking to officials\u201d rule, we can confirm, that caution was for the challenge alone. 8 min: Suwon\u2019s Canadian centre half Doneil Henry wins a freekick. He was fortunate there perhaps, he almost look to have lost possession in a dangerous area, but the whistle saves his blushes. 5 min: An early touch for Taggart, last season\u2019s K-League golden boot winner, who drops deep to collect, but both sides are guilty of giving away early possession. A few rusty touches as you can well imagine after a five-and-a-half month hiatus from league football. Taggart fires off a first effort for Suwon - it\u2019s a worm-burner from the left foot on the pivot from outside the box, but it rolls harmlessly wide of Song\u2019s left-hand upright. 3 min: Jeonbuk looking to build some early sustained possession, and it\u2019s the Brazilian, Murilo, who cuts in onto his right foot - his non-preferred foot - but his shot does not overly concern the Suwon \u2018keeper. He\u2019s the only foreign player starting for Jeonbuk with Japan\u2019s Kunimoto left on the bench. Two Australians and a Canadian start for Suwon. 1 min: And we\u2019re away! It\u2019s a new K-League season, but have we ever seen such internation interest in Korean football? The home side playing left to right in a fetching \u201cyellow highlighter\u201d trikot, Suwon, right to left in their customary all blue kit. The big match news is that Jeonbuk\u2019s star Eredivisie recruit, the South African striker Lars Veldwijk has pulled up short, fitness wise, and will not lead the line for Jose Morais\u2019 team. Both these clubs have experienced an indifferent start to their respective Asian Champions League campaigns. Suwon lost to a 90th minute winner away to Andres Iniesta\u2019s Vissel Kobe, before a shock loss on the road to Malaysia\u2019s Johor. Jeonbuk lost 2-1 at home to Ange Postecoglou\u2019s J-League champions, Yokohama F. Marinos, before salvaging a last-ditch draw on the road to the reigning A-League champions Sydney FC, 2-2. It\u2019s three years since the Suwon Bluewings beat their hosts today on their own patch - the World Cup stadium in Jeonju. It\u2019s capacity 42,000 but without fans today. A smattering of the world\u2019s press have been allowed in; everyone inside the stadium is wearing PPE equipment such as masks. History is very much with Jeonbuk who boast 20 wins to Suwon\u2019s seven historically, and they\u2019ve had the wood on their opponents recently. As we know though, this is a completely different reality now, and whoever has been able to keep their preparations as unaffected as possible could have the edge, especially in terms of fitness. Without further ado, to our team lists for tonight: Jeonbuk Motors: (4-1-4-1) Sung Bum-Keun; Lee Yong, Hong Jeong-Ho, Choi Bo-Kyung, Kim Jin-Su; Son Jun-Ho; Han Kyo-Won, Kim Bo-Kyung, Lee Sueng-Gi, Murilo; Cho Kyu-Song Bench: Lee Bom-Yong, Jyung Hyok, T Kunimoto, Lee Dong-Gook, Choi Chul-Soon, Lee Soo-Bun Suwon Bluewings: (3-4-3) No Dong-Geon; Park Dae-Won, Doneil Henry, Lee Jong-Sung; Myeong Jun-Jae, Ko Seong-Beom, Terry Antonis, Hong Chul; Kim Min-Woo, Adam Taggart, Yeom Ki-Hun Bench: Yang Hyung-Mo, Sulejman Krpic, Han Eiu-Kwon, Han Seok-Hee, Lee Sang-Hyun, Lee Pyong-Yee, Jang Ho-Ik So - what does football in the post Covid-19 world look like? No fans in the stadium is the obvious first point, but in addition to this we\u2019ll have no handshakes, conversation between players and officials will be restricted, and coaches will have to wear face masks. A setback for sideline ranters, therefore - hopefully we\u2019ll see more comedic mime antic from the coaching boxes. Players have also been advised \u201cexcessive spitting or blowing of the nose is prohibited\u201d. The Korean equivalents of Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse be warned. There\u2019s some confusion on the talking restrictions, as Adam Taggart told the BBC last week. \u201cWe are still waiting to get a full explanation on that. I do not speak Korean, you can still communicate with your teammates so I don\u2019t really understand if we are going to get punished if we do talk [to officials]. You can just imagine there will be red cards left, right and centre if people are going to get punished for talking.\u201d Let\u2019s hope not. Although fans of various iterations of \u201cfast soccer\u201d might go in for a full-field 7 v 7 style demonstration. Ahead of this week\u2019s round of games all 1100 players and staff in the K-League were tested and cleared for Covid-19. It\u2019s a remarkable statistic compared to what\u2019s happening in other countries around the world presently - let\u2019s hope it stays that way. For more on this historic fixture, here\u2019s our eyes in the region John Duerden\u2019s match preview: Hi all! Richard Parkin in the chair, and delighted to be here as well. It\u2019s been a seemingly interminable wait since we last had live football, and I for one am loving the chance to get a close-up look at the South Korean game. Australian followers know these clubs reasonably well from Asian Champions League clashes across the years (and some of the players from national team age-level humiliations across the years), but for many international readers this could be their first K-League game. We\u2019ll try to do it justice. If you\u2019re a passionate aficionado of the #KLeague don\u2019t hestitate to share the wealth of your insights with us - join the conversation via email or twitter. We\u2019d love to hear predictions, fun facts, general observations. Football is back! With the utmost respect to Torpedo Zhodino and fans of the Belarus Premier League, of course (Nicaragua, Burundi etc) - but with the start of the K-League, it\u2019s the first, arguably, top-tier league back in action across the planet. South Korea\u2019s swift state-orchestrated response to the coronavirus has reaped dividends in that its people can enjoy live football once again. Not from the terraces, of course, but hey, you can\u2019t have it all. The K-League was meant to start in February, so many of these players will have endured an impatient off-season akin to the A-League\u2019s fabled five-month preparation. They\u2019ll be raring to go, you\u2019d imagine, although two Australians who will be used to months of hill sprints are Suwon\u2019s Adam Taggart and Terry Antonis, presumably in action tonight. What better way to kick things off then two powerhouses of the Korean game: reigning champions Jeonbuk Motors v cup winners Suwon Bluewings. So put the kettle on, dust off the non-football sound cancelling headphones, and plump the ottoman: it\u2019s footer time.",

The second phase suggests reintroducing charter boat and competition fishing \u2013 but only if guidelines can be followed. The final phase would involve a fuller resumption of the sport, again respecting any restrictions.</p> <p>The industry says fishing contributes around \u00a34bn annually to the UK economy, supporting more than 40,000 jobs.

      "bodyText": "Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the lockdown to be eased for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced. Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses. They also warn that the disappearance from the countryside of sportspeople during lockdown is leading to a rise in rural crime and having a negative impact on conservation. Meanwhile, greens are being lovingly prepared and committee members thinking about ways of operating in a post-lockdown world as the sport of bowls makes tentative preparations for a comeback. Martin Salter, the head of policy at the Angling Trust, said fishing had been \u201cincredibly responsible\u201d in persuading the UK\u2019s many hundreds of thousands of anglers to stay away from the water during lockdown. But he said: \u201cI think we have a compelling case now for us to be at the very front of the queue when the government and its advisers decide the time is right to begin ratcheting back the restrictions.\u201d The Angling Trust has submitted a three-phase plan called When We Fish Again to the government spelling out how it believes fishing could return safely. Phase one would include angling being undertaken on a solitary basis close to home. The second phase suggests reintroducing charter boat and competition fishing \u2013 but only if guidelines can be followed. The final phase would involve a fuller resumption of the sport, again respecting any restrictions. The industry says fishing contributes around \u00a34bn annually to the UK economy, supporting more than 40,000 jobs. There have been dire warnings that businesses will go under and jobs lost if the sport does not resume soon. Across the country\u2019s waterways, there have been reports of increases in vandalism and poaching. Danny Fairbrass, whose company runs 25 lakes, said: \u201cAlmost every one has been vandalised or fished illegally during lockdown. With fishing safely re-introduced this would eradicate all of these issues overnight.\u201d Meanwhile, country estates are planning to reduce the number of days they organise when the grouse, partridge and pheasant seasons begin later this year. Jon Fuller, the head keeper at an estate in Shropshire that runs pheasant and partridge shoots in the autumn, said it was planning to press ahead with 60% of its normal activities. \u201cIt\u2019s very uncertain times.\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that we will be able to do some shooting but we can\u2019t say for certain how much. We\u2019ve got to scale back a bit.\u201d Like the Angling Trust, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) is drawing up plans for how game shoots later this year can be carried out if physical distancing rules remain in place. BASC says that shooting contributes \u00a32bn into the UK economy annually and provides the equivalent of 74,000 full-time jobs. In the world of bowls, many players and some administrators are arguing that the nature of their sport means the comforting clack of bowl on bowl may be heard in sunlit parks by mid-summer. \u201cWe tick the box for non-contact and we play outdoors,\u201d said Alistair Hollis, the operational services manager at Bowls England. \u201cWith a degree of initiative and innovation, social distancing shouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem.\u201d In normal times as many as 48 people routinely play on one green but Hollis said the number would almost certainly have to be severely restricted with perhaps just one-on-one or pair games played rather than team versions. Appointment systems and time restrictions may have to be introduced and rules on not sharing equipment brought in. \u201cOne of our biggest selling points is that we are a family sport that can be played by all ages together,\u201d said Hollis. \u201cIf the same households are allowed to play something together, our sport may fit the bill.

The latest jobs losses are the worst monthly figure on record. The closest comparison came in 1933 when unemployment hit an estimated 25% but that was before the government began publishing official statistics.</p> <p>The previous peak for unemployment was 10.8% in 1982 and the largest monthly job loss, close to 2million, came in September 1945 at the end of the second world war, when the country was demobilizing. April\u2019s job losses also easily eclipsed the 800,000 jobs lost in March 2009, the height of the last recession.</p> <p>The job losses swept across the economy, hitting all industries. Leisure and hospitality lost 7.7m jobs as the sector was hit hard by quarantine measures. But 2.5m jobs were also lost in education and health services, where dentist offices shed 503,000 people. Retail lost 2.1m jobs and manufacturing employment dropped by 1.3m.</p> <p>Unemployment for African Americans soared from 6.7% last month to 16.7%, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">wiping out all of the gains</a> made since the last recession. For white Americans unemployment also rose sharply, from 4% to 14.2%. Some 6 million people dropped out of the labor force during the month \u2013 meaning they stopped looking for work.</p> <p>The labor force participation rate \u2013 which measures the percentage of the population working or looking for work \u2013 dropped 2.5% over the month to 60.2%, the lowest rate since January 1973.</p> <p>\u201cThese are truly mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.\u201d</p> <p>The figures probably undercount the true impact of the outbreak as state unemployment offices have been overwhelmed and millions have yet to have their benefit claims accepted.</p> <p>\u201cThe employment situation report confirms what we already know about the economy. Regardless of the official number, we know that one in five workers filed for unemployment insurance. This is a staggering,\u201d said Reed.</p> <p>Friday\u2019s report follows the news on Thursday that another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/07/us-unemployment-jobless-coronavirus-economy\">3.2 million Americans</a> filed for unemployment benefits last week. The number of filings has been declining on a weekly basis but remains at a historically high level. More than 33 million people have filed claims in the last seven weeks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/florida-unemployment-system-coronavirus-applications\">\u2018Designed for us to fail\u2019: Floridians upset as unemployment system melts down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>States including California, Ohio and Washington are weeks away from running out of funds to pay claims.</p> <p>Washington state said it approved Ivan Schierling\u2019s unemployment benefits on 27 March, but seven weeks later, he still hasn\u2019t received a payment.

The Department of Labor announced Friday that the US unemployment rate rose to 14.7% from just 4.4% in March and a near 50-year low of 3.5% in February before the US was hit by the virus. A decade\u2019s worth of job gains have now been wiped out in under two months. The latest jobs losses are the worst monthly figure on record. The closest comparison came in 1933 when unemployment hit an estimated 25% but that was before the government began publishing official statistics. The previous peak for unemployment was 10.8% in 1982 and the largest monthly job loss, close to 2million, came in September 1945 at the end of the second world war, when the country was demobilizing. April\u2019s job losses also easily eclipsed the 800,000 jobs lost in March 2009, the height of the last recession. The job losses swept across the economy, hitting all industries. Leisure and hospitality lost 7.7m jobs as the sector was hit hard by quarantine measures. But 2.5m jobs were also lost in education and health services, where dentist offices shed 503,000 people. Retail lost 2.1m jobs and manufacturing employment dropped by 1.3m. Unemployment for African Americans soared from 6.7% last month to 16.7%, wiping out all of the gains made since the last recession. For white Americans unemployment also rose sharply, from 4% to 14.2%. Some 6 million people dropped out of the labor force during the month \u2013 meaning they stopped looking for work. The labor force participation rate \u2013 which measures the percentage of the population working or looking for work \u2013 dropped 2.5% over the month to 60.2%, the lowest rate since January 1973. \u201cThese are truly mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.\u201d The figures probably undercount the true impact of the outbreak as state unemployment offices have been overwhelmed and millions have yet to have their benefit claims accepted. \u201cThe employment situation report confirms what we already know about the economy. Regardless of the official number, we know that one in five workers filed for unemployment insurance. This is a staggering,\u201d said Reed. Friday\u2019s report follows the news on Thursday that another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week. The number of filings has been declining on a weekly basis but remains at a historically high level. More than 33 million people have filed claims in the last seven weeks. States including California, Ohio and Washington are weeks away from running out of funds to pay claims. Washington state said it approved Ivan Schierling\u2019s unemployment benefits on 27 March, but seven weeks later, he still hasn\u2019t received a payment. In the meantime, bills are piling up for his credit card, healthcare and car payments. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t include just paying to live,\u201d Schierling, 34, said. \u201cI can\u2019t pay for my milk or for gas to get around. I\u2019m kind of frozen.\u201d A $1,200 government stimulus check immediately went to paying off bills and his former employer doesn\u2019t know when they will be able to hire people back. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do, I\u2019m just sitting, slowly running out of cash,\u201d Schierling said.",

      "bodyText": "Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However, large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out. Several SPI\u2013B members told the Guardian that the redacted portions of the document contained criticisms they had made of potential government policies they had been formally asked to consider in late March and early April. One SPI-B adviser said: \u201cIt is bloody silly, and completely counterproductive.\u201d A second committee member said: \u201cThe impression I\u2019m getting is this government doesn\u2019t want any criticism.\u201d On Friday afternoon, after the Guardian revealed frustrations over the redacted report, another member of the government\u2019s advisory committee took to Twitter to complain of what he said was \u201cStalinist\u201d censorship. \u201cPersonally, I am more bemused than furious,\u201d said Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews. \u201cThe greatest asset we have in this crisis is the trust and adherence of the public. You want trust? You need to be open with people. This isn\u2019t open. It is reminiscent of Stalinist Russia. Not a good look.\u201d Members of the committee have been discussing among themselves how best to respond to the redaction, which they believe was a heavy-handed move that jeopardises their independence. At least one scientific adviser is understood to be considering resigning over the government\u2019s secretive approach to science around the Covid-19 outbreak, which they believe is undermining public trust. The report, from 1 April, summarised SPI-B\u2019s discussions about how to handle possible changes to the social distancing measures that had just been introduced to slow the spread of Covid-19. In the version published on Sage\u2019s government website, almost a page and a half of text was heavily redacted.

A third proposal involved requiring people to self-validate their movements, as was occurring in France, where citizens were required to complete permits before leaving home. Experts on SPI-B, which includes professors in psychology, epidemiology and anthropology, said they felt the proposals were too punitive and more likely to result in unfair treatment among people in deprived economic circumstances.

The family rushed to see him but had only a brief opportunity to talk to him at court as he was jailed for trespassing and for Facebook posts that fell foul of Bangladesh\u2019s \u201chighly repressive\u201d internet law. \u201cHe was scared, he was worried, he was crying and breaking down every one or two sentences,\u201d said Kajol\u2019s son, Monorom Polok. Amnesty International has said Kajol faces seven years in prison under the digital security act and his family has begged authorities to release him to protect him from the threat of Covid-19 inside Bangladesh\u2019s crowded prisons. \u201cWe cannot go to sleep, we cannot eat because he\u2019s vulnerable,\u201d said Polok, who said the family are worried as they still do not know where his father was during those two months and whether he may have caught the coronavirus. \u201cMy father is not a criminal, he has only been charged and none of these charges are violent crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know in the crowded prisons of Bangladesh how long he can stay away from coronavirus.\u201d Rights groups suggested Kajol may have been forcibly disappeared on 10 March, a day after the case was filed against him by a ruling party politician for sharing a Facebook that \u201ccould deteriorate law and order\u201d. CCTV footage released by his family showed three men apparently tampering with Kajol\u2019s motorbike before he vanished. Amnesty said his arrest followed posts he wrote criticising an alleged sex-trafficking ring run by an official in the ruling Awami League.

But with a national test and trace strategy yet to be deployed \u2013 including a contact tracing phone app still under development \u2013 the unions\u2019 tests are unlikely to be satisfied by the 1 June date for reopening put forward by Downing Street sources last weekend. A track and trace pilot scheme began on the Isle of Wight, population 140,000, this week. The unions\u2019 position comes as the government in Westminster meets to discuss the UK\u2019s coronavirus lockdown ahead of an announcement by Boris Johnson set for Sunday evening. \u201cParents and staff need full confidence that schools will be safe before any pupils return.

There were earlier reports that officials in Northern Ireland were unlikely to reopen schools before September, because of reluctance among parents. The NASUWT teaching union has already called for schools to remain closed until the end of the summer holidays, while the National Association of Head Teachers said it is \u201cclear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school\u201d. UK schools have been closed since mid-March to all but the children of critical workers and those classed as vulnerable. Only a small number of those pupils have been attending, with the bulk of learning taking place at home and online. Reopening is considered necessary to allow parents to return to work and restart the economy.",

But before the new Covid-19 contact-tracing app is rolled out across the UK this month, it must pass a pilot on the Isle of Wight where it appears to have got off to a bumpy start \u2013 with emerging signs of a generational divide.</p> \n<p>Although most locals told the Guardian they were broadly supportive of the idea, questions have been raised about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/critical-mass-of-android-users-needed-for-success-of-nhs-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app\">glitches</a> on some phones and the potential lack of takeup among the island\u2019s older, less tech-savvy residents.</p> \n<p>And just as the NHS app was unveiled to the island on Thursday morning, it was dealt a further blow when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/uk-coronavirus-contract-tracing-app-could-fall-foul-of-privacy-law-government-told\">parliamentary committee warned</a> it must not be released in its current form without increased privacy and data protections.

      "bodyText": "It has been billed as key to getting Britain back on its feet to help navigate a future way of life post-lockdown. But before the new Covid-19 contact-tracing app is rolled out across the UK this month, it must pass a pilot on the Isle of Wight where it appears to have got off to a bumpy start \u2013 with emerging signs of a generational divide. Although most locals told the Guardian they were broadly supportive of the idea, questions have been raised about glitches on some phones and the potential lack of takeup among the island\u2019s older, less tech-savvy residents. And just as the NHS app was unveiled to the island on Thursday morning, it was dealt a further blow when a parliamentary committee warned it must not be released in its current form without increased privacy and data protections. Meanwhile, it emerged that Downing Street was leaving open the prospect of ditching the app entirely and instead opting for a \u201cdecentralised\u201d model favoured by Apple and Google. By late morning on Thursday, 33,000 of the Isle of Wight\u2019s 140,000 residents were undeterred and had downloaded it, with 28 logging symptoms, the local Tory MP Bob Seely said. (Key workers had access to the app earlier in the week.) Later in the day, downloads topped 40,000.

The government is aiming for 60% of the population to download the app for it to work effectively.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Rohingya Muslims, including children, have arrived at \u201ca de facto detention island\u201d in Bangladesh after being stranded at sea for weeks. Rights groups had warned that the refugees, who had been turned away from other countries in the region, were at risk of starvation and abuse by people traffickers. It is believed that other boats remain adrift. Bangladesh confirmed on Thursday that a boat carrying 280 people was being towed to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited silt island off the southern coast. The country\u2019s foreign minister, Abdul Momen, had earlier said that refugees rescued at sea would be sent to the island to prevent any risk of spreading the coronavirus to the sprawling camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where a million Rohingya live in cramped conditions. Bangladesh, which has struggled to cope with the camps, planned to start moving refugees to Bhasan Char last December, and has built rows of concrete barracks to house about 100,000 people. The relocation was put on hold following an outcry from Rohingya community leaders and international agencies. Human rights groups say the island, which can be reached only by a three-hour boat journey, has no access to basic services and is vulnerable to sea-level rise and storm surges. Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch\u2019s Asia division, said there was no need to send refugees to the island to be quarantined because the UN\u2019s refugee agency and other bodies had facilities set up for this purpose in Cox\u2019s Bazar. Instead, families should be reunited with missing relatives as quickly as possible. \u201cWhile everyone is appreciative that Bangladesh has brought forsaken Rohingya boats ashore, arbitrarily branding the passengers as \u2018new arrivals\u2019 and packing them off to a de facto detention island like Bhasan Char is not a rights respecting solution,\u201d he said. Many of the people on board are refugees who had been living in Cox\u2019s Bazar but who attempted to flee in search of a better life in Malaysia. \u201cThe Rohingya have repeatedly stated they do not want to be moved to Bahsan Char, but that is precisely what the Bangladesh government is forcing this group to do,\u201d Robertson said. Serazul Hoque said he believed his 14-year-old nephew, who had been missing for more than 50 days, is among those taken to Bhasan Char. Traffickers had told the family to pay a ransom to secure Nur Kamaal\u2019s release, but he called on Wednesday to say the Bangladeshi navy had stopped his boat and that all people on board were being taken to a different location. The family later heard news reports that refugees from the boat were being taken to Bhasan Char, but have not been able to confirm that Kamaal is among them. \u201cWe are worried about conditions there and how good the healthcare is,\u201d Hoque said. \u201cIf he comes back to his mother then his mother can take care of him \u2026 She is worrying for her son. She is crying.\u201d Sirajul Mostofa, the chairman of Rohingya Refugee Committee, said he was in contact with other families whose children had been taken to Bhasan Char. He said he hoped the government would reunite them with their families after the quarantine period. Mostofa said there were no words to describe the conditions on the boats, but that people risk the journey because there is no alternative. \u201cThey have no future [in refugee camps in Bangladesh], they cannot see any proper solution at all.\u201d It is not clear how many more boats are still at sea, but Bangladesh\u2019s navy and coast guard is on alert for others in the country\u2019s waters. The Bangladeshi authorities rescued a separate ship last month, allowing about 400 emaciated people, mostly teenagers, to come ashore after spending two months at sea. More than 70 people may have died on the boat, it has been reported, but no official death toll has been announced.",

Sturgeon said the rate of transmission of the coronavirus \u2013 the so-called \u2018R\u2019 number \u2013 is currently between 0.7 and 1 in Scotland, but closer to 1 than 0.7.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Drakeford said the \u2018R\u2019 number was believed to be 0.8 in Wales.

The more we talk the more we understand each other.\u201d Drakeford denied the changes he announced risked sending out mixed messages. \u201cFor most people in Wales, staying at home remains the right thing to do,\u201d he said. He called on people not to travel to beaches or beauty spots over the bank holiday weekend. \u201cI want to make it very clear Wales remains in lockdown. Nothing has changed. A journey to the beach or mountains is not essential travel. The police are ready and will stop people. People will be sent home.\u201d",

There are already efforts in the UK and the US to pave the way for challenge trials, including testing dose escalation in animal studies. However, Eyal argues these efforts need to move more urgently. \u201cBecause of the enormous public health burden that Covid is expected to have \u2026 we don\u2019t want to be in a situation where we decide we want to [pursue challenge studies] but then have to wait three months resulting in an inordinate loss of human life,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>This weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/solemnity-celebration-britain-tribute-war-ve-day\">marks 75 years since the end of the second world war in Europe</a>, and 70 years since the foundations were established of what became the European Union. With the continent facing its biggest challenge since 1945, do the lessons of the war and its aftermath have any resonance for young people? Millennials from around Europe share some of their thoughts and fears.</p> <h2>We are forgetting the lessons of 1945</h2> <p>\u201cAt times of crisis, populism, racism, xenophobia and fascism rise. After the coronavirus economic crisis really hits, we will witness an unbearable climate of pro-nationalist sentiment. In a world of global challenges nations are the wrong scale to solve those problems.\u201d<br><strong>Isabel, scientist, 32, Spain</strong></p> <h2>We thought war had gone the way of the guillotine</h2> <p>\u201cThe fraying of the European project recently has made the second world war suddenly more relevant. For a long time we thought the continent\u2019s bloody divisions were consigned to the past along with slavery or the guillotine. Now it feels like Europe\u2019s tormented history was merely suspended for a few decades. I\u2019m not frightened of a return to armed conflict, but the potential of destructive disunity feels very real. I have no sentimentality for VE Day but I do think that it should be commemorated.\u201d<br><strong>Aleks, 20s, Serbian, living in the UK</strong></p> <h2><strong>As a </strong>German<strong>, people backing the far right feels very scary</strong></h2> <p>\u201cOf course there are lessons for my generation from the second world war. I grew up in Germany after all, and what thoughts of racial elitism can do was shockingly impressed on me. How people are turning back to far-right groups all over Europe is very scary.\u201d<br><strong>Sophia, 22, Brandenburg, Germany</strong></p> <h2>It was hell, not our finest hour</h2> <p>\u201cI am sick of hearing about the war. The allies committed atrocities, war brings out the worst in all people. My friend\u2019s grandad took part in the D-day landings. He said they hit the legs of the soldiers to get them out on the beaches, they were not brave or heroic willingly and they all shit themselves literally. It was hell, not our finest hour. The lesson to learn is no one should think they are better than anyone else and that peace is the most valuable thing we can possibly have.\u201d<br><strong>Jennifer, 35, London</strong></p> <h2><strong>I live in fear of another war</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI feel like it\u2019s our moral responsibility to not let history repeat itself. I\u2019m very fearful of the nationalism, populism, isolationism and the rise of hard-right parties in Europe (and in the world of course) that we face currently. I live in constant fear that this degradation will eventually evolve and lead to WW3. From the pandemic I see a lot of great humanity, empathy, solidarity. But I also see terrible things: self-centredness, selfishness, disinformation, intolerance, etc. And I see countries that are absolutely not ready for what\u2019s coming.\u201d<br><strong>Nina, legal assistant, 27, Montpellier, France</strong></p> <h2>Division hides behind nationalism</h2> <p>\u201cAustria in particular has a tragic past when it comes to nationalism, and people here are acutely aware of this. On the other hand, history never exactly repeats itself and I doubt the horrors of the past would really take place in the same way. Nevertheless, what hides behind nationalism is a profound division between groups of people, which is the antithesis of the European project.\u201d<br><strong>Louis, mid-30s, Vienna</strong></p> <h2>You can feel the nationalism in Denmark</h2> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s good we talk about the second world war in the UK. My boyfriend is Danish and says that despite the country being occupied, and he has family who were young adults at that time, it isn\u2019t talked about. He\u2019s never had a conversation with them about it, or how it impacts their views today. Nationalism worries me very much. You see it across Europe, in ways more subtle than Brexit. Freedom of movement seems to be viewed very negatively by many people. When visiting my boyfriend\u2019s family in Denmark multiple acquaintances or random people have expressed negative feelings about the fact he\u2019s dating a foreigner.\u201d<br><strong>Heather, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>My grandmother\u2019s garden was bombed during WW2</h2> <p>\u201cThis was a traumatic experience and has taught me, as a millennial, not to take peace for granted. Our national curriculum is flawed, however. At school we are taught predominantly about Britain\u2019s role in the war, as if it defeated the Nazi regime singlehandedly. In reality, Britain\u2019s success depended entirely on our continental and global alliances.\u201d<br><strong>Sonia 22, British, living in Paris</strong></p> <h2>The pandemic has boosted rightwing populists</h2> <p>\u201cThe second world war still divides my nation today. Politicians have been using it divide the nation. It\u2019s like a continuous witch-hunt ever since the breakup of Yugoslavia that shifts the focus away from the real lessons of the war. The pandemic too has made me pessimistic. It has enabled a rise in rightwing governments in many parts of Europe which used the lockdown to start implementing their draconian laws.\u201d<br><strong>Andreja, 30s, Ljubljana, Slovenia</strong></p> <h2>In Italy, few have heard of VE Day</h2> <p>\u201cVE Day symbolises an important victory indeed. People were happy not to be under German oppression anymore, but in Italy most people do not feel it or don\u2019t even know it exists. We mark our own liberation day on 25 April. I can see first hand in Italy what nationalistic propaganda is like and what nationalism-oriented communication is like. It\u2019s scary.\u201d<br><strong>Lorenzo, 20s, Milan</strong></p> <h2>Commemorating matters</h2> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s important to acknowledge those who gave up so much for our freedom. My dad lives in South Yorkshire and they have been celebrating VE Day in their socially distanced front gardens! My generation should still learn the lessons of the war. But as our government refused PPE from the EU procurement agreement, it makes me pessimistic about the idea of Britain working with Europe.\u201d<br><strong>Rosie, primary teacher, 30, South Yorks, based London</strong></p> <h2>Time to move on from a nationalist icon</h2> <p>\u201cI think we need to get away from the second world war as a cultural touchstone. Not forget that it happened but with every passing day the context we live in is further removed from it. It has become warped into a nationalist icon, removed from the reality of what actually happened. The \u2018lessons\u2019 people use it to teach are that Britain is special in Europe because we weren\u2019t invaded, fuelling the delusion that we can do everything alone. The tub-thumping pseudo-patriotism of wannabe demagogues is terrifying.\u201d<br><strong>Nick, PhD student, 26, Manchester</strong></p> <h2>Croatia remains blighted by that era</h2> <p>\u201cFor a Croat in particular, the second world war continues to mark my generation as we haven\u2019t been able to transcend divisions dating from then. Some in my generation still struggle to make sense of the lessons of the war. For me it is clear: after the worst modern atrocities on the continent, we as Europeans committed to creating a more peaceful continent. One thing that the Covid crisis might bring is to reveal the inability of nationalist governments to manage the pandemic on their own.\u201d<br><strong>Luka, 22, Zagreb</strong></p> <h2>Solid wartime values are evident in the pandemic</h2> <p>\u201cCaptain Tom and my grandfather exemplify VE Day to me. That stiff upper lip determination that were are not alone and all in this together. Or the Queen saying we will meet again. This crisis shows that the level of support forged in the cauldron of the second world war are still with us. Whether the staff of the NHS or carers, volunteers racing around to deliver food parcels.\u201d<br><strong>Ben, engineer </strong><strong> working as a bin collector, 20s, Carlisle</strong></p> <h2>Britain is obsessed by the war in a way no other country is</h2> <p>\u201cI am anxious about VE Day. My fear is that the loudest voices will be those who want to shout about Britain standing alone and using that to justify a nationalist agenda despite the passage of 75 years. Britain seems obsessed with the war in a way no other European country is.\u201d<br><strong>Peter, 29, London</strong></p> <h2>I feel blessed that my best friends are now German</h2> <p>\u201cI am the grandchild of a Holocaust survivor, and my Dutch grandparents both suffered under German occupation. Being Jewish and living in Amsterdam, the scars of the Jewish community are all over the city. I can\u2019t speak for my generation, but I can say that for me it feels like peace is conditional, it is hard-fought. The fact that many of my best friends are now Germans is a blessing I never take for granted.\u201d<br><strong>Software engineer, 25, Amsterdam</strong></p> <h2>The UK cherrypicks history</h2> <p>\u201cThe second world war teaches us \u2018never again\u2019. The trouble is, most people take that to mean just the gas chambers; everything leading up to that point is apparently acceptable. I also think the UK looks on WWII as a glorious victory of the British against the Germans, rather than a collaborative effort against fascism. The UK has cherrypicked and romanticised history, which makes it impossible for us to learn from it.\u201d<br><strong>Sarah, 31, Milton Keynes</strong></p> <h2>Two lessons matter</h2> <p>\u201cI would say the second world war taught us that no country can make it alone and left us with a deep mistrust of nationalism. However, I look around and I see how little of these two lessons has actually stuck.\u201d<br><strong>Michaela, scientist, 32, Italy</strong></p> <h2>Young people are ignorant about the parallels</h2> <p>\u201cToo many people my age do not even know about the Holocaust, and just how easily European countries slid into horrific persecution and violence. I think our generation needs to contend with this now more so than ever, with razor-wire fences going up all over European and racism, Islamophobia, anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination and gender-based discrimination all on the rise in recent years. A better understanding of this history will remind our generation how easy it is for a society to fall into the abyss.\u201d<br><strong>Adam, 25, Helsinki</strong></p> <h2>The memory of the war has been corrupted</h2> <p>\u201cThe narrative often portrayed in our history lessons was of national pride and British exceptionalism. Having been fortunate to speak to a number of elderly relatives who played a part in the war their stories didn\u2019t match what we were taught, rather they focused on the horrors experienced, and the need for co-operation. I think our generation needs to be aware that the memory of the war has been corrupted to encourage nationalism and British exceptionalism.\u201d<br><strong>Oliver, student, 21, Norfolk</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 8 May 2020 to remove some personal information.</p></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>With most local shops shuttered and online sales booming, it\u2019s easy to imagine that coronavirus will deal a mortal blow to the high street. The images of empty public spaces that have come to define this crisis could be a warning of what life will be like after the lockdown, when people will fear crowds and social distancing will continue, either through self-policing or government directive.</p> <p>The decline of public life is one of the biggest casualties of Covid-19. Zoom, Amazon and Netflix are unlikely to replace our human craving for it. Public discourse has shrunk to encompass the virus, while our daily lives have retreated into the private domestic sphere. Streets and public places, high streets in particular, are the physical setting for public life, and the impact of the virus is that life lived outside \u2013 socialising, shopping, working \u2013 has been almost entirely curtailed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Social preferences, economic realities and government policy will shape the future of the high street</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The typical local high street, with a range of small stores providing essential daily goods, services and meeting places, defined towns and cities in the industrial age. But high streets have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2019/jan/30/high-street-crisis-town-centres-lose-8-of-shops-in-five-years\">struggled</a> in our globalised, post-industrial economy; out-of-town superstores with global supply chains sucked consumers away long before the rise of online retail. To counter this, policymakers restricted the growth of out-of-town shopping centres and attempted to create an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2015/jul/22/young-people-urban-renaissance-city-centres-millennials-report\">urban renaissance</a>\u201d in town centres, bringing shoppers back into revitalised city shopping districts.</p> <p>In effect, the privatised out-of-town model moved into town, creating high-security enclaves of upmarket shops and entertainment areas, policed by private security guards and CCTV. From Cabot Circus in Bristol to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/11/liverpool-one-private-estates\">Liverpool One</a>, this became the template for a new kind of urban development all around the country. At the same time, many high streets were taken over by hundreds of privately controlled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2012/jun/29/business-improvement-districts-london-midtown\">business improvement districts</a>, which operate in a similar way to privately owned estates: businesses in an area pool resources to pay for private security and surveillance, creating a shopping centre \u201cenvironment\u201d aimed at generating maximum footfall. In privately owned and privately controlled places, a range of activities is prohibited, including skateboarding, cycling, taking photographs, filming and, crucially to democratic public life, political protest.</p> <p>As the government begins to ease lockdown restrictions, the public life of the high street will return. Although public transport will be hard hit by decreased commuting, fewer tourists and our fear of contagion, people will be more likely to walk to their local high street \u2013 or drive to one of the privatised, high-security \u201cmalls without walls\u201d or business improvement districts. But the mark of a successful high street, that it\u2019s busy and bustling with people, will also present a challenge to public health.</p> <p>This may suit some high streets and shopping areas more than others. Though people will avoid crowds of shoppers for some time, home-working could provide a boost to local high streets, which means many high streets have the potential to thrive. This is particularly the case in affluent areas with an array of independent shops, as well as in deprived parts of the country that remain overlooked by private estates and business improvement districts.</p> <p>On my local high street in a south London borough, a <a href=\"https://covidmutualaid.org/\">mutual aid centre</a>, a hub for local volunteers who run errands for older people and those who are self-isolating, has joined the parade of independent and charity shops. Councillors are consulting about where best to widen pavements to enable social distancing: outside the organic butchers or outside the foodbank? Income disparities in London mean that upmarket shops and mutual aid co-exist within the same area. In other parts of the country where high streets are characterised by boarded-up shop fronts, mutual aid centres can also provide <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-mutual-aid-how-to-help-the-vulnerable-near-you\">much-needed community hubs</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/sep/26/its-really-shocking-uk-cities-refusing-to-reveal-extent-of-pseudo-public-space\">'It's really shocking': UK cities refusing to reveal extent of pseudo-public space</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Social preferences, economic realities and government policy will shape the future of the high street. In the short term, government support for high streets of every kind will be felt through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/st-albans-firms-group-appeal-business-rates\">suspension of business rates</a> and the range of funds available to carry businesses through the crisis. Business improvement districts have been promised their own <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/6-1-million-funding-boost-to-help-high-streets-and-town-centres-through-pandemic\">\u00a36m </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/6-1-million-funding-boost-to-help-high-streets-and-town-centres-through-pandemic\">fund</a>, but the continuation of social distancing will challenge a model predicated on creating destination environments to maximise footfall \u2013 luring in crowds of shoppers, in other words. The safety of driving to shopping centres may go some of the way to counteract this, and the heavily surveilled, private-public enclaves will no doubt find ways to reinvent themselves, offering data-driven, tech-driven shopping experiences that fit seamlessly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\">contact tracing apps</a>.</p> <p>These <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/privately-owned-public-space-pops\">privately owned public spaces</a>, with their many restrictions on behaviour, offer a stifled version of public life. After the lockdown has eased it\u2019s also possible that high streets that nurture conviviality in place of crowds, and prioritise mutual aid, local goods and services above footfall, will be the places where public life can begin to flourish again.</p> <p>\u2022 Anna Minton is the author of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/big-capital-9780141984995.html\">Big Capital: Who is London for?</a> and is a reader in Architecture at the University of East London</p>",

The images of empty public spaces that have come to define this crisis could be a warning of what life will be like after the lockdown, when people will fear crowds and social distancing will continue, either through self-policing or government directive. The decline of public life is one of the biggest casualties of Covid-19. Zoom, Amazon and Netflix are unlikely to replace our human craving for it. Public discourse has shrunk to encompass the virus, while our daily lives have retreated into the private domestic sphere. Streets and public places, high streets in particular, are the physical setting for public life, and the impact of the virus is that life lived outside \u2013 socialising, shopping, working \u2013 has been almost entirely curtailed. The typical local high street, with a range of small stores providing essential daily goods, services and meeting places, defined towns and cities in the industrial age. But high streets have struggled in our globalised, post-industrial economy; out-of-town superstores with global supply chains sucked consumers away long before the rise of online retail. To counter this, policymakers restricted the growth of out-of-town shopping centres and attempted to create an \u201curban renaissance\u201d in town centres, bringing shoppers back into revitalised city shopping districts. In effect, the privatised out-of-town model moved into town, creating high-security enclaves of upmarket shops and entertainment areas, policed by private security guards and CCTV. From Cabot Circus in Bristol to Liverpool One, this became the template for a new kind of urban development all around the country. At the same time, many high streets were taken over by hundreds of privately controlled business improvement districts, which operate in a similar way to privately owned estates: businesses in an area pool resources to pay for private security and surveillance, creating a shopping centre \u201cenvironment\u201d aimed at generating maximum footfall. In privately owned and privately controlled places, a range of activities is prohibited, including skateboarding, cycling, taking photographs, filming and, crucially to democratic public life, political protest. As the government begins to ease lockdown restrictions, the public life of the high street will return. Although public transport will be hard hit by decreased commuting, fewer tourists and our fear of contagion, people will be more likely to walk to their local high street \u2013 or drive to one of the privatised, high-security \u201cmalls without walls\u201d or business improvement districts. But the mark of a successful high street, that it\u2019s busy and bustling with people, will also present a challenge to public health. This may suit some high streets and shopping areas more than others. Though people will avoid crowds of shoppers for some time, home-working could provide a boost to local high streets, which means many high streets have the potential to thrive. This is particularly the case in affluent areas with an array of independent shops, as well as in deprived parts of the country that remain overlooked by private estates and business improvement districts. On my local high street in a south London borough, a mutual aid centre, a hub for local volunteers who run errands for older people and those who are self-isolating, has joined the parade of independent and charity shops. Councillors are consulting about where best to widen pavements to enable social distancing: outside the organic butchers or outside the foodbank? Income disparities in London mean that upmarket shops and mutual aid co-exist within the same area. In other parts of the country where high streets are characterised by boarded-up shop fronts, mutual aid centres can also provide much-needed community hubs. Social preferences, economic realities and government policy will shape the future of the high street. In the short term, government support for high streets of every kind will be felt through the suspension of business rates and the range of funds available to carry businesses through the crisis. Business improvement districts have been promised their own \u00a36m fund, but the continuation of social distancing will challenge a model predicated on creating destination environments to maximise footfall \u2013 luring in crowds of shoppers, in other words. The safety of driving to shopping centres may go some of the way to counteract this, and the heavily surveilled, private-public enclaves will no doubt find ways to reinvent themselves, offering data-driven, tech-driven shopping experiences that fit seamlessly with contact tracing apps. These privately owned public spaces, with their many restrictions on behaviour, offer a stifled version of public life. After the lockdown has eased it\u2019s also possible that high streets that nurture conviviality in place of crowds, and prioritise mutual aid, local goods and services above footfall, will be the places where public life can begin to flourish again. \u2022 Anna Minton is the author of Big Capital: Who is London for? and is a reader in Architecture at the University of East London",

      "body": "<p>The late 1980s marked a key moment for environmental science, matching triumph with looming disaster. Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/04/latest-data-shows-steep-rises-in-co2-for-seventh-year\">observed since the late 1950s</a>, at the remote Pacific observatory of Mauna Loa, but it was only after three decades of further research that concern over what this rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases might mean reached the desks of the world\u2019s leaders.</p> <p>At the time, politicians appeared receptive to scientific warnings in a way they rarely have been since. In 1987, world governments concluded the <a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol\">Montreal </a><a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol\">protocol</a>, which still stands today as probably the most successful environmental intervention, phasing out the use of the ozone-depleting chemicals that had threatened to destroy the planet\u2019s protective atmospheric layer.</p> <p>When scientists called for a parallel effort to understand the impact of rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the climate, it seemed likely their conclusions would have a similarly galvanising effect. In 1988, the UN and the World Meteorological Organization put together the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/04/FS_timeline.pdf\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPPC), a body of the world\u2019s leading experts on atmospheric physics and chemistry, and the emerging science of climate change, to summarise human knowledge of the climate, and provide policymakers with an assessment of the risks and possible remedies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a534cf0ab5fd4c883d08a50fa33acfac6112679e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a534cf0ab5fd4c883d08a50fa33acfac6112679e/0_0_5000_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Houghton with Adam Butler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Houghton, right, during his time as director general of the Meteorological Office, with Adam Butler, the minister of state for defence procurement, at the official opening of the London weather radar in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, political leadership quickly ran aground on the shoals of the economic vested interests of the fossil fuel industries. But the warnings of that first IPCC report, published in 1990, laid the foundations for the study of what has since been recognised as one of the biggest threats ever to face humanity. One of the foremost scientists who propelled the IPCC, serving as co-chair and chairman of its scientific advisory group from its inception until 2002, was the British atmospheric physicist Sir John Houghton.</p> <p>Houghton, who has died aged 88 of complications arising from Covid-19, had already enjoyed a distinguished public science career when he took on his IPCC role.

      "bodyText": "The late 1980s marked a key moment for environmental science, matching triumph with looming disaster. Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had been observed since the late 1950s, at the remote Pacific observatory of Mauna Loa, but it was only after three decades of further research that concern over what this rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases might mean reached the desks of the world\u2019s leaders. At the time, politicians appeared receptive to scientific warnings in a way they rarely have been since. In 1987, world governments concluded the Montreal protocol, which still stands today as probably the most successful environmental intervention, phasing out the use of the ozone-depleting chemicals that had threatened to destroy the planet\u2019s protective atmospheric layer. When scientists called for a parallel effort to understand the impact of rising CO2 emissions on the climate, it seemed likely their conclusions would have a similarly galvanising effect. In 1988, the UN and the World Meteorological Organization put together the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC), a body of the world\u2019s leading experts on atmospheric physics and chemistry, and the emerging science of climate change, to summarise human knowledge of the climate, and provide policymakers with an assessment of the risks and possible remedies. Unfortunately, political leadership quickly ran aground on the shoals of the economic vested interests of the fossil fuel industries. But the warnings of that first IPCC report, published in 1990, laid the foundations for the study of what has since been recognised as one of the biggest threats ever to face humanity. One of the foremost scientists who propelled the IPCC, serving as co-chair and chairman of its scientific advisory group from its inception until 2002, was the British atmospheric physicist Sir John Houghton. Houghton, who has died aged 88 of complications arising from Covid-19, had already enjoyed a distinguished public science career when he took on his IPCC role. Chief executive (formerly director general) of the Met Office since 1983, he won numerous prizes and accolades, including the Chree medal and prize in 1979 and election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1976 to 1978. While the IPCC\u2019s warnings did not result in the swift remedial action that some hoped for, the body continued to refine and expand its knowledge, producing regular comprehensive assessments and forecasts of the climate crisis. In 2007, the IPCC shared the Nobel peace prize with the former US vice-president Al Gore, with Houghton among those accepting the award in Oslo on behalf of the hundreds of scientists involved. Houghton remained as co-chair of the IPCC\u2019s scientific assessment working group until 2002, and in that time also fostered a world-leading research effort at the Met Office and its Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. The UK still occupies a place at the top table of global climate science today, with the Hadley Centre operating as one of the world\u2019s top climate research hubs. On 1 May, the IPCC announced it would dedicate a key part of its forthcoming report next year to Houghton\u2019s memory. Knighted in 1991, Houghton went on from the Met Office to chair, from 1992 to 1998, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, another landmark institution that had an influence on environmental science and policy before it was closed down in 2011 under the government\u2019s austerity cuts. Houghton discovered his interest in science at a young age, while studying at Rhyl grammar school in north Wales. He was born in Dyserth, Denbighshire, to strongly evangelical Christian parents, Miriam (nee Yarwood) and Sidney Houghton, the second of three sons of whom the eldest, David, became a meteorologist and the youngest, Paul, a lecturer in engineering.

      "body": "<p>About 8,000 more people have died in their own homes since the start of the coronavirus pandemic than in normal times, a Guardian analysis has found, as concerns grow over the number avoiding going to hospital.</p> \n<p>Of that total, 80% died of conditions unrelated to Covid-19, according to their death certificates. Doctors\u2019 leaders have warned that fears and deprioritisation of non-coronavirus patients are taking a deadly toll.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"813b8139-288d-4297-9591-f6f2be6d4d7d\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dr Andy Whittamore, a GP in Portsmouth and Asthma UK\u2019s clinical lead, says that viruses are a trigger for asthma and asthma symptoms, and therefore it is fair to assume that coronavirus will act in the same way.</p>\n    <p>Health bodies around the world are listing asthma as a condition that might be considered high risk, but so far there is no evidence to suggest that having asthma increases the infection rate from the coronavirus. There is, though, some evidence that people who have asthma and catch the coronavirus are more likely to go on to have a more severe case of Covid-19. There is yet to be any data which shows how asthma impacts on the mortality rate from the coronavirus, but doctors are advising that people with the condition try to manage their asthma symptoms as best they can in case they catch the coronavirus.</p>\n    <p>Asthma is a condition of the airways, causing inflammation. It can lead to wheezing, coughing and a tight chest, and be triggered both by internal factors in the body, like levels of hormones, and external factors, like viruses, pollution and allergens. Colds and flu are considered a major trigger.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The data shows 8,196 more deaths at home in England, Wales and Scotland compared with the five-year average for this time of year, including 6,546 non-Covid deaths. It also indicates a drop in non-Covid deaths in hospital, however, leading experts to conclude that many who would ordinarily have been admitted to a ward and died there are instead dying at home.</p> \n<p>Jason Oke, a statistician with the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThis would mean fewer deaths from other causes in hospitals and more deaths from other causes at home or in care homes. It is of course possible that, in addition to this, Covid-19 is being missed in people who remain outside of hospital.</p> \n<p>\u201cA third explanation is that people are dying of other causes that would not have happened under normal conditions \u2013 and are collateral damage of the lockdown.\u201d He added that there was no way of knowing for sure based on the available data.</p> \n<p>Doctors\u2019 leaders have warned that some sick people are too scared to go to hospital and are aware that much of the usual NHS care had been suspended in the pandemic. \u201cThese figures underline that the devastation wrought by Covid-19 spreads far beyond the immediate effects of the illness itself,\u201d said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the council chair of the British Medical Association.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile all parts of the NHS have rallied round in a bid to meet the immediate rocketing demand caused by the pandemic, more than half of doctors in a recent BMA survey have told us that this is worsening the care of non-Covid patients.\u201d</p> \n<p>He cited a fall in A&amp;E visits of up to 50% and a drop by half of patients attending hospitals with heart attacks.</p> \n<p>\u201cReferrals from GPs are not being accepted unless for serious medical conditions and routine investigations to aid diagnosis are not available in many cases. This means many ill patients are not getting the care they so desperately need now \u2013 and crucially, risking their conditions getting worse and with some even dying as a result,\u201d Nagpaul added.</p> \n<p>Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said excess community deaths from non-Covid causes had been seen across Europe.

      "bodyText": "About 8,000 more people have died in their own homes since the start of the coronavirus pandemic than in normal times, a Guardian analysis has found, as concerns grow over the number avoiding going to hospital. Of that total, 80% died of conditions unrelated to Covid-19, according to their death certificates. Doctors\u2019 leaders have warned that fears and deprioritisation of non-coronavirus patients are taking a deadly toll. The data shows 8,196 more deaths at home in England, Wales and Scotland compared with the five-year average for this time of year, including 6,546 non-Covid deaths. It also indicates a drop in non-Covid deaths in hospital, however, leading experts to conclude that many who would ordinarily have been admitted to a ward and died there are instead dying at home. Jason Oke, a statistician with the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, said: \u201cThis would mean fewer deaths from other causes in hospitals and more deaths from other causes at home or in care homes. It is of course possible that, in addition to this, Covid-19 is being missed in people who remain outside of hospital. \u201cA third explanation is that people are dying of other causes that would not have happened under normal conditions \u2013 and are collateral damage of the lockdown.\u201d He added that there was no way of knowing for sure based on the available data. Doctors\u2019 leaders have warned that some sick people are too scared to go to hospital and are aware that much of the usual NHS care had been suspended in the pandemic. \u201cThese figures underline that the devastation wrought by Covid-19 spreads far beyond the immediate effects of the illness itself,\u201d said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the council chair of the British Medical Association. \u201cWhile all parts of the NHS have rallied round in a bid to meet the immediate rocketing demand caused by the pandemic, more than half of doctors in a recent BMA survey have told us that this is worsening the care of non-Covid patients.\u201d He cited a fall in A&amp;E visits of up to 50% and a drop by half of patients attending hospitals with heart attacks. \u201cReferrals from GPs are not being accepted unless for serious medical conditions and routine investigations to aid diagnosis are not available in many cases. This means many ill patients are not getting the care they so desperately need now \u2013 and crucially, risking their conditions getting worse and with some even dying as a result,\u201d Nagpaul added. Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said excess community deaths from non-Covid causes had been seen across Europe. A report this week found that there had been about 11,600 such fatalities in Italy during its pandemic, including deaths from heart attacks and strokes, he added. \u201cData from other countries has shown delayed presentation in patients with heart attacks during the pandemic, either because people don\u2019t want to burden the health service at the current time, or because of fear of catching Covid-19. It is critical that patients who are worried they may be having a heart attack or stroke should call 999.\u201d The fatality figures from the Guardian analysis of the England and Wales data are based on the date of occurrence rather than on the date of registration. The number of deaths occurring in care homes in England and Wales in the week to 24 April was 3.1 times the toll in the equivalent week over the past five years, while deaths in private homes and in hospitals were up to 1.5 times higher than typically seen in the same week. Over the course of the past seven weeks, there were 23,583 deaths in people\u2019s homes compared with the five-year average of 16,794. But of the extra 6,789 fatalities, just one in four were attributed to coronavirus, leaving 5,355 excess non-Covid deaths. Similar data from Scotland \u2013 which is based on date of registration rather than date of the death occurring and is more up to date \u2013 shows a similar trend. In the seven weeks to 3 May, there were 3,453 deaths in private homes and non-institutional settings in Scotland. This compares with 2,046 in a typical year. However, of the remaining deaths, just 216 were Covid-related, leaving 1,191 excess deaths. Similarly, 32,633 deaths were recorded in care homes in England and Wales, more than twice the figure typically expected at this time of year (15,670). Of the remaining deaths, just 6,815 were Covid-19 deaths, leaving 10,148 deaths where Covid-19 was not mentioned on the death certificate. While there were 597 excess deaths in Scottish care homes in the seven weeks to 3 May, these are lower than the number of coronavirus-related deaths (1,195). There have been 704 excess deaths in Northern Ireland since the first coronavirus death was registered there. However, Northern Ireland does not currently publish a five-year average of deaths. Excess deaths grew week on week in both care homes and private homes in England and Wales up until the week ending 10 April, but have fallen in the two subsequent weeks for which data is available. David Leon, professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said the significant numbers of non-Covid excess deaths in care homes would be down to several factors, including undiagnosed Covid-19 deaths. \u201cPeople who are dying from other conditions in care homes may be less likely to be admitted to hospital than pre-pandemic due to concerns about strain on resources,\u201d he said. \u201cThese deaths are ones that would have occurred regardless of the pandemic, but happened in care homes rather than hospitals. \u201cFinally, there is the concern that some of the deaths in care homes were avoidable \u2013 in that some people died because they did not get life-saving treatment in hospitals, because of a reluctance to send them for specialist medical treatment.

      "body": "<p>So football is back. Jeonbuk Motors and Suwon Bluewings opened the coronavirus-delayed K-League season in an empty stadium in the south-west city of Jeonju on Friday evening and for legions of online fans around the world, starved of football by the pandemic, the exertions were a sporting balm. It is fair to say that no football match played on South Korean soil had attracted this level of international interest since the 2002 World Cup finals.</p> <p>With the exceptions of Belarus, Burundi, Tajikistan and Nicaragua, the global game has been at a virtual standstill, presenting the K-League with an opportunity to fill the hole left by the postponement or cancellation of all other major competitions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/may/08/korea-k-league-watch-live-stream-free-jeonbuk-v-suwon-bluewings\">Korea's K-League: Jeonbuk Motors 1-0 Suwon Bluewings \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Top-flight South Korean football was supposed to have started on 29 February, the day the country reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/23/why-south-koreas-coronavirus-death-toll-is-comparatively-low-video-explainer\">909 Covid-19 cases</a> \u2013 a record daily high. Just over two months on the country appears to have contained the virus, but fears of a second wave turned this into a football match like no other.</p> <p>Theplayers\u2019 temperatures were checked and the teams ran on to the pitch separately while masked coaching staff and substitutes took their seats in the dugouts as journalists dotted the press tribune. Seats in empty stands had been repainted to display the message \u201cStay strong\u201d, along with a promise to fans to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLgr4VFn630\">#C_U_SOON</a>.</p> <p>No supporters were allowed inside the 42,000-seat stadium and players were told to observe coronavirus protocols as well as the laws of the game. Excessive goal celebrations were banned, and too much talking at close quarters, whether to teammates or the referee, would result in sanctions for repeat offenders. Players had been told to replace the pre-match handshake with a bow of the head executed from a sensible distance.</p> <p>If any of the players broke the rules on the gratuitous discharge of bodily fluids, they did so discreetly. In fact, to this viewer\u2019s eye, it might well have been the first spit- and snot-free match in football history.</p> <p>It was a sterile atmosphere in the first half, with the players\u2019 shouts echoing in the empty arena.

      "bodyText": "So football is back. Jeonbuk Motors and Suwon Bluewings opened the coronavirus-delayed K-League season in an empty stadium in the south-west city of Jeonju on Friday evening and for legions of online fans around the world, starved of football by the pandemic, the exertions were a sporting balm. It is fair to say that no football match played on South Korean soil had attracted this level of international interest since the 2002 World Cup finals. With the exceptions of Belarus, Burundi, Tajikistan and Nicaragua, the global game has been at a virtual standstill, presenting the K-League with an opportunity to fill the hole left by the postponement or cancellation of all other major competitions. Top-flight South Korean football was supposed to have started on 29 February, the day the country reported 909 Covid-19 cases \u2013 a record daily high. Just over two months on the country appears to have contained the virus, but fears of a second wave turned this into a football match like no other. Theplayers\u2019 temperatures were checked and the teams ran on to the pitch separately while masked coaching staff and substitutes took their seats in the dugouts as journalists dotted the press tribune. Seats in empty stands had been repainted to display the message \u201cStay strong\u201d, along with a promise to fans to #C_U_SOON. No supporters were allowed inside the 42,000-seat stadium and players were told to observe coronavirus protocols as well as the laws of the game. Excessive goal celebrations were banned, and too much talking at close quarters, whether to teammates or the referee, would result in sanctions for repeat offenders. Players had been told to replace the pre-match handshake with a bow of the head executed from a sensible distance. If any of the players broke the rules on the gratuitous discharge of bodily fluids, they did so discreetly. In fact, to this viewer\u2019s eye, it might well have been the first spit- and snot-free match in football history. It was a sterile atmosphere in the first half, with the players\u2019 shouts echoing in the empty arena. But with Jeonbuk chasing a winner in the second half, artificial crowd noise was pumped through the PA system, which did at least give some semblance of atmosphere. Jeonbuk, last year\u2019s champions who are chasing a record eighth title, won the game with minutes rremaining when the 41-year-old Lee Dong-gook headed in the only goal from a corner. With both sides having gamely observed the virus protocols, Lee and his teammates then passed the night\u2019s toughest test of physical-distancing discipline, settling for celebratory exchanges of fist bumps rather than embraces. \u201cI think it is the first time in my career I\u2019ve played without fans and it was a little strange,\u201d said Lee, who thanked health workers around the world for battling coronavirus. \u201cIt was important that we got the win and we worked hard to get it. I think I\u2019ve reminded international fans that I\u2019m still around.\u201d Simon Hill, the veteran commentator, had promised online viewers a \u201cfeast\u201d to end the \u201cfamine\u201d, but the match probably did not quicken the pulses of overseas neutrals who filled the K-League\u2019s official YouTube account with comments in Japanese, English, Arabic, French and Spanish. In fairness, it should have come as no surprise that the players, denied conventional preparations for the season opener, lacked sharpness on a sticky evening at the Jeonju World Cup Stadium. But at least they all knew they were virus-free. The 1,100 K-League players and staff have tested negative, but any new infections during the season, shortened from 38 to 27 rounds, will require the affected club and their opponents to sit out competition for two weeks. \u201cAbout a week ago we decided to get everyone, players and coaching staff, tested for the coronavirus so that there will be little or no risk of infection, even if there\u2019s contact,\u201d Lee Jong-kwoun, the K-League\u2019s head of communications, said on the eve of a match, which will be followed by five more over the weekend. This could prove to be a memorable season for Asia\u2019s oldest professional league.

      "bodyText": "Global markets rose on Friday despite mounting economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic, as tensions eased between the White House and Beijing. Share prices on Wall Street and in Europe ended the week on a high amid rising hopes that lockdown measures could be lifted soon to reboot growth and that a full-blown global trade war could be averted. With stock markets closed in the UK for the early May bank holiday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 380 points, or 1.6%. European markets also rallied, with Germany\u2019s Dax index and France\u2019s Cac up by more than 1%. The gains came despite increasingly gloomy updates from the economy, after official US figures on Friday showed that more than 20m people lost their jobs last month and after the Bank of England warned on Thursday the British economy could shrink by the largest amount in more than three centuries this year. Analysts said investors had already priced in the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, and were buying shares as they anticipated lockdown measures being lifted around the world soon. The gains also came after the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and US trade representative Robert Lighthizer spoke to Chinese vice-premier Liu He late on Thursday in the first trade talks between the world\u2019s two biggest economies since January. Amid concerns that Donald Trump would use the coronavirus pandemic to escalate the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing in retaliation for China\u2019s handling of the pandemic, analysts said the call may signal a cooling of tensions between the two sides. Oil markets also rallied, with the price of a barrel of crude rising by around 1% to $30.

The second consecutive week of gains came amid rising hopes that the end of lockdown measures could lead to an upswing in demand for crude.

She criticised the \u201cmyth of exceptionalism\u201d, which she said was part of the country\u2019s self-image.</p> <p>\u201cBritain was in that position, where our government had increasingly taken an isolationist route, and championed the idea of a small island nation that would go it alone, and punch above its weight, without stopping to think about how we were going to exert power and influence in the world, particularly with China and the US taking the approach that they\u2019ve taken,\u201d Nandy said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned in this pandemic is that that global Britain approach that was supposed to put Britain first, has actually ended up putting us last \u2013 and that in the future we\u2019re going to have a serious reckoning about how Britain does form alliances across the world, that enable us to not just survive future pandemics and global shocks, but actually to thrive during some very very difficult times.\u201d</p> <p>She welcomed that fact that Britain co-hosted a pledging conference with the EU last week, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/boris-johnson-cooperation-coronavirus-vaccine-bid\">raise funding for vaccine development</a>, and described the race to discover one as \u201cthe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes\u201d.</p> <p>But she pointed out that the US was not involved in the conference \u2013 and a rival event was held on the same day, in which the Indian government, among others, was involved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47afe27fde2909e059fc315ef44363532fdcf40d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47afe27fde2909e059fc315ef44363532fdcf40d/0_146_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons on 6 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister\u2019s Questions in the House of Commons on 6 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUnless we get a global response, we\u2019ll see countries scrabbling for a vaccine in competition with one another. It means that the development of that vaccine will undoubtedly be slower, and lives will be lost as a consequence,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt also leaves the UK in a particularly vulnerable position, because we don\u2019t have the manufacturing capacity here. We\u2019ll be reliant on other countries, many of which weren\u2019t present in those discussions on Monday. So we need a global agreement, not just about developing a vaccine, but then about manufacturing, and then about equitable access.\u201d</p> <p>She urged Britain to do more to facilitate a global response.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a series of crunch moments coming up \u2013 key summits around the world \u2013 where it will be determined whether we can forge a global response, whether we can persuade drug companies to pull patents, for example, whether we can get an agreement about what an equitable distribution of the vaccine would look like.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government that has made much of our special relationship with the United States, we need to be reaching across the Atlantic and ensuring that America comes to the table, and that we get a genuine global response to the crisis.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cUnless we deal with this now, we\u2019re going to find, just like with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/no-complaint-or-refund-demand-over-400000-unusable-nhs-gowns\">PPE</a>, with testing, with the furlough scheme, with all of the issues that we\u2019ve had to confront as a country, that we\u2019re not prepared, and that we\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/07/no-10-scrambles-to-control-amid-fierce-criticism-of-lockdown-mixed-messages\">behind the curve</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Starmer\u2019s frontbench have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/01/labour-keir-starmer-coronavirus-covid-19-new-era\">cautious in their criticism</a> of the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, believing the national mood favoured a constructive approach.</p> <p>But shadow ministers have stepped up their attacks in recent days, with Starmer using an article in the Daily Telegraph on Friday to accuse Johnson of failing to protect veterans in care homes.</p> <p>Nandy said Britain was one of those countries where a \u201cmyth of exceptionalism\u201d had taken hold, leading to \u201can enormous divergence\u201d in the way the outbreak has been tackled, creating problems for citizens and businesses.</p> <p>\u201cEven this week, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\">newly launched app</a> on the Isle of Wight, there\u2019s been a discussion in government about whether they now need to change the technology they\u2019re using around that app, to bring them in line with other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start to get this right, and to see the world pulling together, we will continue to see those problems and those barriers.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab509e625d79f40961451c1ebe4d05c57c014019\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab509e625d79f40961451c1ebe4d05c57c014019/0_191_4503_2703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Nandy addresses the Labour party conference in Brighton, 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Nandy addresses the Labour party conference in Brighton, 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Thomas/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The 40-year-old\u2019s appointment was one of the surprises in the radical reshuffle carried out by Keir Starmer after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/the-guardian-view-on-keir-starmer-a-serious-politician\">won the Labour leadership</a> last month.</p> <p>She had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/13/refreshingly-untribal-lisa-nandy-labour-best-hope\">impressed many party members </a>with assured media performances during her own campaign for the leadership, but was better known for championing the needs of towns like her Wigan constituency than for her views on foreign policy.</p> <p>Nandy said her \u201cmission\u201d in the post would be to \u201cconnect back together what is happening to people in places like Wigan, and what is happening at that multilateral level - and why those two things might work in tandem and why they matter so much\u201d.</p> <p>She highlighted what she sees as a \u201ccrisis of legitimacy\u201d for globalisation, which fed the rise of populist leaders, including Donald Trump, and the Brexit vote in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that is foremost in my mind is that the globalisation model that we had has become completely unsustainable in large parts of the world. And that is as true here in Britain as it is for example in the USA,\u201d she said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/the-guardian-view-on-labour-and-coronavirus-lay-claim-to-the-future\">The Guardian view on Labour and coronavirus: lay claim to the future | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nandy said Starmer\u2019s Labour would continue to be an internationalist party. \u201cIt is working-class people, and the poorest, in countries all over the world including Britain, who are bearing the brunt of this. So if we don\u2019t work together to resolve it, that will continue, and we can\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWe can already see the nationalist, populist forces line up, to say that the world must pull apart in response to this. And we have to say that we\u2019re part of that global response - and Labour is an alternative pole on the UK landscape, that puts internationalism very firmly back at the heart of what constitutes a progressive agenda for Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Nandy also suggested Britain be more cautious in its relations with China. Aspects of China\u2019s behaviour, she said, \u201cshould give us cause for concern, and they should make us much more vigilant.\u201d But she added: \u201cThere is no global problem that you can solve without China.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: \u201cFrom the start of the crisis the UK has played a leading role in tackling the spread of coronavirus and driving the world\u2019s response to it. We are uniquely placed to do so as a member of the G7, G20, Nato, Commonwealth and the UNSC, and as a major donor to the global health system.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is the biggest contributor to the international body leading the search for a coronavirus vaccine, and to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We are also hosting the virtual Global Vaccine Summit on 4 June. The UK has now pledged \u00a3744m in aid to support global efforts to combat the outbreak.\u201d </p>",

She criticised the \u201cmyth of exceptionalism\u201d, which she said was part of the country\u2019s self-image. \u201cBritain was in that position, where our government had increasingly taken an isolationist route, and championed the idea of a small island nation that would go it alone, and punch above its weight, without stopping to think about how we were going to exert power and influence in the world, particularly with China and the US taking the approach that they\u2019ve taken,\u201d Nandy said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned in this pandemic is that that global Britain approach that was supposed to put Britain first, has actually ended up putting us last \u2013 and that in the future we\u2019re going to have a serious reckoning about how Britain does form alliances across the world, that enable us to not just survive future pandemics and global shocks, but actually to thrive during some very very difficult times.\u201d She welcomed that fact that Britain co-hosted a pledging conference with the EU last week, to raise funding for vaccine development, and described the race to discover one as \u201cthe most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes\u201d. But she pointed out that the US was not involved in the conference \u2013 and a rival event was held on the same day, in which the Indian government, among others, was involved. \u201cUnless we get a global response, we\u2019ll see countries scrabbling for a vaccine in competition with one another. It means that the development of that vaccine will undoubtedly be slower, and lives will be lost as a consequence,\u201d she said. \u201cIt also leaves the UK in a particularly vulnerable position, because we don\u2019t have the manufacturing capacity here. We\u2019ll be reliant on other countries, many of which weren\u2019t present in those discussions on Monday. So we need a global agreement, not just about developing a vaccine, but then about manufacturing, and then about equitable access.\u201d She urged Britain to do more to facilitate a global response. \u201cThere are a series of crunch moments coming up \u2013 key summits around the world \u2013 where it will be determined whether we can forge a global response, whether we can persuade drug companies to pull patents, for example, whether we can get an agreement about what an equitable distribution of the vaccine would look like. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a government that has made much of our special relationship with the United States, we need to be reaching across the Atlantic and ensuring that America comes to the table, and that we get a genuine global response to the crisis.\u201d She added: \u201cUnless we deal with this now, we\u2019re going to find, just like with PPE, with testing, with the furlough scheme, with all of the issues that we\u2019ve had to confront as a country, that we\u2019re not prepared, and that we\u2019re behind the curve.\u201d Starmer\u2019s frontbench have been cautious in their criticism of the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, believing the national mood favoured a constructive approach. But shadow ministers have stepped up their attacks in recent days, with Starmer using an article in the Daily Telegraph on Friday to accuse Johnson of failing to protect veterans in care homes. Nandy said Britain was one of those countries where a \u201cmyth of exceptionalism\u201d had taken hold, leading to \u201can enormous divergence\u201d in the way the outbreak has been tackled, creating problems for citizens and businesses. \u201cEven this week, with the newly launched app on the Isle of Wight, there\u2019s been a discussion in government about whether they now need to change the technology they\u2019re using around that app, to bring them in line with other countries,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t start to get this right, and to see the world pulling together, we will continue to see those problems and those barriers.\u201d The 40-year-old\u2019s appointment was one of the surprises in the radical reshuffle carried out by Keir Starmer after he won the Labour leadership last month. She had impressed many party members with assured media performances during her own campaign for the leadership, but was better known for championing the needs of towns like her Wigan constituency than for her views on foreign policy. Nandy said her \u201cmission\u201d in the post would be to \u201cconnect back together what is happening to people in places like Wigan, and what is happening at that multilateral level - and why those two things might work in tandem and why they matter so much\u201d. She highlighted what she sees as a \u201ccrisis of legitimacy\u201d for globalisation, which fed the rise of populist leaders, including Donald Trump, and the Brexit vote in 2016. \u201cOne of the things that is foremost in my mind is that the globalisation model that we had has become completely unsustainable in large parts of the world. And that is as true here in Britain as it is for example in the USA,\u201d she said. Nandy said Starmer\u2019s Labour would continue to be an internationalist party. \u201cIt is working-class people, and the poorest, in countries all over the world including Britain, who are bearing the brunt of this. So if we don\u2019t work together to resolve it, that will continue, and we can\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can already see the nationalist, populist forces line up, to say that the world must pull apart in response to this. And we have to say that we\u2019re part of that global response - and Labour is an alternative pole on the UK landscape, that puts internationalism very firmly back at the heart of what constitutes a progressive agenda for Britain.\u201d Nandy also suggested Britain be more cautious in its relations with China. Aspects of China\u2019s behaviour, she said, \u201cshould give us cause for concern, and they should make us much more vigilant.\u201d But she added: \u201cThere is no global problem that you can solve without China.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cFrom the start of the crisis the UK has played a leading role in tackling the spread of coronavirus and driving the world\u2019s response to it. We are uniquely placed to do so as a member of the G7, G20, Nato, Commonwealth and the UNSC, and as a major donor to the global health system. \u201cThe UK is the biggest contributor to the international body leading the search for a coronavirus vaccine, and to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. We are also hosting the virtual Global Vaccine Summit on 4 June. The UK has now pledged \u00a3744m in aid to support global efforts to combat the outbreak.\u201d",

Daniel is eager to hear the prime minister\u2019s plan to scale back the lockdown: \u201cWe are waiting to get a definitive idea of the type of cleaning that will be expected and the timescale if a property might need to be left empty before the next guests. This will make things very, very difficult for existing bookings.\u201d However, once the plan for the summer months is clearer Daniel is optimistic people will want to \u201crun to the hills\u201d. \u201cWe have some truly gorgeous remote cottages and I think there could not be a safer place,\u201d she says. The Isle of Wight usually attracts 2.4 million visitors a year and Will Myles, managing director of Visit Isle of Wight, also believes potential holidaymakers are still keen. \u201cWe\u2019re still getting emails asking for brochures,\u201d he says of the island which has been chosen as the guinea pig for the government\u2019s coronavirus contact-tracing app. \u201cThe demand is there. It is an island that thrives on tourism and we certainly want people back.\u201d But in many locations rebooting the tourism industry will have to be handled extremely sensitively, simply because many host communities fear the health implications of the return of tourists and second-home owners. \u201cWe know the population is nervous for obvious reasons,\u201d says Bell, who says there are currently three patients in local intensive care wards, which have capacity for 60. Cornwall has 530,000 residents but its population increases by 185,000 during the peak holiday season. Bell, who lives near Truro, says he has debates with his family over the pros and cons of reopening. But, he says, that unless the government is \u201cgoing to come over the hill with a \u00a31.5bn cheque for Cornwall\u201d a balance will need to be struck. \u201cI say \u2018what about the 40% of businesses we know are in distress and those worried about losing their job and their houses? What about the fishermen who aren\u2019t selling any fish?\u2019\u201d Visit Cornwall is working with the council, police and NHS to figure what the safe number of visitors could be. They may also need to manage crowds on Cornwall\u2019s 300 beaches, which include family-friendly spots such as the two mile-long Perranporth with its natural swimming pool. \u201cOne way is to control car parking,\u201d says Bell. \u201cIf you know what the beach can take you can have that number of car parking spaces, and then a ban on parking within a certain distance.\u201d Attractions could also introduce timed entry of the kind already operated at popular sights such as Tintagel Castle. When holiday parks and campsites reopen around the country, those who own properties and caravans may be allowed back before renters and campers. Tent pitches will be spaced out more than normal. Martin Smith, founder of Campsites.co.uk, said the number of visitors to its site had picked up in the last fortnight but \u201cbooking and enquiry volumes are still 95% down on last year, and most people are looking at August rather than anything sooner\u201d. Many campsites are small family businesses, Smith says, and they may have reservations about their own health: \u201cThey will be weighing that up against being unable to survive a summer of no bookings.\u201d If there is no summer trade many businesses will be mothballed until next spring \u2013 a decision that would have a big impact on jobs in a place like Cornwall where one in three households is at least partially reliant on tourism. \u201cThat would mean between 30,000 and 40,000 redundancies, which is a scary,\u201d says Bell. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to open a day too early, but equally not a day too late.\u201d",

VE Day is known as National Victory Day in Poland. \u201cThis is an anniversary for us every year in what is a bittersweet sense,\u201d Duda said. \u201cSweet because world war two ended, this bloody slaughter in the history of the 20th century and in the history of humanity ended, in which so many people lost their lives - almost 6 million of our citizens, including over 3 million Polish citizens of Jewish nationality.\u201d Czech Republic In the Czech Republic, where a lockdown has been partially lifted, politicians arrived at 10-minute intervals to lay wreaths on Prague\u2019s Vitkov Hill, to minimise contact. Russia Vladimir Putin sent a message to Boris Johnson ahead of Russia\u2019s national commemoration on 9 May. Putin expressed confidence that the memory of the two nations\u2019 \u201cbrotherhood-in-arms\u201d would lead to constructive dialogue and cooperation between Russia and the UK. He wrote: \u201cThe Great Victory was a pivotal event of the 20th century with enduring significance for the fate of all humankind. It was achieved thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition. That invaluable experience is no less needed today.\u201d US Seven veterans, including participants in the D-day landings and 97-year-old Gregory Melikian, who was tasked in the early hours of 7 May 1945 with sending the coded message announcing Germany\u2019s unconditional surrender, defied the dangers posed by the pandemic to join Donald Trump at a wreath-laying ceremony on Friday. Long-held plans to fly the men to a major commemoration in Russia had to be cancelled due to the pandemic. The men, the youngest of whom is 96, were described as \u201cchoosing nation over self\u201d by agreeing to join the US president at the World War II Memorial in Washington close to Capitol Hill. They then joined Trump as guests of honour at the White House. Melikian, from Phoenix, Arizona, told the Guardian: \u201cMy heroes are the guys that hit the beaches in 6,400 ships. So many never came back and are buried underneath white tombstones.\u201d Timothy Davis, director of the Greatest Generations Foundation, a charity that helps veterans return to the countries where they fought, said the men had sought to commemorate the day in Washington. \u201cOf course, we presented to them the risk we are facing,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, Tim\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ministers have asked local directors of public health to take charge of Covid-19 testing in English care homes in what will be seen as a tacit admission that centralised attempts to run the programme have fallen short. In a letter to sector leaders, seen by the Guardian, the care minister, Helen Whately, acknowledged that testing of care home residents and staff needs to be \u201cmore joined up\u201d. She describes the new arrangements as \u201ca significant change\u201d. Under the new approach, public health directors employed by local councils will take lead responsibility for arranging the testing of some 400,000 care home residents and 500,000 staff, in discussion with directors of adult social services, local NHS bodies and regional directors of Public Health England (PHE). Critically, the local public health directors will decide which homes should have priority in the testing programme, which is still working up to a capacity of 30,000 tests a day for the sector. The switch is a conspicuous, if belated, vote of confidence in local government\u2019s ability to help get a grip on the Covid crisis. There has been frustration and incomprehension that public health teams have until now been left as bit-players in the testing programme and in tracking and tracing carriers of the virus. One senior director of public health said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing and pushing government to realise that we exist and that we are best placed to organise things like testing, alongside directors of adult social services, because we know our patch.\u201d The plight of care homes has shot up the political agenda in recent weeks as Covid has swept through many of them, leading to the deaths of 6,686 people up to 1 May in England and Wales.

Care home sector leaders said that while any move to reform the testing system was welcome, homes would still have no say in determining local priorities or timetables. Lack of capacity remained a grave concern. Vic Rayner, executive director of the National Care Forum, representing not-for-profit care homes, said: \u201cWith almost a million people needing to be tested, and only 30,000 tests a day envisaged at best, what our members really want to know is when all this is going to be a reality.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The end is not in sight. With an <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8297425/Coronavirus-infecting-20-000-people-day-Britain-warns-leading-expert.html\">estimated 20,000 new infections a day</a>, and with experts warning that the reproduction rate of coronavirus may be rising again, any premature loosening of the lockdown will only prolong the crisis. When the prime minister speaks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/07/no-10-scrambles-to-control-amid-fierce-criticism-of-lockdown-mixed-messages\" title=\"\">on Sunday evening</a>, it is essential that he makes it clear that people should still be staying at home, not relaxing their guard.</p> <p>Though so many other countries had been hit, the government did not act soon enough to either contain the threat or prepare for it. Those failures have made a longer and tougher lockdown necessary. It was slow to take the pandemic seriously, slow to impose stringent social distancing, and slow to pursue equipment, testing and tracing, as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, noted this week.</p> <p>At the same time, it has been far too hasty in its promises, and Boris Johnson is under pressure from his party\u2019s right for a hasty relaxation. Following his own experience with the virus, Mr Johnson is reportedly very cautious. Only weeks ago, the chief medical officer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/uk-will-need-social-distancing-until-at-least-end-of-year-says-whitty\" title=\"\">warned</a> that highly disruptive social distancing measures would be needed until at least the end of the year.</p> <p>Yet heading towards a warm bank holiday weekend, the promise that the prime minister would lay out a plan for England\u2019s gradual exit from lockdown, and his remark that he wanted to \u201cget going with some of these measures\u201d on Monday, led to excitable headlines promising that freedom beckoned.</p> <p>A swift revision of the message saw ministers speaking instead of modest changes for the next three weeks \u2013 of the kind already outlined for Wales \u2013 and only a tentative roadmap for after that, but damage may already have been done. A prime minister whose rhetoric so often invokes the second world war should remember that careless talk costs lives. There are signs that more people are out and about. On social media, the government switched from the clear injunction \u201cstay home\u201d to the nebulous \u201cstay safe\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The end is not in sight. With an estimated 20,000 new infections a day, and with experts warning that the reproduction rate of coronavirus may be rising again, any premature loosening of the lockdown will only prolong the crisis. When the prime minister speaks on Sunday evening, it is essential that he makes it clear that people should still be staying at home, not relaxing their guard. Though so many other countries had been hit, the government did not act soon enough to either contain the threat or prepare for it. Those failures have made a longer and tougher lockdown necessary. It was slow to take the pandemic seriously, slow to impose stringent social distancing, and slow to pursue equipment, testing and tracing, as the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, noted this week. At the same time, it has been far too hasty in its promises, and Boris Johnson is under pressure from his party\u2019s right for a hasty relaxation. Following his own experience with the virus, Mr Johnson is reportedly very cautious. Only weeks ago, the chief medical officer warned that highly disruptive social distancing measures would be needed until at least the end of the year. Yet heading towards a warm bank holiday weekend, the promise that the prime minister would lay out a plan for England\u2019s gradual exit from lockdown, and his remark that he wanted to \u201cget going with some of these measures\u201d on Monday, led to excitable headlines promising that freedom beckoned. A swift revision of the message saw ministers speaking instead of modest changes for the next three weeks \u2013 of the kind already outlined for Wales \u2013 and only a tentative roadmap for after that, but damage may already have been done. A prime minister whose rhetoric so often invokes the second world war should remember that careless talk costs lives. There are signs that more people are out and about. On social media, the government switched from the clear injunction \u201cstay home\u201d to the nebulous \u201cstay safe\u201d. The \u201cfour nations\u201d approach was strained as Nicola Sturgeon said she wouldn\u2019t be pressured into loosening measures. Though lockdown is undoubtedly more comfortable for some than others, no one relishes uncertainty about the future or being cut off from friends and family. For many people, the impact is profound. Households are going hungry. Disadvantaged children will fall further behind academically. Domestic abuse is increasing. The Bank of England has predicted that the economy could shrink by 14% this year, in its sharpest contraction for three centuries. Public caution is not a sign that Britain has become \u201caddicted\u201d to the furlough scheme, but simply that people are rightly aware of the risks to themselves and those they love. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies warned this week, a world with no lockdown and a rapidly spreading pandemic does not make for a healthy economy; and nor does one in which containment measures are reintroduced repeatedly because they were eased too quickly and in ill-judged ways. A successful exit will require a much sharper drop in infections, and better preparation, than we have so far seen. Immense issues remain with testing. Tracing is not feasible while the incidence of infections is so high, and the government could yet ditch its own contact-tracing app in favour of the \u201cdecentralised\u201d model favoured by Apple and Google.

      "body": "<p>For every athlete across every sport there will be a level of anxiety right now regarding a return to action post-lockdown. When will it be? What will it look like? Why, exactly, will it be taking place? But among those from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds the sense of unease is likely to be especially acute given the way in which Covid-19 is ravaging their communities.</p> <p>The numbers are stark. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">NHS England figures</a> published last month showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number in the white population, while analysis carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies soon after found the death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis in English hospitals to be more than 2.5 times that of the white population.</p> <p>On Thursday the Office for National Statistics published a report which provided further evidence that people from ethnic groups are at a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white ethnicity \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">four times as high in the case of black people</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/07/football-coronavirus-this-could-be-the-end-of-grassroots-game-change-non-league\">Football and coronavirus: 'This could be the end of the grassroots game'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A range of variables are at play here, from health inequalities to socio-economic and cultural factors, but there remains shock and an overall lack of clarity as to why people from BAME backgrounds are being so disproportionately affected. The government has launched an inquiry while medics across the country \u2013 including at Birmingham NHS trust \u2013 are carrying out their own investigations. But there are no guarantees of findings, let alone solutions, and as such it is little wonder BAME athletes are worried about resuming the day job anytime soon.</p> <p>This appears to be the case in football in particular, which is no surprise given how diverse the sport is in the UK \u2013 about a third of Premier League players are from a BAME background, with similar figures in the lower leagues. Emile Heskey spoke for at least some when he said last week that he would be \u201c100% concerned\u201d about returning to action were he still playing. \u201cMy grandad passed away two years ago and he had diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d the former Leicester, Liverpool and England forward, who is of Antiguan descent, said. \u201cMy eldest kids are sickle cell trait. Are they at risk as well? These are the problems we have.\u201d</p> <p>Jobi McAnuff is a BAME player who shares Heskey\u2019s concerns. The Leyton Orient midfielder said: \u201cYou only have to look at the effect Covid-19 is having on black and ethnic minority groups \u2013 it\u2019s quite shocking really. It\u2019s most definitely a worry for football given the percentage of players from those backgrounds and it\u2019s vital that before we get playing again the strongest safety measures are in place to ensure everyone involved doesn\u2019t catch the virus.\u201d</p> <p>It can be argued that competitive sport \u2013 and football especially \u2013 will provide BAME athletes with a space that is safer than even their own homes. Testing will be stringent, medics will be on hand and, as such, they should not fear a return to action. There is sense in that way of thinking but, equally, it does not fully take into account those circumstances that are BAME-specific, or at least BAME-prevalent.</p> <p>McAnuff, for instance, has been dropping off food at the home of his elderly Jamaican father while he self-isolates, which touches on the socio-economic aspect of the issue given his father lives in Tottenham \u2013 where the family grew up and he has remained through a desire for familiarity but which, like many parts of London with long-standing ethnic communities, is densely populated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5bb48ec0f2ce3fceb4a247c3ab731f2a4ac80b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5bb48ec0f2ce3fceb4a247c3ab731f2a4ac80b0/0_139_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street art in south London by the artist Deanio_X.

It\u2019s a difficult situation.\u201d</p> <p>The British sprinter Asha Philip does not have to worry about dropping off food to family given most of them are living with her during lockdown.

      "bodyText": "For every athlete across every sport there will be a level of anxiety right now regarding a return to action post-lockdown. When will it be? What will it look like? Why, exactly, will it be taking place? But among those from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds the sense of unease is likely to be especially acute given the way in which Covid-19 is ravaging their communities. The numbers are stark. NHS England figures published last month showed that hospital deaths per 100,000 among British people of a black Caribbean background were three times the equivalent number in the white population, while analysis carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies soon after found the death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis in English hospitals to be more than 2.5 times that of the white population. On Thursday the Office for National Statistics published a report which provided further evidence that people from ethnic groups are at a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white ethnicity \u2013 four times as high in the case of black people. A range of variables are at play here, from health inequalities to socio-economic and cultural factors, but there remains shock and an overall lack of clarity as to why people from BAME backgrounds are being so disproportionately affected. The government has launched an inquiry while medics across the country \u2013 including at Birmingham NHS trust \u2013 are carrying out their own investigations. But there are no guarantees of findings, let alone solutions, and as such it is little wonder BAME athletes are worried about resuming the day job anytime soon. This appears to be the case in football in particular, which is no surprise given how diverse the sport is in the UK \u2013 about a third of Premier League players are from a BAME background, with similar figures in the lower leagues. Emile Heskey spoke for at least some when he said last week that he would be \u201c100% concerned\u201d about returning to action were he still playing. \u201cMy grandad passed away two years ago and he had diabetes, high blood pressure,\u201d the former Leicester, Liverpool and England forward, who is of Antiguan descent, said. \u201cMy eldest kids are sickle cell trait. Are they at risk as well? These are the problems we have.\u201d Jobi McAnuff is a BAME player who shares Heskey\u2019s concerns. The Leyton Orient midfielder said: \u201cYou only have to look at the effect Covid-19 is having on black and ethnic minority groups \u2013 it\u2019s quite shocking really. It\u2019s most definitely a worry for football given the percentage of players from those backgrounds and it\u2019s vital that before we get playing again the strongest safety measures are in place to ensure everyone involved doesn\u2019t catch the virus.\u201d It can be argued that competitive sport \u2013 and football especially \u2013 will provide BAME athletes with a space that is safer than even their own homes. Testing will be stringent, medics will be on hand and, as such, they should not fear a return to action. There is sense in that way of thinking but, equally, it does not fully take into account those circumstances that are BAME-specific, or at least BAME-prevalent. McAnuff, for instance, has been dropping off food at the home of his elderly Jamaican father while he self-isolates, which touches on the socio-economic aspect of the issue given his father lives in Tottenham \u2013 where the family grew up and he has remained through a desire for familiarity but which, like many parts of London with long-standing ethnic communities, is densely populated. \u201cFor the first three or four weeks [of lockdown] I\u2019d order food to my address and then go round and leave it on his doorstep,\u201d McAnuff said. \u201cI\u2019ve got two sisters who have been helping out and while where my dad lives isn\u2019t crowded \u2013 he\u2019s not in a housing estate or anything like that \u2013 there are people around, so there has been that worry about contact. It\u2019s a difficult situation.\u201d The British sprinter Asha Philip does not have to worry about dropping off food to family given most of them are living with her during lockdown. As the 29-year-old put it: \u201cMy mum, my brother, his girlfriend, their two kids and my sister and her child just turned up at my house and haven\u2019t left.\u201d This has created an environment that is common within BAME communities \u2013 a sizeable number of people from various generations cohabiting under one roof, and which could therefore be deemed a concern in regards to the spread of infection. But Philip, who has won gold, silver and bronze medals across Olympic, world and European championships and Commonwealth Games, insists her home is safe. \u201cWe\u2019re all staying indoors and being very strict in regard to cleanliness \u2013 for instance, all our post is sprayed with Dettol as soon as it comes through the front door,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mum does have diabetes but it\u2019s a mild form and none of the rest of us have underlying health issues, so we\u2019re OK on that front.\u201d Philip, who is of Antiguan and Jamaican descent, has no concerns as a BAME athlete about returning to competitive action. But because of her background she is worried about competing at the world indoor championships in Nanjing next March, having read about the treatment of black people in China following the spread of coronavirus. Last month it was reported that a branch of McDonald\u2019s in Guangzhou had banned black people from entering because of fears they were spreading Covid-19 \u2013 leading to an apology from the restaurant chain and a temporary closing of the premises \u2013 and that in the same city, hundreds of Africans had been evicted from hotels and apartments due to the same, unfounded fears. \u201cHearing things like that is scary as a black person, especially given I\u2019m meant to be going to China next year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a worry.

The only way to rescue this sector now is for the UK government to pursue a simple Dutch-style compensation scheme, which will help save our horticultural industry.\u201d</p>",

I would just stress again that any easements that we do make will be very limited, and that we will be taking a very cautious approach.\u201d Natalie Porter, a sales manager at the family-run Happy Plants, in Formby, Merseyside, which supplies plants to garden centres, said the firm had to throw away \u00a3180,000 worth of stock in the first week of the lockdown \u2013 more than the company usually makes in annual profits. \u201cIt\u2019s our absolute prime time,\u201d said Porter of the key spring months. \u201cThis happened when we should have been getting a lot of plants out of the door and replacing those with more.\u201d The supplier usually moves 8m plants between March and June but even after selling online and making deliveries it has only made about 1% of its usual sales. However, there is likely to be a shortage of stock because growers have not been planting at their usual pace. Happy Plants decided to take a gamble by planting some fresh stock last month, anticipating a change in policy. \u201cWe missed three whole weeks of planting, you can\u2019t really catch that up,\u201d Porter said. \u201cSo if garden centres do reopen, they would be going into it with a third less stock than usual.\u201d The HTA said that while allowing garden centres to reopen was good news for hundreds of growers, the shutdown would leave lasting scars. In contrast, their Dutch counterparts have received a \u20ac600m (\u00a3524m) government bailout. Barnes said: \u201cThe damage has already been done to our industry, as garden centres have been closed during the annual peak period for plant sales. The only way to rescue this sector now is for the UK government to pursue a simple Dutch-style compensation scheme, which will help save our horticultural industry.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Friday was a dark day for the US economy. The labor department announced more than 20 million people lost their jobs in April as the coronavirus shut down much of the economy. Here are five key takeaways from a report that will enter the history books as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. 1) The headline figures are bad \u2013 but what lies beneath is worse About 20.5m jobs were lost in the month and the unemployment rate shot up to 14.7%. The numbers are probably deflated, since a huge chunk of people have considered themselves out of the workforce, so they are not counted in the unemployment numbers. About 6.5 million more people filed for unemployment since the mid-April reference week Friday\u2019s numbers are based on. About 6 million people left the workforce over the month, and therefore are not being counted. 2) The damage is widespread Some 95% of industries lost jobs. Leisure and hospitality lost 7.7m jobs. That industry has been devastated by Covid-19 closures. But the shutdown has hit industries across the country. Manufacturing lost 1.3m jobs, construction employment fell by 975,000. In healthcare, employment declined by 1.4 million, led by losses in dentist\u2019s offices (down 503,000). 3) The report has highlighted racial inequality The unemployment rate was highest for Hispanic Americans (18.9%), followed by black Americans (16.7%). Although unemployment shot up for white Americans as well (from 4% to 14.2% over the month), that is probably because black workers are more likely to be working in essential jobs. 4) Things are likely to get worse and we don\u2019t know for how long This week\u2019s jobs report may be the low point \u2013 but there are signs of more trouble ahead. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is still having problems misclassifying absent workers. According to Capital Economics, without that distortion the unemployment rate would have been close to 20% last month. Another 3.2 million people filed for unemployment last week, after the survey was completed.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Australia</strong></h2> <p>Clubs and the football federation hope for an<strong> August restart </strong>with a July training phase to step up for a resumption of the A-League, which was postponed indefinitely on 24 March. Five rounds of games, plus the finals, remain. All games are likely to be played in Sydney without spectators, with Wellington Phoenix to be based in NSW for a two-week quarantine before playing. The National Rugby League has the green light to restart on 28 May, which may lead to fixture clashes at cross-code venues.</p> <h2><strong>Austria</strong></h2> <p>The situation was complicated this week when the government insisted that if one player tested positive the whole team would have to go into a 14-day quarantine. On Thursday the Austrian Bundesliga\u2019s managing director, Christian Ebenauer, <a href=\"https://kurier.at/sport/fussball/zwischen-hoffnung-und-klage-wie-es-in-der-bundesliga-mit-dem-coronavirus-weitergeht/400835540\">said </a><a href=\"https://kurier.at/sport/fussball/zwischen-hoffnung-und-klage-wie-es-in-der-bundesliga-mit-dem-coronavirus-weitergeht/400835540\">he was \u201cconfident\u201d</a> the top division could resume at the <strong>end of May </strong>but added that \u201cwe need answers in the next seven or eight days\u201d. The second division has little hope of finishing and a request from the top two teams, Ried and Klagenfurt, to increase the Bundesliga in 2020-21 from 12 to 14 teams was rejected. They are considering whether to appeal or take the matter to court.</p> <h2><strong>Brazil</strong></h2> <p>The president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been pushing for a restart despite coronavirus having not yet peaked in the country and he angered many when he said \u201cfootballers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/01/jair-bolsonaro-says-footballers-in-brazil-have-a-small-chance-of-dying-from-covid-19\">a small chance of dying </a>of the virus\u201d. On Monday a group of 16 first-division players, including Felipe Melo of Palmeiras, released a video saying players\u2019 health must come first. On Tuesday, Internacional became the first top club to resume training at its facilities but a restart of the league would appear to be <strong>at least a month away</strong>.</p> <h2><strong>China</strong></h2> <p>The country does not have a start date for the Super League, with the football association president, Chen Xuyuan, saying this week it could have to kick off without foreign players. China has barred overseas visitors. The league was due to start on 22 February but the best-case scenario appears to be <strong>end of June</strong>. \u201cPlan A is to finish the season with 30 rounds,\u201d Chen said. \u201cWe have a plan B if the league were to kick off in late June and finish in December, and we have also designed plan C for a later restart.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc0f61ed3a52bc38188cb9dbadb3b4bed36b74fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc0f61ed3a52bc38188cb9dbadb3b4bed36b74fb/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guangzhou\u2019s head coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst takes a training session in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guangzhou\u2019s head coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst takes a training session in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Denmark</strong></h2> <p>Clubs were on Thursday given the green light to restart the season and will decide a date in days but they expect it to be <strong>before the end of the month</strong>.

Teams have been allowed to start practising this week, with players training individually and adhering to physical-distancing protocols.

      "body": "<p>Ministers\u2019 plans to reopen schools as early as 1 June are in serious doubt after unions representing teachers and school staff insisted that they would not consider a return without a stringent coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/08/how-covid-19-contact-tracing-can-help-beat-the-pandemic\">\u201ctest and trace\u201d</a> regime.</p> <p>In an unusual joint statement, which one senior union official said indicated that an early return to a normal school timetable was \u201coff the menu\u201d, the Trades Union Congress said that there should be \u201cno increase in pupil numbers until full rollout of a national test and trace scheme\u201d, and called for the establishment of a Covid-19 taskforce with government, unions and others to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/07/coronavirus-uk-unions-warn-against-premature-reopening-of-schools\">agree on the safe reopening of schools</a>.</p> <p>But with a national strategy for a scheme that would help identify who needs to be in quarantine yet to be deployed \u2013 and a contact-tracing phone app still undergoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/guinea-pigs-isle-of-wight-residents-mixed-reactions-to-contact-tracing-app-coronavirus\">a limited trial on the Isle of Wight</a> \u2013 the unions\u2019 tests are unlikely to be satisfied by the 1 June date floated by officials last week.</p> <p>That could mean children in England and Wales returning to schools for just a few weeks between now and the new school year in September, and pupils in Scotland \u2013 who break up earlier \u2013 increasingly unlikely to return before the summer holidays at all.</p> <p>The Scottish and Welsh governments have already announced that their schools will not reopen on 1 June.</p> <p>The news comes amid growing signs that Boris Johnson will set out a cautious \u201croadmap\u201d for the next phase of the crisis on Sunday after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/mixed-messages-uk-governments-strategy-fuels-fears-of-rule-breaking\">government faced severe criticism over its mixed messages</a> about what the public should expect.</p> <p>The statement, submitted to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is backed by the main teaching unions, as well as Unite, GMB and Unison, which represent key school staff such as cleaners, administrators and caterers. Any return without their agreement is highly unlikely.</p> <p>\u201cThe wider reopening of our schools will depend greatly on ensuring that families and carers are fully confident that allowing their children to return to school is safe. We do not believe that sufficient levels of confidence exist at this time,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Johnson told last weekend\u2019s Sun on Sunday: \u201cOne of the things we want to do as fast as we can is get primary schools back. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but that\u2019s where we want to go. It\u2019s about working out a way to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Whitehall sources suggested at the time he had in mind a phased return from the beginning of June, after the summer half-term break.</p> <p>But the Guardian understands that conversations with headteachers and trade unions in recent days have underlined the practical challenges of the move \u2013 and the potential resistance from parents anxious about their children\u2019s safety. A government source insisted on Friday: \u201cWe never set a date.\u201d</p> <p>Ahead of Johnson\u2019s address to the nation, the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Friday played down suggestions of any major changes to the lockdown regime, stressing that the government would proceed \u201cwith the utmost caution\u201d.</p> <p>At the press briefing, Eustice also stressed the importance of abiding by the existing measures over the bank holiday weekend, despite the fact that the government is poised to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/picnics-and-sunbathing-on-cards-as-pm-expected-to-allow-more-time-outside\">unlimited exercise, sunbathing and picnics from Monday</a>.</p> <p>But he welcomed moves by some businesses to reopen where existing restrictions already allow \u2013 including McDonald\u2019s. \u201cOur view is that McDonald\u2019s drive-through is made for the social distancing system that we are in,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/welsh-assembly-government\">Welsh government</a> stole a march on Johnson on Friday by announcing a three-week extension to its coronavirus lockdown and making modest adjustments, including allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day and plans to reopen libraries. </p> <p>The first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/mark-drakeford\">Mark Drakeford</a>, insisted that the lockdown needed to stay, but said \u201cvery cautious\u201d changes would come into force. He anticipated that \u201cbroadly\u201d similar changes would be announced by the prime minister.</p> <p>He said that from Monday, people would be allowed to exercise more than once a day, provided that they do not travel \u201ca significant distance\u201d from their home. Garden centres will be allowed to reopen if they can ensure that the 2-metre physical distancing rule is enforced. And councils will begin work on plans to safely reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres.</p> <p>The announcement came as Scotland\u2019s first minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>, said she believed \u201call four nations now accept there may be differences in pace of how we do these things because the level of the virus is at different stages\u201d, although she expected divergence from England\u2019s upcoming new guidance to be minor.</p> <p>The TUC\u2019s tests include \u201cclear scientific published evidence\u201d that reopening schools will not increase the transmission of Covid-19; agreement between government, unions and employers over minimum safety standards for social distancing and hygiene; and a \u201dsecure supply\u201d of PPE for school staff.</p> <p>But the key demand is that opening up schools cannot begin until there is a \u201cfull rollout\u201d of the government\u2019s test, trace and isolate policy, with targets for testing being consistently met and the numbers of new cases of Covid-19 falling.</p> <p>Williamson has maintained that his top priority is the safety of children, and said that the question of when and how to reopen schools is the government\u2019s most difficult decision.</p> <p>The teaching unions and the Department for Education have been consulting closely in recent days, with ministers and advisers contacting individual headteachers and academy leaders to canvass their views. Following the discussions, the DfE believes the TUC\u2019s tests do not differ significantly from those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/have-the-governments-five-tests-for-easing-lockdown-been-met\">set out by the government to end the lockdown</a>.</p> <p>Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London who has been involved in the development of coronavirus tracing apps in countries including Switzerland and Germany, said it was possible that the first NHS tracing app could be ready by 1 June. But he warned that an app alone would be unlikely to be sufficient to curb a Covid-19 outbreak affecting schools.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is, would an app help schools?\u201d he said. \u201cPrimary schools don\u2019t contain humans with smartphones in the same way as the rest of the world. Certainly, unions should be alert to health risks for the workers they represent, but I don\u2019t think unions should rely on an app to protect their workers.

      "bodyText": "Ministers\u2019 plans to reopen schools as early as 1 June are in serious doubt after unions representing teachers and school staff insisted that they would not consider a return without a stringent coronavirus \u201ctest and trace\u201d regime. In an unusual joint statement, which one senior union official said indicated that an early return to a normal school timetable was \u201coff the menu\u201d, the Trades Union Congress said that there should be \u201cno increase in pupil numbers until full rollout of a national test and trace scheme\u201d, and called for the establishment of a Covid-19 taskforce with government, unions and others to agree on the safe reopening of schools. But with a national strategy for a scheme that would help identify who needs to be in quarantine yet to be deployed \u2013 and a contact-tracing phone app still undergoing a limited trial on the Isle of Wight \u2013 the unions\u2019 tests are unlikely to be satisfied by the 1 June date floated by officials last week. That could mean children in England and Wales returning to schools for just a few weeks between now and the new school year in September, and pupils in Scotland \u2013 who break up earlier \u2013 increasingly unlikely to return before the summer holidays at all. The Scottish and Welsh governments have already announced that their schools will not reopen on 1 June. The news comes amid growing signs that Boris Johnson will set out a cautious \u201croadmap\u201d for the next phase of the crisis on Sunday after the government faced severe criticism over its mixed messages about what the public should expect. The statement, submitted to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is backed by the main teaching unions, as well as Unite, GMB and Unison, which represent key school staff such as cleaners, administrators and caterers. Any return without their agreement is highly unlikely. \u201cThe wider reopening of our schools will depend greatly on ensuring that families and carers are fully confident that allowing their children to return to school is safe. We do not believe that sufficient levels of confidence exist at this time,\u201d it said. Johnson told last weekend\u2019s Sun on Sunday: \u201cOne of the things we want to do as fast as we can is get primary schools back. It\u2019s not going to be easy, but that\u2019s where we want to go. It\u2019s about working out a way to do it.\u201d Whitehall sources suggested at the time he had in mind a phased return from the beginning of June, after the summer half-term break. But the Guardian understands that conversations with headteachers and trade unions in recent days have underlined the practical challenges of the move \u2013 and the potential resistance from parents anxious about their children\u2019s safety. A government source insisted on Friday: \u201cWe never set a date.\u201d Ahead of Johnson\u2019s address to the nation, the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Friday played down suggestions of any major changes to the lockdown regime, stressing that the government would proceed \u201cwith the utmost caution\u201d. At the press briefing, Eustice also stressed the importance of abiding by the existing measures over the bank holiday weekend, despite the fact that the government is poised to allow unlimited exercise, sunbathing and picnics from Monday. But he welcomed moves by some businesses to reopen where existing restrictions already allow \u2013 including McDonald\u2019s. \u201cOur view is that McDonald\u2019s drive-through is made for the social distancing system that we are in,\u201d he said. The Welsh government stole a march on Johnson on Friday by announcing a three-week extension to its coronavirus lockdown and making modest adjustments, including allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day and plans to reopen libraries. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, insisted that the lockdown needed to stay, but said \u201cvery cautious\u201d changes would come into force. He anticipated that \u201cbroadly\u201d similar changes would be announced by the prime minister. He said that from Monday, people would be allowed to exercise more than once a day, provided that they do not travel \u201ca significant distance\u201d from their home. Garden centres will be allowed to reopen if they can ensure that the 2-metre physical distancing rule is enforced. And councils will begin work on plans to safely reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres. The announcement came as Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she believed \u201call four nations now accept there may be differences in pace of how we do these things because the level of the virus is at different stages\u201d, although she expected divergence from England\u2019s upcoming new guidance to be minor. The TUC\u2019s tests include \u201cclear scientific published evidence\u201d that reopening schools will not increase the transmission of Covid-19; agreement between government, unions and employers over minimum safety standards for social distancing and hygiene; and a \u201dsecure supply\u201d of PPE for school staff. But the key demand is that opening up schools cannot begin until there is a \u201cfull rollout\u201d of the government\u2019s test, trace and isolate policy, with targets for testing being consistently met and the numbers of new cases of Covid-19 falling. Williamson has maintained that his top priority is the safety of children, and said that the question of when and how to reopen schools is the government\u2019s most difficult decision. The teaching unions and the Department for Education have been consulting closely in recent days, with ministers and advisers contacting individual headteachers and academy leaders to canvass their views. Following the discussions, the DfE believes the TUC\u2019s tests do not differ significantly from those set out by the government to end the lockdown. Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London who has been involved in the development of coronavirus tracing apps in countries including Switzerland and Germany, said it was possible that the first NHS tracing app could be ready by 1 June. But he warned that an app alone would be unlikely to be sufficient to curb a Covid-19 outbreak affecting schools. \u201cThe question is, would an app help schools?\u201d he said. \u201cPrimary schools don\u2019t contain humans with smartphones in the same way as the rest of the world. Certainly, unions should be alert to health risks for the workers they represent, but I don\u2019t think unions should rely on an app to protect their workers. They should make demands that relate to broader tracking and tracing capabilities.\u201d Veale said that an underlying problem in the UK was its failure to conduct enough tests to make tracing work effectively, even with a functioning app available. The first version of the NHS app requires users to self-report symptoms. \u201cWe must be careful not to make strong claims about the effectiveness of an app before we have even deployed one,\u201d he said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has claimed that a nationwide contact-tracing scheme, involving 18,000 contact tracers, will be in place by mid-May. But he has conceded that it is a \u201chuge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity\u201d. The NASUWT teaching union has already called for schools to remain closed until the end of the summer holidays, while the National Association of Head Teachers said it is \u201cclear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school\u201d. A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cSchools will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to re-open and the five tests set out by government to beat this virus have been met. \u201cWe are also working closely with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.\u201d",

NHS England figures show 12 deaths so far for hospital patients aged 0 to 19 who had tested positive. Some nine, including the baby, had a pre-existing health condition, while three did not. The total death toll in the UK, among patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 now stands at 31,241 - 1,072 more than Italy\u2019s total of 30,201. </p> \n  <p><strong>Government misses 100,000 testing target for sixth day</strong></p> \n  <p>For the sixth day in a row the government missed its target of testing 100,000 people for coronavirus. Despite a rise of more than 10,000 on the previous day, the level reach was 97,029. Defending the figure, the environment secretary, George Eustice said: \u201cThe important thing is to have those ambitious targets you\u2019re working to, to just continually build the capacity.\u201d He claimed the prime minister\u2019s new target of 200,000 tests per day by the end of the May, was for capacity rather than tests carried out. He said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s announced in the last week that we\u2019re going to ramp that up further to 200,000 tests capacity per day.\u201d </p> \n  <p><strong>Plea to open fast food outlets but \u2018no dramatic change in lockdown\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Eustice has urged more takeaway food outlets to reopen. He said: \u201cWe never mandated that they should close.\u201d He also said: \u201cMcDonalds drive through was made for social distancing.\u201d But he confirmed there would be no \u201cdramatic overnight change\u201d in the lockdown rules on Sunday. </p> \n  <p><strong>UK scientists\u2019 fury over attempt to censor Covid-19 advice</strong></p> \n  <p>Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by Sage this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out.</p> \n  <p><strong>Wales unveils modest easing of the lockdown</strong></p> \n  <p>The first minister, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales but announced three modest adjustments.</p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>Local exercise will be allowed more than once a day.</li> \n   <li>Garden centres will be opened with physical distancing measures.<br></li> \n   <li>Local authorities will open libraries and recycling centres.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Schools will not be opened at the start of June, Drakeford confirmed. He also revealed the R number in Wales is estimated to be 0.8 and if it stays at that level 800 people will die in Wales by August. If it increases to 1.1 an estimated 7,200 will die in Wales.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sturgeon warns against easing the lockdown</strong></p> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was only considering relaxing the restrictions on exercising, saying the R number in Scotland was too close to 1 to contemplate any other easing measures. She also announced a further 49 deaths in Scotland taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: \u201cBy easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we\u2019ve made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Rail services set to increase</strong></p> \n  <p>Plans to ramp up rail services have been brought forward by a week and will start from next Monday, a union is claiming. Services were expected to be increased gradually from 18 May as part of an easing of the economic lockdown. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it had discovered that the plans had been brought forward to start on Monday 11 May.</p> \n  <p><strong>Calls to ease lockdown for angling, shooting and bowls</strong></p> \n  <p>Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/05/longer-lockdown-for-over-70s-would-allow-fewer-restrictions-for-rest-of-uk-scientists-suggest\">lockdown to be eased</a> for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced. Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses.</p> \n  <p><strong>Nine Chelsea pensioners have died from Covid-19</strong></p> \n  <p>The Royal Hospital Chelsea, the retirement home for British military veterans, which has 290 residents, made the announcement before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ve-day\">VE Day</a> on Friday. Five of the deaths occurred in the home, and four died while receiving hospital treatment elsewhere.

system itself.</p> \n  <p>Kristin Buhnemann, assistant director at the Florence Nightingale Museum, said: \u201cIn terms of modern nursing, her legacy has never been so relevant, as she was a pioneer

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re closing this liveblog now. You can follow our global coverage here Footage has emerged of the former chief medical officer, Sally Davies, discussing worrying findings from Exercise Cygnus on simulating an influenza pandemic. Speaking after the exercise in 2016 she said: \u201cIt became absolutely clear that we could not cope with the excess bodies.\u201d It raises more questions about why the government wanted to suppress a 2017 report into the exercise. The government tried to keep the Exercise Cygnus report secret until it was published by the Guardian this week. NHS England medical director Professor Stephen Powis committed to publishing data on the deaths of those with learning disabilities and autism who had tested positive for coronavirus. Speaking at the the Downing Street press conference he said: People with learning disabilities and autism and wider mental health problems are really key to NHS England\u2019s work and from the long-term plan we published at the start of last year, it\u2019s clear just quite the focus we are placing on those groups of individuals and it\u2019s really important that they get the appropriate care, the right care and have parity of care with everybody else. So we\u2019re not losing that focus, in terms of patients with mental health who are dying with Covid-19, many of those have been transferred from mental health facilities into acute hospitals, it is a small number but they are being transferred. I can commit that we will publish that data, we\u2019ve been looking at how we can do that as part of our deaths we publish daily. We\u2019re looking at how we can report on those groups and I\u2019ll commit that from next week we will be publishing data on learning disabilities, autism and mental health patients who died in acute hospitals, and we\u2019ll do that on an ongoing basis. \u201cAny premature loosening of the lockdown will only prolong the crisis,\u201d the Guardian warns in an editorial. A successful exit will require a much sharper drop in infections, and better preparation, than we have so far seen. Immense issues remain with testing. Tracing is not feasible while the incidence of infections is so high, and the government could yet ditch its own contact-tracing app in favour of the \u201cdecentralised\u201d model favoured by Apple and Google. Health and social care workers must be adequately protected. Though the right would like to see Mr Johnson offer a timeline for key measures, this should be resisted. A broad outline of plans is sensible. But any dates attached, however carefully caveated, will inevitably be seen as promises; the political pressure not to deviate from them will be intense. What is needed is sober decision-making, with an open discussion about the scientific evidence, and proper scrutiny. Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments on coronavirus in the UK: Baby among 626 new victims in the UK A six-week-old baby has become the youngest victim of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK. NHS England figures show 12 deaths so far for hospital patients aged 0 to 19 who had tested positive. Some nine, including the baby, had a pre-existing health condition, while three did not. The total death toll in the UK, among patients who have tested positive for Covid-19 now stands at 31,241 - 1,072 more than Italy\u2019s total of 30,201. Government misses 100,000 testing target for sixth day For the sixth day in a row the government missed its target of testing 100,000 people for coronavirus. Despite a rise of more than 10,000 on the previous day, the level reach was 97,029. Defending the figure, the environment secretary, George Eustice said: \u201cThe important thing is to have those ambitious targets you\u2019re working to, to just continually build the capacity.\u201d He claimed the prime minister\u2019s new target of 200,000 tests per day by the end of the May, was for capacity rather than tests carried out. He said: \u201cThe prime minister\u2019s announced in the last week that we\u2019re going to ramp that up further to 200,000 tests capacity per day.\u201d Plea to open fast food outlets but \u2018no dramatic change in lockdown\u2019 Eustice has urged more takeaway food outlets to reopen. He said: \u201cWe never mandated that they should close.\u201d He also said: \u201cMcDonalds drive through was made for social distancing.\u201d But he confirmed there would be no \u201cdramatic overnight change\u201d in the lockdown rules on Sunday. UK scientists\u2019 fury over attempt to censor Covid-19 advice Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by Sage this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out. Wales unveils modest easing of the lockdown The first minister, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales but announced three modest adjustments. Local exercise will be allowed more than once a day. Garden centres will be opened with physical distancing measures. Local authorities will open libraries and recycling centres. Schools will not be opened at the start of June, Drakeford confirmed. He also revealed the R number in Wales is estimated to be 0.8 and if it stays at that level 800 people will die in Wales by August. If it increases to 1.1 an estimated 7,200 will die in Wales. Sturgeon warns against easing the lockdown Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was only considering relaxing the restrictions on exercising, saying the R number in Scotland was too close to 1 to contemplate any other easing measures. She also announced a further 49 deaths in Scotland taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: \u201cBy easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we\u2019ve made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives.\u201d Rail services set to increase Plans to ramp up rail services have been brought forward by a week and will start from next Monday, a union is claiming. Services were expected to be increased gradually from 18 May as part of an easing of the economic lockdown. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said it had discovered that the plans had been brought forward to start on Monday 11 May. Calls to ease lockdown for angling, shooting and bowls Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the lockdown to be eased for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced. Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses. Nine Chelsea pensioners have died from Covid-19 The Royal Hospital Chelsea, the retirement home for British military veterans, which has 290 residents, made the announcement before VE Day on Friday. Five of the deaths occurred in the home, and four died while receiving hospital treatment elsewhere. A total of 58 of its residents, known as Chelsea pensioners, have recovered from the disease. The official death toll in the UK is now more than 1,000 higher than in Italy, which until this week was the worst hit country in Europe. As Eustice confirmed an increase of 626 deaths to 31,241 in the UK, Italy announced a further 243 coronavirus deaths, taking its tally passed 30,000 for the first time. On Tuesday the Office of National Statistics suggested the UK\u2019s death toll already passed 32,000 by the start of May. It counts all deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on deaths certificates as possible or probable cause. The number announced at the Downing Street briefing is deaths in all settings where patients have tested positive for Covid-19. The charts from today\u2019s briefing show the rolling weekly average for deaths is coming down but only slowly. And today it was more than yesterday. This is Matthew Weaver taking over the blog again for the next hour or so. Takeaway fast food outlets can reopen, minister George Eustice has said, insisting that the government never ordered them to shut. Asked if fast food outlets could have stayed open during the crisis, the environment secretary explained: \u201cWhile clearly restaurants and pubs had to close, we were quite keen to keep that capacity to be able to do takeaway food for people.\u201d Reduced footfall in town centres, staff anxiety and a sense of what was \u201csocially acceptable\u201d given the stay-at-home message had led to places such as McDonald\u2019s and KFC closing, he suggested. He added: I think it is quite possible for these venues to reopen and reopen safely, we never mandated that they should close. We have learned a lot from supermarkets and other food outlets about how you can do social distancing and do it well. I think some of those food-to-go businesses will probably be seeking to learn lessons from what supermarkets have done as they consider tentatively reopening.\u201d Pressed on why the UK has failed to meet its 100,000 daily testing target for six days in a row, the environment secretary, George Eustice, sought to defend the government\u2019s efforts. He said: If you have, as we do, 50 different sites offering drive-through tests you will get regional variances. You will get some days of surplus tests where people haven\u2019t come forward to take them in some areas, and you will have other areas where you don\u2019t have quite enough capacity for that local demand. The important thing is to have those ambitious targets you\u2019re working to, to just continually build the capacity. But you will of course get daily fluctuations in availability in any given local area.\u201d And, asked about the government\u2019s new target to conduct 200,000 tests by the end of the month, Eustice insisted it would not distract from delivering the current testing capacity. \u201cI think it is important and helpful to have targets you\u2019re moving towards,\u201d he said. That\u2019s why we had that ambitious target to get to 100,000 and again to get to 200,000 by the end of this month. I don\u2019t really understand at all why that would distract from those that are delivering the current test capacity and they can continue to do so, the planning for an expansion is done by an entirely different set of people. As we start to roll out things such as our track and trace approach, testing will become quite an important feature of that.\u201d The government has been challenged on revelations that almost 80% of respirators in the national pandemic stockpile were out of date when the coronavirus hit the UK. Channel 4 News obtained detailed stock lists that reveal exactly what was held on the day coronavirus was declared an international emergency. Around 200m vital pieces of kit \u2013 including respirators, masks, syringes and needles \u2013 had all expired in the eight months before 30 January. Asked by Channel 4 News political correspondent, Liz Bates, about the findings, NHS England medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said any items of PPE which have gone past their original date of expiry are retested to ensure they still meet the right standards and would not be distributed to frontline workers unless they met the standards. There is not going to be \u201cdramatic overnight change\u201d in the UK\u2019s lockdown measures, George Eustice insisted, as he sought to downplay speculation of a greater lifting of restrictions. Speaking at the daily Downing Street conference ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s address to the nation on Sunday, where he is expected to announce some form of ease in lockdown measures, the environment secretary insisted the government would be acting cautiously. He said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be any dramatic overnight change. We will be very, very cautious as we loosen the restrictions we have. As the data that we\u2019re outlining on a daily basis shows, we are not out of the woods, there are still major challenges with this virus for sometime to come. And it\u2019s therefore important to avoid that second peak that could overwhelm our NHS, that we exit and evolve these restrictions very, very carefully.\u201d The government has been challenged on how it\u2019s Covid-19 contact-tracing app will work for those elderly people who do not have smartphones, as it warned they may be left in danger. Heidi, a member of the public from Romford, Essex, submitted a question at the Downing Street press conference saying: How will the contact app work properly when a lot of the older generation do not have smartphones? They are the ones that need to know who has Covid-19 the most, but they won\u2019t know and will still be in danger.\u201d Answering, George Eustice said: \u201cThe work that we\u2019ve done suggests that if you got around 60% of the population on this app then it would become highly effective, but even at lower rates it would be effective. We recognise that some elderly people may not have a mobile phone and may not have an app but also many will have family to help support them to get such an app. And, of course, some of those - particularly the shielded group - may indeed continue to stay at home for longer periods of time to protect themselves.\u201d It follows the Guardian reporting on signs of a generational divide among the take-up of the app on the Isle of Wight where it is being piloted this week. The app is due to be rolled out to the rest of the country later this month. The government has failed for the sixth day in a row to meet its 100,000 Covid-19 testing target. Despite a rise by more than 10,000 in the number of tests carried out, only 97,029 were conducted in the 24-hours to 9am today. It is up from 86,583 the day before but still short of the six-figure target that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, pledged the government would meet by the end of April. It comes after Hancock was accused of artificially inflating the number of coronavirus tests as he last week hailed the rapid expansion that allowed him to reach a self-imposed 100,000-a-day target as a \u201cnational achievement\u201d. It emerged that a third of the 122,347 tests included in the final 24-hour period before the deadline were counted before they had been carried out. The UK\u2019s coronavirus death toll has reached 31,241 it has been announced, marking an increase of 626 since yesterday. The environment secretary, George Eustice, gave the new figure, which includes deaths in both hospitals and the community including care homes, as he spoke at the daily Downing Street press conference. Eustice also announced details of the \u00a316m fund to help support charities feed some of the nation\u2019s most vulnerable people hit by the pandemic. Charities are set to receive \u00a316m to help provide food to some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people struggling during the Covid-19 lockdown. Refuges, homeless shelters and rehabilitation services are among at least 5,000 frontline charities and community groups in England who will benefit from the funds. It comes after it emerged that the coronavirus lockdown has triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes dropped. The fund will cover rural areas in addition to cities and will target those who are struggling to afford food, the government has said. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said: During this difficult time, our frontline food charities are doing brilliant work amid a significant increase in demand - working in refuges, drop-in services, homeless centres and other places. It is absolutely vital they have the resources they need and this funding will help the most vulnerable in our society get the food they need at this enormously challenging time.\u201d The funding is part of the \u00a3750m pot announced by the chancellor for charities across the UK during the coronavirus outbreak. It comes after charities reported unprecedented levels of demand for assistance, while facing a drop-off in donations. Lindsay Boswell, chief executive of FareShare, said: We welcome this support from Defra to obtain vital food supplies, on top of the generosity already shown by the UK food industry. This will enable us to continue to supply much-needed food and drink to the many thousands of frontline charities and community groups across England that are doing the humbling work of getting meals to very vulnerable people during this crisis.\u201d The programme will provide millions of meals over the next three months delivered via charities, including FareShare, the largest not-for-profit organisation that redistributes food in England and nationwide. Funds will also be available for smaller food distribution charities, a spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed, with a Covid-19 food charity grant scheme to be created next week to allow charities that provide food to apply online for funding. Outdoor swimming pools and leisure centres are capable of reopening \u201cquite easily\u201d within weeks under social distancing measures, the boss of a leading gym chain claims. The David Lloyd Leisure chief executive, Glenn Earlam, believes there is \u201cprejudice against certain sectors\u201d, arguing that gyms should be allowed to open before shopping centres. With Boris Johnson due to reveal plans on Sunday to ease the country\u2019s lockdown measures, reports have suggested that gyms and leisure centres may be shut until the autumn as they are feared to be a \u201chotbed of infection\u201d. However, Earlam told PA: The evidence suggests that keeping the body fit and healthy could be one of the best things to do to prevent Covid-19, but I think gyms and leisure centres are quite far down on the pecking order of opening things up again, which seems pretty counter-intuitive. I believe leisure centres and gyms could be safely reopened quite easily, not everything would be the same at the start, there would have to be screens on reception desks, floor markings ensuring members stay two metres away and every piece of equipment would be cleaned after every use, with hand towels readily available. The numbers of people entering could also be limited, with ill people advised to stay at home.\u201d Claiming his company\u2019s gyms were \u201cincredibly clean\u201d and insisting staff would be given PPE, he said his facilities would be ready to open in the coming weeks. He added: We\u2019d also be in the position to reopen outdoor swimming pools - all the advice suggests chlorine kills Covid stone dead. Of course we\u2019d have to limit the number of people around the pool and changing rooms would remain closed, but there\u2019s nothing to suggest people can\u2019t safely swim while maintaining social distancing measures. Boris Johnson has invited Russia to participate in a global vaccine summit next month during a call with Vladmir Putin to mark VE Day. The prime minister extended an invitation to Putin for the Global Vaccine Summit that the UK will be hosting virtually in June to help strengthen healthcare systems and tackle Covid-19 in some of the poorest nations, a Downing Street spokeswoman said. \u201cThe prime minister spoke to President Putin today to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day,\u201d the spokeswoman said, adding: They paid tribute to the collaboration between British and Russian forces during the second world war, including through the Arctic convoys, and to the heroism and sacrifice of all those who lost their lives. They also discussed the bilateral relationship between our countries. The prime minister was clear we should maintain dialogue, but that obstacles to further progress remained. The leaders spoke about the coronavirus pandemic and agreed on the importance of continuing to work together and with other countries to defeat the disease. Good afternoon, readers. It\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the UK live blog from my colleague, Matthew Weaver. There has been a sharp rise in the number of people being moved on by Police Scotland because they are not adhering to lockdown guidance, according to the latest figures released by the force. Some 13,717 people were asked to disperse from a public place in the fortnight from 23 April to 6 May, taking the total since the emergency power came into force on 27 March to 18,357. An additional 2,851 people were dispersed with a police warning, taking the total to 41,999. A further 101 were returned home using reasonable force, taking that total to 212, and there have now been a total of 143 arrests and 2263 fixed penalty notices issued. Speaking at the Scottish government briefing this afternoon, chief constable Iain Livingstone acknowledged that there were more people on the streets now than at the start of the lockdown. He said: \u201cI do think there have been remarkably high levels of consent, support and compliance but undeniably in recent weeks there are more people in public.\u201d The six-week-old baby announced to have died in an English hospital is the youngest victim of the outbreak in the UK so far (see earlier). PA has this background: While it is much less likely for children to suffer severely from Covid-19 compared with adults, Friday\u2019s NHS England figures show 12 deaths so far for hospital patients aged 0 to 19 who had tested positive. Some nine, including the baby, had a pre-existing health condition, while three did not. The youngest victim with no known underlying health issues was Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, who died in March aged just 13. After his case emerged, one expert called for research into deaths which have occurred outside of patient groups believed to be at higher risk. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an academic clinical lecturer at King\u2019s College London, said at the time: It is essential that we undertake research to determine why a proportion of deaths occur outside of the groups expected to succumb to infection as it may indicate an underlying genetic susceptibility. Determining if this is the case could help us to learn more about the interaction of the virus with the immune system and subsequently what further treatments may be suitable in patients with severe infection.\u201d People of all ages with underlying health problems are believed to be at higher risk from the effects of the virus. But a major British study of almost 17,000 patients with severe Covid-19 found that only a very small number of children fall seriously ill. The study, which examined data from 16,749 Covid-19 patients in 166 hospitals between 6 February and 18 April, found that under-18s accounted for less than 2% of the study sample and under-fives accounted for 0.8%. Public Health Wales has announced another 28 coronavirus deaths taking the death toll to 1,090 in Wales. Earlier the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the Welsh government estimates there will be another 800 deaths in Wales by 7 August if the R number stays at its current level of 0.8. If it increases to 1.1 the death toll would increase by 7,200 by August, he warned. Another five Covid-19 related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said. It brings the total number of deaths to 427. Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University School of Medicine, says it too risky to significantly lift the lockdown in Wales or the rest of the UK. He said: Although we had all hoped that it might be possible for a more substantial relaxation of the lockdown restrictions at this stage, it is clear that the daily level of new infections is still too high and the R value too close to 1 to allow that to happen safely. We are clearly past the peak of this first wave, but a more major easing of the social distancing rules now would risk a large second wave a few weeks down the line, with increasing hospital admissions and deaths. It seems unlikely that these minor measures announced today by the First Minister for Wales will have any significant detrimental effect on the rate of new infections. We know that the risk of the infection being transmitted is much lower outdoors so exercising more than once a day should not pose a risk. I would expect similar measures to be announced by the other UK nations. Research by Citizens Advice suggests many vulnerable workers are having their health put at risk by their employer not furloughing them on the government\u2019s scheme. A press release on the study said: The charity\u2019s frontline advisers are helping workers in the shielded group, such as those undergoing chemotherapy, who have been denied furlough despite instructions to stay at home and avoid face-to-face contact. Many have been left relying on \u00a395.85 per week from statutory sick pay and any additional benefits they might be entitled to. In the week after applications for the Job Retention Scheme launched on 20 April, Citizens Advice gave one-to-one employment advice to almost 4,200 workers. An analysis of a randomised sample of a tenth of these cases showed that over 70% of those who are shielding or are potentially at higher risk from coronavirus had not been furloughed. Those at higher risk include people who are pregnant or have conditions such as diabetes. Employers are currently allowed to furlough people for any reason arising from the coronavirus pandemic, including to protect employees\u2019 health. Citizens Advice is calling for the most vulnerable workers to have a right to be furloughed if their work would require them to breach public health advice. This should include people in the shielded group or who share a household with someone in the shielded group. These workers should also be able to retain access to the Job Retention Scheme for as long as public health advice requires them not to work. Food shop key worker Colleen, 55, is in the shielded group as she has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. She has been denied furlough and instead put on Statutory Sick Pay. Her husband works as a carer and so can\u2019t return home. She said: \u201cI really wish I never gave my work the [shielding] letter because at least I wouldn\u2019t be struggling to get by. But my husband rightly said working would put me at risk. It\u2019s just a catch-22. I\u2019m damned if I work and I\u2019m damned if I don\u2019t go to work. \u201cBeing on SSP means I take home over \u00a3200 a month less than if I was working. I\u2019m struggling to pay my normal bills and buy things like food. I\u2019ve had to sign up to get food parcels as I just don\u2019t have enough money. My friend has dropped me bread and beans to get by.\u201d Plans to ramp up rail services have been brought forward by a week and will start from next Monday, a union is claiming, PA reports. Services were expected to be increased gradually from 18 May as part of an easing of the economic lockdown. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said it had discovered that the plans had been brought forward to start on Monday 11 May. Officials said the industry had been told to be ready to begin a last-minute mobilisation to accommodate an increase in passenger numbers from Monday in reaction to the prime minister\u2019s address on Sunday. The RMT said the move overrules a planning document sent to the unions on Thursday by the Rail Industry Coronavirus Forum, a rail industry and trade union body established to put in place arrangements to protect passengers and workers. The document said services would be increased in phases, with a \u201cstepped\u201d increase from 18 May, said the RMT. General secretary Mick Cash said: \u201cWe have it on good authority that the rail network has been put on notice to begin a last-minute mobilisation to accommodate an increase in passenger numbers from Monday.\u201d A pilot on the Isle of Wight for the new contact tracing app appears to have got off to a bumpy start \u2013 with emerging signs of a generational divide. Although most locals told the Guardian they were broadly supportive of the idea, questions have been raised about glitches on some phones and the potential lack of takeup among the island\u2019s older, less tech-savvy residents. And just as the NHS Covid-19 app was unveiled to the island on Thursday morning, it was dealt a further blow when a parliamentary committee warned it must not be released in its current form without increased privacy and data protections. Meanwhile, it emerged that Downing Street is leaving open the prospect of ditching the app entirely and instead opting for a \u201cdecentralised\u201d model favoured by Apple and Google. By late morning on Thursday, 33,000 of the Isle of Wight\u2019s 140,000 residents were undeterred and had downloaded it, with 28 logging symptoms, the local Tory MP Bob Seely said. (Key workers had access to the app earlier in the week.) Later in the day, downloads topped 40,000. Here\u2019s the top part of PA\u2019s take on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s press conference: The four UK nations may need to move at different speeds on easing lockdown, Nicola Sturgeon said as she urged Scots to stick with the current coronavirus restrictions. Prime Minster Boris Johnson spoke with the leaders of the devolved nations on Thursday, ahead of an expected announcement on easing parts of the lockdown in England on Sunday. Wales\u2019 first minister, Mark Drakeford, has announced three \u201cmodest adjustments\u201d from Monday to restrictions there. But Sturgeon has said the only change in Scotland would be allowing people to leave their house for exercise more than once a day. Speaking at her daily coronavirus briefing, she said there was a \u201chelpful recognition\u201d in her call with the prime minister that the \u201cfour UK nations may well move at different speeds if our data about the spread of the virus says that that is necessary to suppress it\u201d. Sturgeon said after talks with the PM on Thursday about his plans that she expected any differences between the nations to be initially \u201cquite minor\u201d. She stressed: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t anticipate a radical departure in the immediate term, if the sense I am getting from the UK government now turns out to be the reality.\u201d But she added that planning and messaging would continue to be co-ordinated. The Scottish government said its data suggested the R-number was higher in Scotland than the rest of the UK - with this estimated to be between 0.7 and one in Scotland, compared to between 0.5 and 0.9 in the UK. Almost 3,000 male prisoners in Wales are being held in shared cells despite the threat from coronavirus, Plaid Cymru has discovered. The party\u2019s Westminster parliamentary leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said: These are shocking revelations that show a deeply dangerous lack of action to protect those that work in prisons as well as inmates. Mega prisons like Berwyn [in Wrexham] offer near perfect conditions for an outbreak. Social distancing will inevitably be difficult in a prison, but it looks as if prison officers are being asked to fight this disease with one hand tied behind their back. Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, says the modest easing of the lockdown in Wales poses \u201cvery little, if any, risk of new infections\u201d and the Welsh government should have gone further. He said: It is disappointing that other forms of leisure and exercise have not been included to improve people\u2019s physical and mental health. The evidence against other leisure activities not being allowed where social distancing can be maintained easily should be published to justify this decision. This particularly applies to fishing and sunbathing in a park. Recycling centres have already reopened in England and the nature of these sites intrinsically allows social distancing if site specific measures are put in place. Garden centres have always been near the top of the list for re-opening. Zoos are also large open spaces which would readily allow even more social distancing and it is a pity there has not been more consistency. If libraries can open, presumably with social distancing, it is difficult to see why shops of similar sizes can\u2019t also reopen. The decision to maintain most of the lockdown is warranted but given more evidence on the analyses of lockdowns across Europe and lifting in many countries we need to see the evidence on why these decisions have been made and this will maintain confidence in following the science. The different UK administrations say they want to work and stay in line and keep the messaging consistent but announcing different measures or the same measures two days early needs to be justified and explained. Given the epidemic is really a series of multiple epidemics across the UK it is likely one size does not fit all and therefore different approaches are warranted. This particularly applies to various smaller islands around the UK, rural vs cities and also Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to work as one body. The battle over reopening schools in England continues, with the National Association of Head Teachers releasing a poll showing that few school leaders feel confident enough for lockdown measures to be relaxed. Just 10% said they felt confident it would be safe to open their school to more pupils \u201cin coming weeks\u201d, while only 7% said parents would think it was safe enough to allow their children back to school, according to responses from 1,300 senior leaders yesterday. Paul Whiteman, the NAHT\u2019s general secretary, said the government needed to put in a greater effort to win over parents and staff in the event of a change of policy: \u201cSchools will need very clear and unambiguous guidance in order to move forward. There should be no grey areas in terms of what schools are expected to do. Leaving difficult choices up to school leaders who do not have access to the scientific advice would be an unreasonable burden to put on their shoulders.\u201d Meanwhile the Trades Union Congress has backed a statement from the unions working in schools, including GMB, Unison and Unite members, saying that they should not reopen until the government is able to test and trace those infected with Covid-19. There\u2019s more on the issue here: Here\u2019s a roundup of the latest developments on coronavirus in the UK UK scientists\u2019 fury over attempt to censor Covid-19 advice Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by Sage this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out. Baby among 332 more victims in English hospitals NHS England said a further 332 people have died in English hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. It brings England\u2019s coronavirus death toll in hospitals to 22,764. The youngest victim was a six-week-old baby with underlying health problems, NHS England said. The oldest victim was 103. Wales unveils modest easing of the lockdown The first minister, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales but announced three modest adjustments. Local exercise will be allowed more than once a day. Garden centres will be opened with physical distancing measures. Local authorities will open libraries and recycling centres. Schools will not be opened at the start of June, Drakeford confirmed. He also revealed the R number in Wales is estimated to be 0.8 and if it stays at that level 800 people will die in Wales by August. If it increases to 1.1 an estimated 7,200 will die in Wales. Sturgeon warns against easing the lockdown Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was only considering relaxing the restrictions on exercising, saying the R number in Scotland was too close to 1 to contemplate any other easing measures. She also announced a further 49 deaths in Scotland taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: \u201cBy easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we\u2019ve made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives.\u201d Rail services set to increase Transport sources have revealed plans for a gradual easing of the lockdown from 18 May. The Department for Transport confirmed a \u201crange of options\u201d were being considered. Union leaders stressed they wanted to make sure their members\u2019 safety was protected, with one saying lifting the lockdown was \u201cfraught with danger\u201d. Calls to ease lockdown for angling, shooting and bowls Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the lockdown to be eased for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced. Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses. Nine Chelsea pensioners have died from Covid-19 The Royal Hospital Chelsea, the retirement home for British military veterans, which has 290 residents, made the announcement before VE Day on Friday. Five of the deaths occurred in the home, and four died while receiving hospital treatment elsewhere. A total of 58 of its residents, known as Chelsea pensioners, have recovered from the disease. Anglers, game shooting enthusiasts and bowls clubs are increasing the pressure for the lockdown to be eased for their sports, arguing that they can resume them while remaining physically distanced. Lobbyists for fishing and game shooting claim that continuing strict lockdown restrictions for their pursuits could cost the UK economy millions of pounds and lead to thousands of job losses. They also warn that the disappearance from the countryside of sportspeople during lockdown is leading to a rise in rural crime and having a negative impact on conservation. Meanwhile, greens are being lovingly prepared and committee members thinking about ways of operating in a post-lockdown world as the sport of bowls makes tentative preparations for a comeback. Martin Salter, the head of policy at the Angling Trust, said fishing had been \u201cincredibly responsible\u201d in persuading the UK\u2019s many hundreds of thousands of anglers to stay away from the water during lockdown. But he said: \u201cI think we have a compelling case now for us to be at the very front of the queue when the government and its advisers decide the time is right to begin ratcheting back the restrictions.\u201d The Downing Street coronavirus briefing is expected to take place at 5pm, as usual for a weekday, and will led by the environment secretary, George Eustice. NHS England said a further 332 people have died in English hospital after testing positive for Covid-19. It brings England\u2019s coronavirus death toll in hospitals to 22,764. The youngest victim was a six-week-old baby with underlying health problems, NHS England said. The oldest victim was 103. Some 22 of the 332 patients, aged between 40 and 96 years old, had no known underlying health condition. Here\u2019s the regional breakdown of the deaths: London 93 East of England 53 North-east &amp; Yorkshire 50 North-west 41 Midlands 40 South-east 35 South-west 20 Q: Is the R number in Scotland the highest in the UK? Sturgeon said the R number in Scotland was between 0.7 and 1 and it was closer to 1 than 0.7. In the UK it is estimated to be between 0.5 and 0.9. Q: How will policing work if there are different lockdown regimes in Scotland and England? Sturgeon said Scotland had to do what the data said it should. She repeated that the four nations could move at a different pace. But she added: \u201cI would not anticipate a radical departure from Scottish lockdown measures in England.\u201d I would anticipate that in the immediate term, as in Sunday into Monday, any differences will be probably quite minor. Q: Should there be more checks at airports? Sturgeon says this is something the UK government is looking at. \u201cI would expect the UK government to say something about borders in the coming days,\u201d she said. Q: Are you worried that the furlough scheme will be wound down to save money? Sturgeon said no government could ignore the fiscal challenge of the policies. Government support should continue, but it may need to \u201cflex\u201d. She said support should not be withdrawn too soon, and a cliff edge withdrawal should be avoided. Q: Are care home workers being prevented from getting tests because of staffing issues? All care home staff should be allowed to get a test, Sturgeon said. She said \u201cWe are working with homecare providers\u201d to make sure that if they have staffing difficulties they have cover through volunteers and those returning to work. Q: Are care workers having trouble getting to testing sites? Sturgeon agreed to look at the issue. Home tests should be available, she added. Sturgeon criticised the media speculation about a possible lifting of the lockdown on Monday. She said: My main message is about the importance of staying at home. I know it will be tempting to think that this weekend, after so many weeks of lockdown, we can allow ourselves perhaps one little slip. You may even think given recent unhelpful news headlines that things have already eased up, and that there\u2019s somehow less at stake. I want to emphasise to you as strongly as I possibly can that that is absolutely not the case, the risk remains too high for us to ease up now. Sturgeon said: None of us, including me, want these restrictions to be place for a minute longer than they have to be, but we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent against this virus. By easing restrictions prematurely we would risk undoing all the progress that we\u2019ve made, we would risk allowing the virus to spread out of control and that would cost lives. Sturgeon says the four nations of the UK may move at different speeds. \u201cThe only change we are considering in the immediate term is to the guidance on outdoor exercise,\u201d she said. More details will be provided on Sunday. Sturgeon said the R number in Scotland is higher than the rest of the UK, but she did not give a figure. Sturgeon announced that a further 49 people who had tested positive for the coronavirus died in Scotland in the last 24 hours, taking its death toll to 1,811. She said: There have been 13,149 positive cases confirmed, that is an increase of 225 since yesterday. I\u2019m also able to confirm today that since 5 March a total of 3,016 patients who had tested positive and been hospitalised have been able to leave hospital and I wish all of them, and the families, well. Unfortunately I also have to report that in the past 24 hours, 49 deaths have been registered of patients who had been confirmed through a test as having Covid-19, that takes the total number of deaths in Scotland, under that measurement to 1,811. You can follow the Scottish government\u2019s news conference here: The epidemiological term \u2018harvesting\u2019 is tragically applicable to the way we have failed to shield vulnerable people from coronavirus, writes Richard Coker, the emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Next up will be the Scottish government\u2019s press conference. The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, will be joined by the chief constable of Police Scotland, Iain Livingstone and Jason Leitch, Scotland\u2019s national clinical director. The Welsh government provided these slides on the estimated 0.8 R value in Wales and the various projected impacts on hospital admissions and deaths if that changes. Here\u2019s a transcript of what Drakeford said about the decision not to open schools on 1 June. He said: We don\u2019t know what the UK government will be saying about schools in England, so I\u2019m not going to speculate on that. I said, a week ago, that it needed three weeks from the point you made the decision to a school reopening. We\u2019re at that point where if we\u2019ve made the decision schools will be reopening in Wales in June. We\u2019re not making that decision today for all the reasons I\u2019ve already set out. And that\u2019s why Kirsty Williams our education minister confirmed that schools in Wales wouldn\u2019t be reopening in that major way in June. Despite Drakeford\u2019s wording there is still a chance that schools could reopen in Wales at the end of June. Q: What level would R need to be before lockdown is lifted or adjustments reimposed? We will be watching R like a hawk, Drakeford said. If it increases the adjustments will be reversed. Drakeford said the R rate in care homes is higher than in the community but he did not say by how much. Q: Will policing be difficult if there are different lockdown policies in the UK nations? Drakeford said: \u201cWe are managing. I want to make it clear to people thinking of travelling to Welsh beaches or mountains that Wales is still under lockdown. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d Q: How open has the Westminster government been? It has been one of \u201cfits and starts\u201d, Drakeford said. \u201cWhen we have discussions it is good, it would be better to have regular discussions.\u201d Q: Is Wales still in lockstep with England and what about schools opening? Drakeford said: \u201cWe will maintain a four nations approach but timings could vary. We don\u2019t know what the UK government will say about schools. We are not making a decision to reopen schools in June.\u201d Q: Is there a danger of mixing messages? Drakeford says there is no chance of that. He said the message was to stay safe and stay local. Q: When will there be a route map out of lockdown? Drakeford said there will be a need to spell out a road map to lifting the lockdown. That needs to be coordinated with the other UK nations on Sunday. He said lifting the exercise restrictions was about improving people\u2019s well being and mental health. Q: What\u2019s the point of tiny changes that could affect the messaging? Drakeford said reviewing the lockdown is about making modest adjustments. It has not produced any major changes, but the adjustments will make a difference to people. Q: Will similar changes be made in England? Drakeford said he spoke to Boris Johnson yesterday. It will be for him to decide what to do in England. But only modest changes are likely in England, Drakeford said. The first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, says it is too soon to ease the lockdown in Wales. He says the R reproductive rate of the virus in Wales is currently estimated to be 0.8. He warned that 800 people would die of the virus in Wales, but if the lockdown is lifted that figure would increase to more than 7,000. Drakeford said three \u201csmall and modest adjustments\u201d could be made in Wales. People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day. But it should be local and not involve any travel. Garden centres should be open with physical distancing measures. Local authorities can plan to open libraries and recycling centres. There was no mention of schools. Government scientific advisers are furious at what they see as an attempt to censor their advice on government proposals during the Covid-19 lockdown by heavily redacting an official report before it was released to the public, the Guardian can reveal. The report was one of a series of documents published by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) this week to mollify growing criticism about the lack of transparency over the advice given to ministers responding to the coronavirus. However large blocks of text in the report, produced by SPI-B, the Sage subcommittee providing advice from behavioural scientists on how the public might respond to lockdown measures, were entirely blanked out. Several SPI\u2013B members told the Guardian that the redacted portions of the document contained criticisms they had made of potential government policies they had been formally asked to consider in late March and early April. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is being praised for his VE day message and his handling of the coronavirus crisis by Conservative commentators and outlets. In the next hour or so, the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford will reveal the next stage of the Welsh government\u2019s lockdown plans. A press conference is due to start at 12.30pm. Earlier this week he suggested that schools in Wales could reopen at the beginning of June. \u201cOur advice from the trade unions and from the local education authorities is that you will need three weeks as a minimum from the point that we decide to do that, to when schools can reopen, so we are talking about the beginning of June,\u201d he told the BBC. At 1.30pm the Scottish government is due to give its daily briefing. On Thursday, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, ruled out any significant lifting of the lockdown. She also warned that changing the stay at home message would be a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d mistake. Here\u2019s a summary of the main developments so far today: UK coronavirus lockdown tested as bank holiday starts The lockdown is facing a major test from the long VE Day bank holiday weekend of warm weather. There are concerns about mixed messaging before Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement on easing restrictions. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said \u201cany changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental\u201d before the prime minister\u2019s address to the nation on Sunday evening. Rail services set to increase Transport sources have revealed plans for a gradual easing of the lockdown from 18 May. The Department for Transport confirmed a \u201crange of options\u201d were being considered. Union leaders stressed they wanted to make sure their members\u2019 safety was protected, with one saying lifting the lockdown was \u201cfraught with danger\u201d. Nine Chelsea pensioners have died from Covid-19 The Royal Hospital Chelsea, the retirement home for British military veterans, which has 290 residents, made the announcement before VE Day on Friday. Five of the deaths occurred in the home, and four died while receiving hospital treatment elsewhere. A total of 58 of its residents, known as Chelsea pensioners, have recovered from the disease. Javid says the economy should be run hot The former chancellor Sajid Javid urged the government to go \u201cfar and as quick\u201d to help the economy recover from the impact of coronavirus. Javid, who left his post in Boris Johnson\u2019s government in February, said scientific advice needed to be acted upon, but the best course of action was \u201crunning the economy hot\u201d. The Bank of England warned that Covid-19 could lead to the economy plunging 14% this year, in the worst annual fall since records began. Global death toll nears 270,000 The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 268,999, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus. There are 3,846,949 confirmed cases. WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus Up to 190,000 people in Africa could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on prediction modelling and analysing 47 countries in the region. The organisation also warned that the virus could \u201csmoulder\u201d on the continent for years. The live blog will be pausing at 11am to observe the two minutes\u2019 silence marking the 75th VE Day anniversary. Rail services are set to increase later this month as part of the gradual easing of the lockdown Sources said there would be a gradual increase from 18 May. Rail unions have been involved in talks about the safety of workers and passengers when more trains run. Union leaders stressed they wanted to make sure their members\u2019 safety was protected, with one saying lifting the lockdown was \u201cfraught with danger\u201d. Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union said: \u201cThere is a headlong dash to lift the lockdown on our transport services for May 18 and it is fraught with danger for both passengers and staff alike. \u201cTo maintain the government\u2019s own social distancing guidance would mean huge logistical and staffing input to manage passenger flows onto trains and it is imperative that all staff involved in this process are properly protected. \u201cRMT will not compromise on the health, safety and livelihoods of our members and we will not agree to anything that fails to put the safety of staff and passengers first. \u201cIf that means advising our members not to work under conditions that are unsafe and in breach of the government\u2019s own guidelines then that is exactly what we will do.\u201d Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers\u2019 union Aslef said: \u201cWe want to help Britain return to what we knew as normal before the pandemic, and have agreed with the Department for Transport that we will increase the number of services when and where it is safe for passengers and for staff.\u201d A Department for Transport spokesman said: \u201cWe are examining a range of options on how transport can respond to support the recovery in a timely way when the time comes and it is safe to do so. \u201cWe continue to prepare for any scenario we might be asked to support.\u201d Historians have praised Florence Nightingale before the 200th anniversary of her birth, and said her legacy has \u201cnever been more relevant\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. Staff at the Florence Nightingale Museum in Westminster said her key nursing values \u2013 which focused on maintaining good hygiene, regularly washing hands and carrying out evidence-based practices \u2013 had been widely echoed over the past months. Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 and Tuesday also marks International Nurses Day. She developed these habits during the Crimean war, where, along with a small troupe of nurses, she tended soldiers\u2019 wounds and worked to improve hospital conditions. Her data-based work also helped shape modern nursing: founding the nursing school at St Thomas\u2019 hospital, developing palliative care and midwifery, and shaping the redesign of hospitals across the UK and the health system itself. Kristin Buhnemann, assistant director at the Florence Nightingale Museum, said: \u201cIn terms of modern nursing, her legacy has never been so relevant, as she was a pioneer for sanitation, hygiene and had a monumental impact on infection control today.\u201d Health leaders continue to use the concept of evidence-based healthcare, a theory Nightingale pioneered and advocated for and which is currently being used by the World Health Organization (WHO) to track and trace Covid-19 patients. Her passion for data saw her become the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society, while her invention of the coxcomb, an early version of a pie chart used to show Queen Victoria and her government the connection between cleanliness and the mortality rate of British soldiers, is being used today to combat the current pandemic. Elsewhere, her compassion towards nurses has also had an impact on modern practices, and historians have drawn parallels to the current PPE (personal protective equipment) crisis. Buhnemann, said: \u201cSo just like today\u2019s nurses, Nightingale risked her life to help others, and I believe she would be incredibly proud of the current healthcare workers.\u201d Premier League clubs opposed to the idea of playing their remaining matches at neutral venues once the competition restarts must realise people\u2019s lives are at stake and football concerns should take a back seat, police have said. Mark Roberts, the national lead for football policing, told Sky he was concerned about some of the comments he had heard regarding the conditions for restarting the league, which was suspended in mid-March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Discussions are continuing about resuming games after clubs were told only neutral venues approved from a health and safety point of view would be allowed. Brighton and Hove Albion\u2019s chief executive, Paul Barber, said his team were opposed to surrendering home advantage and Christian Purslow, his counterpart at Aston Villa, said relegation would be a \u00a3200m catastrophe. \u201cThe things that are starting to concern me a little as we get closer to a potential restart are comments we\u2019re hearing on the margins by people involved in football,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cComments such as \u2018we might get relegated\u2019, \u2018we don\u2019t want to play at neutral venues\u2019, \u2018when we played them away there were fans in the stadium\u2019, \u2018we play at home without fans that\u2019s a disadvantage\u2019, \u2018we want to get the trophy\u2019. \u201cI get this in a football context that these are all a big deal. But in the context where 30,000 people have died (in the UK) and the total is still going up, then it\u2019s not such a big deal. \u201cWe want to work with football ... get the season back going for the commercial reasons, for the morale reasons ... but we have to remind ourselves that cannot be at the risk of putting a single further life in jeopardy.\u201d Hello, I am updating the UK liveblog this morning. Please send any tips and stories to nazia.parveen@theguardian.com or follow me on Twitter @NParveenG to send me a message. Thank you. The editor-in-chief of the Lancet has said that the lockdown should remain in place until the beginning of June, warning of a second wave of the pandemic. Speaking to Nick Robinson on the Political Thinking podcast, Dr Richard Horton said: \u201cAbsolutely don\u2019t do it too fast. In Wuhan they locked down for 10 weeks and a lot of the epidemiological modelling shows that you need to lock down for around about 10 weeks. That takes us to 1 June. We locked down on 23-24 March. \u201cSo I really worry that if we come out of this too quickly, maybe two or weeks too quickly we could see the flare-up of a second wave and so I would say keep it in place until the end of May, to the beginning of June. \u201cThe danger both economic and the toll in deaths danger is so great. Those extra couple of weeks are worth it. I know it\u2019s painful but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d Horton also condemned the \u201ccorruption and collusion\u201d of scientific advice to the government during the pandemic. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think the system was self-critical enough. \u201cThere should have been more criticism \u2013 such as \u2018what if this isn\u2019t influenza, what if this is like a Sars-like virus, why don\u2019t we know what was taking place in China?\u2019 These questions weren\u2019t asked and you see it in some of the documents on Sage. \u201cThere was such a concern about the potential economic damage of raising the alarm. Some of the papers Sage were considering and Imperial College produced \u2013 they were trying to balance the concern about an epidemic with the potential concern for an economic hit. And I think that did lead to a pulling of punches.\u201d The full podcast is available here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08clg1w A nurse has received a Points of Light award from the prime minister for creating a book to help reduce anxiety in children caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. Molly Watts, a staff nurse on the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) at Southampton Children\u2019s Hospital, was thanked for her book Dave the Dog is worried about coronavirus, which she created in her spare time. The free online publication, which has now been published in paperback, has been downloaded more than 260,000 times in 164 countries, and was used in schools and nurseries to help ease the fears of children before the lockdown. It is one of a collection of titles Watts has written under her Nurse Dotty Books brand, which are often written and illustrated by her when she returns home from shifts on the unit. The Points of Light award is given by the prime minister to recognise those who are supporting their communities during the pandemic, with Captain Tom Moore being a high-profile recipient. In a letter to Watts Johnson wrote: \u201cYou have used your Nurse Dotty Books to help reduce the fear and anxiety that many young people have about coronavirus. \u201cAllow me also to express my deepest gratitude and admiration for your service to our country as a paediatric nurse in intensive care. \u201cTwenty-four hours a day, for every second of every hour, you and your colleagues are watching over your patients with the most astonishing devotion, precision and love. \u201cIt is why our whole nation is so immeasurably proud of our NHS and everyone who works within it and, on behalf of the whole country, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u201d Watts said: \u201cI am so honoured to receive this award, especially now when so many incredible people are doing so much to help others. \u201cThe fact that the story has reached so many children and that they have found it helpful is amazing to me.\u201d Visit http://www.nursedottybooks.com for more information and access to the books. Andy Serkis\u2019s continuous live reading of The Hobbit, starting online at 10am, has already raised \u00a3100,000 for charity. The actor, who has played Gollum, will read JRR Tolkien\u2019s 1937 novel from start to end. Money raised from the 56-year-old\u2019s expected 12-hour performance will be shared between NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings. The GoFundMe campaign has already received more than 7,000 donations from more than 70 countries and the campaign target has now been increased to \u00a3250,000. As a token of his appreciation, Serkis will choose a handful of donors at random and call them to say thank you for joining him on the journey. He said: \u201cI have been absolutely blown away by the response, both from those who have tuned in to watch along, and from those who have been generous enough to donate. I want to express my gratitude to every single person who has come on this journey with me. The difference that this money will make to these two amazing charities is huge, so thank you very much.\u201d Tune in to the live stream here. The residents of Cambrian Road in Chester dress up in 1945 clothing and have a social distancing tea party to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Although large-scale public events are unable to go ahead because of coronavirus restrictions, politicians and members of the royal family will pay tributes, alongside a host of other events as the nation remembers those who fought and died in the second world war. Kyle Walker claims he is being \u201charassed\u201d after admitting that he breached lockdown rules to visit his sister and parents. The Manchester City defender had been forced to issue an apology last month after media reports that he had hosted a party at his home. But Walker has hit back at the latest stories, saying he is being targeted and that the ongoing controversy is affecting his and his family\u2019s health. Walker admitted contravening coronavirus regulations again by visiting Sheffield to see his sister and his parents \u2013 for which he could be fined and cautioned by police. Boris Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley Johnson, has spoken of his delight after the prime minister named his baby boy Wilfred after his grandfather, a second world war RAF pilot. Stanley told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that Boris and Carrie have named their boy \u2026 after my father, Wilfred. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful strange feeling actually to see that this name is going to live on in this young boy. \u201cI actually broke the lockdown rule \u2026 but I went, I said \u2018there\u2019s bound to be something in the papers\u2019 and went across to the garage \u2026 I said \u2018I know I\u2019m not really meant to be out buying a newspaper, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s an essential journey, but I just think there\u2019s something in the paper today about my 14th grandchild.\u2019\u201d Johnson also spoke of his anxiety when the PM fell critically ill with Covid-19. \u201cI think I was as worried as any father would be if their child is at death\u2019s door \u2026 I make no bones about it, I said a prayer or two,\u201d he said. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the prime minister would on Sunday set out a \u201croad map\u201d for how England would begin to lift the lockdown restrictions. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: \u201cWe can start to look to the future but we\u2019ll have to do so in a very tentative and cautious way, so people should not expect big changes.\u201d He added: \u201cIf there is any indication that things are starting to get out of control, we won\u2019t hesitate to step back. \u201cBut people should be able to look forward to the weeks and months ahead to know where we are going and the order in which we are doing it.\u201d Meanwhile, the first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, reiterated that any changes made to the region\u2019s lockdown measures \u2013 extended for another three weeks on Thursday \u2013 would be \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cnuanced\u201d in order to keep the \u201cR-rate\u201d of infection below 1. She said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take any chances that it will go above the number 1 again. \u201cEverything will stay as it is. \u201cWe don\u2019t just look at the public health, of course that is the priority, we do have to look at the economic damage that is being done to our country and the societal damage and the wider health issues we have to take into account as well. \u201cWe will look to see if we can make minor amendments within those three weeks.\u201d The government should open up the economy \u201cas far and as quick\u201d as possible to recover from the economic impact of coronavirus, the former chancellor Sajid Javid has said. The Bank of England warned that Covid-19 could lead to the economy plunging 14% this year, in the worst annual fall since records began. Javid, who left his post in Boris Johnson\u2019s government in February, said scientific advice needed to be acted upon, but the best course of action was \u201crunning the economy hot\u201d. Official data suggests more than 36,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, while the number of cases has topped 200,000. Speaking to Sky News, Javid said the government was right to put the public health first but this had led to economic issues and a balance needed to be struck. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to co-exist with this virus for many months, if not potentially years. But we\u2019ve got to find a way forward and that does mean you\u2019re relaxing, as much as you can,\u201d he said. \u201cRunning the economy hot, you could say, in a way that you are trying to take into account, not just the sort of necessity to control the virus, but also the wider impact on society.\u201d Briefings from Downing Street about relaxation of lockdown were \u201centirely wrong and a foolish mistake\u201d, according to Scotland\u2019s deputy first minister John Swinney. Describing the briefings, which prompted celebratory headlines on Thursday morning and then fierce criticism about mixed messaging from No 10, as \u201ca disastrous piece of communications by the UK government\u201d, Swinney said that first minister Nicola Sturgeon had had a \u201chelpful discussion\u201d with the prime minister yesterday afternoon. Sturgeon has been clear that she believes lifting lockdown too quickly could be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d, with Scotland\u2019s infection curve behind the rest of the UK. He told BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme: \u201cIt gave the opportunity for the leaders of the devolved nations to express clearly to the prime minister the perspectives in different parts of the UK.\u201d Swinney said that the Downing Street response to the meeting, which stressed Johnson\u2019s \u201ccommitment to continuing our UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus, even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds\u201d, showed an important recognition of the \u201cimportance of following the science in different parts of the country\u201d. Responding to complaints overnight from the chief executive of Scottish Care, Donald Macaskill, that home care staff booking tests were being asked to travel to the other side of the country, Swinney said that the situation was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d. \u201cWe have to make sure that the capacity is used to the full throughout the country,\u201d he said. Children and staff at Breadsall primary school in Derby during a VE Day lunch party to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe: The UK will come together to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day and remember those who fought and died in the second world war, despite restrictions imposed due to coronavirus. Although large-scale public events are unable to go ahead, tributes will be paid by politicians and members of the royal family, as well as through a host of other events. Friday commemorates the official surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allied forces on 8 May 1945, following the second world war. Boris Johnson has written to veterans to assure them that, despite the ongoing lockdown, they and their efforts to defeat a \u201cruthless enemy\u201d would not be forgotten. \u201cWe cannot pay our tribute with the parades and street celebrations we enjoyed in the past; your loved ones may be unable to visit in person,\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cBut please allow us, your proud compatriots, to be the first to offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.\u201d The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, will also release a pre-recorded commemorative message to mark VE Day, and tributes will be offered by speakers in both the House of Commons and the Lords. A two-minute national silence will be observed at 11am to honour the memories of the British servicemen and women who gave their lives during the conflict. The silence will be led by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and broadcast from a location in Scotland, where they are self-isolating. At 9pm, the Queen will address the nation in a televised message \u2013 the exact moment her father, King George VI, gave a speech over the radio three-quarters of a century earlier. The lockdown is facing a major test from the long VE Day bank holiday weekend of warm weather, and concerns of mixed messaging ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement on easing restrictions. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said \u201cany changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental\u201d before the prime minister\u2019s address to the nation on Sunday evening. Raab admitted there could be minor rifts in efforts to maintain a UK-wide approach to tackling Covid-19, with Wales set to announce plans on Friday. But he told the public that the rules had not yet changed ahead of the long weekend to mark 75 years since VE Day, when victory was declared in Europe during the second world war. \u201cFor the moment it is really important, particularly as people look towards a warm bank holiday weekend, that we continue to follow the guidance in place at this time,\u201d Raab said. With official data suggesting more than 36,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, the PM will unveil his \u201croadmap\u201d for easing the lockdown in a broadcast to the nation at 7pm on Sunday. In other developments: The Royal Hospital Chelsea said nine Chelsea Pensioners had died of coronavirus-related conditions Tests continued to stay below the 100,000-a-day target, with 86,583 conducted in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday The nation clapped from their windows and doorsteps for the seventh week in a row to show their appreciation of NHS workers and other carers.

Dire economic forecasts released this week, including a Bank of England warning that the country faces its worst recession in 300 years, has prompted Labour to rapidly escalate its call for current protections for the rented sector, like the three-month ban on evictions in England and Wales, to be extended. People should be given two years to pay back rent arrears accrued because of the coronavirus crisis, Labour has suggested, in a five-point plan due to be presented to the government. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow secretary of state for housing, said: \u201cCurrent protections for people renting their homes are woefully inadequate. Unless the government acts now, many thousands of tenants will be at risk of losing their homes.\u201d She warned of an \u201cunprecedented and devastating spike\u201d in homelessness unless action is taken soon. YouGov polling for the charity Shelter found that one in five private renters in England \u2013 an estimated 1.7 million adults \u2013 say they are likely to lose their job in the next three months because of coronavirus. The housing charity is warning that a growing number of people will need to rely on welfare benefits for the first time to cover their basic costs. The government banned any new evictions of private rented sector tenants for three months in March as part of the emergency coronavirus laws drawn up at the start of the crisis.

We use the opportunity to talk a lot of the time, about her history. We do our own things too, we might watch television, I do a bit of gardening. I appreciate that my mother is so sparky. She has courage, and I think that\u2019s wonderful. Even though I hanker for being home, I haven\u2019t been down all that much.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-the-first-50-days\">Australia's coronavirus lockdown \u2013 the first 50 days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I spent eight years looking after my husband. The last two years, when he was really gravely ill, were very difficult. He died last September. This was thrown at me a couple of months later, so the grieving process has been disrupted. But I feel stronger. He was a brilliant man, and we had a wonderful life together. I listen to a lot of podcasts now, and it reminds me of the intellectual conversations I used to have with my husband.</p> <p>I\u2019ve well and truly left my teenage stage behind, and I\u2019m quite grateful for that. It would be quite terrible if I was here, and my mother was running after me, like she keeps promising to do. She keeps saying to me, \u2018Well I should be doing something for you.\u2019 It probably would have been very confronting if I\u2019d done this forty years ago. Now I appreciate how precious this time we have together is.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Obviously keeping a routine would be helpful, but I\u2019m not doing that\u2019 \u2013 James*</strong></h2> <p>When you move back in with your parents, you work out a way to not be there as much. You basically just sleep there. I moved back in with my mother temporarily right before Christmas. I was planning to move out again when the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. I remember the date, it was 12 March. My stepdad is very unwell, and so I called my work and started to organise working from home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e985dd19922225b0040fd7f058fffb1d74b8463\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e985dd19922225b0040fd7f058fffb1d74b8463/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Removalists on Bondi Road, Bondi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was planning to move out again when the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My parents thought they were doing the social distancing thing, but they don\u2019t understand how to do it. My mum kept going to work, and my stepdad kept doing \u201cretired man stuff\u201d, like going to lunch. The day they closed the restaurants, they had a dinner party here. I\u2019d been inside for two weeks already, so I was pretty tense. No one washed their hands. It was really messy. Some guests had just got back from overseas. People were sharing food with their hands. I remember muttering to my mum: \u201cWell we\u2019re all dead\u201d. Some people are not taking this situation seriously enough. I can safely say I\u2019m taking it too seriously. They\u2019re better at social distancing now though.</p> <p>I work in the arts, and I\u2019ve lost my job now. I sleep how cave rats sleep, in four hour blocks. It\u2019s been tense. I\u2019m drinking a lot more. But I\u2019m sure there are people much worse off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cabf1af256d1c812fdaba3f6a62a30ec8d0a6f51\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cabf1af256d1c812fdaba3f6a62a30ec8d0a6f51/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"For lease sign at Bondi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I now feel very nihilistic.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now we\u2019re all forced to be with each other all the time, there\u2019s been a lot of arguing.

If someone invited me to a party now, I would probably go \u2013 but now everyone\u2019s taking it seriously. I feel like I got in too early, like I\u2019ve been social distancing for six months.</p> <p>My mental health is in the toilet. As far as us all living with each other, I think they\u2019re being pretty patient with how bananas I\u2019ve gone. But I also love to complain.

I was supposed to be here until the end of March.

I live alone back in Manchester and I haven\u2019t lived with my parents in about 12 years, so it\u2019s been an adjustment.</p> <p>My parents have always been 100% supportive. My mum bakes me delicious pink cakes and she\u2019s teaching me how to cook. I am learning how to make some curries while I\u2019m here, traditional Tamil cooking. We\u2019re slowly increasing the difficulty levels.</p> <p>My parents also look after my nephew and niece, so they spend a lot of time with them, and I do as well. But my parents also give me a lot of space. I\u2019ll remember my lockdown as a time of trashy gay romance novels and TikTok. My work is quite emotionally draining, and it\u2019s been a wonderful escape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fef85df067dc39e08d0b303cb8f82a071e5fa26d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fef85df067dc39e08d0b303cb8f82a071e5fa26d/0_0_5200_3466/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baking tray with six iced cupcakes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My mum bakes me delicious pink cakes and she\u2019s teaching me how to cook.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raphye Alexius/Getty Images/Image Source</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Given that there\u2019s been so many stories about people in lockdown with abusive partners or parents, especially in the context of LGBTIQ people, I am so lucky. My parents don\u2019t police my behaviour, or ask me to do too much.</p> <p>My parents have always done a lot of domestic stuff, and never expected or asked us to do it. I try to help out, and my parents are like \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 My mum gets quite upset if I say thank you \u2013 she says, \u2018Why are you thanking me? I\u2019m not a stranger, I\u2019m your mother.\u2019 It\u2019s endearing but also reflects a cultural dynamic that I think other families don\u2019t really have, in terms of how parents relate to their kids when they\u2019re back home.</p> <p>In some ways it\u2019s been like becoming a teenager again. I\u2019ve certainly become more lazy, given the inability to go out.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I started to freak out about the amount of diabetics in ICU\u2019 \u2013 Katie*</strong></h2> <p>I was meant to move overseas in late April. I had been working to pack my life up, and live with my parents for a bit, but that got brought forward. I have Type 1 diabetes and as news reports started to come in, I was freaking out about having contact with anything to do with coronavirus. I was meant to live here for a month and basically, I haven\u2019t moved out. I don\u2019t really want to interact with the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"383769e619db21bb4580c6bd830e776ffbf11216\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/383769e619db21bb4580c6bd830e776ffbf11216/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Royal Melbourne Hospital Head of Intensive Care Unit (ICU).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My parents are really happy for me to be here, because they\u2019ve been concerned from the start from a health perspective.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We all agreed to follow the same level of restrictions, to limit it coming into the house.

My parents have compromised to meet that level of restriction.</p> <p>I feel really lucky. As a freelancer not having to pay rent has been a plus, since my work has been affected. I\u2019m doing all the cooking because I\u2019m not paying rent.

We do our own things too, we might watch television, I do a bit of gardening. I appreciate that my mother is so sparky. She has courage, and I think that\u2019s wonderful. Even though I hanker for being home, I haven\u2019t been down all that much. I spent eight years looking after my husband. The last two years, when he was really gravely ill, were very difficult. He died last September. This was thrown at me a couple of months later, so the grieving process has been disrupted. But I feel stronger. He was a brilliant man, and we had a wonderful life together. I listen to a lot of podcasts now, and it reminds me of the intellectual conversations I used to have with my husband. I\u2019ve well and truly left my teenage stage behind, and I\u2019m quite grateful for that. It would be quite terrible if I was here, and my mother was running after me, like she keeps promising to do. She keeps saying to me, \u2018Well I should be doing something for you.\u2019 It probably would have been very confronting if I\u2019d done this forty years ago. Now I appreciate how precious this time we have together is. \u2018Obviously keeping a routine would be helpful, but I\u2019m not doing that\u2019 \u2013 James* When you move back in with your parents, you work out a way to not be there as much. You basically just sleep there. I moved back in with my mother temporarily right before Christmas. I was planning to move out again when the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. I remember the date, it was 12 March. My stepdad is very unwell, and so I called my work and started to organise working from home. My parents thought they were doing the social distancing thing, but they don\u2019t understand how to do it. My mum kept going to work, and my stepdad kept doing \u201cretired man stuff\u201d, like going to lunch. The day they closed the restaurants, they had a dinner party here. I\u2019d been inside for two weeks already, so I was pretty tense. No one washed their hands. It was really messy. Some guests had just got back from overseas. People were sharing food with their hands. I remember muttering to my mum: \u201cWell we\u2019re all dead\u201d. Some people are not taking this situation seriously enough. I can safely say I\u2019m taking it too seriously. They\u2019re better at social distancing now though. I work in the arts, and I\u2019ve lost my job now. I sleep how cave rats sleep, in four hour blocks. It\u2019s been tense. I\u2019m drinking a lot more. But I\u2019m sure there are people much worse off. Now we\u2019re all forced to be with each other all the time, there\u2019s been a lot of arguing. Bringing up stuff that was there for a long time that we\u2019ve never discussed. Sometimes it\u2019s things that happened 20 years ago. I\u2019m cleaning a lot more and I\u2019m a better house guest now. But because I started early, I now feel very nihilistic. If someone invited me to a party now, I would probably go \u2013 but now everyone\u2019s taking it seriously. I feel like I got in too early, like I\u2019ve been social distancing for six months. My mental health is in the toilet. As far as us all living with each other, I think they\u2019re being pretty patient with how bananas I\u2019ve gone. But I also love to complain. Really, it\u2019s fine. \u2018I\u2019m hyper aware of how lucky I am\u2019 \u2013 Senthorun Raj I came back to Australia for a fellowship, to launch my book and to check up on family and spend time with them. I was supposed to be here until the end of March. When the lockdowns started happening, I thought \u2018should I try and get an earlier flight?\u2019 I decided to stay here, and given everything that\u2019s happened, I think I\u2019ve made the right choice. I live alone back in Manchester and I haven\u2019t lived with my parents in about 12 years, so it\u2019s been an adjustment. My parents have always been 100% supportive. My mum bakes me delicious pink cakes and she\u2019s teaching me how to cook. I am learning how to make some curries while I\u2019m here, traditional Tamil cooking. We\u2019re slowly increasing the difficulty levels. My parents also look after my nephew and niece, so they spend a lot of time with them, and I do as well. But my parents also give me a lot of space. I\u2019ll remember my lockdown as a time of trashy gay romance novels and TikTok. My work is quite emotionally draining, and it\u2019s been a wonderful escape. Given that there\u2019s been so many stories about people in lockdown with abusive partners or parents, especially in the context of LGBTIQ people, I am so lucky. My parents don\u2019t police my behaviour, or ask me to do too much. My parents have always done a lot of domestic stuff, and never expected or asked us to do it. I try to help out, and my parents are like \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 My mum gets quite upset if I say thank you \u2013 she says, \u2018Why are you thanking me? I\u2019m not a stranger, I\u2019m your mother.\u2019 It\u2019s endearing but also reflects a cultural dynamic that I think other families don\u2019t really have, in terms of how parents relate to their kids when they\u2019re back home. In some ways it\u2019s been like becoming a teenager again. I\u2019ve certainly become more lazy, given the inability to go out. \u2018I started to freak out about the amount of diabetics in ICU\u2019 \u2013 Katie* I was meant to move overseas in late April. I had been working to pack my life up, and live with my parents for a bit, but that got brought forward. I have Type 1 diabetes and as news reports started to come in, I was freaking out about having contact with anything to do with coronavirus. I was meant to live here for a month and basically, I haven\u2019t moved out. I don\u2019t really want to interact with the world. We all agreed to follow the same level of restrictions, to limit it coming into the house. If there\u2019s outside interaction there\u2019s a process, if there\u2019s a delivery, there\u2019s a cleaning process. My parents have compromised to meet that level of restriction. I feel really lucky. As a freelancer not having to pay rent has been a plus, since my work has been affected. I\u2019m doing all the cooking because I\u2019m not paying rent. I\u2019ve also been doing work round the house to try and contribute \u2013 those are suggestions I\u2019ve made, they didn\u2019t ask that of me, but it\u2019s been received well. But my parents are Boomers and we don\u2019t agree in terms of politics and world views, so conversation\u2019s not great. But we\u2019ve agreed to have dinner together every night. I definitely think there\u2019s elements of regression, but I\u2019m hopefully better at dealing with them now, given I\u2019m 33. I definitely don\u2019t feel good about myself when I can sense there\u2019s a learned frustration that hasn\u2019t been worked through. We\u2019re way out in the suburbs. There\u2019s some space in the house, so I can walk away. But I can\u2019t just leave if it gets tense, so I\u2019m being more amicable. I call on my friends a lot more, in terms of calls and texts, so I can get social contact from other places. My plans to move overseas are probably not going to happen now, so I\u2019m in a transient phase. I\u2019m mentally struggling with the isolation, that\u2019s been the hardest thing to deal with. I don\u2019t think before Covid I would ever have done a video call, but that\u2019s been really helpful for me in terms of staying sane. At this point I\u2019m planning to be here probably until at least July. My parents are really happy for me to be here, because they\u2019ve been concerned from the start from a health perspective. I\u2019m lucky that they\u2019re comfortable with me staying, until we move into whatever a new normal life looks like. *Names have been changed",

      "body": "<p>\u201cLet\u2019s not give everything back, let\u2019s not throw away all the progress we\u2019ve made by letting our frustration get the better of us.\u201d This was Daniel Andrews on Friday afternoon, shortly after national cabinet resolved to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/the-three-step-plan-to-relax-restrictions-and-reopen-australia-after-coronavirus-crisis\">gradually restart economic and social activity by July</a>.</p> \n<p>The Victorian premier wanted people to understand he\u2019d be hastening slowly \u2013 the message being here in the Massachusetts of Australia, we decide how quickly we\u2019ll remove coronavirus restrictions. We don\u2019t apply an arbitrary national average.</p> \n<p>Minutes before that, Scott Morrison was jutting out his chin in Canberra. Have you noticed this unconscious habit of the prime minister\u2019s? When Morrison intends to be resolute, or because he can\u2019t smother his impatience, he juts out his chin. This body language generally means shut it mate, I\u2019m talking. The prime ministerial chin was duly jutted, and Morrison declared that fresh outbreaks of the coronavirus after the easing of restrictions would not, repeat, n-o-t, be a reason to reverse course. Premiers just needed to hold their nerve.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/scott-morrison-details-australias-three-step-path-out-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">Scott Morrison details Australia's three-step path out of coronavirus lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Just for the record, Morrison declined to nominate a threshold at which this collective holding of nerves might shatter. At the moment, the big states are recording sub-30 numbers of Covid-19 cases a day. If there were 500 new cases a day after the resumption of normal activities, would Gladys, Daniel, Steven, Annastacia, Mark, Michael, Andrew and Peter still be commanded to hold their nerve \u2013 or might we all have to do something else \u2013 like try to shove the Covid-19 genie back in the bottle?</p> \n<p>Between these two moments on Friday afternoon, 8 May 2020 \u2013 Morrison, bullish, in Canberra, and Andrews, bearish, in Melbourne \u2013 the Australian federation piloted out of phase one of managing the coronavirus pandemic. We entered phase two.</p> \n<p>Given this pandemic messes with everything, and messes with our shared sense of time most of all, it\u2019s important to mark these important pivot points when they are tangible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/the-two-meetings-that-changed-the-trajectory-of-australias-coronavirus-response\">Phase one in Australia spanned 20 January to 8 May</a>. Now we\u2019ve moved to phase two \u2013 May to July.</p> \n<p>Phase one was about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2020/apr/08/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-your-questions-on-testing-and-community-transmission-answered\">flattening the curve</a>.</p> \n<p>Phase two is about learning to live with a virus we can\u2019t eradicate.</p> \n<p>Perhaps it can be eradicated in time, with a vaccine, but for now, Covid-19 lives with us and we with it. Over the next couple of months Australians are participants in a live social experiment: what does living with coronavirus look like? How far can we go with reinstating normalcy without inviting the diabolical scenes that have played out elsewhere?</p> \n<p>Something to note. During phase one, the tempo of the public health response was set by the two most populous states \u2013 the jurisdictions with the most risks to manage. By championing lockdowns in the third week of March, and making it clear they would lock down non-essential services whether anyone else agreed or not, New South Wales and Victoria in essence forced the other states to follow suit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/the-three-step-plan-to-relax-restrictions-and-reopen-australia-after-coronavirus-crisis\">The three-step plan for reopening Australia after Covid-19 and what Stage 1, 2 and 3 looks like</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Politically, it would have been impossible at that time for the smaller states to resist that centre of gravity, because then some premiers would be in a position of appearing to not care about saving lives as much as others did. That\u2019s a big problem: if you are Steven Marshall, and you tell the people of South Australia there\u2019s no need to lock down here, and then a significant of cluster of infections suddenly emerges, making a liar of you. A problem. One you\u2019d want to avoid, and one you can avoid by remaining in the herd.</p> \n<p>On Friday, when we jumped over the threshold into phase two, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-australia-live-news-national-cabinet-scott-morrison-nsw-victoria-lockdown-economy-latest-updates\">the herd split</a>. The smaller states ran back in the other direction, flagging easing, while NSW and Victoria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/nsw-and-victoria-hold-firm-on-coronavirus-restrictions-as-queensland-eases-rules\">are continuing to telegraph their intention to move very carefully</a>, because the circumstances are quantifiably different in Sydney and Melbourne.</p> \n<p>The confident articulation of different strategies tells us a couple of things: the national cabinet is getting better at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/as-australia-goes-off-the-coronavirus-cliff-the-question-is-how-hard-will-it-land\">finding ways to agree to disagree</a> and explain their disagreements to people watching on. It also tells us that the success of the opening phase of managing the pandemic has given the nine governments of Australia some political capital to take risks they were not prepared to take only a month ago.</p> \n<p>I\u2019m sure many Australians will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/essential-poll-australians-warm-to-easing-of-covid-19-restrictions-but-are-divided-on-schools\">happy to resume something approximating normal life</a> over the coming months, even if they pick up their former habits very tentatively. I\u2019m also certain governments, all of them, federal and state, are moving now because they have more confidence than they did two months ago that the health system can cope with what the winter brings. Governments have used the opening months of this pandemic here to fortify the health system: investing in more intensive care capacity, more protective equipment, more ventilators.</p> \n<p>We are not moving now because Morrison has always been an undeclared herd immunity disciple, restrained by saintly premiers. That is a caricature of the deliberative dynamic inside the national cabinet. Balancing the various trade-offs is more complicated, and Morrison is right to be concerned both about the health effects and the economic impacts. A pandemic of unemployment could be as devastating as a coronavirus pandemic. That\u2019s not spin. That\u2019s reality. That\u2019s what previous recessions have taught us.</p> \n<p>But we do need to be clear that moving to phase two contains plenty of risk, both practical and political. Right now, in the states that are moving to ease restrictions, the war gaming is about how to switch the messaging.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For some weeks, political leaders and their health advisers have been bringing people a steady stream of good news of declining case numbers. The successful containment of the outbreak has been held up as the hallmark of success. But when restrictions ease, the number of infections will most likely rise.</p> \n<p>So what do you say then? Do you say don\u2019t worry, it is OK for the number of cases to rise now, because our measures of success have changed?</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a can of worms, that argument. It\u2019s a can of worms, because it leads you to a place where the trade-offs become explicit. More normalcy has a price. The price is more infections, and more lives lost.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLet\u2019s not give everything back, let\u2019s not throw away all the progress we\u2019ve made by letting our frustration get the better of us.\u201d This was Daniel Andrews on Friday afternoon, shortly after national cabinet resolved to gradually restart economic and social activity by July. The Victorian premier wanted people to understand he\u2019d be hastening slowly \u2013 the message being here in the Massachusetts of Australia, we decide how quickly we\u2019ll remove coronavirus restrictions. We don\u2019t apply an arbitrary national average. Minutes before that, Scott Morrison was jutting out his chin in Canberra. Have you noticed this unconscious habit of the prime minister\u2019s? When Morrison intends to be resolute, or because he can\u2019t smother his impatience, he juts out his chin. This body language generally means shut it mate, I\u2019m talking. The prime ministerial chin was duly jutted, and Morrison declared that fresh outbreaks of the coronavirus after the easing of restrictions would not, repeat, n-o-t, be a reason to reverse course. Premiers just needed to hold their nerve. Just for the record, Morrison declined to nominate a threshold at which this collective holding of nerves might shatter. At the moment, the big states are recording sub-30 numbers of Covid-19 cases a day. If there were 500 new cases a day after the resumption of normal activities, would Gladys, Daniel, Steven, Annastacia, Mark, Michael, Andrew and Peter still be commanded to hold their nerve \u2013 or might we all have to do something else \u2013 like try to shove the Covid-19 genie back in the bottle? Between these two moments on Friday afternoon, 8 May 2020 \u2013 Morrison, bullish, in Canberra, and Andrews, bearish, in Melbourne \u2013 the Australian federation piloted out of phase one of managing the coronavirus pandemic. We entered phase two. Given this pandemic messes with everything, and messes with our shared sense of time most of all, it\u2019s important to mark these important pivot points when they are tangible. Phase one in Australia spanned 20 January to 8 May. Now we\u2019ve moved to phase two \u2013 May to July. Phase one was about flattening the curve. Phase two is about learning to live with a virus we can\u2019t eradicate. Perhaps it can be eradicated in time, with a vaccine, but for now, Covid-19 lives with us and we with it. Over the next couple of months Australians are participants in a live social experiment: what does living with coronavirus look like? How far can we go with reinstating normalcy without inviting the diabolical scenes that have played out elsewhere? Something to note. During phase one, the tempo of the public health response was set by the two most populous states \u2013 the jurisdictions with the most risks to manage. By championing lockdowns in the third week of March, and making it clear they would lock down non-essential services whether anyone else agreed or not, New South Wales and Victoria in essence forced the other states to follow suit. Politically, it would have been impossible at that time for the smaller states to resist that centre of gravity, because then some premiers would be in a position of appearing to not care about saving lives as much as others did. That\u2019s a big problem: if you are Steven Marshall, and you tell the people of South Australia there\u2019s no need to lock down here, and then a significant of cluster of infections suddenly emerges, making a liar of you. A problem. One you\u2019d want to avoid, and one you can avoid by remaining in the herd. On Friday, when we jumped over the threshold into phase two, the herd split. The smaller states ran back in the other direction, flagging easing, while NSW and Victoria are continuing to telegraph their intention to move very carefully, because the circumstances are quantifiably different in Sydney and Melbourne. The confident articulation of different strategies tells us a couple of things: the national cabinet is getting better at finding ways to agree to disagree and explain their disagreements to people watching on. It also tells us that the success of the opening phase of managing the pandemic has given the nine governments of Australia some political capital to take risks they were not prepared to take only a month ago. I\u2019m sure many Australians will be happy to resume something approximating normal life over the coming months, even if they pick up their former habits very tentatively. I\u2019m also certain governments, all of them, federal and state, are moving now because they have more confidence than they did two months ago that the health system can cope with what the winter brings. Governments have used the opening months of this pandemic here to fortify the health system: investing in more intensive care capacity, more protective equipment, more ventilators. We are not moving now because Morrison has always been an undeclared herd immunity disciple, restrained by saintly premiers. That is a caricature of the deliberative dynamic inside the national cabinet. Balancing the various trade-offs is more complicated, and Morrison is right to be concerned both about the health effects and the economic impacts. A pandemic of unemployment could be as devastating as a coronavirus pandemic. That\u2019s not spin. That\u2019s reality. That\u2019s what previous recessions have taught us. But we do need to be clear that moving to phase two contains plenty of risk, both practical and political. Right now, in the states that are moving to ease restrictions, the war gaming is about how to switch the messaging. For some weeks, political leaders and their health advisers have been bringing people a steady stream of good news of declining case numbers. The successful containment of the outbreak has been held up as the hallmark of success. But when restrictions ease, the number of infections will most likely rise. So what do you say then? Do you say don\u2019t worry, it is OK for the number of cases to rise now, because our measures of success have changed? It\u2019s a can of worms, that argument. It\u2019s a can of worms, because it leads you to a place where the trade-offs become explicit. More normalcy has a price. The price is more infections, and more lives lost. It\u2019s not quite an unavoidable fact, because the future is yet to reveal itself, but it is an unavoidable likelihood of plotting a path back from lockdowns. I said a moment ago the competent management of the outbreak has given governments some political capital to take risks. I believe that\u2019s right. But there\u2019s a flipside of competence, and it\u2019s this. If the governments of Australia had been hopeless, callous and incompetent, like the Trump administration, public expectations of what governments do in a crisis would be different. People would not have formed positive views that their governments \u2013 federal and state \u2013 would work assiduously to keep them well, and keep them supported during a pandemic. Expectations would be low. As it stands, governments here have shown Australians they care about the health and wellbeing of citizens. They\u2019ve set a high bar for themselves, and they are likely to be judged by the standard they\u2019ve set. Success has created a set of community expectations that will be challenging to shift. Added to this is the return of normalcy also means a return to political normalcy for Morrison after a period where hostilities have been suspended. Parliament resumes next week. Anthony Albanese on Monday will set out his views on what a post-Covid Australia looks like, and the problems of old haven\u2019t gone away \u2013 the travails of Angus Taylor, the mess of sports rorts both remain visible in the peripheral vision.",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\u201d Winston Churchill might not have had the coronavirus pandemic in mind when trotting out that particular gem, but trust him to find the right words almost a century before the fact. The Churchillian equivalent of \u201ckeep calm and carry on\u201d is a mantra embraced by much of society right now, and sport is no different. While health remains the primary concern in all walks of life, sporting bodies the world over have found themselves engaged in sessions of radical thinking to stave off looming economic ruin. In what predicament other than a global crisis could the term \u201cNRL Island\u201d be anything other than a genius concept for reality television? Stationing all NRL players and staff on an island off Queensland has, thankfully, remained nothing more than an interesting idea. Other domestic codes such as AFL and netball can now also begin to plan for brighter times ahead, but most sports are still mired in the dilemma of what to do next. And desperate times are calling for desperate measures. Cricket, both in Australia and overseas, has been left financially bereft by the Covid-19 crisis. Cricket Australia has already lost tens of millions of dollars and the damage could run into the hundreds of millions if future series fall by the wayside. The England and Wales Cricket Board, too, is in distress, this week assessing a $730m hole blown into the coffers. It has been reported the ECB wants Australia to tour in September to help claw back some of its lost pounds. Quite how wise it would be to leave the safety of home and travel to the UK, now second only to the United States in terms of Covid-19 deaths, is open to debate. But stranger things have happened. \u201cHopefully there\u2019s some cricket played in England this year,\u201d said the Australia batsman Marnus Labuschagne. \u201cI\u2019m itching to play cricket so if they come up with a match anywhere, it\u2019d be nice to play.\u201d Possibly the boldest idea \u2013 or craziest, depending on your viewpoint or grip on reality \u2013 to get a competition back up and running has involved England\u2019s Premier League, which has been dormant since 13 March. While the league\u2019s own Project Restart has been musing over a six-week \u201cfestival of football\u201d to play out the season\u2019s remaining 92 matches, wheels have been spinning elsewhere to take the whole kit and kaboodle to Perth. Perth, Western Australia. Not Perth, Scotland. First mooted by the WA businessman John Higgins, the proposal to bring players and staff of the Premier League\u2019s 20 clubs to Perth is being championed by the player agent Gary Williams. \u201cIt would involve about 1,500 players and officials coming into the country and spending a couple of weeks in quarantine,\u201d Williams told The World Game. \u201cAs long as the safety aspects are dealt with properly then there\u2019s no reason it wouldn\u2019t be sanctioned. There\u2019s a lot of positivity about from the clubs we\u2019ve spoken to.\u201d WA has recorded 0.03% of coronavirus-related deaths so the idea has merit on the health and safety front, but WA\u2019s closed borders would present a significant hurdle to overcome. Germany\u2019s Bundesliga will be the first major European football league to make a comeback after officials this week announced a 16 May restart date. But the Germans have been beaten to the punch by South Korea, the K-League having resumed on Friday. The restrictions are predictably austere: no fans, no bottle sharing, no emission of bodily fluids. \u201cExcessive spitting or blowing of the nose is prohibited and players should refrain from close conversations,\u201d said the K-League communication officer, Woo Cheoung-sik. Baseball was the first sport in South Korea to resume competition, this week\u2019s first match between SK Wyverns and Hanwha Eagles being played in front of a cardboard crowd, masked cheerleaders and with a strict no-tobacco-chewing policy. The Ultimate Fighting Championship this weekend becomes the first major United States sporting body to return to action with the staging of UFC 249 in Florida, an event that will feature US-based fighters only. But it is what is to come that has fans of mixed martial arts drooling. The UFC president, Dana White, might not be given to mimicry, but there is a sense of parallel between the NRL Island concept and his strategy to return international fighters to the octagon. White claims to have secured a remote island \u2013 he isn\u2019t saying where \u2013 that could host fights as soon as next month. \u201cThe infrastructure is being put in now. This place is literally going to be a UFC Fight Island,\u201d White told Sports Illustrated. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna use it a lot until the world gets normal again. We\u2019re gonna need it for our international fights \u2014 a place where people can fly in and out easily, without needing a bunch of visas and red tape.\u201d It might seem like the world has gone mad, but it is no more than needs-must at a time when the cost of Covid-19 can be expressed in dollars per second. \u201cTime and money are largely interchangeable terms.\u201d Thanks, Winston.",

      "bodyText": "The Queen led tributes to the wartime generation on Friday night, recalling the \u201cnever give up, never despair\u201d message of VE Day as the country marked the 75th anniversary of victory in Europe. In a special broadcast, on a unique day of remembrance, reflection and celebration taking place during the coronavirus lockdown, she said: \u201cToday it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish. Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. \u201cBut our streets are not empty: they are filled with the love and care that we have for each other. And, when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.\u201d The country united during a two-minute silence at 11am as people stood, heads bowed at front doors in bunting-lined streets, and wreaths were laid at war memorials in small, physically-distanced ceremonies. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall led the national moment of remembrance, paying their respects in Scotland at the Balmoral war memorial , placing a wreath and bouquet of spring flowers from their garden at nearby Birkhall as a lone piper played. A cannon at Edinburgh castle started and ended the silence, as a Spitfire flypast soared over the iconic white cliffs of Dover. Earlier, the Red Arrows streamed red, white and blue as they roared over central London, passing above The Mall, now deserted but which was to have been packed with thousands ahead of a veterans parade and the scene of joyful reunions with old comrades. RAF Typhoon jets performed flypasts over Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Extracts from Churchill\u2019s historic victory speech were broadcast, followed by the \u201cNation\u2019s Toast\u201d: \u201cTo those who gave so much, we thank you.\u201d Royal Navy warships and support vessels blasted their sirens to mark the occasion. Messages such as We Will Meet Again and Thank You were etched in the sky above Henstridge airfield in Somerset. With original elaborate plans hastily rearranged because of Covid-19, the wartime generation who Boris Johnson said had \u201ccarried the fate of freedom on their shoulders\u201d were confined to their homes. Crowded street parties, one of the defining images of VE Day, are banned. But even strict social distancing measures could not mute the mood of celebration, as households across the country evoked the spirit of the 1940s, some dressing in period costume and hosting household tea parties.

It may not have been the day planned, but VE Day 75 will itself become a part of history. Speaking at the same hour her father, George VI, delivered his historic broadcast on a \u201cgreat deliverance\u201d 75 years ago, the Queen paid tribute to the many who \u201claid down their lives in that terrible conflict\u201d and died \u201cso we could live as free people in a world of free nations\u201d. \u201cWe should and will remember them,\u201d she said.

Globally, the grim consensus is the end of isolation won\u2019t be the end of the music industry\u2019s pain; Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/music/department-of-health-clarifies-comments-music-festivals-2657777\">has said festivals and nightclubs</a> would likely be some of the last social activities to return, even as restrictions ease.</p> <p>Until then, Noonan has advice. \u201cUnless you\u2019re on a major performing arts company salary, please don\u2019t share your content for free because it perpetuates this horrible myth that your art is not worth paying for,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cI think we should starve the internet of content and then re-emerge as a beautiful Phoenix from the ashes \u2026 and everyone has a paywall. It can be two bucks, it can be five or 10 bucks, whatever, but it has to be something.\u201d</p> <p>Some artists have already turned to new platforms to ensure Facebook and Instagram aren\u2019t the only ones to profit. As Emma Swift \u2013 a Nashville-based Australian songwriter \u2013 puts it, \u201cThere is no reason we should give Mark Zuckerberg or his company content for free.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should starve the internet of content and then re-emerge as a beautiful Phoenix from the ashes</p> <footer> <cite>Katie Noonan, singer-songwriter and musical director</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, Swift uses <a href=\"https://www.stageit.com/site/landing\">Stageit</a> to play gigs with cult musician Robyn Hitchcock, because it\u2019s ticketed and has an option to tip. \u201cIt\u2019s the online format that to me is most like a proper, paid show,\u201d says Swift. \u201cIf gig streaming is to continue \u2026 playing for free or playing for tips is not sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>Promisingly, hybrids with one foot back on the sticky carpet are emerging \u2013 not Silicon Valley goliaths but small, agile venues dedicated to their communities. Their learning curve will be steep. It\u2019s not only how to mic up the drums so they actually sound good online \u2013 it\u2019s the nerd stuff: cookies, speed tests, private browsers and spinning wheels of death.</p> <p>Late last week in Sydney\u2019s inner west, tiny venue <a href=\"https://www.moshpitbar.com.au/\">MoshPit</a> finally got permission from police to stage and stream its first crowdless, barless gig, professionally recorded with schmick rented gear, ticketed at $10. A studio in St Peters and a jazz bar in Dulwich Hill are doing something similar, says MoshPit co- owner Pat Jones. Last Saturday, the first gig, he had been prepped to pay the artist and, crucially, a skeleton crew and a few casual staff he\u2019d been unable to enrol in jobkeeper. A few hours after the gig was announced came a \u201csuper gutted\u201d follow-up post. That familiar word, \u201ccancelled\u201d. NBN issues. So it goes.</p> <p><br></p>",

When Covid-19 struck \u201cit was a time of panic\u201d, he said. \u201cA different tier of artists, and a bigger group, are being asked to play for free now.\u201d Maclean has been approached by a variety of different types of organisations wanting him to play for free, including a major touring company, a small arts organisation, and a music events startup; the latter asked for \u201ca 15 minute performance, broadcasting all over the world, but no mention of pay\u201d. He performed a livestream for Together Fest which directed people to donate to Support Act, but didn\u2019t pay performers \u2013 despite being run by a major ticketing company. \u201cI play a lot of fundraisers [that pay] \u2013 I don\u2019t see why these ones can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, they could\u2019ve given me $50 and I would\u2019ve been like, \u2018Neat! $50!\u2019 \u2026 I don\u2019t think we should be getting used to playing fundraisers for free.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, a Ticketmaster spokesperson said the festival\u2019s streams brought more than 150 direct links to the Support Act donation site. \u201cAll the feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive,\u201d they said. As for Isolaid, Maclean says his experience was \u201cfine\u201d but \u201cI won\u2019t be doing any more. Musicians shouldn\u2019t just be used for charity and at some point, you have to go \u2018OK enough\u2019.\u201d Singer-songwriter Jen Cloher, on the other hand, enjoyed Isolaid so much she started a weekly show on Instagram called Lesbian Play School. \u201cYes there will be gross corporate evil things that come from this time,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I was playing to my fans [all over the world] all at once. I was playing to children, older people, people who told me \u2018I hate going to gigs and getting crushed\u2019 and \u2026 to people who have disabilities.\u201d She agrees, however, that \u201cfuture livestreaming needs to be and will be monetised\u201d. When does that future begin? Globally, the grim consensus is the end of isolation won\u2019t be the end of the music industry\u2019s pain; Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, has said festivals and nightclubs would likely be some of the last social activities to return, even as restrictions ease. Until then, Noonan has advice. \u201cUnless you\u2019re on a major performing arts company salary, please don\u2019t share your content for free because it perpetuates this horrible myth that your art is not worth paying for,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cI think we should starve the internet of content and then re-emerge as a beautiful Phoenix from the ashes \u2026 and everyone has a paywall. It can be two bucks, it can be five or 10 bucks, whatever, but it has to be something.\u201d Some artists have already turned to new platforms to ensure Facebook and Instagram aren\u2019t the only ones to profit. As Emma Swift \u2013 a Nashville-based Australian songwriter \u2013 puts it, \u201cThere is no reason we should give Mark Zuckerberg or his company content for free.\u201d Instead, Swift uses Stageit to play gigs with cult musician Robyn Hitchcock, because it\u2019s ticketed and has an option to tip. \u201cIt\u2019s the online format that to me is most like a proper, paid show,\u201d says Swift. \u201cIf gig streaming is to continue \u2026 playing for free or playing for tips is not sustainable.\u201d Promisingly, hybrids with one foot back on the sticky carpet are emerging \u2013 not Silicon Valley goliaths but small, agile venues dedicated to their communities. Their learning curve will be steep. It\u2019s not only how to mic up the drums so they actually sound good online \u2013 it\u2019s the nerd stuff: cookies, speed tests, private browsers and spinning wheels of death. Late last week in Sydney\u2019s inner west, tiny venue MoshPit finally got permission from police to stage and stream its first crowdless, barless gig, professionally recorded with schmick rented gear, ticketed at $10. A studio in St Peters and a jazz bar in Dulwich Hill are doing something similar, says MoshPit co- owner Pat Jones. Last Saturday, the first gig, he had been prepped to pay the artist and, crucially, a skeleton crew and a few casual staff he\u2019d been unable to enrol in jobkeeper. A few hours after the gig was announced came a \u201csuper gutted\u201d follow-up post. That familiar word, \u201ccancelled\u201d. NBN issues. So it goes.",

It becomes a game of musical chairs.\u201d</p> <p>Welbergen, the president of the Australasian Bat Society, says there\u2019s another problem with dispersal of bat camps.</p> <p>While it might not be obvious to a casual observer, Welbergen says each day there\u2019s about a 10% turnover of the bats in a camp, as some leave and others arrive.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a hostel,\u201d he says. \u201cThe roost is the hostel and the bats are the clientele. Flying foxes rarely stay in the same place for very long.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDispersals are predicated on the idea that you can teach flying foxes that another place is better. You might teach some individuals, but not others.\u201d</p> <p>In a single year, Welbergen says one individual bat might fly across the entire range of its species \u2013 from southern Victoria to south-east Queensland \u2013 multiple times.</p> <p>As bats move, they perform a vital ecological function by spreading thousands of seeds through spit and poop, as well as pollinating flowering trees. Welbergen says lower numbers of bats likely means slower recovery of forest areas from the 2019-20 bushfires.</p> <p>Australia has 81 species of bats, ranging from microbats weighing a few grams to the four large mainland flying foxes that can weigh up to 1kg.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d52e260b6ef20280c99e5c43aac4a578affe2d8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d52e260b6ef20280c99e5c43aac4a578affe2d8/0_65_1867_1120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grey-headed flying foxes in Sydney\u2019s Botanical Gardens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grey-headed flying foxes in Sydney\u2019s Botanical Gardens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin A.

She has 32 hours of interview material from more than 60 residents living close to nine flying-fox camps in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.

The Sars-Covid-2 virus that led to the pandemic probably originated in bats, with the likeliest scenario being a \u201czoonotic\u201d transfer to another animal, and then to humans.</p> <p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pretend that flying foxes are not vectors for some nasty diseases,\u201d says Westcott.

For example, Baker says their life expectancy as a mammal relative to their size is \u201coff the scale\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a four-gram microbat that can live for 40 years, but compare that to a mouse that probably only lives for a couple of years. There\u2019s also some evidence that bats don\u2019t get tumours and, for a long-lived species, that is quite curious. People don\u2019t understand how amazing these creatures are.\u201d</p> <p>Despite their talents, Welbergen says bats have \u201clong had an image problem in western societies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust think Dracula or Halloween. They have a dark reputation,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In April, even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pontifex/status/1252893657545531392?s=20\">a tweet from the Pope</a> compared people \u201cin a state of sin\u201d to human bats.</p> <p>\u201cIn times like this people are looking for things to blame,\u201d says Welbergen. \u201cFlying foxes and bats make a very easy scapegoat, especially because of the reporting that the virus that caused Covid-19 originated in bats.\u201d</p>",

He wants a solution \u201cwhether that\u2019s drastic action like a cull, or simply moving them on.\u201d Dr Pia Lentini, one of Smith\u2019s constituents and a bat expert, says: \u201cEvery context is different but the concerns are always the same \u2013 they\u2019re noisy, the smell is overwhelming, \u2018my car is covered in shit\u2019, \u2018I can\u2019t dry my clothes outside\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m worried about diseases\u2019.\u201d As our human settlements get bigger, we\u2019re encroaching further into bushland where bats live. At the same time, bats have been hit by droughts, habitat clearing and bushfires that put pressure on their food supplies. But bats can fly hundreds of kilometres a night to find food \u2013 whether that food is in the middle of a city or out in a national park. Lentini is studying conflict between bats and human populations and she says the incidence of bats turning up in large numbers in towns is on the rise. \u201cThere\u2019s been conflict with flying foxes for decades \u2013 it started with fruit growers who had bats \u2018raiding\u2019 their fruit, and the economic cost of that. \u201cNow we have flying foxes becoming increasingly urban because they\u2019re losing habitat. There\u2019s now also a great diversity of trees in our cities. They are becoming more urban and the camps are becoming more prominent. \u201cThey are in our cities because they are starving.\u201d Lentini lives near the Yarra Bend grey-headed flying foxes. The bat camp was established as part of a major relocation project from the Royal Botanic Gardens in 2003, when the bats were deliberately disturbed by noises at dawn and dusk. Lentini says this demonstrates a problem with dispersing colonies of flying foxes. \u201cIf we keep trying to move them on \u2013 which is difficult anyway \u2013 then you also move the conflict.\u201d Associate Prof Justin Welbergen, an animal ecologist at Western Sydney University\u2019s Hawkesbury Institute for the Environment, says: \u201cDispersals risk making a situation that\u2019s already bad, worse. It becomes a game of musical chairs.\u201d Welbergen, the president of the Australasian Bat Society, says there\u2019s another problem with dispersal of bat camps. While it might not be obvious to a casual observer, Welbergen says each day there\u2019s about a 10% turnover of the bats in a camp, as some leave and others arrive. \u201cIt\u2019s like a hostel,\u201d he says. \u201cThe roost is the hostel and the bats are the clientele. Flying foxes rarely stay in the same place for very long.\u201d \u201cDispersals are predicated on the idea that you can teach flying foxes that another place is better. You might teach some individuals, but not others.\u201d In a single year, Welbergen says one individual bat might fly across the entire range of its species \u2013 from southern Victoria to south-east Queensland \u2013 multiple times. As bats move, they perform a vital ecological function by spreading thousands of seeds through spit and poop, as well as pollinating flowering trees. Welbergen says lower numbers of bats likely means slower recovery of forest areas from the 2019-20 bushfires. Australia has 81 species of bats, ranging from microbats weighing a few grams to the four large mainland flying foxes that can weigh up to 1kg. It\u2019s these larger flying foxes that experts say are causing conflict in towns and cities. On Australia\u2019s national threatened species list, grey-headed flying foxes are considered vulnerable and the spectacled flying fox was uplisted in 2019 from vulnerable to endangered. Lentini is in the middle of a major research project to better understand people\u2019s concerns. She has 32 hours of interview material from more than 60 residents living close to nine flying-fox camps in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. She is also analysing responses to 1,600 surveys returned from people living within 300 metres of 31 camps across the east of the country. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of anger and frustration out there,\u201d she says. \u201cYou do hear the loudest voices but it\u2019s unclear if those people really do represent the broader views of the community.\u201d Lentini says \u201cthere\u2019s no real quick fix\u201d for helping people live close to flying foxes, but as with many things, she says \u201cit will come down to compromise for those who are suffering with the sound and the smell. It\u2019s going to be modifications like double-glazing and shade cloth.\u201d While bats might be a temporary annoyance for some (large influxes generally dissipate once the food has gone), the species itself is struggling. Dr David Westcott of the CSIRO is an ecologist who has studied bats for more than 20 years and says 2019 was \u201ca bad year for bats.\u201d \u201cWe had extreme heat and droughts and bushfires and all kinds of misery for flying foxes.\u201d Westcott helps coordinate a national monitoring program for flying foxes that covers more than 700 camps. The most recent count in February, after the bushfires, suggests grey-headed flying-fox numbers are down by about a third based on an average count for that time of year, but he says they \u201cmay have moved to places we don\u2019t know about\u201d. Numbers had been stable for several years before then, but the species is one of 119 animals assessed as \u201crequiring urgent management intervention\u201d after the 2019-20 bushfires. A 2015 report on flying-fox numbers found the spectacled flying fox \u2013 found mainly in the wet tropics \u2013 had crashed from 214,750 in 2005 to just 92,880 in November of 2014. Westcott says the last two years of drought and extreme heat \u2013 that can cause bats to die in their thousands \u2013 has left only about 70,000 spectacled flying foxes. Australia\u2019s bats \u2013 like all bats \u2013 can carry a wide range of viruses. The Sars-Covid-2 virus that led to the pandemic probably originated in bats, with the likeliest scenario being a \u201czoonotic\u201d transfer to another animal, and then to humans. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pretend that flying foxes are not vectors for some nasty diseases,\u201d says Westcott. But getting a virus from a bat \u201cgenerally requires us to have intimate contact with an animal\u201d and, with flying foxes, \u201cwe don\u2019t do that\u201d. Public health authorities warn people not to handle dead or alive flying foxes because a small percentage carry Australian Bat Lyssavirus \u2013 a rabies-like virus that can be fatal if not treated. Bat carers are vaccinated against the virus. NSW Health says there have only been three cases of humans getting the virus in Australia. A spokesperson for the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said bats and flying foxes \u201cplay important roles in our ecosystem, pollinating trees and dispersing seeds across wide areas.\u201d \u201cWhile the department will continue to closely monitor the international science around zoonotic diseases in bats, there is no evidence of Sars-CoV2 (the virus which causes Covid-19) in any Australian bat species.\u201d Dr Michelle Baker, an expert in bit viruses at the CSIRO, says the risk of getting infections from bats is very low. At the same time, there\u2019s much we still need to learn about bats. For example, Baker says their life expectancy as a mammal relative to their size is \u201coff the scale\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a four-gram microbat that can live for 40 years, but compare that to a mouse that probably only lives for a couple of years. There\u2019s also some evidence that bats don\u2019t get tumours and, for a long-lived species, that is quite curious. People don\u2019t understand how amazing these creatures are.\u201d Despite their talents, Welbergen says bats have \u201clong had an image problem in western societies.\u201d \u201cJust think Dracula or Halloween. They have a dark reputation,\u201d he says. In April, even a tweet from the Pope compared people \u201cin a state of sin\u201d to human bats. \u201cIn times like this people are looking for things to blame,\u201d says Welbergen. \u201cFlying foxes and bats make a very easy scapegoat, especially because of the reporting that the virus that caused Covid-19 originated in bats.\u201d",

The 63-year-old family lawyer from the Blue Mountains works for a domestic violence legal advice hotline in Parramatta and it used to be that she would wake at 7am, drive seven minutes to Hazelbrook station and from there catch the 7.17am train to Parramatta before making the same one-and-a-half hour trip home in the evening.</p> <p>With the pandemic, all that would change. Domestic violence support services such as the one Blazey worked for were declared \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/covid-19-will-slam-the-door-shut-australias-family-services-brace-for-domestic-violence-spike\">essential</a>\u201d services, meaning they could keep operating despite restrictions.

Anonymised geolocation data gathered from people\u2019s mobile phones showed how crowds in central business districts along the east coast had thinned by half even before the Australian government announced stage-one restrictions on social movement. By mid-April they would be nearly deserted. Crowding in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs had fallen to a fifth or less, while crowding around suburban train stations had fallen to a 10th.</p> <p>Those like Blazey might have regained an extra three hours in their day but, as society begins to reopen, the question now is whether the embrace of working from home sticks. Should it become permanent, it may drive a radical change in the way governments think about how we drive, fly, commute and ride in the post-pandemic world.</p> <h2><strong>Planes, trains and cars</strong></h2> <p>Already transport is taking centre stage. In mid-April Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, called for the construction of a high-speed rail line to be built between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as a brace against a looming recession. King billed the idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/26/from-showpiece-to-goat-track-the-long-dangerous-decline-of-sydney-to-melbourne-rail-travel\">which has been around since the 1980s</a> \u2013 as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for regions along its route.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57233788bc4efd302b894fc02459f9a3a61bca60\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57233788bc4efd302b894fc02459f9a3a61bca60/0_0_5076_3384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Catherine King\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, calls high-speed rail a \u2018game changer\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Ross/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHigh-speed rail has the potential to revolutionise interstate travel, allowing travel between capital cities in as little as three hours,\u201d King said.</p> <p>As an idea, the thought was as much about the past as it was the future. A century ago, when economies were transport-driven, everything depended on the ability to move people around. Ever since, planes, trains and cars have played an outsized role in the imagination, especially for policymakers looking for \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects.</p> <p>Marion Terrill of the Grattan Institute says this romance may prove costly today. Having studied proposals for high-speed rail, she says that if the country were to lock itself into such a project, it would be 22 years before the first leg was complete and it would be 39 years \u2013 if not longer \u2013 before the country saw any reduction in carbon emissions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"339e16f2e64fb4b16bbd8d52759179e98378bfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/339e16f2e64fb4b16bbd8d52759179e98378bfed/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The WestConnex tunnel at Haberfield in Sydney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sydney\u2019s WestConnex tunnel.

It\u2019s something people respond to emotionally. It\u2019s all things to all people: it\u2019s going to create jobs, take the pressure off cities, help regions, or serve as stimulus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we looked at it, most of the benefits go to business travellers going between Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane.\u201d</p> <p>Terrill says this applies not only to future projects, but extends to existing ones which should now come under review. With no vaccine expected for at least 18 months \u2013 if ever \u2013 it is possible social distancing regulations may remain even as restrictions on social movement are lifted. With lower capacities and lower populations expected, it may no longer be possible to justify many existing projects, including the $18.6bn WestConnex underground roadway and a second airport for Sydney.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/07/our-income-vanished-australias-galleries-and-museums-buckle-in-covid-19-storm\">'Our income vanished': Australia's galleries and museums buckle in Covid-19 storm</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These decisions may raise questions about the future of mass transit itself, especially among austerity-minded governments concerned about their debt burdens. Faced with renewed mistrust of public spaces and social distancing requirements, public transport systems must now be retrofitted to reduce touchable surfaces and capacity. Doing so carries a cost beyond the financial.</p> <p>The risk, says Prof Kim Dovey, the chair of architecture and urban design at Melbourne University, is that the lowering capacity will make public transport unviable when what\u2019s needed is a massive expansion.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus is really an attack on cities, in many ways,\u201d Dovey says. \u201cOne of its biggest effects is it stops cities from functioning effectively. It stops people from coming together and interacting.

      "bodyText": "Before the pandemic struck, Sara Blazey made the same three-hour commute to work, three days a week, for the better part of 12 years. The 63-year-old family lawyer from the Blue Mountains works for a domestic violence legal advice hotline in Parramatta and it used to be that she would wake at 7am, drive seven minutes to Hazelbrook station and from there catch the 7.17am train to Parramatta before making the same one-and-a-half hour trip home in the evening. With the pandemic, all that would change. Domestic violence support services such as the one Blazey worked for were declared \u201cessential\u201d services, meaning they could keep operating despite restrictions. To ensure they could do so safely, the organisation did what some commentators long thought impossible and began to transition its employees into working from home. \u201cThere were a couple of us older ones in the office who said it all sounds too hard, really,\u201d Blazey says. \u201cAnd then we were reluctant to work from home. My home is my home. I don\u2019t particularly want to do my work from there.\u201d As the country went through a collective tech upgrade, millions of workers like Blazey retreated from office blocks and entire cities emptied out. It was a pattern that would be replicated worldwide. Streets devoid of cars and pavements free of people were so haunting that photographs of cities including New York, Paris and Sydney were shared across social media. Within Australia, the scale of this change was captured in data obtained by the Grattan Institute. Anonymised geolocation data gathered from people\u2019s mobile phones showed how crowds in central business districts along the east coast had thinned by half even before the Australian government announced stage-one restrictions on social movement. By mid-April they would be nearly deserted. Crowding in the Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane CBDs had fallen to a fifth or less, while crowding around suburban train stations had fallen to a 10th. Those like Blazey might have regained an extra three hours in their day but, as society begins to reopen, the question now is whether the embrace of working from home sticks. Should it become permanent, it may drive a radical change in the way governments think about how we drive, fly, commute and ride in the post-pandemic world. Planes, trains and cars Already transport is taking centre stage. In mid-April Labor\u2019s transport spokeswoman, Catherine King, called for the construction of a high-speed rail line to be built between Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as a brace against a looming recession. King billed the idea \u2013 which has been around since the 1980s \u2013 as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for regions along its route. \u201cHigh-speed rail has the potential to revolutionise interstate travel, allowing travel between capital cities in as little as three hours,\u201d King said. As an idea, the thought was as much about the past as it was the future. A century ago, when economies were transport-driven, everything depended on the ability to move people around. Ever since, planes, trains and cars have played an outsized role in the imagination, especially for policymakers looking for \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects. Marion Terrill of the Grattan Institute says this romance may prove costly today. Having studied proposals for high-speed rail, she says that if the country were to lock itself into such a project, it would be 22 years before the first leg was complete and it would be 39 years \u2013 if not longer \u2013 before the country saw any reduction in carbon emissions. \u201cThe thing about fast rail is it plays to our dreams,\u201d Terrill says. \u201cWe love fast rail. It\u2019s something people respond to emotionally. It\u2019s all things to all people: it\u2019s going to create jobs, take the pressure off cities, help regions, or serve as stimulus.\u201d \u201cWhen we looked at it, most of the benefits go to business travellers going between Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane.\u201d Terrill says this applies not only to future projects, but extends to existing ones which should now come under review. With no vaccine expected for at least 18 months \u2013 if ever \u2013 it is possible social distancing regulations may remain even as restrictions on social movement are lifted. With lower capacities and lower populations expected, it may no longer be possible to justify many existing projects, including the $18.6bn WestConnex underground roadway and a second airport for Sydney. These decisions may raise questions about the future of mass transit itself, especially among austerity-minded governments concerned about their debt burdens. Faced with renewed mistrust of public spaces and social distancing requirements, public transport systems must now be retrofitted to reduce touchable surfaces and capacity. Doing so carries a cost beyond the financial. The risk, says Prof Kim Dovey, the chair of architecture and urban design at Melbourne University, is that the lowering capacity will make public transport unviable when what\u2019s needed is a massive expansion. \u201cThe virus is really an attack on cities, in many ways,\u201d Dovey says. \u201cOne of its biggest effects is it stops cities from functioning effectively. It stops people from coming together and interacting. This, in my view, is what makes cities work. \u201cIf people want to stay two metres apart from each other into the future, that will kill cities.\u201d Thought of in this way, Covid-19 is the sociological equivalent of a distributed denial of service attack \u2013 where a swarm of computers repeatedly attempt to access the same system all at once, eventually overloading it with demand. If at the start of the pandemic the main concern was the ability of health systems to cope, now the worry is that secondary systems like transport will buckle. The consequences are profound. If density and walkability combine to make cities vibrant places to live, public transport is the sinew that makes it possible. Cars may have dominated cities over the last century but in the last decade patronage of public transport has slowly grown once more. Should this trend be broken, Dovey says, the result would be \u201ctragic\u201d. \u201cReducing public transport to 30% will kill cities,\u201d he says. \u201cWe really need to go the other way.\u201d These concerns go beyond trains, trams and buses to the \u201cmicrospatiality\u201d of cities and efforts to green them. The more room provided for cars, the less there is for footpaths. Lifts in high-rises built to handle eight to 10 people become unworkable when they are limited to one or two. \u201cRight now a lot of people will avoid public transport for a while, which means they\u2019ll get in their cars,\u201d Dovey says. \u201cAnd that will produce demand for more roads, as it always does. \u201cPeople still believe building roads can ease congestion but that is not true.

What comes next depends on what happens when restrictions are eased and those people go back to work \u2013 particularly as global oil prices remain low. The cause was simple enough. As whole national economies were put on ice at the start of the pandemic, the world\u2019s oil producers kept pumping even as demand fell off a cliff. When they ran out of storage the mismatch between supply and demand grew so chronic oil producers in Russia found it easier to burn their excess, marking a disaster for efforts to combat climate change. \u201cOil fields are not like wine bottles, where you can put in a cork and return to it later,\u201d Jeff Colgan says. \u201cShutting an oil field down can damage it, which reduces or even eliminates the field\u2019s future production.\u201d Colgan is the Richard Holbrooke associate professor of political science at Brown University and expert on the global oil industry, who says low fuel prices will last for some time. \u201cNothing lasts forever in the oil business but low oil prices are probably here to stay for at least the rest of the year and perhaps much longer,\u201d he says. \u201cEven when consumer demand increases after lockdowns end, there is an awful lot of inventory build-up that will keep prices from rising too quickly.\u201d Against this global backdrop, Australia \u2013 which boasts the highest sulphur content fuel in the OECD and rising road transport emissions \u2013 finds itself caught between two competing futures. On the one hand, persistent low oil prices will make petrol cars cheaper to run, frustrating any attempt to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles as part of a transition to a zero-carbon economy. The alternative scenario is exemplified by China. When Australia\u2019s largest trading partner lifted restrictions and moved to reopen its factories early this month, its people stayed home.

<strong>Bexhill-on-Sea</strong>, joked about how he served tots of rum to fellow servicemen on VE Day. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe were in Greece at the time, and I had to go round early in the morning with rum for all the men,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p> \n  <p>William replied: \u201cI bet you were the hero of the time there Charles, delivering rum out to everybody.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Ward, aged 101, had a varied military career during the war and, after first being called up into the London Irish Rifles, he later served in North Africa before joining the Special Operations Executive to encrypt,

Because of lack of food we were now all lacking in energy and did very little work but we had to be on the job and just went through the motions.

There were exPOWs but large numbers of forced workers, men and women of all ages and nationalities all on foot and trying to go home. Practically all were hungry and poorly dressed, many without shoes.

I had recently returned to my grandfather\u2019s empty villa in the city of Lodz, after nearly six years on the run. I come from a Jewish family, and all of my immediate relatives died in the Holocaust. I only survived because I escaped from a train bound for Treblinka, after which I joined the Polish resistance. We fought the Germans in Warsaw, but after they were defeated the Soviets occupied our country and they were arresting and executing Polish home army officers. It was also the time that I realised that my family, for whom I had been waiting in Lodz, wasn\u2019t going to come home.</p> \n   <p>While the rest of Europe celebrated, we were in hiding. We already knew for a few months that the war would end soon, but that it would not bring us any great joy. It was just another grey day, the end of years of suffering, but no freedom. I\u2019m not sure that everyone in Poland felt the same way as us, but we did see substantial collaboration with the new regime. </p> \n   <p>For me, VE Day meant the end of one horror and the beginning of another that I didn\u2019t want to be a part of. After the war I left Europe and moved to what would become Israel. I know it marks a great achievement, but for the last 75 years I have never celebrated this day and I doubt I ever will - the part of me that remains strongly Polish does not allow me to do so.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:23:42.487Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb52ca08f08464cd42967bf\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-boffey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-08T10:11:44.192Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A 98-year-old RAF veteran has completed a 2.2-mile walk in Belgium to raise funds for a much-loved soldiers\u2019 club in the Flemish town of Poperinge.<br><br>George Sutherland, the son of a Belgian mother and Scottish father, escaped to Britain when the Germans invaded Belgium in 1940.</p> \n  <p>He walked from Lijssenthoek commonwealth war cemetery in Poperinge to Talbot House, a clubhouse for all the ranks founded in 1915 but which is facing financial ruin because of the coronavirus lockdown.<br></p> \n  <p>Sutherland had a police escort and was accompanied by a pipe major from the memorial bagpipe band of the Church of our Lady in Poperinge.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for our VE Day 75 liveblog today, thanks so much to all the readers who sent in their pictures and stories, I\u2019ve found many of them incredibly moving and uplifting - and as always, thanks for reading along. The Queen has delivered a poignant message to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day - praising the nation\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak that has filled empty streets with \u201clove and care\u201d. As she remembered Britain\u2019s Second World War sacrifices and the \u201cjoyous celebrations\u201d that followed the end of fighting in Europe, the head of state paid tribute to the positive qualities of today\u2019s generation. The tireless efforts of NHS staff, care and key workers, and communities helping the vulnerable, reflected a nation \u201cthose brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire,\u201d said the Queen. And she highlighted the message of VE (Victory in Europe) Day that resonates with the country\u2019s plight today - \u201cNever give up, never despair\u201d. Her televised address came at the end of national celebrations, curtailed due to the lockdown, marking 75 years to the day Britain and its Allies formally accepted Nazi Germany\u2019s unconditional surrender, following almost six years of brutal warfare. Speaking from Windsor Castle\u2019s white drawing room, the Queen said in her pre-recorded message: The wartime generation knew that the best way to honour those who did not come back from the war, was to ensure that it didn\u2019t happen again. The greatest tribute to their sacrifice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends, working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all. Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish. Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But our streets are not empty; they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other. And when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire. After the broadcast, the nation was invited to take part in sing-a-long of Dame Vera Lynn\u2019s wartime anthem We\u2019ll Meet Again, during the BBC\u2019s VE Day 75 show. The Queen\u2019s words were her second televised address during the coronavirus outbreak and followed her speech to the country on 5 April, when she delivered a message of hope, saying if we remained resolute in the face of the outbreak \u201cwe will overcome it\u201d. And she echoed Dame Vera\u2019s words by telling those in lockdown \u201cwe will meet again\u201d. The Queen\u2019s father King George VI was an important part of her speech which was broadcast at 9pm, the exact time of his radio address to the nation on 8 May 1945. At the conclusion of the Queen\u2019s address, a recording shows people across the country - including NHS staff and other key workers, and celebrities - singing the classic wartime song, We\u2019ll Meet Again, made famous by Dame Vera Lynn. She concludes her address with a reference to the coronavirus crisis, which has led to social distanced versions of celebrations across the country. Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish. Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But our streets are not empty; they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other. And when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire. I send my warmest good wishes to you all. She goes on to note that while VE Day prompted celebrations across the continent, it did not mark the end of the war. I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound, though while we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrifice. It was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased and the war finally ended. Many people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict. They fought so we could live in peace, at home and abroad. Queen Elizabeth starts her speech reflecting back on World War Two. I speak to you today at the same hour as my father did, exactly 75 years ago. His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad who had sacrificed so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a \u2018great deliverance\u2019. The war had been a total war; it had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve; families separated from each other; or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play. At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain. But we kept faith that the cause was right - and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through. Never give up, never despair - that was the message of VE Day. The address starts with a recording of that original 1945 broadcast. After we hear Big Ben chime, an announcer says: \u201cThis is London. His Majesty King George VI\u201d. We then hear the late King say: Let us remember the men of all the services and the women in all of the services who have laid down their lives. We have come to the end of our tribulation and they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing. The Queen is addressing the nation at 9pm to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. BBC One will broadcast a pre-recorded address by the Queen at the exact moment her father, King George VI, gave a radio address on 8 May 1945. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were left tickled pink by stories of Churchill\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d birthday message to his son when they chatted to Second World War veterans about their VE Day memories. Champagne was flowing when William and Kate made a video call on Wednesday to residents of an East Sussex care home to listen to them reminisce about the day the war ended in Europe on 8 May 1945. William praised the efforts of the wartime generation, and told them: \u201cBecause we can\u2019t be together, everyone\u2019s still thinking of you all today, and are very proud of everything you\u2019ve all achieved.\u201d Kate revealed Prince George and Princess Charlotte have been asked by their teachers to learn Dame Vera Lynn\u2019s famous wartime anthem. She said: \u201cThe school has set all the children a challenge and they\u2019re currently trying to learn the lyrics to the song We\u2019ll Meet Again... so it\u2019s been really lovely having that playing every day.\u201d The residents had started their VE Day celebrations early, and when the royal couple asked what they would do when the Covid-19 outbreak was over, the sprightly group said they would hold VC Day - \u201cVictory over Coronavirus\u201d. With a glass of bubbly nearby, Charles Ward, the oldest resident at Mais House, a Royal British Legion care home in Bexhill-on-Sea, joked about how he served tots of rum to fellow servicemen on VE Day. \u201cWe were in Greece at the time, and I had to go round early in the morning with rum for all the men,\u201d he said with a laugh. William replied: \u201cI bet you were the hero of the time there Charles, delivering rum out to everybody.\u201d Ward, aged 101, had a varied military career during the war and, after first being called up into the London Irish Rifles, he later served in North Africa before joining the Special Operations Executive to encrypt, or cipher, messages from British agents parachuted into France and Italy. The veteran, from South Kirkby in Yorkshire, told the Cambridges about working on \u201csecret\u201d messages from wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill. The duke said Valerie Glassborow, Kate\u2019s paternal grandmother, was a civilian member of staff at the wartime code-breaking centre Bletchley Park, where her twin sister Mary was also employed. The duchess, who was just one of a number of royals who have chatted to veterans this week, said: \u201cIt\u2019s so sad that she\u2019s not here today, as I would love to speak to her more about it.\u201d Ward later described the correspondence he received from the wartime leader, saying: The message came from Churchill, I had to decipher it, re-encipher it and send it to his son in Yugoslavia to say, \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019. And then there was another one from the son to Churchill himself to say congratulations on your speech in Parliament. When I told William and Kate that story, they giggled. Mais House went into lockdown before the Government issued social distancing rulings, has remained virus free and has been receiving supplies of personal protection equipment for staff, said Sue Barnes, the registered home manager. Every year, Croydon Commitment runs a tea party for veterans to celebrate their service to our armed forces. This year, volunteers, alongside members of the army, have packed 100 bags full of treats including wine and chocolate and are delivering to veterans across the whole borough of Croydon. Here is another lovely contribution from a Guardian reader. Vicki Nightingale sent in this photograph of her grandparents, the second world war veteran Cyril Gillard, 94, and his wife, Betsy, 92, celebrating VE Day with a special tea at their home in Ellesmere Port in Cheshire. She also sent this account of Cyril\u2019s experiences in the war. On VE Day 1945 Cyril was in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on board the HMS Tartar as they were still involved in the war in the Far East. They celebrated onboard the ship by \u2018splicing the mainbrace\u2019 \u2013 an order given for the crew to have an alcoholic drink \u2013 but unfortunately, due to Cyril\u2019s age at the time, he was unable to have a tot of rum. During the war he served on board the HMS Tartar, a Tribal-class destroyer which was one of eight Royal Navy ships engaged in heavy combat trying to keep the English Channel free of enemy crafts during D-Day. In 2017 he was honoured by the French government, receiving the highest French order of military merit, the Legion D\u2019Honneur, for his role in the D-Day landings. Thousands have watched an online performance of Katherine Jenkins singing in front of an empty Royal Albert Hall as she marked the 75th anniversary of VE Day. The mezzo-soprano singer, 39, performed wartime favourites in the concert, which was streamed on YouTube and has now been watched by more than 13,000 people. Her performance also featured a virtual duet with the Forces\u2019 Sweetheart Dame Vera Lynn, who entertained troops during the second world war. Jenkins sang Lynn\u2019s We\u2019ll Meet Again alongside archive footage and audio from one of her wartime performances. During the show, Jenkins said: On this anniversary, we are here to appreciate those who gave so much so that we could live our lives in peace and freedom. Today, the Royal Albert Hall stands empty, just as it did during the Blitz, without its true life force \u2013 the audiences who fill it with energy night after night. But the doors will open again, as they did following the last world war, and the music will play on. Before her performance began, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, delivered a message to mark the anniversary. \u201cJust as we united to achieve victory back then, I am confident that together we will overcome adversity again,\u201d he said. Jenkins said the event left her \u201cspeechless\u201d and was \u201cone of the most incredible experiences of my career\u201d. She added: \u201cI have sound-checked here many times before for my own concerts so thought I\u2019d know how it might feel today, but it really was something special.\u201d The concert was in support of the Royal Albert Hall\u2019s fundraising appeal and armed forces charity SSAFA\u2019s emergency response fund. Terry Clark, a Battle of Britain veteran, died yesterday aged 101, just hours before the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Clark died on Thursday evening in a care home from natural causes, leaving one surviving member of \u201cThe Few\u201d who took to the skies in the summer of 1940. Clark served as a radar operator on Beaufighters during the second world war and was one of two remaining air crew, known as The Few, who took to the skies to defend the UK against attacks from the Luftwaffe, Nazi Germany\u2019s air force, in the Battle of Britain. The death of Clark, who had celebrated his 101st birthday earlier this year, leaves John \u201cPaddy\u201d Hemingway as the last surviving member. The RAF Benevolent Fund controller, Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, said: Our condolences go to Terry\u2019s family and friends at this sad time. This news is especially poignant as we remember the bravery and sacrifice of all those who fought for us today, the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Terry belonged to a generation of servicemen and women who answered their country\u2019s call without question. We owe a debt of gratitude to every one of them and their legacy must be to remember their service. John \u2018Paddy\u2019 Hemingway is now the last surviving member of The Few and in September we will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the battle. The RAF Benevolent Fund will be paying tribute to those pilots and air crew who \u2018gave so much to so many\u2019. We honour their memory by supporting the second world war and National Service veterans who need our help, before it is too late. Trumpeters and buglers up and down the country played The Last Post to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. The piece is often played at military memorials, and was taken up by dozens of musicians across the UK to mark the day that commemorates the end of the second world war in Europe. Among those involved was Paul Cartwright, from Ryhill near Wakefield. He is part of the West Yorkshire police band, which plays in Ypres every year on 11 November. The 48-year-old Church of England priest told the PA news agency: It was to be able to honour those who gave their life for us, and also to honour those who are working so hard for us now in the armed forces, to help with all the Nightingale hospitals and all the logistics. It was to get the community involved and to give a bit of thanks for the peace that was brought on VE Day. Grace Harman, a 17-year-old A-level student from Kesgrave in Suffolk, said it was important to her to \u201cpay homage to all the people who sacrificed\u201d. She told PA: \u201cI knew today was going to be very poignant and a lot of people have been turning to music.\u201d Cartwright said that by playing the same piece up and down the country, musicians could fulfil a unique role at a time when people were social distancing because of the coronavirus. It\u2019s a way musicians can try and unite the community at this strange time where so many people are isolated. It was interesting to see people stopping as they came by on their walks and just have a moment as they were listening to The Last Post. It was quite moving, actually. Harman agreed that the unique situation in the world added an extra layer of resonance to the music, calling it \u201cespecially poignant\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s so still. For the trumpet, the part is quite challenging. When you master it and you get the notes perfectly, it really does it justice.\u201d Cat Buckley, a care assistant, looks after the 95-year-old second world war veteran signalman Eric Bradshaw, who is in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19. Eric, who enlisted in the Royal Navy at the age of 18 in 1943, served in Norway, the far east and across the globe in his role sending and receiving messages while his ship was at sea. \u201cSomehow the quiet made it louder. By rights, marking the 75th anniversary of VE Day in the midst of a pandemic that has confined us to our homes \u2013 forcing us to keep our distance from one another, denying us the right to gather in crowds \u2013 should have muffled this commemoration,\u201d writes the Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland. And yet today\u2019s marking of the end of the second world war struck a deeper chord than it might, had it been just another sunny bank holiday. Yes, the usual rituals had to be suspended. There could be no wreath-laying at local memorials: instead, Prince Charles and Camilla laid two small wreaths on their own, in a crowd-less corner of Balmoral, watched by a lone piper. All the same, Britons seemed more conscious of this 75th anniversary than previous ones. Manufacturers of bunting and flags reported record sales, busier than for any previous VE Day commemoration, busier even than in the summer of 2012 when the London Olympics and the Queen\u2019s diamond jubilee coincided. Perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Britons in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic should seize on the memory of the allies\u2019 victory in Europe. After all, the second world war has hovered over this crisis from the start. As we mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, here is a selection of archive photographs from 1945. The Queen\u2019s Piper joined pipers all over the world in playing this afternoon in honour of VE Day. Pipe major Richard Grisdale, of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, played When the Battle\u2019s O\u2019er on the Round Tower at Windsor Castle. The daughter of a radio intercept operator has described the moment she stumbled at Bletchley Park upon her father\u2019s note recording Germany\u2019s second world war surrender. Dr Jennifer Iles, 66, from Wimbledon, was visiting the former home of the code breakers in 2018 when she approached the final museum exhibits. One happened to be a note taken by a radio interceptor of the German surrender to the Allied forces - and Dr Iles recognised the handwriting as that of George Curd, her father. Dr Iles told the PA news agency: My parents, who were both radio intercept operators and met at Beaumanor Hall, often used to talk about the war. But my father only mentioned he had taken down the surrender on one occasion in the late 1960s. They were still bound by the Official Secrets Act and my mother brought the conversation to a swift end. My father was at Bletchley before going to Beaumont Manor so I wanted to take a look around. I was almost at the end of the museum exhibits, feeling very tired and I almost missed taking a look at the exhibits in this particular alcove. I was taken aback when I saw the message. The message brought the war to an end and was followed by Victory in Europe Day, with today marking the 75th anniversary of the momentous occasion. Dr Iles hunted for a photocopy she had of the note and afterwards was able to match it with the photo she had taken at the museum. She said: I knew my mother had been in touch with Bletchley when my father died, but I never thought any more about it. I\u2019m sure my parents would be amazed that it is now being displayed. Here\u2019s another round-up of the best photographs showing how people around the country are marking the 75th anniversary of VE Day. RAF Sergeant Bernard Morgan was a 20-year-old code and cipher operator, part of the 2nd Tactical Air Force. His role was to advance with the land forces across Europe and encrypt messages for pilots and UK command. He received and printed out the first official telex message declaring the end of hostilities and that \u201cTHE GERMAN WAR IS NOW OVER\u201d, which he now proudly keeps in his possession. Matt Baker, a theatre director, and his neighbours dress up and sing on Cambrian Road in Chester. Gabriella Williams, seven, Gregory Williams, nine, Carrisa Amaning, four, and Claire Williams, four, play on their scooters at a community commemoration party in the grounds of Haig Housing in Edinburgh. Eight veterans, including participants in the D-day landings and 97-year-old Gregory Melikian, who was tasked in the early hours of 7 May 1945 with sending the coded message announcing Germany\u2019s unconditional surrender, defied the dangers posed by the pandemic to join Donald Trump at a wreath-laying ceremony. Long-held plans to fly the men to a major commemoration in Russia had to be cancelled due to the pandemic. The men, the youngest of whom is 96, were described as \u201cchoosing nation over self\u201d by agreeing to join the US president at the World War II Memorial in Washington close to Capitol Hill. They later joined Trump as guests of honour at the White House. Melikian, from Phoenix, Arizona, told the Guardian: My heroes are the guys that hit the beaches in 6,400 ships. So many never came back and are buried underneath white tombstones. Timothy Davis, the director of the Greatest Generations Foundation, a charity that helps veterans return to the countries where they fought, said the men had sought to commemorate the day in Washington. \u201cOf course, we presented to them the risk we are facing,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey said: \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, Tim.\u2019\u201d In the Hertfordshire countryside people are finding plenty of opportunities for socially distant celebrating. Eric Clarkson has adorned his house in Datchworth with flags from the Commonwealth and has his 1942 American army jeep out front. The jeep, which he bought in 1976, was in the British army for ten years, so there is a good chance it was in action on or around VE Day. \u201cI love it,\u201d he says. \u201cBoth my kids learnt to drive in it over the fields. It\u2019s great fun.\u201d A few streets down, neighbours \u2013 who met for the first time during the weekly clap for carers \u2013 are sharing a drink standing a good 2m apart on their own bits of pavement. If nothing else, these strange times are bringing us together in adversity. Boris Johnson has invited Russia to play a more integrated role in global efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine. During a phone call with president Vladimir Putin to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, the prime minister suggested Russia take part in a global vaccine summit next month being hosted by the UK. While Johnson told the long-standing leader there remained \u201cobstacles\u201d in developing stronger bilateral relations between the two nations, he opened the door to working together to find an inoculation against Covid-19. Relations between the UK and Russia have been under strain since the deployment of a military-grade nerve agent on an ex-Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, in Salisbury in 2018. The MI6 informant and his daughter survived the Novichok attack but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, later died, with the incident leading to the expulsion of 23 suspected Russian spies. UK and US security services warned that hackers, who the Telegraph reported were believed to be state-backed by countries including Russia, China and Iran, were targeting the NHS to steal coronavirus secrets. During his call with Putin, Johnson reflected on the nations\u2019 second world war links but said more needed to be done if closer ties were to be re-established. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: The prime minister spoke to resident Putin today to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. They paid tribute to the collaboration between British and Russian forces during the second world war, including through the Arctic convoys, and to the heroism and sacrifice of all those who lost their lives. They also discussed the bilateral relationship between our countries. The prime minister was clear we should maintain dialogue but that obstacles to further progress remained. The leaders spoke about the coronavirus pandemic and agreed on the importance of continuing to work together and with other countries to defeat the disease. Johnson is due to speak to a number of other world leaders to remember the events of 1945, including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, in the evening. Seventy-five years ago, crowds gathered in the streets of Europe, singing and dancing as their leaders announced the end of six years of bloody war on the continent. On Friday, the streets were empty, and leaders stood alone in silence at places of commemoration to mark the heroics of the war generation in the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic. France The French president, Emmanuel Macron, took part in a scaled-down version of the traditional commemorations on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris, alongside his two most recent predecessors, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Germany At a distance of 1.5m, Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, came together to mark a \u201clonely\u201d commemoration. Poland At a wreath-laying commemoration at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Warsaw, the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, wearing a black mask, expressed the mixed emotions of many his compatriots, given the decades of Soviet repression that followed the defeat of the Nazis. Czech Republic In the Czech Republic, where the lockdown has been partially lifted, politicians arrived at 10-minute intervals to lay wreaths on Prague\u2019s Vitkov Hill, to minimise contact. Russia Vladimir Putin sent a message to Boris Johnson ahead of Russia\u2019s national commemoration on 9 May. Putin expressed confidence that the memory of the two nations\u2019 \u201cbrotherhood-in-arms\u201d would lead to constructive dialogue and cooperation between Russia and the UK. What does the second world war mean to millennials in Europe? We asked for their views. We are forgetting the lessons of 1945 At times of crisis, populism, racism, xenophobia and fascism rise. After the coronavirus economic crisis really hits, we will witness an unbearable climate of pro-nationalist sentiment. In a world of global challenges, nations are the wrong scale to solve those problems. Isabel, scientist, 32, Spain We thought war had gone the way of the guillotine The fraying of the European project recently has made the second world war suddenly more relevant. For a long time we thought the continent\u2019s bloody divisions were consigned to the past, along with slavery or the guillotine. Now it feels like Europe\u2019s tormented history was merely suspended for a few decades. I\u2019m not frightened of a return to armed conflict, but the potential of destructive disunity feels very real. I have no sentimentality for VE Day but I do think that it should be commemorated. Aleks, 20s, Serbian, living in the UK Col Tom Moore\u2019s local pub led a nationwide toast in honour of those who served in the second world war. Publicans across the UK got behind the bar to ring their pub bell and raise a glass at 3pm. They were joined by members of the public on their doorsteps. Publican Karl Clark, who runs Moore\u2019s local in Bedfordshire, stood next to a flag bearing the words \u201clest we forget\u201d and paid tribute to the fallen. He said: \u201cFrom The Bell in Marston Moretaine, we would like to thank those who gave so much.\u201d Ahead of the Nation\u2019s Toast, Clark praised \u201cnational hero\u201d Moore, who raised more than \u00a332m for the NHS. The British Beer &amp; Pub Association called on its members, who represent more than 20,000 pubs and 90% of the beer brewed in Britain, to join in the toast. It comes at a time when the nationwide shutdown of pubs to prevent the spread of Covid-19 has severely hampered their ability to play their traditional role as community hubs. At the Fairway Inn in New Moston, Manchester, Mark Sweetland said: For those that gave so much, we thank you. I raise a glass, a good bottle of ale, for the Nation\u2019s Toast. For the moment of the national celebration, in remembrance and gratitude as we honour those that fought and died protecting our freedom. I ring the bell as a salute to the heroes. Lest we forget. Staff at the deserted National Memorial Arboretum in Alrewas, Staffordshire, observed a two-minute silence to commemorate the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Mark Ellis, the head of visitor experience, laid a wreath. The arboretum would normally welcome around 10,000 visitors to mark such an occasion. Mark Stephenson has sent this photograph of his father, Desmond Stephenson, who was in the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC). Desmond was captured at Arnhem, the Netherlands in 1944 and taken to a stalag, a term used for prisoner-of-war camps, in Zagen, Poland. Mark also sent this extract from Desmond\u2019s diary while he was a prisoner of war: 21-3-45 The main topic of all talk in Stalag is definitely food; each man discussing what he will eat and how he will prepare it; of things that he has and hasn\u2019t eaten and how his tastes have changed ... I have prepared a menu on a separate piece of paper of one day\u2019s food. Whether or not I shall be able to eat it, I leave entirely in the hands of the Lord and pray that he will keep or rather restore my health and strength sufficiently to do so ... It started after I was wounded in the leg while in Oosterbeek in the Arnhem offensive ... It wasn\u2019t too bad and I expected to come out again straight away, however I was kept in. This was about 3pm on Friday 23rd Sept 1943. There wasn\u2019t beds or even room to lay down on the floor as it was overcrowded and only a makeshift hospital, so that I had to sit on the stairs with dozens of others cases ... And so it was, sat there on the stairs the following day in the mid afternoon with mortars and shells bursting everywhere blowing in the windows and doors, that a voice seemed to say to me, \u201cWhy not call on the Lord and ask him to take care of you\u201d, and I did. I prayed to him for protection and guidance and immediately my shattered nerves were steadied and I was able to look at others and steady them without feeling the same ... Menu for first few days leave On the first day of my leave, God willing, this is what I have arranged to do. If possible three of us, Jack, Bill and myself, have arranged that if at all possible to get to one large station preferably in London and go into town to some restaurant and have a good luncheon. For this I can\u2019t set a menu as I do not know how things will be. However we intend to have a really good meal regardless of price. Should this meal take place in any other place than London or if I have to wait any length of time at Euston station I intend going to the YMCA there and have another meal which will consist of the following: Sausage or bacon Mash or chips Bread butter and tea Sweet: Fruit and custard Or Trifle and custard Cakes and tea This is usually obtainable there or was six months ago. I then intend to buy 12 hot dogs. These consist of rolls split in half and a sausage put in with butter, and then buy some assorted cakes and biscuits all of which I will take on the train with me ... On arriving home, which will be about 6.45pm, by the way I would like to do this without them knowing that I was coming and then nothing would be prepared and I would get my usual meal as I used to when I arrived home on leave before. After all the welcoming there would be the inevitable \u201cYou\u2019ll be hungry\u201d and almost at once my sister would have a cup of tea ready while she cooked something. This would consist of 2 fried eggs, 2 rashers of ham, chips and fried bread with bread, butter, jam and tea cake or pastry. I hope that I shall be able to get the same meal as I have looked forward to it many times in the past. I think it one of the tastiest meals that I used to have. Desmond was eventually part of \u2018The March\u2019 back to the west during which many prisoners of war and people from concentration camps died. \u201cHe survived, but only just,\u201d Mark said. Reader Georgina Dayman-Johns sent this photo of her husband, Steve, playing the trombone in his union jack tie. He was supposed to have played in the village of Nunney, Somerset to mark the VE Day anniversary. \u201cHe has (uniquely?) played the trombone for the Remembrance service for the last 48 years!!\u201d said Georgina. A picture from VE Day celebrations at Holly House residential home in the village of Milton Malsor in South Northamptonshire. Naeha Menon from Holly House said: We went into lockdown on March 9th to stop our residents getting coronavirus, and with the support of our great staff we remain covid free, but taking precautions to ensure everyone can celebrate happily and safely. Footage of Prince Charles reading an extract from his grandfather George VI\u2019s diary entry for 8 May 1945, has been broadcast to mark VE Day 75. The extract reads: The Prime Minister came to lunch. We congratulated each other on the end of the European War. The day we have been longing for has arrived at last, &amp; we can look back with thankfulness to God that our tribulation is over. No more fear of being bombed at home &amp; no more living in air raid shelters. But there is still Japan to be defeated &amp; the restoration of our country to be dealt with, which will give us many headaches &amp; hard work in the coming years\u2026 The Prime Minister broadcast his statement that the European War had ceased at 3.0 pm. The Germans had signed the Capitulation in Berlin itself. The rest of the day was a General Holiday. Great crowds had collected outside Buckingham Palace &amp; we went on to the Balcony to see them. We were given a great reception. We went out several times during the afternoon\u2026I made a broadcast at 9.0pm to the British Empire. Several buildings in Whitehall besides Buck. Pal. were floodlit &amp; we were called for to go out on to the balcony repeatedly. We went out eight times altogether during that afternoon and evening. Lilibet &amp; Margaret with a party of friends walked in the crowd after dark to see London in festive mood. Poor darlings they have never had any fun yet. Dame Joan Collins, whose family home was destroyed during the blitz, led the Nation\u2019s Toast to the Heroes of World War Two at 3pm. The actor and author, 86, also spoke about her wartime experiences on Good Morning Britain. She recalled going to an air raid shelter in Marble Arch to hide from the bombing that destroyed her home: People were passing sandwiches and thermoses of tea, some people had accordions, and a lot of people sang. The next morning when we went back to our flat in Maida Vale, it had been completely destroyed. We\u2019ve seen lots of amazing house decorations today, but this effort from Jane and Toby Lyde in Tooting, south London, is one of the best yet. Some more lovely contributions from Guardian readers. Nigel Annett sent this photo of a bus shelter near his home in Aberyscir, a village near Brecon in Wales. He said he\u2019d been moved by listening to recollections of second world war survivors. Chris Hughes, now 83, recalls being part of the crowd celebrating VE Day in London. I was with my mother outside Buckingham Palace and a stranger hoisted my eight-year-old frame onto his shoulders to get a better view. I got a very distant sight of the King. I remember a feeling of freedom being in London rather than Bexley in Kent. My mother worked all during the Blitz as a district nurse, when she would travel on her bicycle despite bombs falling. I lived with a cousin during the early years in Lincolnshire and watched bombers flying out each night. We kept rabbits and ate a lot of vegetables. My father had died in 1939 and my mother remarried - to the man who serviced her bicycle - in 1943 so I returned to Kent. I was in an underground air raid shelter most nights and spent days in the giant school shelter. It was very enjoyable for a youngster but hard for the adults. Alison Mayes, a school office manager, feels that marking VE Day while being in lockdown has given it some poignancy. \u201cThere are some similarities between 1945 and 2020,\u201d she said. We are unable to see our loved ones at the moment and we are all having to make sacrifices as they did in the war. It\u2019s incredibly important to commemorate the occasion and to teach the younger generations about our country\u2019s history. It has also been a lot of fun for my children to craft homemade bunting, paper chains and flags and bake cakes for our front garden tea party. It has been a lovely diversion.

One of our readers, Lennox Honychurch, has sent in this message and photograph: Readers may like to be reminded that VE Day was celebrated in the smallest and most far flung British colonies, many of which had sent men to fight in the conflict in Europe and women to serve in the ATS. Here is a photo of VE Day 1945 celebrations in Dominica in what was then the British West Indies, with a parade going down the main street of the capital, Roseau. People around the country are about to take part in the The Nation\u2019s Toast to the Heroes of World War Two at 3pm. Members of the public are encouraged to stand on their doorstep and raise a glass to those who served. Cheers! The Countess of Wessex joked with a second world war airman about his hangover after VE Day celebrations when they met for a virtual chat. Members of the royal family have been talking to wartime veterans and civilians this week to hear their stories and mark the 75th anniversary of the war ending in Europe. Louis Goodwin, 94, from Salisbury, told the countess he had joined the RAF in 1943 as an 18-year-old and opted to train as a gunner rather than pilot or navigator because the instruction course was shorter. Speaking on the Royal British Legion\u2019s special online show, screened on its Facebook page, the former airman said: When I joined, I thought the war\u2019s not going to last that long and I\u2019ll never get flying, because the training for a pilot was a good year, so I elected to go for a quicker course on air gunnery. The countess asked about his safety flying in Lancaster bombers, adding: \u201cQuite an exposed position you were in because you were right down in the tail.\u201d Goodwin joked: \u201cI wasn\u2019t quite as fat as I am now, with flying gear on it was a job to get in anyway - a little bit tight sitting behind four machine guns.\u201d When he said that he had left the VE Day party at 11pm, the countess said that was \u201cquite civilised, not too bad.\u201d He replied: \u201cWe had a few drinks.\u201d \u201cYou remember the headache the next morning?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes, yes and wondering what we were going to do next,\u201d Goodwin replied. During the Royal British Legion\u2019s online show, Dame Joan Collins described how her London home was destroyed in an air raid when she was a child, and the tenor Alfie Boe sang. Collins said: \u201cWe got bombed out and I remember going to our home in Maida Vale and seeing that the whole flat was gone. \u201c\u2018Oh, where\u2019s my toys?\u2019 I said to my mother. \u2018Well, we\u2019ll have to buy you some more,\u2019 said my father toughly.\u201d The Princess Royal chatted to Dorothy Pettican Runnicles, 95, from Gloucester, who served with the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service as a petty officer and air radio mechanic. She said she had \u201cvolunteered for the services because it was the thing to do, we had to get this war finished\u201d. Dorothy was 19 when she lost her boyfriend in an air crash while she was working in the Fleet Air Arm. She said about her service: \u201cIt challenged me, it stretched me. I learned about death.\u201d The princess asked how she was coping with the coronavirus lockdown. \u201cI\u2019m not good in my mobility and I worry [about] not getting out of the flat, but I\u2019ve got instructions from my grandchildren, I\u2019ve got to stamp about the flat from each room and pretend I\u2019m doing physical work,\u201d she said. Here are some more great photos of how people have been marking the day around the country: The Guardian photographer Murdo MacLeod was given access to the David Walker Gardens care home as it prepared to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Clear of Covid-19, strict protective measures are in place. Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be taking over the VE Day live blog for the rest of the day. Please do send in photos of your decorations, commemorations and celebrations - or any personal stories you would like to share. It\u2019s been great to see people coming together to mark the day across the country. Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ My grandparents are celebrating up in Rothbury, Northumberland, where the model Spitfire my grandad built is on display on the front lawn. Thanks everyone who has followed the live feed today. I am now handing the blog over to my colleague Jessica Murray who will continue with coverage. Hope you\u2019ve enjoyed it \u2013 and thanks so much for sharing all your photographs and stories with me. Back in 1985, on the 40th anniversary, the Queen spoke of her memories of VE Day. Today, the royal family\u2019s social media platforms have re-broadcast short extracts, in which she talked about joining in with the celebration. She recalled \u201cthe thrill and relief\u201d of the end of the war in Europe, and how she managed to join the jubilant crowds without being recognised. \u201cMy parents went out on the balcony in response to the huge crowds outside. I think we went on the balcony nearly every hour, six times. And then when the excitement of the flood lights being switched on got through to us, my sister and I realized we couldn\u2019t see what the crowds were enjoying. My mother had put her tiara on for the occasion, so we asked my parents if we could go out and see for ourselves. I remember we were terrified of being recognized, So I pulled my uniform cap well down over my eyes.\u201d She added: \u201cWe cheered the king and queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\u201d She added: \u201c I think it was one of the most memorable nights of my life. The RAF\u2019s display team colours the skies above London red, white and blue to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Nazi commanders surrendered to allied forces in a French schoolhouse 75 years ago on 8 May 1945, bringing the second world war in Europe to an end. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has paid tribute to second world war veterans. She said: They showed the necessity and the value of personal sacrifice for the common good. They demonstrated the resilience of the human spirit and our ability to overcome adversity. As we pay tribute to them for their bravery, dedication and idealism that they showed 75 years ago, let\u2019s also thank them for the inspiration they give us today. Our challenge may be different, but as they did then, we will overcome it. The Queen\u2019s recollections of her VE Day celebrations as \u201cone of the most memorable nights of my life\u201d have been shared by Buckingham Palace. The monarch recorded an interview for the BBC Radio 4 programme The Way We Were for the 40th anniversary on 8 May 1985. As a 19-year-old princess, she joined thousands of other revellers after slipping into the crowds to dance and sing outside Buckingham Palace unnoticed with her 14-year-old sister Princess Margaret. In the archive audio on the royal family\u2019s social media channels, the Queen can be heard saying: \u201cWe cheered the King and Queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the streets. \u201cI remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.\u201d The Duchess of Cornwall has recorded excerpts from her father\u2019s own account of his second world war service. Major Bruce Shand\u2019s memoirs, Previous Engagements, recount his time serving with the 12th Royal Lancers. Camilla chose extracts documenting his time serving in north Africa, where he lost two of his closest comrades, and as a prisoner of war in Germany. Jane Hodges has sent in comments from her father, who was in a prisoner of war camp outside what was then the German town of Brux. He was a gunner in the Royal Artillery. Below are his comments on the last months of war. The last months of the war were rather a nightmare and in some ways unreal. On the face of it everything went on as normal. We still went to work escorted by sentries each day but the hydrowerk had been put out of production by bombing. Because of lack of food we were now all lacking in energy and did very little work but we had to be on the job and just went through the motions. It was an effort to march to and from the workplace. He added: The sheer chaos in central Europe at the end of the war was beyond believe and description. There were exPOWs but large numbers of forced workers, men and women of all ages and nationalities all on foot and trying to go home. Practically all were hungry and poorly dressed, many without shoes. Some I believe were former soldiers who had found civvies but they kept a low profile and also German civilians trying to get to the west out of the hands of the Russians. The UK\u2019s first skytyping display has been held to mark VE Day and pay tribute to frontline workers. Messages such as We Will Meet Again and Thank You were etched in the sky above Henstridge airfield in Somerset. The display was commissioned by the Department for Transport, which recently introduced a law change to allow skytyping and skywriting to take place. The techniques were outlawed in the UK in the 1960s over safety concerns, but are used in many countries such as the US, Australia, France and Spain. Skywriting was inadvertently discovered by an RAF pilot during the First World War, when oil accidentally entered a plane\u2019s exhaust, creating dense, white smoke. According to the DfT, skytyping, which involves smoke being emitted in a series of bursts, was not conducted in the UK before Friday\u2019s display in Somerset. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: Victory in Europe Day will always be a landmark in British history and it is an honour to have commissioned the first skytyping display in the UK to mark the occasion. With its strong British history, stemming from the creation of skywriting, it seems an entirely fitting way to honour all those who fought for our freedom while also thanking those keeping the country moving during this challenging time. The prime minister told a 102-year-old war veteran he was \u201cawesome\u201d after the two-minute silence held at 11am to mark VE Day. Boris Johnson\u2019s official spokesman told reporters during a briefing: He held a Zoom call with a veteran, an amazing guy by the name of Ernie Horsfall. He is 102 and one of the UK\u2019s oldest surviving servicemen. Ernie served with the Army\u2019s Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers from 1940 to 1946 as a staff sergeant. He was in Naples on VE Day, on the outskirts of the city along the Pompeii road, running workshops to repair and maintain tanks. He and the PM had a really lovely conversation, they spoke for just over half an hour. Johnson told Ernie he was \u201cawesome\u201d and a \u201ccredit to his generation\u201d during the call. William Cave from Somerset sent in the following message and photograph. My father was commander of \u2018A\u2019 squadron 44th RTR, his brother was killed in Burma. This is my VE Day memorial to them and all who served, here with my lovely Emma, an A&amp;E nurse and on her way to work. Going to attempt the Last Post on a plastic trumpet at 2.55pm before a lockdown 2 metre Zoom toast with family and whichever villagers have emerged to complain about the terrible noise. Another reader, Doreen Scerri, said that she had just finished a wreath she made by painting water bottles, cutting them into strips, and stapling them to cardboard painted white. She added: \u201cYesterday we had a rosemary plant delivered with our groceries and it was wrapped with a UK flag print. With the lockdown I had to make do with what I could find.\u201d I\u2019ve been enjoying all your wonderful photographs as VE Day is marked in different ways this year because of coronavirus. Please do continue to share your images, and I hope you enjoy the day despite the restrictions in place. A group of volunteer bakers has made 800 bags of treats that they will deliver to vulnerable members of the community who are self-isolating. Amersham Rotate said they had come together to add something special to this VE Day at home. If you want to share your photographs with me, then please do. The SSAFA, the armed forces charity, says it is \u201cimmensely honoured\u201d to have received a message of support from the Queen on VE Day. The Queen, who is the charity\u2019s patron, was joined by Prince Michael of Kent in sending her best wishes. She said: \u201cAs patron of SSAFA, the armed forces charity, I am pleased to send my best wishes to the beneficiaries, volunteers, employees and all those concerned with the charity on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of VE Day. \u201cAt this increasingly challenging time, I know that you have continued to provide support to members of the armed forces and veterans, together with their families. \u201cAs you reflect on the charity\u2019s 135-year history, my thoughts and prayers remain with you all for your continued safety and the future success of your important work.\u201d Some beautiful photographs of the Red Arrows flying over Westminster. The nine RAF Hawks pilots put on a colourful display in an arrow formation, trailing red, white and blue smoke over Ingoldmells, East Ham, Westminster, Bracknell and Winslow before flying out over Northamptonshire. As I run the live feed, please do share your pictures and comments with me. I\u2019d love to know how you are marking the day with those around you given the current lockdown. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Vladimir Putin has sent a message to Boris Johnson on the 75th anniversary of VE Day. The Russian president said: \u201cThe Great Victory was a pivotal event of the 20th century with enduring significance for the fate of all humankind. It was achieved thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition. That invaluable experience is no less needed today.\u201d The Kremlin said he also expressed confidence that the memory of the two nations\u2019 \u201cbrotherhood-in-arms\u201d would lead to constructive dialogue and cooperation between Russia and the UK. Katherine Jenkins has performed in an empty Royal Albert Hall to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. Her rendition of wartime favourites will be streamed on YouTube. The mezzo-soprano said the performance left her speechless and was one of the most incredible experiences of her career. \u201cI have sound-checked here many times before for my own concerts so thought I\u2019d know how it might feel today, but it really was something special,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so honoured to have been asked to do this and excited that we are making history, a first for the Royal Albert Hall and for me of course. \u201cI was lucky enough to be involved in the 60th and 70th VE Day celebrations, so I\u2019ve seen first-hand what these events mean to the veterans and their families. \u201cWe must do all we can to suitably honour this momentous day to the best of our abilities under the circumstances and we hope the nation will help us with that. I hope that you all enjoy and sing along. It has been a day to remember.\u201d The Prince of Wales wrote on the card that accompanied his wreath at the Balmoral war memorial: \u201cIn everlasting remembrance. Charles.\u201d The Duchess of Cornwall wrote on her card: \u201cIn memory of my darling father and all the officers and men of the XII Lancers who fought so bravely to give us peace. Camilla.\u201d A Winston Churchill impersonator did not despair when a three-day VE Day outdoor celebration was cancelled because of Covid-19. Derek Herbert was to have given a Churchillian speech at Hever Castle in Kent, the childhood home of Anne Boleyn, which was to turn red, white and blue throughout the bank holiday weekend. Locked down instead at his home in Little Neston, Cheshire, with wife, Linda, who portrays Clementine Churchill, he will be dressed as the wartime prime minister on Friday for a series of online performances. Among the events will be the VE Day 1940s Performers Extravaganza, a free concert hosted on Facebook by the singer Miss Madeline Brown. Herbert has played Churchill for about 15 years, and his screen credits include the BBC dramas Close To The Enemy and Summer Of Rockets. He also features in the movie Lawrence: After Arabia, starring Brian Cox and Hugh Fraser, to be released later this year. How are you marking the VE Day anniversary in lockdown? Before the coronavirus crisis, plans were made for street parties and parades, and even the first May bank holiday was moved for the occasion. But with the UK still in lockdown, we\u2019d like to hear how readers will be marking the anniversary. You can share your pictures and stories via our form - or WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. We\u2019ll feature some of them in the blog. Dame Vera Lynn has given her thanks to the wartime generation in a message broadcast on the Royal British Legion\u2019s livestream. In a message read by the actor Lesley Sharp, she said: As we commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of the war, what a perfect opportunity for me to say thank you to everyone who did their bit to help us fight for freedom. Not only our wonderful air force, navy and army, but all the munitions workers in factories, those who broke the codes, the land girls and everyone else in the country. Neighbours helping neighbours, every person involved helping in some way. My love and thanks to you all, Dame Vera. Some of you have been sending me photographs of how you are marking the day. Below is a selection. Stanis\u0142aw Aronson took part in the Polish resistance under Nazi occupation. He lives in Israel. He said in an interview: As members of the Polish underground home army, VE Day was a very gloomy day for my friends and me. I had recently returned to my grandfather\u2019s empty villa in the city of Lodz, after nearly six years on the run. I come from a Jewish family, and all of my immediate relatives died in the Holocaust. I only survived because I escaped from a train bound for Treblinka, after which I joined the Polish resistance. We fought the Germans in Warsaw, but after they were defeated the Soviets occupied our country and they were arresting and executing Polish home army officers. It was also the time that I realised that my family, for whom I had been waiting in Lodz, wasn\u2019t going to come home. While the rest of Europe celebrated, we were in hiding. We already knew for a few months that the war would end soon, but that it would not bring us any great joy. It was just another grey day, the end of years of suffering, but no freedom. I\u2019m not sure that everyone in Poland felt the same way as us, but we did see substantial collaboration with the new regime. For me, VE Day meant the end of one horror and the beginning of another that I didn\u2019t want to be a part of. After the war I left Europe and moved to what would become Israel. I know it marks a great achievement, but for the last 75 years I have never celebrated this day and I doubt I ever will - the part of me that remains strongly Polish does not allow me to do so. A 98-year-old RAF veteran has completed a 2.2-mile walk in Belgium to raise funds for a much-loved soldiers\u2019 club in the Flemish town of Poperinge. George Sutherland, the son of a Belgian mother and Scottish father, escaped to Britain when the Germans invaded Belgium in 1940. He walked from Lijssenthoek commonwealth war cemetery in Poperinge to Talbot House, a clubhouse for all the ranks founded in 1915 but which is facing financial ruin because of the coronavirus lockdown. Sutherland had a police escort and was accompanied by a pipe major from the memorial bagpipe band of the Church of our Lady in Poperinge. You can see the video here. He was inspired by the fundraising efforts of Tom Moore, the army captain promoted to colonel last week after raising more than \u00a331m for the NHS by walking a hundred lengths of his 25-metre garden before his 100th birthday. The UK has fallen silent to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day as the country was urged to draw on the \u201csame spirit of national endeavour\u201d during the coronavirus crisis. Millions of people across the country paused at 11am on Friday to remember those who served in the second world war and the price so many paid for freedom. The poignant moment was led by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, who each laid a wreath at a memorial near Balmoral. Veterans and members of the public, unable to gather by their local war memorials as normal, reflected quietly in their own homes. Thanks everyone. Please do share your pictures and comments with me as I blog this morning. I\u2019d love to know how you are marking the day with those around you given the current lockdown. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The blog will be on hold from 11am to mark the two-minute silence in honour of the service and sacrifice of the wartime generation, and reflect on the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on so many lives across the world. Please join us. Some festive bunting sent to me from mid-Devon. Local activities include a minute\u2019s silence, and raising a glass to remember those who lost their lives. Please do share any local decorations with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Residents and staff at MHA care homes in the east Midlands have taken part in a sing-a-long of Vera Lynn\u2019s We\u2019ll Meet Again. The Red Arrows fly over Buckingham Palace to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day. An interesting comment article today written by the broadcaster, writer and Labour peer Joan Bakewell. She writes about remembering the euphoria of 8 May 1945, and the push for a fairer society that followed. She notes that the parallels today are striking. The prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley Johnson, has spoken of his delight after Boris Johnson named his baby boy Wilfred after the PM\u2019s grandfather, a second world war RAF pilot. He told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that Boris and Carrie have named their boy ... after my father Wilfred. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful strange feeling actually to see that this name is going to live on in this young boy. \u201cI actually broke the lockdown rule ... but I went, I said \u2018there\u2019s bound to be something in the papers\u2019 and went across to the garage ... I said \u2018I know I\u2019m not really meant to be out buying a newspaper I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s an essential journey but I just think there\u2019s something in the paper today about my 14th grandchild\u2019.\u201d The first minister of Wales has paid tribute to the \u201cunimaginable courage\u201d of those who served during the second world war. Mark Drakeford spoke to Welsh veterans aged between 96 and 103 in calls over Zoom, Skype, FaceTime and the phone. People across Wales, who are being asked to stay at home, will stand in silence at 11am to mark 75 years since the end of the war in Europe. The RAF will also fly Typhoon jets over Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. Drakeford said: Speaking with all veterans this week and listening to their extraordinary accounts of torpedo attacks and near misses, brought home the incredible grit and determination of an entire generation who lived through the second world war. All of us can look to them for inspiration, to help us deal with our own unique piece of history. I want to thank each and every person across the commonwealth who battled fascism and helped to build the foundations of a society, which we all benefit from today. A 98-year-old RAF veteran who says he has been inspired by the fundraising efforts of Capt Tom Moore is undertaking a two-mile walk this morning in aid of a soldiers\u2019 club in Belgium threatened with financial ruin by the coronavirus. George Sutherland, who escaped to Britain when the Germans invaded his native Belgium in 1940, will start his walk at 9am UK time from Lijssenthoek commonwealth war cemetery in Poperinge to Talbot House, a clubhouse for all the ranks founded in 1915 in the Flemish town, known to British soldiers as \u201cPops\u201d. Moore, who was promoted to colonel last week, raised more than \u00a331m for the NHS by walking a hundred lengths of his 25-metre garden before his 100th birthday. A Go Fund Me appeal to save Talbot House has so far secured \u20ac81,390 of its \u20ac100,000 target in the run up to the walk. The club is facing permanent closure after being forced by the pandemic to shut for the first time since the German occupation of 1940. \u201cI\u2019m still a fit man \u2013 I used to be a footballer,\u201d Sutherland told the Guardian earlier this week. \u201cI will do it out of respect for all those young men who lost their lives.\u201d Sutherland is the son of a Scottish father and Belgian mother. A single bag-piper will play as the war veteran walks from the cemetery, where he worked as a gardener for four decades after the war, to the club. Hello everyone. As I run this blog today I\u2019d like to make it as interactive as possible, documenting celebrations you are having to mark the day. Please do share your photos, messages and thoughts with me via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Here are the main events across the UK, and how you can see them or take part: After 10am: The Red Arrows will fly over London, and RAF Typhoons over Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. 11am: A two-minute silence will be held to honour the service and sacrifice of the wartime generation, and reflect on the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on so many lives across the world. Broadcast on BBC One. 11.15am: The nation is invited to join in with the Royal British Legion\u2019s (RBL) VE Day 75 livestream. 3pm: The Nation\u2019s Toast to the Heroes of World War Two. Members of the public are encouraged to stand on their doorstep and raise a glass to those who served. 3pm: BBC One will broadcast Winston Churchill\u2019s victory speech. 4pm: Historian Dan Snow will broadcast the last of his special VE Day inspired history lessons live on YouTube\u2019s Timeline channel . 8pm: Captain Tom Moore, who raised more than \u00a332m for the NHS in April, will share his memories of wartime in an ITV documentary called Captain Tom\u2019s War. 9pm: BBC One will broadcast a pre-recorded address by the Queen at the exact moment her father, King George VI, gave a radio address on 8 May 1945. 9pm: After the Queen\u2019s address, the nation is invited to come together in a rendition of Vera Lynn\u2019s We\u2019ll Meet Again on BBC One. Gen Carter praised military veterans, and also younger people living through lockdown. He told BBC Breakfast: These tremendous people - and we\u2019ve seen this, of course, with the now-Colonel Tom Moore, who has become a bit of a legend over the last month or so - of course, what they give us is they give us hope... and I think that word \u2018hope\u2019 is very important at the moment. I do think we should spare a thought for the young - it was tough for them in the 1940s but it will be tough for them going forward, I fear. The second world war veteran and NHS fundraising champion Capt Tom Moore told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: It\u2019s a very special day that is celebrating the end of a very fearsome war in Europe. But today it really is a very fine day, the sun is shining on us too, so I think we all need to be very happy that the war in Europe did come to an end.\u201d Moore, who fought in Burma during the war, said: It was a very important day and everyone concerned was absolutely very pleased that this was the end ... the bombing of London, the bombing of other cities ... had come to an end. It was a very, very happy day. Despite war ending in Europe, fighting continued elsewhere: At the time I was very concerned that all my comrades I had left in Burma were still fighting. My thoughts were with them because although there were great celebrations here all my comrades were still fighting in Burma with the Japanese. Here is a selection of photographs showing today\u2019s early celebrations. The UK will commemorate the 75th anniversary of VE Day, remembering those who fought and died in the second world war, despite the restrictions imposed to counter the coronavirus. There will be no large-scale public events, but tributes will be paid by politicians and members of the royal family, as well as through a host of other events. General Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff, said the scaled-down commemorative events necessitated by strict lockdown measures made it tough on the veterans, and urged the public to spare a thought for those stuck at home at a time of celebration. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has written to veterans to assure them that despite the ongoing lockdown, they and their efforts would not be forgotten. \u201cWe cannot pay our tribute with the parades and street celebrations we enjoyed in the past; your loved ones may be unable to visit in person,\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cBut please allow us, your proud compatriots, to be the first to offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.\u201d The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, will also release a commemorative message, and tributes will be offered by speakers in both the House of Commons and House of Lords. A two-minute national silence will be observed at 11am , led by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall and broadcast from a location in Scotland, where they are self-isolating. The Queen will address the nation in a televised message at 9pm, the exact moment her father, King George VI, gave a speech over the radio three-quarters of a century earlier. The Red Arrows will fly over London, and RAF Typhoons will appear above Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast. Capt Tom Moore, who raised more than \u00a332m for the NHS in April, will share his memories of war time in an ITV documentary called Captain Tom\u2019s War, which airs at 8pm. In it he recalls having his spirits lifted by Dame Vera Lynn, whose songs include We\u2019ll Meet Again and The White Cliffs Of Dover. \u201cShe did a little song for us, so it really boosted the morale of everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was great.\u201d Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live feed on VE Day celebrations, as people come together to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of the second world war in Europe. Victory in Europe (VE) Day marks the official surrender of Nazi Germany to the Allied forces on 8 May 1945.

According to the Local Government Association, fraudsters have gone into overdrive during the past six weeks to exploit the public\u2019s fears and the fact that they are stuck at home. Some local authorities have reported a 40% jump in complaints about fake items and other Covid-19-related scams since early March, the LGA said. It warned consumers to stay especially vigilant as they stay at home. Trading standards officers in Havering, east London, intervened after receiving a report of a car repair garage allegedly trying to sell Covid-19 testing kits to customers.

On the other side of the capital in Ealing, officers seized more than 500,000 face masks which had fake safety markings and fell apart on inspection, plus 2,600 bottles of illegal hand sanitiser. The LGA said there have been widespread complaints of scammers trying to exploit the replacement school meals chaos, telling people they need their bank details to make payments. Fraudsters have been posing as government officials offering special Covid-19 grants or loans while fake IT workers have preyed on those forced to work from home for the first time. Conmen in Swindon even posed as council workers distributing food parcels to gain pensioners\u2019 personal details with a view to later defrauding them, it said.

By reporting a scam, people can help someone else avoid being a victim of these despicable crimes and help councils track down the fraudsters, bring them to justice and recover their money.\u201d On Monday the Guardian reported how organised criminals had targeted potential motorhome buyers on eBay. Thousands of fake listings have appeared since the lockdown started in a bid to target those looking to buy a vehicle for use when restrictions are lifted. Last month an Uxbridge man was arrested under the Fraud Act after 250 Covid-19 testing kits were found in a car. He told investigators he was planning to sell them to construction workers.",

Those who listened to the BBC\u2019s rebroadcast of Churchill\u2019s 3pm victory speech, granting Britons a \u201cbrief period of rejoicing\u201d, knew that the two stories were out of sync.

That now seems to have been another bit of bungled comms by a government that is making a habit of them. Even if it\u2019s not true that social distancing will endure into 2021, or that a vaccine could take several years to develop, plenty of Britons will feel that, when it comes to the war against the coronavirus, we are rather closer to 3 September 1939 than we are to 8 May 1945.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ae265d3c460184820b98e4d2816da24b82ae203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ae265d3c460184820b98e4d2816da24b82ae203/0_453_5408_3244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking to 102-year-old war veteran Ernie Horsfall, from the cabinet room inside 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking to 102-year-old war veteran Ernie Horsfall, from the cabinet room inside 10 Downing Street.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is another difference, one that can feel like bad form to mention. Britain may have stood alone for a valiant year of the war, but it did not end it that way.

Not for nothing did Churchill\u2019s VE day speech spill over with \u201cgratitude to our splendid allies\u201d.</p> <p>But there is no such alliance, and all too little global cooperation, in the war against the virus. At the desk where Franklin D Roosevelt once sat now lurks Donald J Trump, who first denied that a threat existed at all and whose energies since have been devoted not to leading a worldwide effort to defeat it \u2013 a task for which the United States is uniquely equipped \u2013 but to finding someone to blame for the fatal havoc it is wreaking (usually Democratic state governors, the media, China or all three). Trump shows nothing but contempt for the global institutions created after 1945, designed to ensure that the peoples of the world would face future perils together \u2013 institutions that are now creaking under the strain.</p> <p>Britain stands especially alone. Not long after VE Day, Churchill was pressing the case for what needed to happen next. \u201cWe must recreate the European family in a regional structure called, it may be, the United States of Europe,\u201d Churchill declared in Zurich in 1946. Five years later, he <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/what-churchill-really-thought-about-britains-place-in-europe-36613\">was warning of the \u201cdisadvantages and even dangers to us in standing aloof\u201d</a> from a more united Europe. He was sad that Britain had refused to discuss the creation of a European army. He hoped Britain would join the European Coal and Steel Community, the precursor of the Common Market. Close ties to our European neighbours were precious, Churchill argued, even if that sometimes meant \u201cthe abrogation of national sovereignty\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Seventy-five years on, those who most like to invoke the name of our wartime leader choose to pretend he never did or said those things.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Saturday\u2019s blog: The decision to shelve detailed guidance on reopening communities came from the highest levels of the White House, according to emailed obtained by the AP. The White House said that the CDC\u2019s head had not approved the guidelines, but documents suggested that he had okayed them. Donald Trump said the coronavirus would go away without a vaccine, but offered no evidence to back the claim. Meanwhile, the US recovery lags way behind Europe, even as states reopen. Some California businesses on today began opening their doors for business \u2013 at least partially. The state also became the first in the country to commit to sending mail-in ballots to every voter in November. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller tested positive for coronavirus. Miller is married to Donald Trump\u2019s senior White House adviser on immigration, Stephen Miller, all of which led to concerns that everyone in the west wing has been exposed. A federal watchdog said that ousted government scientist Rick Bright may have suffered retaliation and should be reinstated during an investigation into his whistleblower complaint, according to Bright\u2019s lawyers. Bright was reassigned after raising concerns that the Trump administration was hyping hydroxyquinoline despite a lack of research that it was effective in treating Covid-19. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state is \u201cfinally ahead of the virus\u201d as the death toll and hospitalizations continue to come down in what became the world coronavirus hotspot. He warned the rest of the US that their numbers are still going up, and not to be hasty to reopen society and business. The Department of Homeland Security has come out strongly against internet voting in new draft guidelines, breaking with its longstanding reluctance to formally weigh in on the controversial issue, even after the 2016 Russian election hacking efforts. Kim Zetter reports for The Guardian: The move comes as a number of states push to expand the use of ballots cast online. The eight-page document, obtained by the Guardian, pulls no punches in calling the casting of ballots over the internet a \u201chigh-risk\u201d endeavor that would allow attackers to alter votes and results \u201cat scale\u201d and compromise the integrity of elections. The guidelines advise states to avoid it altogether or restrict it to voters who have no other means of casting a ballot. The document primarily addresses a type of internet voting called electronic ballot delivery and return \u2013 where digital absentee ballots counties send to voters overseas via email or a web portal are completed and returned via email attachment, fax or direct upload \u2013 but it essentially applies to all forms of internet voting. No states currently offer full-on internet voting, but numerous states allow military and civilian voters abroad to receive and return ballots electronically, and some of these voters use an internet-based system that allows them to mark their ballot online before printing it out and mailing it back or returning it via email or fax. Controversial trials in which volunteers are intentionally infected with Covid-19 could accelerate vaccine development, according to the World Health Organization, which has released new guidance on how the approach could be ethically justified despite the potential dangers for participants. So-called challenge trials are a mainstream approach in vaccine development and have been used in malaria, typhoid and flu, but there are treatments available for these diseases if a volunteer becomes severely ill. For Covid-19, a safe dose of the virus has not been established and there are no failsafe treatments if things go wrong. Scientists, however, increasingly agree that such trials should be considered, and the WHO is the latest body to indicate conditional support for the idea. \u201cThere\u2019s this emerging consensus among everyone who has thought about this seriously,\u201d said Prof Nir Eyal, the director of Rutgers University\u2019s Center for Population-Level Bioethics in the US. The prospect of infecting healthy individuals with a potentially deadly pathogen may sound counterintuitive, but according to Eyal the risk of death from Covid-19 for someone in their 20s is around one in 3,000 \u2013 similar to the risk for live kidney donation. In this case, the potential benefits would extend not to a single individual, but to thousands or millions who could be protected by a vaccine. Some California businesses on Friday began opening their doors for business \u2013 at least partially. As states and counties across the nation contend with pressure to lift the stay-at-home measures that have destroyed local economies, California is taking an especially cautious approach, walking a fine line between political and economic pressure to reopen and the public health imperative to stop the spread of disease. Public health experts told the Guardian that while no US state was equipped with enough coronavirus testing and surveillance to feel fully confident reopening, California\u2019s slow, piecemeal recovery plan \u2013 though far from perfect \u2013 seemed like the least risky option. Although the White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said guidance on reopening had not been approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Robert Redfield, the new emails obtained by the AP found that Redfield did clear the guidance. More from the AP: On April 24, Redfield again emailed the guidance documents to Birx and Grogan, according to a copy viewed by The AP. Redfield asked Birx and Grogan for their review so that the CDC could post the guidance publicly. Attached to Redfield\u2019s email were the guidance documents and the corresponding decision trees including one for meat packing plants. \u201cWe plan to post these to CDC\u2019s website once approved. Peace, God bless r3,\u201d the director wrote. (Redfield\u2019s initials are R.R.R.) Redfield\u2019s comments contradict the White House assertion Thursday that it had not yet approved the guidelines because the CDC\u2019s own leadership had not yet given them the green light. The decision to shelve a document created by the nation\u2019s top disease investigators with detailed advice to local authorities for reopening communities came from the highest levels of the White House, the AP reports. From the AP: A trove of emails show the nation\u2019s top public health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spending weeks working on guidance to help the country deal with a public health emergency, only to see their work quashed by political appointees with little explanation. This new CDC guidance, a mix of advice already released along with newer information, had been approved and promoted by the highest levels of its leadership, including [Robert] Redfield. Despite this, the administration shelved it on April 30. According to the documents, CDC continued inquiring for days about the guidance that officials had hoped to post by Friday, May 1, the day Trump had targeted for reopening some businesses, according to a source who was granted anonymity because they were not permitted to speak to the press. Fact check: Voter fraud Trump himself voted absentee in 2018. Experts say that voter fraud is incredibly rare. In North Carolina, an election was overturned in 2018 after a Republican political operative was alleged to have directed workers to collect and mail in other people\u2019s absentee ballots during the 2018 Republican congressional primary and during the 2016 general election. But states can avoid that sort of fraud by implementing ballot tracking, providing prepaid postage and setting ballot boxes and drop-off sites. Five states already conduct their elections entirely by mail, and have found ways to ensure the integrity of ballots. There is no evidence of widespread voting fraud. The Brennan Center for Justice found in 2017 that the risk of voting fraud is 0.00004% to 0.0009%. Moreover, Trump\u2019s own voting integrity commission found no evidence to support claims of widespread fraud found. Trump\u2019s campaign director Tim Murtaugh told CNN that California\u2019s plan to mail every voter a ballot is a \u201ctactic by Gov. Newsom to undermine election security, falsely implying, as the president has often done, that mail-in-voting begets fraud. Jason Wilson and Robert Evans report: Leaked audio recordings and online materials obtained by the Guardian reveal that one of the most prominent anti-lockdown protest groups, American Revolution 2.0 (AR2), has received extensive assistance from well-established far-right actors, some with extremist connections. AR2 presents itself as a grassroots network, but the recordings and other materials reveal its allies include a well-connected Tea Party co-founder and a family of serial online activists who have rolled out dozens of \u201creopen\u201d websites and Facebook groups. Its website was built and is hosted by a web designer long active in far-right circles online, and who runs a bespoke social media network for the militia movement. One of that website\u2019s previous users bombed a mosque, and another user, now memorialized on the site, was recently shot dead by police in Maryland during a firearms raid. Josh Ellis is the leader of AR2, which has driven anti-lockdown protests across the country, and presented itself as a spontaneous uprising. In videos posted to YouTube, the AR2 website, and across anti-lockdown Facebook groups, Ellis has presented the movement as inclusive and bipartisan, and himself as a conservative everyman. The House Judiciary Committee Democrats have called on the Justice department\u2019s inspector general to investigate Bill Barr after the DOJ dropped its prosecution of Michael Flynn. \u201cBy itself, the decision to dismiss charges against Mr. Flynn would smack of corruption and unacceptable political influence in an ongoing criminal matter: President Trump tweeted in defense of his former advisor, and one week later Mr. Flynn is poised to walk free,\u201d the Judiciary Democrats wrote in a letter to the DOJ inspector general. \u201cBut this is hardly the first time that Attorney General Barr has appeared to reach into an ongoing criminal case to do the President\u2019s political bidding,\u201d they write. That the DOJ also sought a shorter sentence for Roger Stone in February was another example of Barr doing Trump\u2019s \u201cpolitical bidding,\u201d the Democrats said. Despite signals that the entire West Wing could have have been exposed to the coronavirus, after Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller tested positive for Covid-19, White House officials are inconsistent in their approach to wearing masks and maintaining a physical distance. As an event with World War II veterans to mark the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe, defense secretary Mark Esper gathered with several men all over 95, took photos with them, and handed them coins from his pocket. Esper was not wearing a mask, nor were the veterans. Esper tested negative on Monday, a Pentagon spokesman told the Washington Post. The White House described the veterans as \u201cchoosing nation over self\u201d by showing up to the event, according to the AP. \u201cOf course, we presented to them the risk we are facing,\u201d said Timothy Davis, director of the Greatest Generations Foundation, which helps veterans return to the countries where they fought. \u201cThey said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter, Tim,\u2019\u201d Davis, who helped organize the event, told the AP. Hi, there. I\u2019m Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast. After Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary tested positive for Covid-19, the White House offered tests to members of the press corps. Hello again US live blog readers, apologies for entirely forgetting the mid-day summary. It\u2019s been another action packed day in US politics and coronavirus news and there is more to come. Handing over now to my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh in San Francisco. She\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours, so thanks for reading and do stay tuned. So far today: Donald Trump says the coronavirus may go away without a vaccine, but offers no evidence to back this up. Ousted government scientist Rick Bright may have suffered retaliation and should be reinstated during an investigation into his whistleblower complaint, his lawyers reported that they had been informed by a federal watchdog. Bright was out after raising concerns that the Trump administration wanted to \u201cflood\u201d coronavirus hotspots like New York and New Jersey with a malaria drug that Donald Trump was pushing despite scant scientific evidence it helped. Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller has the coronavirus, it was revealed earlier today. Miller is married to Donald Trump\u2019s senior White House adviser on immigration, Stephen Miller, all of which led to comments that everyone in the west wing has been exposed. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state is \u201cfinally ahead of the virus\u201d as the death toll and hospitalizations continue to come down in what became the world coronavirus hotspot. He warned the rest of the US that their numbers are still going up, and not to be hasty to reopen society and business. Donald Trump said during an interview this morning that he likes to learn from disgraced president Richard Nixon. You\u2019ve got to read it to believe it. California today became the first state in the country to authorize sending every registered voter a mail-in ballot in the upcoming elections, my Guardian colleague Vivian Ho writes. Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, signed an executive order a little earlier that he hopes will give voters a choice and make sure they \u201cdon\u2019t feel like they have to go into a concentrated, dense environment where they feel like their health is at risk\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s no safer, physically distancing way to exercise your right to vote than from the safety and convenience of your own home,\u201d said California secretary of state Alex Padilla. Voters will still have the option to vote in person, he said. The executive order came as Newsom modified the statewide stay-at-home order, ushering California into the next phase of coronavirus response. Certain non-essential retailers around the state can now offer curbside pickup, meaning roughly 70% of the state\u2019s economy can now reopen with modifications. The White House has halted talks with Congress over any further coronavirus stimulus package for the crippled US economy - as it waits for more information about how US state re-openings affect the economy, White House top economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters this afternoon. The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic party-dominated House of Representatives have already passed four major bills to address the novel coronavirus outbreak, including three aimed at stabilizing the economy as most Americans have sheltered in place and unemployment has soared. Democrats, who control the House, are pushing for a vote as soon as next week on another massive coronavirus relief bill that would include more money for state and local governments, coronavirus testing and the US Postal Service, Reuters writes. They also have been arguing with Republicans over oversight of the trillions of dollars being disbursed by the federal government in response to the crisis, with Republicans charging that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created a subcommittee on the crisis in order to attack Donald Trump as he runs for re-election in November. The panel made its first official action today, sending letters demanding that large, public corporations immediately return taxpayer funds received under the bailout bills, which were intended for small businesses. Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, told reporters that formal talks with Congress have paused for May. \u201cWell we just had another big infusion,\u201d Kudlow said with regard to why there was a pause in talks. In a separate interview on Bloomberg Television, he said the Trump administration was making contingency plans for a second wave of potential cases of Covid-19, including later shutdowns. Public health officials have cautioned against a fast and widespread restart to economic activity, saying it could lead to a second surge in infections. That\u2019s quite a headline from The Associated Press. Both dire and, perhaps, overly optimistic from the markets. Wall Street rallied again on Friday after a terrible, unprecedented report on the US jobs market wasn\u2019t quite as horrific as economists had forecast, The AP writes. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.4% in afternoon trading after the government said employers cut a record-busting 20.5 million jobs last month. While the number is a nightmare, it was slightly below the 21 million that economists told markets to brace for. More importantly, investors are betting they won\u2019t see another report that bad again because the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits has been slowly declining the last five weeks. Stocks around the world were already heading higher before the US jobs report came out, in part on hopes that US and China won\u2019t restart their trade war. After the release of the report, stocks climbed even more. In another sign of receding pessimism, Treasury yields tentatively rose. \u201cIn some aspects, investors are starting to look at it as the worst is behind us,\u201d said. Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management. It\u2019s not clear whether or when Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller would have chosen to reveal her own diagnosis for coronavirus if it hadn\u2019t all happened so publicly this morning. The first indications came when the Vice President\u2019s flight to Iowa was held up for at least an hour, and some individuals disembarked from Air Force Two, who had apparently been in contact with Miller. Then the president, as it were, let the Kate out of the bag: And once again, Kellyanne Conway\u2019s husband is not impressed by his wife\u2019s boss. The US president said a little earlier at his event with Republican lawmakers in Washington that coronavirus \u201cwill go away without a vaccine\u201d. He didn\u2019t offer any evidence for what he was talking about. He noted that there may be \u201csome flare ups\u201d in the fall, or \u201cnext year\u201d. \u201c[Viruses] die too, like everything else,\u201d he said. Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller has reportedly confirmed to the media that she tested positive for coronavirus this morning. There is growing consternation about to what extent people working in the White House, from the president on down, have been exposed to Covid-19 while not practicing social distancing, wearing face masks, using gloves, frequent hand cleansing, etc. Earlier, WH press sec Kayleigh McEnany had pointed to new steps taken to further protect top officials, noting the White House is now conducting contact tracing and putting in place all guidelines recommended for essential workers, Reuters writes. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,\u201d McEnany insisted to reporters at a White House news briefing. She also pointed to regular cleanings and adherence to distancing guidelines of six feet between individuals that are not always followed at crowded White House events. \u201cWe\u2019ve done every single thing that Dr. (Deborah) Birx and Dr. (Anthony) Fauci have asked us to do,\u201d she added, referring to highly respected physicians on the White House coronavirus task force. This morning Trump was asked in a Fox News interview whether those who serve him food would now cover their faces. \u201cThey\u2019ve already started,\u201d he said A federal investigative office has found \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the Trump administration was retaliating against a whistle-blower, Rick Bright, when he was ousted from a government research agency combating the coronavirus. The New York Times reports that the agency further said, according to Bright\u2019s lawyers, that Bright Should be reinstated for 45 days while it investigates. Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports that the lawyers, Debra S. Katz and Lisa J. Banks, said in a statement that they were notified late Thursday afternoon that the Office of Special Counsel, which protects whistle-blowers, had \u201cmade a threshold determination\u201d that the Department of Health and Human Services \u201cviolated the Whistleblower Protection Act by removing Dr. Bright from his position because he made protected disclosures in the best interest of the American public.\u201d The finding comes just days after the lawyers filed a whistle-blower complaint saying that Dr. Bright\u2019s removal last month as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority was intended as payback. They said Dr. Bright, who was reassigned to a narrower job at the National Institutes for Health, had tried to expose \u201ccronyism\u201d and corruption at the Department of Health and Human Services while pressing for a more robust virus response and opposing the stockpiling of anti-malaria drugs championed by President Trump. However, the Times further notes that the recommendation is not binding. A year ago, the same office said counsel to the president Kellyanne Conway should be fired for repeatedly violating legal prohibitions on using her position for political purposes. The president ignored the recommendation. Donald Trump was asked at his meeting with Republican lawmakers earlier who on Mike Pence\u2019s staff had tested positive for coronavirus. He said: \u201cShe is a wonderful young woman, Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of sudden she tested positive. She has not come into contact with me, she spent some time with the Vice President. It\u2019s, I believe, the press person, so she tested positive out of the blue.\u201d The staffer at the White House who tested positive for coronavirus this morning is Katie Miller, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, Donald Trump just confirmed. Katie Miller (nee Waldman) is married to the top adviser to the president, Stephen Miller. The White House strongly defended its efforts earlier to protect Trump and Pence from catching coronavirus. Donald Trump is at an event with Republican lawmakers in Washington, after a morning that included a visit to the WWII memorial and a press briefing by WH press sec Kayleigh McEnany. The US death toll from coronavirus just passed 76,000 and the president has reportedly floated that he now expects it to reach 95,000 or above. Trump \u201cDeath Clock\u201d goes live The Trump Death Clock, the real-time tracker that seeks to put a figure on the number of Americans who have died needlessly during the pandemic as a result of White House inaction, has just gone live in New York\u2019s Times Square. A digital billboard has beamed up on 43rd Street and Broadway in Manhattan that broadcasts in large red numerals the daily estimated count of unnecessary deaths caused by Trump\u2019s delay in issuing lockdown guidelines in March. Today\u2019s tally: 44,809. The billboard is a physical version of a website, TrumpDeathClock.com, that was started earlier this week and that the Guardian was first to disclose. It is the brainchild of award-winning film-maker Eugene Jarecki and modeled on the National Debt Clock that also has a presence near Times Square. Jarecki told the Guardian he wanted to hold Trump accountable for \u201creckless leadership\u201d by giving a real-time estimation of the number of Americans who have lost their lives through federal government incompetence. He bases the figure, which will update daily on the billboard, on 60% of the total real-time tally of deaths from Covid-19 in America. That proportion was first posited as a rough calculation of unnecessary deaths by epdemiologists. Trump has so far kept his silence about the death clock. If he finds out about the new billboard he is unlikely to be pleased, however \u2013 it is a mere 13 blocks away from his home in Trump Tower. Oklahoma Republicans are still making it harder to vote during the Covid-19 pandemic Days after the Oklahoma supreme court said voters do not have to get their mail-in ballot notarized during the Covid-19 pandemic, state Republicans quickly approved a law imposing new obstacles if someone wants to vote by mail, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports. The new measure still requires someone to get their ballot notarized, but says if the governor declares a state of emergency due to Covid-19 within 45 days of an election, a voter can provide a copy of their state ID. Republicans, who control both chambers of the state legislature, passed the bill, saying it was necessary to prevent voter fraud, which is extremely rare. Governor Kevin Stitt, a Republican, signed it into law Thursday evening. The move immediately drew criticism at a time when states are scrambling to make it easier to vote by mail since there is risk in contracting Covid-19 if one voters in person at the polls. Oklahoma\u2019s next elections are on June 30. \u201cThis legislative attack is based on bogus claims of voter fraud, but it is abundantly clear that the real motivation is to make it harder for Oklahomans to exercise their power at the ballot box,\u201d Ryan Kiesel, the executive director of the ACLU said in a statement. Oklahoma is among nearly a dozen states that require a notary, witness or identification with an absentee ballot. Those requirements could provide an extremely high barrier to Americans seeking to vote, since it will likely be difficult to track down a notary as businesses remain shut down. Many voters may also lack a printer or copier to make a copy of their ID. Civil rights groups are suing Alabama, which requires either a notary, two witnesses and a copy of a voter ID with an absentee ballot, saying voters shouldn\u2019t have to meet those requirements amid the Covid-19 pandemic. On the news that a staffer to Vice President Mike Pence tested positive for coronavirus this morning, a small but rather scary update, courtesy of CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins: Not Donna Reed... Turns out that last question called to White House press sec Kayleigh McEnany as she was leaving was, of course, from CBS\u2019s Paula Reid. Paula\u2019s Twitter handle is currently \u201cNot Donna Reed. Lawyer and CBS White House Correspondent\u201d The Hill explains, via its recent report: CBS White House correspondent Paula Reid [has] embraced a dig from President Trump that she is not like iconic actress Donna Reed, who often portrayed a \u201850s housewife in film and television, with Reid responding: \u201cFact Check: True.\u201d The response from Reid, who has clashed with the president on several occasions during White House coronavirus task force briefings, came after Trump singled her out, along with CBS colleague Weijia Jiang, for their \u201cattitude\u201d during questioning. Trump contrasted the two to Donna Reed, who captured four Emmy nominations as housewife Donna Stone on \u201cThe Donna Reed Show\u201d that ran on ABC from 1958-1966. The late actress also played Mary Bailey in \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life\u201d in 1946. Pence and coronavirus - update White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany just finished the briefing for the press and has exited the room. As she was walking out, a reporter could be heard calling out her question, which was not answered. \u201cWhy did you spent the first half of the briefing talking about Michael Flynn when both the president and the vice president have been exposed to coronavirus?\u201d the unseen journalist asked. Good question. A few moments before, McEnany did say, upon being asked about the news that a staffer to Vice President Mike Pence earlier today tested positive for Covid-19, a day after Trump\u2019s personal valet tested similarly, that \u201cthe White House is continuing to operate safely.\u201d McEnany said: \u201cWe have put in place the guidelines that our experts have recommended for this building,\u201d before then saying about the guidelines \u201cwe are now putting in place here in the White House\u201d, so it\u2019s a little confusing. Anyway, Potus and Veep have stepped up from being tested weekly for Covid to now being tested daily. The pool report from the briefing adds: Pool spotted all 14 seated reporters wearing masks as the press secretary spoke. All photographers were wearing masks. The White House stenographer was wearing a mask, but the press secretary and three press aides who joined her in the room were not. White House press briefing White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has just began her presser in the briefing room. She begins by marking the 75th anniversary of the Second World War\u2019s Victory in Europe day. Then, despite the US coronavirus death toll approaching now 76,000 souls, she immediately launches into the Michael Flynn case. McEnany begins: \u201cThe FBI exists to investigate crimes but in the case of Michael Flynn it seems they might have existed to manufacture one.\u201d She then details what she describes as a \u201cpartisan pursuit\u201d of Flynn by the intelligence community, asking did FBI investigators came to confront him in early 2017 \u201cwith the intent to get him to lie\u201d? She welcomed the Department of Justice move yesterday to drop the case against Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI over conversations he had with the Russian ambassador about the possible easing of sanctions that the Obama administration announced to punish Moscow for interfering in the 2016 US presidential election. Donald Trump has also talked about the fact that Flynn lied to the FBI, which is illegal. Flynn was awaiting sentencing. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see that justice finally prevailed,\u201d she said about yesterday\u2019s announcement. There is no word yet whether the judge in the case will try to block the DoJ move. Meanwhile, it\u2019s creepy hearing reporter after reporter in the press briefing room congratulating McEnany on her appointment as press sec last month, before asking their chosen question. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is giving his daily coronavirus briefing. He said 216 people in New York state died of Covid-19 yesterday, down from 231 on Wednesday. The number was close to 800 a day at the height of the outbreak in New York in mid-to-late April. Most cases are in New York City, though Cuomo has mentioned a cluster around some agricultural businesses upstate. So deaths and hospitalizations continue to decline in New York, where stay-at-home restrictions continue until May 15, when a review is expected. \u201cWe are finally ahead of this virus, for the first time, we have showed we can control the beast,\u201d Cuomo said moments ago... \u201cWe have the beast on the run. We have not killed the beast but we are ahead of it.\u201d But he warned, again, that if you take New York out of the picture, the numbers of infections and deaths in the rest of the US is still going up. Around 44 states are going to continue or begin some sort of reopening of societal movement and business this weekend. Cuomo warned: \u201cIf we reopen irresponsibly we will see the infection rate go up.\u201d Hospitalizations for new cases in New York right now are still disproportionately and dramatically affecting Hispanic and African American people. \u201cWe will address this immediately,\u201d Cuomo said, even though economic and health care inequities have been entrenched amid minority ethnic and low-income populations for decades, which make people more susceptible to infection and death from coronavirus. Just before Air Force Two was to be wheels up to Iowa one of Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s aides tested positive for coronavirus. Several staffers were forced to exit the plane, which is taking Pence, a Trump Cabinet member, and two GOP Senators to the Hawkeye State, Raw Story reports. The positive test comes just two days after Donald Trump\u2019s personal valet tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19. Another Pence staffer tested positive back in late March. Donald and Melania Trump are at the World War II memorial in Washington, DC, right now. It\u2019s a chilly and windy day. There are current military personnel and WW2 vets well up in their nineties at the solemn event, with everyone standing well apart. The event marks the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe day. Update on New York governor Andrew Cuomo. He normally gives his daily press briefing on the latest news about the coronavirus outbreak as it affects the world hotspot, New York City, and the rest of the state, at 11.30am ET, but today it\u2019s scheduled for 12pm. At 11.30, Donald Trump is due at the WW2 memorial in Washington to mark Victory in Europe day, the 75th anniversary of the German surrender there. There will be a live stream available of the governor\u2019s briefing via Cuomo\u2019s office: Another positive test for Covid among people working close to Potus and Veep - report The man and masks Donald Trump has said certain White House staff members have started wearing face masks, one day after the White House said his personal valet had tested positive for coronavirus. Trump, asked whether those who serve him food would now cover their faces, told Fox News in an interview that such White House staff had made that change, Reuters reports. \u201cThey\u2019ve already started,\u201d he said. The White House on Thursday said Trump and Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus and were feeling well after the staffer - a US military service member who works at the White House as a valet - came down with the virus. It also said the two leaders would now be tested daily, versus weekly. It was reported that Trump was \u201clava level\u201d angry about the valet situation. Trump has said he would not wear a mask and has not publicly worn a mask to any of his events so far amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but told reporters this week that he tried some on behind the scenes during his visit to a Honeywell face mask factory in Arizona. Both Trump and Pence have drawn fire for not donning face masks, with critics arguing they are setting a bad example for Americans. Pence did not wear a mask while visiting coronavirus patients during a recent visit to Minnesota\u2019s famed Mayo Clinic, noting that he was tested frequently for the disease. But he later said he should have worn one, saying it carries a symbolic weight as well. Trump is scheduled to attend a public event at the World War Two memorial in Washington any moment now, before meeting with Republican members of Congress at the White House, according to the White House. Trump said he has not yet been tested for antibodies to the novel coronavirus but probably would be soon. Such a test could confirm previous exposure to the virus. Attorney general Bill Barr is comfortable with the Department of Justice move yesterday to drop the criminal case against former, short-lived Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn had pleaded guilty to the FBI (which Donald Trump has previously acknowledged) about conversations he had in 2016 with the Russian ambassador about sanctions and was awaiting sentencing. Last night Barr did an interview on CBS in which he said history is written by winners. As the Guardian wrote at the time of Flynn\u2019s resignation after less than a month as Trump\u2019s national security adviser, it had been revealed that his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kisilyak after Trump won the 2016 election concerned sanctions the Obama administration was about to impose on Moscow for interference in the presidential elections. Intelligence officials claimed that Flynn had given the impression the sanctions might be lifted once the Trump administration came to office on 20 January. He then lied to the FBI and vice president Mike Pence about the nature of his conversations. Reminder of the Flynn timeline: Trump\u2019s mention of tapes in his extraordinary references, in a live phone call into Fox News, to how he learned from Richard Nixon is interesting, to say the least. He added that he wished there were tapes. Trump pretended there were tapes of the conversation he had with then-FBI director James Comey, after which Comey said Trump had asked for his loyalty and pressed him to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn, which was part of the nascent Trump-Russia investigation. As colleagues of mine wrote at the time, May 2017: Trump tweeted: \u201cJames Comey better hope that there are no \u2018tapes\u2019 of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!\u201d The tweet, which if taken at face value would suggest Trump has been secretly taping White House meetings, came after the New York Times reported that he demanded \u201cloyalty\u201d from Comey in a private dinner held shortly after Trump took office. At the White House press briefing [a few days after Comey had been fired that week], press secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to deny that Trump was taping visitors to the White House. Comey, who was overseeing an investigation into alleged links between Trump aides and Russia during the 2016 election, was fired on Tuesday in a surprise announcement. The White House initially claimed Comey was fired by recommendation of deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who was dissatisfied with Comey\u2019s handling of the Clinton email scandal. But Trump later said it was entirely his decision and said \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d factored into it..... ...The mention of tapes will only fuel further comparisons to Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal. Nixon infamously taped meetings in the Oval Office and recordings of those meetings led to his resignation from office. Here\u2019s transcript of Trump\u2019s full comments about Richard Nixon during his call in to Fox News this morning. How Trump talks about Americans lost to coronavirus The number of Americans who are infected with coronavirus, confirmed cases, has crossed the 1.25 million mark and the death toll is approaching 76,000 today. There was a protest outside the White House from nurses, who have lost more than 80 of their fellows to coronavirus. More than 100 bus and subway train riders have died of the disease in New York. On Fox this morning, the president chooses to talk about it this way, after spending several minutes talking about the need for an economic comeback and what an \u201cincredible\u201d job the administration has done. He mentioned that the US coronavirus dead would fill \u201ctwo Yankee stadiums\u201d, adding \u201cit\u2019s been grim.\u201d Note for global readers: Yankee Stadium is the baseball stadium of the New York Yankees baseball team, it\u2019s in the Bronx borough of New York City and its capacity is 54, 251. Amid the marathon ramble that was the president\u2019s phone call into Fox News this morning, he brought up former president Richard Nixon. Trump had praised attorney general Bill Barr for the DoJ\u2019s move to drop the case against Michael Flynn and the wider DoJ project to go back and investigate the Trump-Russia investigators, calling Barr \u201ca man of unbelievable credibility and courage.\u201d Asked if Barr had been his first AG, not Jeff Sessions, would there have even been \u201ca Mueller investigation and the Russia hoax\u201d, Trump said: \u201cNO!\u201d and said Sessions was a disaster (for recusing himself from the nascent investigation into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election, then being on the sidelines as Trump fired FBI director James Comey and Sessions\u2019s deputy Rod Rosenstein brought in special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate the whole shebang). Trump later fired Sessions. The president then pivoted to: \u201cI learned a lot from Richard Nixon, don\u2019t fire people. I study history, and the firing of everybody, I should\u2019ve in one way but I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because look at the way it worked out, they\u2019re all a bunch of crooks, and they got caught. \u201cBut I learned a lot by watching Richard Nixon. Of course there was one difference, one big difference, number one, he may have been guilty, and number two, he had tapes all over the place. I wasn\u2019t guilty, I did nothing wrong and there were no tapes.\u201d Trump does like firing people, though. Donald Trump was on the phone with Fox News when the April jobs numbers were released this morning. As the news alerts pumped out, the hosts of the morning show Fox &amp; Friends asked the president for his reaction to the unemployment rate in the US leaping from 4.4% at the end of March to 14.7% by the end of April. Read our full report on this here. \u201cIt\u2019s fully expected. There is no surprise. Even the Democrats are not blaming me for that,\u201d he said. He predicted that the third quarter will be one of transition, the fourth quarter will see recovery and \u201cnext year will be the best we\u2019ve ever had, if someone doesn\u2019t come in and triple taxes, like Sleepy Joe [his presumptive 2020 election Democratic opponent Joe Biden], he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d he said. Donald Trump has called into the Fox &amp; Friends morning show on Fox News to give his reaction to the Flynn decision. The show is famously sympathetic to the president and his administration. At the start of the call, the president was asked whether he believed the decision was proof that the Trump-Russia investigation was a \u201choax\u201d \u201cWell, absolutely,\u201d Trump replied. The former US special counsel Robert Mueller has previously demolished Trump\u2019s claims about his investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia \u2013 insisting the results did not exonerate Trump. The president wrapped the prosecution of Michael Flynn into his condemnation of the whole investigation, blaming \u201cdirty cops and politicians\u201d. The public has yet to hear from the federal judge in the Flynn case and what he, Emmet Sullivan in Washington, DC, will do next. Legal experts predict he could counter-move to block, hold up and/or investigate the DoJ move. The president had been speaking to Fox &amp; Friends for 21 minutes about Flynn before he was asked about the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than 75,000 people in the US so far. Trump led with: \u201cOur country is going back to work, we are opening up. It\u2019s a much smarter enemy [the virus] than the enemy we just talked about [a slew of Democrats, the Trump-Russia investigators and Trump\u2019s first attorney general Jeff Sessions], much smarter, those folks, they are not in the same league [clarifying: Trump\u2019s opponents/insufficiently loyal Republicans are not in the same league as the coronavirus]. \u201cWe are doing really, really well.\u201d He talks about ramped up production of ventilators and testing. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredible.\u201d He talks about the virus originating in China and infecting people in 184 countries. \u201cMost people didn\u2019t even know there are that many countries,\u201d the president said. Good morning, live blog readers. Donald Trump has already been tweeting, celebrating the justice department\u2019s move to drop the criminal case against the president\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn \u2013 a stunning reversal for one of the signature cases brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cYesterday was a BIG day for Justice in the USA,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cCongratulations to General Flynn, and many others. I do believe there is MUCH more to come! Dirty Cops and Crooked Politicians do not go well together!\u201d The move abandons a prosecution that had become a rallying cry for Trump and his supporters in attacking the FBI\u2019s Trump-Russia investigation, and came even though prosecutors for the past three years have maintained that Flynn lied to the FBI in a January 2017 interview about his conversations with the Russian ambassador. Flynn himself admitted as much, pleading guilty before asking to withdraw the plea, and became a key cooperator for Mueller. The chairman of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, said the decision was \u201coutrageous\u201d and said he intended to call the attorney general, Bill Barr, to testify about it.
