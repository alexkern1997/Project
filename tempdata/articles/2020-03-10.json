      "bodyText": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised elderly and unwell Americans to avoid crowds in order to limit the impact of the coronavirus \u2013 but the White House said it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d as the 73-year-old Donald Trump attended a fundraising event in Florida. The president played down the threat of Covid-19, saying many more people had died of the flu in the US than have been reported killed by coronavirus \u2013 despite warnings from his own officials that, unlike flu, the current outbreak concerns a new virus for which there is no vaccine and no natural immunity in the population. Covid-19 has also only just begun to spread in the US. Nancy Messonnier, head of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said more than 500 cases of the virus had been reported in 34 states and Washington DC as of Sunday night. Nineteen people had died, according to the CDC, 18 of them in Washington state with the other fatality in California. According to the World Health Organization, about 106,000 cases and around 3,500 deaths have been confirmed worldwide. \u201cThis seems to be a disease that affects adults and most seriously older adults,\u201d Messonnier said. \u201cStarting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease, and the risk increases with age. \u201cThe data really says that as you get older, the risk goes up and so in the broader age category of over 60 or over 65, over-80-year-olds have the greatest risk and so I would recommend that people make their own decisions based on an understanding of that risk.\u201d Messonnier said for the elderly, or those who have an underlying disease, \u201cwe are recommending avoiding crowds because those are places where in general, there\u2019s lots of transmission of respiratory diseases\u201d. Despite reports of an attendee at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) near Washington falling sick with coronavirus after interacting with senior Republicans including the Texas senator Ted Cruz \u2013 who placed himself in quarantine \u2013 the White House denied reports that the nation\u2019s top officials would change their routine. \u201cReports that the White House has issued formal guidelines to staff instructing them to limit in-person interactions and meetings are completely false,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, Trump\u2019s White House press secretary. \u201cWhile we have asked all Americans to exercise commonsense hygiene measures, we are conducting business as usual. I want to remind the media once again to be responsible with all reporting.\u201d Trump attended CPAC, where he was pictured shaking hands with organiser Matt Schlapp, who said he had contact with the infected individual early in the conference. The Georgia Republican congressman Doug Collins followed Paul Gosar of Arizona in announcing that he was also self-quarantining, after it emerged he had been in contact with the infected person at CPAC. Collins accompanied Trump in a tour of CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday. A second congressman who had been in contact with the Covid-19 patient at CPAC, Matt Gaetz, said he would self-quarantine. Gaetz partied with Trump in the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort over the weekend and flew back with him to Washington. According to the New York Times, the congressman found out he had had contact with a coronavirus patient when he was already on Air Force One with Trump and he went to a separate part of the plane to sit alone. On Monday Trump spent the day in Florida, where he attended a fundraising meeting in a private residence. Aides said 300 supporters would attend, expecting to raise $4m for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. Handshakes and selfies are customary for those attending such events, and Trump was pictured shaking hands with well-wishers along the way. The White House told reporters traveling with Trump that he was not worried about contracting or spreading coronavirus, which experts say can be spread via coughs or sneezes and by physical contact. Jeremy Konyndyk, who as head of foreign disaster assistance led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014, said on Twitter: \u201cI cannot overstate how risky it is to be exposing the president of the United States to events like this right now.\u201d",

Biden is 7 points ahead of the president in a potential general election (48% to 41%), while Sanders is 5 points ahead (46% to 41%). Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016, besting Clinton by about 10,000 votes.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e667b4f8f085f0b8d945191\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T17:28:18.055Z\">5.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US troops have begun withdrawing from Afghanistan</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hundreds of US service members have started withdrawing from Afghanistan as part of the initial troop drawdown outlined in the peace agreement with the Taliban.</p> <p>The AP <a href=\"https://apnews.com/2e8a815a031e8da37075feec466694c2\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> Hundreds of troops are heading out of the country as previously planned, but they will not be replaced as the U.S. moves ahead with plans to cut the number of forces in the country from about 13,000 to 8,600, [a US] official said. ...<br></p> <p>The pullout comes as Afghanistan\u2019s rival leaders were <a href=\"https://apnews.com/49838d1881bdd372b45c8c1b1c36d4c1\">each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies</a> on Monday, creating a complication for the United States as it figures out how to move forward on the deal and end the 18-year war.</p> <p>The sharpening dispute between President <strong>Ashraf Ghani</strong>, who was declared the winner of last September\u2019s election, and his rival <strong>Abdullah Abdullah</strong>, who charged fraud in the vote along with the elections complaints commission, threatens to wreck the next key steps and even risks devolving into new violence.</p> </blockquote> <p>The initial troop withdrawal comes as <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/officials-u-s-has-persuasive-intel-taliban-does-not-intend-n1150051\">reports</a> emerge that Taliban officials have no intention of honoring the promises they agreed to in the peace agreement.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e66762a8f085f0b8d945161\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T17:05:33.003Z\">5.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s where the day stands so far:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Trump </strong>downplayed the threat of coronavirus, comparing it to the \u201ccommon Flu\u201d and suggesting the economy is carrying on, even though the Dow is down nearly 1,600 points today.</li> <li><strong>Cory Booker </strong>and <strong>Kamala Harris </strong>will appear at <strong>Joe Biden</strong>\u2019s Detroit rally tonight after both senators, who have been listed as potential running mates to Biden, endorsed the former vice president.</li> <li>Biden criticized Trump\u2019s response to coronavirus, saying the president should \u201cjust be quiet\u201d and defer to medical experts.</li> </ul> <p>The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6673b88f08c2df6d2762c9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T16:54:52.348Z\">4.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The Senate finance committee is considering \u201ctargeted tax relief measures\u201d in response to coronavirus.</strong></p> <p>The Republican chairman of the panel, <strong>Chuck Grassley, </strong>said the tax relief measures were one of several proposals under consideration as the economy suffers because of the health threat.</p> <p>A statement from Grassley\u2019s office said, \u201cWhile we continue to assess the economic impacts, Chairman Grassley is exploring the possibility of targeted tax relief measures that could provide a timely and effective response to the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Dow is down more than 1,600 points today after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was briefly halted this morning.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6671108f085f0b8d945118\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T16:43:05.062Z\">4.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>About half of Democratic voters are enthusiastic about Joe Biden potentially winning the presidential nomination, </strong>according to a new poll.</p> <p>The HuffPost/YouGov survey <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/super-tuesday-biden-nominee-poll_n_5e6650f4c5b68d616457d88e?19\">found</a> that 48% of Democratic voters are ethusiastic about Biden becoming the nominee, versus 40% who say the same of <strong>Bernie Sanders. </strong></p> <p>But there\u2019s a stark age gap in those numbers.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for reading on this busy afternoon of coronavirus and politics news. Here are some stories to be aware of: Trump has been in close contact with members of Congress who have been exposed to coronavirus. Mike Pence declined to answer in a press conference on Monday if Trump had been tested for the illness. Rep Julia Brownley, a Democrat from California, locked down her Washington, DC offices and is staying home for the next week after potentially coming in contact with the coronavirus. Meanwhile, Rep Gohmert has declined to quarantine himself, despite having potentially been in contact with someone who had coronavirus. Trump announced in a press conference \u201cmajor\u201d economic measures to address the impact of coronavirus, including a potential payroll tax. That\u2019s all from me, take care. Former candidate Mike Bloomberg is firing staffers across the country, despite guaranteeing them they would be paid by his campaign into November. Bloomberg is reportedly encouraging workers to reapply for jobs with his new independent committee and allowing them to keep their Bloomberg-issued iPhones and MacBooks. The campaign of the former New York City mayor has stated it will start a new independent expenditure to keep staffers in six battleground states and work towards electing Biden. It is unclear how many of his former staffers he will retain for that effort. Election officials in St Louis, Missouri, are taking measures to stop the spread of coronavirus as they await tomorrow\u2019s elections there. All 357 polling places in the St Louis area have been sent additional hand sanitizing wipes and liquids, according to STL Today. There are six states slated to hold Democratic elections on Tuesday: Missouri, Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota, Washington and Michigan. The former wife of George Papadopoulos tweeted on Monday she is leaving the disgraced former Trump administration member, alleging abuse. Papadopoulos sparked the US inquiry into Russia election meddling and served 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI during the probe of his meetings with Russia. The final straw appeared to be being insulted on his podcast this week. As Trump and Pence held their press conference regarding coronavirus response Monday evening, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, released a list of priorities Democrats have related to the virus. Those priorities include paid sick leave and enhanced unemployment insurance for those who cannot work or lose work because of the epidemic, measures to support food security, and anti-price gouging protections for medical and non-medical essentials during the emergency. She also advocated to increase the capacity of the medical system and provide affordable treatment for all as the virus continues to spread. Donald Trump spoke at a press briefing regarding coronavirus response on Monday. He said his administration is proposing measures including working with hourly wage earners to ensure they can take time off and creating loans for small businesses so they can weather the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis is something we were thrown into and we have been handling it\u201d, Trump said. The moves come as the economy has been in a nosedive and coronavirus spreads around the globe. Trump also proposed a payroll tax he said he will discuss on Tuesday with the Senate. \u201cWe are going to take care of, and have been taking care of, the American public and the American economy\u201d, he said. Trump said he will hold another press conference on Tuesday to announce \u201cmajor\u201d economic measures he will work with the Senate to create. \u201cThey will be very dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a very strong economy but this has blindsided the world, I think we have handled it very well,\u201d he said. Trump has taken the stage at the task force press briefing. Republican Rep Gohmert of Texas is refusing to quarantine himself despite interacting with someone at CPAC who has been diagnosed with coronavirus. This comes despite several of his colleagues quarantining out of an abundance of caution. He said a CDC doctor told him he \u201cshouldn\u2019t be at any risk\u201d so he is returning to Congress and observing \u201cbasic hygienic processes\u201d instead of enforcing a quarantine. More members of Congress are now quarantining themselves after potentially being put in contact with the coronavirus. Rep. Julia Brownley, a Democrat from California is locking down her Washington, D.C. office and remaining at home for the next week after she discovered an individual who tested positive attended her office last week. The White House is about to hold a press briefing about coronavirus and the task force being used to address it. Stay tuned for updates. Coronavirus is encroaching on Donald Trump. The president has had close contact with a number of people exposed to the virus, the Associated Press reported on Monday. Close congressional confidants \u2014 including one who traveled on Air Force One with Trump Monday \u2014 have moved to quarantine themselves after exposure to a person infected with the virus. The potential contact comes after the White House said it was \u201cconducting business as usual,\u201d and Trump sought to project calm as the epidemic poses one of the greatest tests yet to his administration. On Capitol Hill, at least five lawmakers were in self-quarantine as discussions were underway on how to address the virus outbreak and economic volatility and keep the government functioning. Hello readers! Kari Paul here, taking over the blog from our West Coast bureau in San Francisco. Stand by for updates. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The Dow suffered its worst day since 2008, dropping more than 2,000 points amid intensifying fears about the spread of coronavirus. Trump downplayed the severity of coronavirus, comparing it to the \u201ccommon Flu\u201d and suggesting the economy was humming along even as markets nosedived. Two Republican lawmakers who have recently interacted with Trump are self-quarantining. Congressmen Doug Collins and Matt Gaetz said they interacted with a person who tested positive for coronavirus at CPAC and would self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris will appear at Joe Biden\u2019s Detroit rally tonight. The two Democratic senators, both of whom endorsed Biden in recent days, have been listed as potential running mates to the former vice president. Polls show Biden leading Bernie Sanders in Michigan, which will hold its primary tomorrow. With 125 pledged delegates up for grabs, Michigan is the most delegate-rich state voting tomorrow and could increase Biden\u2019s lead over Sanders. Kari will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Dow has closed down more than 2,000 points, or about 7.8%, amid fears about the spread of coronavirus. The nosedive marks the Dow\u2019s worst day since 2008, at the start of the Great Recession. For more updates on coronavirus, follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog: Congressman Matt Gaetz is now also self-quarantining after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus. The Florida Republican and close Trump ally attracted attention last week for wearing a gas mask on to the House floor to vote on the $8 billion coronavirus bill. But Gaetz\u2019s statement on his self-quarantine claimed he wore the gas mask to illustrate the depth of his concern around the spread of the virus. \u201cCongressman Gaetz had expected COVID-19 to impact Congress, given the elevated frequency of travel and human contact, and demonstrated his concern last week on the House Floor,\u201d the statement reads. Gaetz also flew back to Washington with Trump on Air Force One today, marking another interaction between the president and someone who has since gone into self-quarantine. Another Republican lawmaker who attended CPAC is self-quarantining after interacting with a person who tested positive for coronavirus. Congressman Doug Collins said he was not experiencing symptoms but was going to self-quaratine \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d Collins also shook hands with Trump on Friday as the president traveled to the congressman\u2019s home state of Georgia to visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A new national poll found Joe Biden leading Bernie Sanders by almost 20 points. The Quinnipiac University survey showed that Biden is attracting the support of 54% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, compared to Sanders\u2019 35%. Biden is also viewed as more electable than Sanders when it comes to an eventual general election race against Trump. While 80% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say Biden is very or somewhat likely to defeat Trump, only 61% say the same of Sanders. But the poll shows both Biden and Sanders leading against Trump in a hypothetical general election, although Biden\u2019s advantage (9 points) is a bit larger than Sanders\u2019 (7 points). Joe Biden said he would defer to medical experts on whether to cancel campaign rallies. Some experts have expressed concern about holding large rallies while the number of coronavirus cases in the US increases. \u201cIf they conclude that there shouldn\u2019t be big indoor rallies, then we\u2019ll stop big indoor rallies,\u201d Biden told NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do whatever they say.\u201d Trump said on Saturday that his campaign rallies, which he has been using to counterprogram the Democratic primaries, would continue. \u201cWe will have tremendous rallies, and we\u2019re doing very well, and we\u2019ve done a fantastic job with respect to that subject on the virus,\u201d Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. Cory Booker appeared at Joe Biden\u2019s campaign stop in Flint, Michigan, shortly after the New Jersey senator endorsed the former vice president. Booker will also appear at Biden\u2019s rally in Detroit tonight, alongside fellow senator Kamala Harris, both of whom have been listed as potential running mates for Biden. Polls show Biden leading in Michigan, which will hold its primary tomorrow and award 125 pledged delegates. The state, which went for Bernie Sanders in 2016, could give Biden an even larger delegate lead. The Dow has dropped more than 1,900 points today, as fears intensify about the spread of coronavirus. The New York Stock Exchange briefly halted trading this morning as the markets nosedived. For the latest updates on coronavirus, follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog: Joe Biden\u2019s campaign dismissed a report about the Democratic frontrunner\u2019s potential Cabinet picks. Axios reported that the former vice president is considering billionaires Mike Bloomberg and Jamie Dimon for senior roles like head of the World Bank and treasury secretary. Former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, who has lobbied for stricter regulation of Wall Street, was also listed as a potential treasury secretary in a Biden administration. \u201cThis is like fantasy football for politics, and no one who actually works on this campaign and is engaged in getting Joe Biden elected has the time to play,\u201d said Andrew Bates, Biden\u2019s director of rapid response. \u201cIt is laughable speculation and should only be treated as such.\u201d Another poll has been released showing Joe Biden beating Bernie Sanders in Michigan, which will hold its primary tomorrow. According to the Monmouth University survey, Biden is at 51% in the state, whil Sanders is 15 points behind at 36%. The survey is great news for Biden, who is looking to increase his delegate lead tomorrow. With 125 pledged delegates up for grabs, Michigan is the most delegate-rich state voting tomorrow. But Monmouth includes this important caveat in its press release on the poll: \u201cThe 2016 Michigan Democratic primary is considered to be the biggest polling miss of that cycle. Polls released in the week before the state primary showed Hillary Clinton with anywhere from a 10 to 27 point lead \u2013 Monmouth\u2019s poll had her up by 13 points \u2013 but Sanders ended up winning the contest by just over a percentage point.\u201d And here\u2019s some good news for all Democrats: Monmouth found Biden and Sanders both leading Trump in the battleground state. Biden is 7 points ahead of the president in a potential general election (48% to 41%), while Sanders is 5 points ahead (46% to 41%). Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016, besting Clinton by about 10,000 votes. Hundreds of US service members have started withdrawing from Afghanistan as part of the initial troop drawdown outlined in the peace agreement with the Taliban. The AP reports: Hundreds of troops are heading out of the country as previously planned, but they will not be replaced as the U.S. moves ahead with plans to cut the number of forces in the country from about 13,000 to 8,600, [a US] official said. ... The pullout comes as Afghanistan\u2019s rival leaders were each sworn in as president in separate ceremonies on Monday, creating a complication for the United States as it figures out how to move forward on the deal and end the 18-year war. The sharpening dispute between President Ashraf Ghani, who was declared the winner of last September\u2019s election, and his rival Abdullah Abdullah, who charged fraud in the vote along with the elections complaints commission, threatens to wreck the next key steps and even risks devolving into new violence. The initial troop withdrawal comes as reports emerge that Taliban officials have no intention of honoring the promises they agreed to in the peace agreement. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump downplayed the threat of coronavirus, comparing it to the \u201ccommon Flu\u201d and suggesting the economy is carrying on, even though the Dow is down nearly 1,600 points today. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris will appear at Joe Biden\u2019s Detroit rally tonight after both senators, who have been listed as potential running mates to Biden, endorsed the former vice president. Biden criticized Trump\u2019s response to coronavirus, saying the president should \u201cjust be quiet\u201d and defer to medical experts. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Senate finance committee is considering \u201ctargeted tax relief measures\u201d in response to coronavirus. The Republican chairman of the panel, Chuck Grassley, said the tax relief measures were one of several proposals under consideration as the economy suffers because of the health threat. A statement from Grassley\u2019s office said, \u201cWhile we continue to assess the economic impacts, Chairman Grassley is exploring the possibility of targeted tax relief measures that could provide a timely and effective response to the coronavirus.\u201d Meanwhile, the Dow is down more than 1,600 points today after trading on the New York Stock Exchange was briefly halted this morning. About half of Democratic voters are enthusiastic about Joe Biden potentially winning the presidential nomination, according to a new poll. The HuffPost/YouGov survey found that 48% of Democratic voters are ethusiastic about Biden becoming the nominee, versus 40% who say the same of Bernie Sanders. But there\u2019s a stark age gap in those numbers. Among voters aged 45 and older, 62% say they\u2019re enthusaistic about a Biden nomination, compared to 28% of those under 45. Sanders similarly sees an age divide in enthusiasm. While 55% of younger voters say they would be enthusiastic about his nomination, only 29% of those over 45 say the same. But there is broad agreement on one point: a 77% majority of Democratic voters say they expect Biden to win the nomination. Trump does not appear to have adjusted his behavior as concerns mount about the spread of coronavirus. The president was seen shaking hands with supporters in Florida as he arrived for a fundraiser. Reports have also been popping up that some of Trump\u2019s aides fear he is not taking the health threat seriously enough, while he simultaneously downplays the impact coronavirus is having on the economy. Trump\u2019s press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said the White House is conducting \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d amid fears about the climbing number of coronavirus cases. \u201cReports that the White House has issued formal guidelines to staff instructing them to limit in-person interactions and meetings are completely false,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cWhile we have asked all Americans to exercise common-sense hygiene measures, we are conducting business as usual.\u201d The statement came shortly after Trump downplayed the severity of coronavirus by comparing it to the \u201ccommon Flu\u201d and suggesting the economy is carrying on, even though the Dow is down 1,400 points today. Joe Biden expressed concern about Trump\u2019s response to coronavirus, criticizing the president for not deferring more to medical experts. \u201cI wish he would just be quiet,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell. \u201cI really mean it. That\u2019s an awful thing to say about a president, but I wish he\u2019d be quiet. Just let the experts speak.\u201d Biden also said he was worried Trump was trying to minimize the health threat out of fear of political consequences. \u201cThere\u2019s no confidence in the President, in anything he says or does,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHe turns everything into what he thinks is a political benefit for himself, when he\u2019s actually imploding in the process. But there\u2019s a lot of innocent bystanders that are being badly hurt.\u201d Cory Booker will appear alongside Joe Biden in Detroit tonight, after endorsing the former vice president earlier today. Kamala Harris, another former presidential candidate who endorsed Biden over the weekend, will also attend the Detroit rally. Booker and Harris have both been repeatedly mentioned as potential running mates for Biden, so he may be appearing alongside his future vice president tonight. Trump appeared to minimize coronavirus as the Dow is down 1,600 points because of the health threat. The president\u2019s tweet ironically came moments after his health and human services secretary emphasized the severity of coronavirus in a Fox News interview. \u201cThis is a very serious health problem,\u201d Alex Azar told Fox. \u201cNobody is trying to minimize that.\u201d Trump celebrated crashing oil prices as \u201cgood for the consumer,\u201d blaming the market nosedive on Saudi-Russian tensions and \u201cthe Fake News.\u201d At the risk of stating the obvious, the market slump is tied to very real concerns about the spread of coronavirus. And while slumping gas prices might be nice for drivers when they go to fill their tanks, they can have a devastating impact on global markets, as we are seeing this morning. Case in point: the Great Recession caused a steep drop in gas and oil prices. Some White House advisers are concerned Trump is not taking coronavirus seriously enough, after spending a weekend at Mar-a-Lago fundraising. The president is again holding fundraisers today as the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points. Trump also continues to downplay the severity of the health threat as the number of cases rise. CNN reports: For a self-described germophobe, Trump has continued to shake hands and interact with people like normal. While a bottle of hand sanitizer has been a staple in his life for decades now, people said they did not notice the President taking any extra precautions, despite being in the age bracket that health officials say should be most concerned about coronavirus. That wasn\u2019t the case for all of Mar-a-Lago\u2019s membership, which skews older. People who were at the club this weekend said conversations among guests focused intently on coronavirus and preparations to avoid contracting it. One person said there appeared to be extra sanitizer positioned on side tables throughout the club. Other guests said they didn\u2019t expect to return to the facility until the crisis wanes, wary of mingling with large groups. ... The weekend left several people around the President questioning how seriously he\u2019s taking the outbreak. He was briefed several times by Vice President Mike Pence, who he has put in charge of leading the administration\u2019s response and also made an appearance at Mar-a-Lago. Asked Saturday night if he was worried that coronavirus is getting closer to Washington, and therefore the White House, Trump said, \u2018No, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not.\u2019 A new poll out of Michigan shows Joe Biden leading Bernie Sanders by 24 points, as the former vice president consolidates support after a strong Super Tuesday performance. According to the EPIC-MRA/Detroit Free Press poll, Biden is at 51% in the state, while Sanders is far behind at 27%. Michigan is the most delegate-rich state voting tomorrow, awarding 125 delegates to the three remaining Democratic presidential candidates. (Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard also remains in the race.) If Biden can pull off a massive victory tomorrow, it will make it even more difficult for Sanders to catch up, so the presidential primary could wrap up quickly. Trading has temporarily halted at the New York Stock Exchange, as the Dow fell more than 7% over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. The nosedive comes a day after Saudi Arabia slashed oil prices amid escalating tensions with fellow oil producer Russia, which triggered fears of a damaging price war. For the latest updates on coronavirus, follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog: This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. Montana\u2019s governor, Steve Bullock, who suspended his presidential campaign in December, has announced he will run for Senate against Republican incumbent Steve Daines. Bullock had been expected to launch a Senate bid, following months of lobbying by top Democrats such as the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer. The popular governor had initially resisted calls for him to challenge Daines but changed his mind in recent weeks after discussions with his family. (Joe Biden\u2019s rising fortunes in the presidential primary probably also helped convince Bullock, considering Montana\u2019s very conservative leanings would have made it difficult to run with Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket.) Bullock still faces a difficult road ahead in trying to unseat Daines, but it was widely recognized the well known state leader faced the best chance of victory if he chose to enter the race. It feels like every Tuesday at the moment could potentially be a decisive moment in the Democrat primaries. Last week certainly re-shaped the race, and this week\u2019s vote could either see Bernie Sanders regain his momentum, indicating that we\u2019ll have a race that goes all the way to the wire, or, if Biden wins well, could effectively be the end of the road. Here\u2019s a reminder of who is voting, and when: Michigan 125 delegates, polls close 8pm ET (except four counties in the Central time zone) There\u2019s been a big ad spend from both campaigns in the state and both candidates are there in person today. Sanders has to repeat his 2016 win - but in recent polling Biden has a small lead. Washington 89 delegates, polls close 10pm Sanders won every county here in 2016. Missouri 68 delegates, polls close 8pm This was tight between Sanders and Clinton in 2016, and could be tight again. Mississippi 36 delegates, polls close 8pm Biden is favourite here, where the electorate is overwhelmingly black Idaho 20 delegates, polls close 8pm locally, mostly 11pm ET but the state is split across time zones. Idaho was a strong win for Sanders in 2016. This year it is a primary rather than caucuses North Dakota 14 delegates, polls close 8pm Also a Sanders win in 2016. It might be a dodgy day for stocks and shares, but someone who seems to continue to be able to pull in the cash is Donald Trump. Watchdogs and public records have revealed how Trump properties have raked in millions from Pacs and Republican figures during the president\u2019s time in office. The America First Action Super Pac, for example, has spent over $540,000 to host events at Trump\u2019s hotel, making it a top source of campaign revenues for the hotel and the Trump family business. Peter Stone has more - How Trump\u2019s business empire is cashing in on the 2020 campaign We are just under an hour away from the markets opening in New York, and it is going to be a rough ride for sure. MarketWatch here are suggesting that oil prices will \u201cdeliver a punishing blow to Wall Street\u201d. There are already some big pre-opening falls. You\u2019ll be able to follow what happens on our business live blog. It isn\u2019t just Kamala Harris and Cory Booker who have been endorsing Joe Biden this weekend. He has also, according to a report from the Associated Press, picked up the endorsement of one of the nation\u2019s largest gun safety groups. Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund plans to spend $60m on electoral activities this cycle, the AP says, some of which will go toward trying to elect Biden. An Everytown spokesman said the group typically airs advertisements and engages in grassroots organizing for the candidates it endorses, though it\u2019s unclear when the group will begin to spend on Biden\u2019s behalf. They boasts 6 million supporters and more than 375,000 grassroots donors, numbers that could help boost attention and support for Biden\u2019s presidential bid nationwide. In an interview with AP, John Feinblatt, head of Everytown for Gun Safety, said the group chose Biden because working for gun control is \u201chis past, it\u2019s his present, it\u2019s his future\u201d. Asked if Sanders\u2019 record on gun control factored into the group\u2019s decision, Feinblatt said that the group looks at a candidate\u2019s \u201ctotal record\u201d. \u201cYou can\u2019t confine yourself to just what somebody says they\u2019ll do in the future. You have to look at what they\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cUnquestionably, Joe is a person who\u2019s dedicated much of his life to the issue of gun safety.\u201d During his tenure in the House and the Senate, Bernie Sanders opposed a 1993 gun safety bill known as the Brady Bill and supported bills that would give gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits. His position on gun control issues has shifted, and he now has a D-minus rating from the National Rifle Association. But Sanders\u2019 past votes have been frequent fodder for attacks from his opponents, with Biden charging in a recent TV debate, as he stood next to the Vermont senator, that \u201cmy friend on my right and others have given gun manufacturers absolute immunity\u201d. Biden also has run ads highlighting his work on gun control measures, and on Sunday he received the endorsement of another gun control group, the Brady Campaign. Pete Buttigieg has been on the Today show, talking about Joe Biden \u2013 and about the significant role that the economy could play in tomorrow\u2019s vote, saying: My part of Indiana is very similar to those parts of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania where we\u2019ve been told the economy is great. And yet right now we are seeing so many families trying to get ahead, but when your pay does go up it doesn\u2019t keep pace with the cost of higher education, housing, the cost of prescription drugs, and there need to be solutions for that. But that is what vice president Biden has been focussed on for his entire career. He also suggested that a vote for Trump last time around had been a vote to \u201cburn the house down\u201d out of frustration. Michigan is the biggest prize in tomorrow\u2019s primaries, with 125 delegates up for grabs. Tom Perkins has been in Detroit for us, looking at how last time around Sanders\u2019 upset against Hillary Clinton propelled his campaign forwards just as some had begun to write him off. He comes back four years later in need of a similar result. The latest Michigan polling mirrors others around the country and suggests the state is leaning toward Biden. While Sanders led by as much as nine points in late February, a poll taken after Biden\u2019s huge South Carolina win put Biden up seven. But, despite the appearance of an uphill battle, there is optimism among some Sanders supporters. Read it here \u2013 Politico\u2019s chief political correspondent Tim Alberta has also been reporting from Michigan, this time Ann Arbor. He says that one of the reasons that Sanders\u2019 victory in the state was significant was not what it meant for the Democratic race, but what it foreshadowed for November\u2019s election. Where the Vermont senator saw a sudden groundswell of support for his insurgent candidacy Democrats on the ground in Michigan saw something very different. They saw disturbingly low turnout. They saw Clinton failing to energize black voters. They saw young people and independents rebelling against the Democratic front-runner. They saw white working-class voters abandoning her, and the party, in numbers that were once unfathomable. Alberta argues that if Sanders can\u2019t win in Michigan tomorrow, he can\u2019t at all. Read it here \u2013 Politico: Michigan Was Once Bernie\u2019s Resurrection. Now It Could Be His Burial The phrase \u201cThe economy, stupid!\u201d has echoed down presidential election campaigns through the years, and it might prove to be a significant factor in Michigan. Trump has made much of the US economic performance under his administration but Axios reports: The counties in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that flipped from blue to red in 2016 all have something in common: they\u2019re heavily reliant on manufacturing and are still struggling amid industrial decline. Whether Biden or Sanders come out on top tomorrow could be a significant indicator on whether the Democrats have won back those voters \u2013 and to which flavour of policies. Read it here \u2013 Axios: Manufacturing counties still struggling ahead of Michigan primary Joe Biden has picked up another big endorsement, this time from the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, who has tweeted that Biden \u201cwon\u2019t only win - he\u2019ll show there\u2019s more that unites us than divides us\u201d. Booker ended his own challenge for the nomination back in January, and is another high-profile supporter for Biden after Kamala Harris endorsed the 77-year-old last night. The FiveThirtyEight endorsement tracker shows just how many of the Democratic party\u2019s major figures have swung behind Biden rather than Sanders. Trump is on the attack over coronavirus again, tweeting that \u201cThe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power to inflame the coronavirus situation\u201d. There are a couple of interesting articles this morning looking at Trump\u2019s relationship with the coronavirus and the White House team trying to communicate to the US public about it. NBC has an article on the mixed messaging sparking internal frustration: Multiple sources acknowledged that Trump is simply not on the same wavelength as the rest of his team, but they said there isn\u2019t much they can do to change his public tone. Trump has been advised by some close to him to let public health officials, rather than the politicians, take a more forward-facing role. But a person close to the White House said Trump thinks it helps him politically to keep doing what he has been doing. Read it here - NBC News: Mixed White House messaging on coronavirus sparks internal frustration The New York Times has an analysis piece that suggests the coronavirus may be immune to the usual Trump tactics. Peter Baker\u2019s view is that: A president who is at his strongest politically when he has a human target to attack has found it harder to confront a growing outbreak that has rattled the country. Read it here - New York Times: For Trump, Coronavirus Proves to Be an Enemy He Can\u2019t Tweet Away Donald Trump has been very keen during his time in office to take credit for stock market highs. It remains to be seen how happy he will be to take any blame for the market crash that is expected when trading opens later today. CNBC are reporting that the Dow could immediately fall as much as 1,300 points. The markets won\u2019t be allowed to go into complete free-fall however. There are several \u201ccircuit-breakers\u201d built into it which will pause trading on the S&amp;P 500 if it falls below certain thresholds. You can follow what is likely to be a volatile morning on over on our business live blog with my colleague Graeme Wearden. Good morning, on what is likely to prove a busy and eventful day. Not only do we have last-minute campaigning for a whole bunch of Democrat primaries tomorrow on the agenda, but the US will be waking up to news of turmoil in international markets as fears about the coronavirus outbreak have set stocks and shares plunging across Asia and Europe. Donald Trump is already up and tweeting in campaign mode: He\u2019s also been retweeting the contentious assertion that media coverage of the coronavirus is as dangerous to the US as the outbreak of Covid-19 itself. The president is fundraising in Florida today, and will be back at the White House this afternoon. Mike Pence will lead a White House coronavirus taskforce meeting in the situation room at 4pm ET. Bernie Sanders is campaigning in Missouri and Michigan. Michigan is the state offering the most delegates tomorrow - 125 of them. Also voting on Tuesday are Idaho, North Dakota, Mississippi, Missouri and Washington. Joe Biden currently leads with 664 pledged delegates to Sanders\u2019 573. Biden is in Michigan, too, where he will be appearing alongside former rival for the nomination Senator Kamala Harris at a rally in Detroit. Harris endorsed Biden at the weekend. And Elizabeth Warren? She\u2019ll be reflecting on going viral at the weekend for her spot on Saturday Night Live, as everybody waits to see whether she is going to endorse one of the two remaining realistic challengers to take on Trump in November.",

10am,\u201d said Ananya Bhattacharya, who arrived in Egypt for a holiday on 7 March and took a train to Luxor, arriving this morning. She said that her temperature was taken on arrival at Cairo airport and she was made to sign a declaration concerning the virus.</p> \n  <p> Bhattacharya arrived in Luxor as Egyptian officials tried to contain the virus, while attempting to prevent damage to its tourism industry, which accounts for about 12% of GDP. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe visited Karnak and Luxor temples \u2013 both were open when we went,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were then told we\u2019d have to wait around until our cruise received an all-clear from health officials, who were inspecting it for signs of coronavirus.\u201d </p> \n  <p>She added that they were finally able to board the ship at 3.30pm local time. </p> \n  <p>An Indian passenger on the Asara nile cruise in Luxor, where 45 passengers and crew were quarantined after testing positive for the virus, told the Bangalore-based site <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/we-are-confined-cabins-tn-tourist-quarantined-egypt-ship-speaks-tnm-119816\">the News Minute</a> that many remained quarantined on the ship. </p> \n  <p>This followed an onboard announcement on 6 March \u2013 hours before passengers were expecting to disembark \u2013 that they would be quarantined on board for 15 days, the passenger, Vanitha Rengaraj, said. \u201cWe have been asked to stay inside our rooms and not venture outside.</p> \n  <p>There is a doctor on the ship all the time, and a few nurses. \u201cThey [officials] have also briefed us on what to do if we have symptoms like vomiting, fever etc,\u201d Rengaraj said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T14:56:04.150Z\">at 2.56pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6648d18f087df56e4c5052\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregory-robinson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-09T14:23:20.394Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Manchester</strong> airport\u2019s Terminal 3 seems a lot quieter than usual.

Children are playing out in the streets, however, because they are not in school.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Corr decided to find the earliest UK-bound flight available because she was afraid of being trapped in Milan. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to get back, so I went online and panic-booked. Same-day flights were very expensive.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A lot of people were feeling the area was like a \u201cpost-apocalyptic war zone\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really not.

be enforced with immediate effect. </p> \n  <p>The measures, which include a two-week ban on sporting events, came as Greece\u2019s Olympic Committee announced that for the first time since 1984 this week\u2019s flame-lighting ceremony for the Tokyo 2020 games will be held without spectators. </p> \n  <p>The event, which usually takes place in front of an audience of thousands, is unlikely to be seen by more than a hundred people when it gets under way in ancient Olympia on Thursday, organisers say. </p> \n  <p>The prefecture of Ileia in the west of Greece, to which Olympia belongs, is one of the regions hardest hit by the outbreak, although there were signs today of more cases in Athens, with media reporting that personnel at the Israeli embassy had also tested positive for the virus.</p> \n  <p>A 40-year-old woman, who had visited <strong>Israel</strong> on a tour of the Holy sites, is in isolation in a hospital in Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, also suspected of having contracted the virus. </p> \n  <p>Although an official announcement is expected later today, doctors say the case has all but been confirmed and the woman\u2019s two children have been withdrawn from school at their mother\u2019s request. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2894b155ad0029e7eb5bf05af01c17059c82757b\"> \n   <img

putting off its <a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/events/medicine-2020-rcp-annual-conference\">Medicine 2020</a> gathering from April to next January \u201cso that doctors can concentrate on looking after patients with Covid-19 and avoid putting themselves at any increased risk from the virus.

The college represents about 28,000 hospital doctors in England, though has some members elsewhere too. </p> \n  <p>Prof Andrew Goddard, the RCP\u2019s president, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our aim is always to protect people\u2019s health, and it simply wouldn\u2019t be sensible to bring together hundreds of doctors from all over the UK, \u2013 and other countries too \u2013 when they are already stretched dealing with Covid-19 on top of all the other pressures on the NHS.</p> \n   <p>We shouldn\u2019t put doctors at unnecessary risk of contracting or spreading the virus, so it is a wise precaution to postpone Medicine 2020.

The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Dan Sabbagh</strong>, has this explainer of how exactly such meetings work.</p> \n  <p>Cobra meetings are held in the basement of the Cabinet Office, not far underground from the Cabinet War Rooms, and represent the crown jewel of Britain\u2019s emergency planning system.</p> \n  <p>Prime ministers, minsters, chief advisers and the most junior official have to hand in their mobile phones and tablets, encouraging attendees to concentrate on the topic in hand \u2013 ranging from a terrorism incident, a natural disaster or, in this case, a threatened pandemic.</p> \n  <p>The acronym stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Room A, although in reality the largest meeting room is Room F, which sits 20 or so people around a coffin shaped table. Screens are mounted on the walls to show presentations and to patch in those who have to participate remotely, such as Scottish first ministers.</p> \n  <p>The meetings are tightly structured to a pre-written \u201cchair\u2019s brief\u201d, which is intended to allow somebody to lead a meeting at short notice, if they are stressed, and to get quickly to key decisions. The first step is the Common Recognised Information Picture, the CRIP, an agreed statement of facts \u2013 designed to prevent needless arguments about what is going on on the ground. CRIPs are put together in advance, and may well be the product of a considerable amount of work.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1315c6943723a0b6f42f6b9932880efcb642955c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1315c6943723a0b6f42f6b9932880efcb642955c/0_126_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health Secretary Matt Hancock (left) and Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty (right) in Downing Street ahead of a Cobra meeting to discuss coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health Secretary Matt Hancock (left) and Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty (right) in Downing Street ahead of a Cobra meeting to discuss coronavirus.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Boris Johnson, or whoever is chairing, then solicits advice from key figures such as the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, or the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, plus the senior ministers present. More junior officials are housed in satellite rooms in case there is a technical question that needs to be answered immediately; the idea is that there is nothing that should not be able to be clarified straight away.</p> \n  <p>A good brief will warn the chair of likely points of conflict, or if there are going to be ministerial disagreements, and may even suggest ways through. But the idea is that after a relatively short period \u2013 it is not uncommon for a Cobra meeting to last just 45 minutes \u2013 it will reach the key decision point, in this case whether to formally move to the delay phase of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n  <p>Meeting over and phones recovered, the idea is that everybody in the room will have a concise shared understanding of the problem and agree what the next steps are in tackling it. But some aspects sit ultimately with the prime minister alone: as when Tony Blair decided not to close the London Underground the day after 7/7, after what had been deemed to be a credible terrorism threat.

      "bodyText": "We are closing this blog now. Thanks for following along. Our new coronavirus live blog, with all the latest developments, is here. Markets rallying after Donald Trump announces \u2018major\u2019 economic measures in response to coronavirus The US President said his administration is proposing measures including working with hourly wage earners to ensure they can take time off and creating loans for small businesses so they can weather the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis is something we were thrown into and we have been handling it\u201d, Trump said. Markets are already responding positively: Scott Morrison is appealing to Australians\u2019 patriotism to guide the nation through the spread of the deadly coronavirus as his government prepares to jettison its planned surplus, AAP reports. But the prime minister has also reassured Australians his government won\u2019t look at further cuts to essential services such as schools, hospitals and the NDIS as it deals with the economic impact of the health crisis. His government is putting the final touches on a stimulus package, expected to be worth as much as AU$10bn ($US$6.6bn). In a speech to business leaders on Tuesday morning, Mr Morrison outlined seven principles guiding that economic response. The coronavirus is a \u201cnew, complex, hydra-headed and rapidly evolving challenge\u201d, Morrison told the Australian Financial Review summit in Sydney. \u201cWhatever you thought 2020 was going to be about, think again,\u201d Mr Morrison said. \u201cWe now have one goal together this year: to protect the health, the wellbeing and livelihoods of Australians through this global crisis, and to ensure that when the recovery comes, and it will, we are well-positioned to bounce back strongly on the other side.\u201d It is important to remember the problem is only a temporal one, not structural, and learn the lessons of the global financial crisis, he said. After plunging at the open, the ASX200 has clawed back most of its losses to be down just 0.8% by 11.10am. The monthly survey of businesses conducted by the NAB is due out at about 11.30am and could provide the market\u2019s next cue. The travel ban for international excursions for Western Australian schools has been extended due to the spread of coronavirus across the United States. WA Education Minister Sue Ellery said her decision to extend the ban was following advice from the Chief Health Officer. Due to its close proximity to the US border, Canada has also been included. All public, private and Catholic schools will be banned from travelling to those countries. New Zealand is the only country where international travel will be considered for WA school groups. \u201cWe have a duty of care to school students and staff, with the aim of reducing the possibility of exposure to the coronavirus while overseas,\u201d Ms Ellery said. In Australia, an additional eight cases have been confirmed in the state of New South Wales, bringing the the state\u2019s total to 55. The latest cases include a woman in her 20s who had contact with a previously confirmed case at Ryde Hospital, a woman in her 40s who recently returned from South Korea and a Victorian man in his 20s who recently returned from Hong Kong. NSW Health is separately working to establish how three others were infected: two women in their 30s and 40s and a man in his 70s. Two other cases are related to the outbreak at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge nursing home in Macquarie Park. Two year 10 students from St Patrick\u2019s Marist College in Dundas and a year 7 pupil from Willoughby Girls High School were on Monday confirmed to have coronavirus. The fathers of the two St Patrick\u2019s students are both Defence staff and had previously tested positive for the infection. NSW authorities are now investigating a coronavirus cluster centred around Ryde Hospital, the Australian Defence Force and Dorothy Henderson Lodge. St Patrick\u2019s Marist College and Willoughby Girls High School will be closed on Tuesday as a precautionary measure. Hi, Helen Sullivan here. I\u2019ll be taking over the blog for the next while. The coronavirus crisis has edged closer to the Oval Office after it emerged that Florida congressman Mark Gaetz, who travelled with Donald Trump on Air Force One from his state to Washington on Monday, is now in self-isolation. He took the action after it emerged that he was one of several Republican lawmakers who were exposed to a person at last month\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference who tested positive for the virus. The president meanwhile continued to play down the impact of the virus and again compared it with the common flu. He blamed the stock market collapse on Monday on the oil price war and \u201cfake news\u201d. We\u2019ll have a full story on this shortly, so stay tuned. We\u2019ve got more on the Australian share market from our business editor, Ben Butler, including news that while the Qantas boss was speaking, the airline\u2019s shares fell 6%: A 3.7% fall in the Australian market this morning has been driven by tumbling airline, retail and financial stocks. Oil and gas producers have also been punished for a second day running after Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude. Australia\u2019s flag carrier, Qantas, plunged more than 6% after the opening bell after telling the market it has slashed international routes by a quarter due to the coronavirus outbreak. Travel groups Flight Centre and Webjet also tumbled more than 5%. Woodside Petroleum slumped 4.4% and Whitehaven Coal crumbled by 6.6%. In tumultous early trading oil and gas producer Santos, which on Monday crashed 27%, opened down by 4% before surging to be up about half a percent by 10.30am. Insurance companies have been hit hard, with QBE shedding 4.2%, bancassurance Suncorp down 3.4% and insurance sales group Steadfast diving 5.9%. The medical sector is also in the gun - private hospital operator Ramsay Health shed almost 7%. As we reported earlier, the Australian airline Qantas has reduced its flights by a quarter in the wake of falling demand for flights. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, who earned A$24m last year, will forgo his salary for the rest of the financial year. Staff will be asked to take unpaid annual leave to avoid job cuts as the business deals with the crisis. He is giving a media conference now and said that it\u2019s a question of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d in the airline industry, which has been hit very hard by the outbreak. He insisted Qantas was well-placed to deal with the crisis which has already accounted fior Flybe in the UK. Joyce said: We are in a position where we\u2019re one of the fittest airlines in the world. We\u2019rein a strong position to be able to come out of this and take opportunities. And this will be a survival of the fittest. The benchmark ASX200 index has fallen 3.7% in Sydney as another horror day begins to unfold on the financial markets. Stand by for similar falls elsewhere in Asia Pacific as markets open on Tuesday. That\u2019s all from me. My colleague Martin Farrer will be taking over the blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the most recent events: More than 60 million were placed in lockdown conditions in Italy as the measures imposed on the northern \u201cred zone\u201d were extended to the whole country. The steps announced by the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte included the suspension of all public gatherings and strict travel restrictions. Anyone arriving in the UK from Italy should self-isolate for two weeks, Whitehall warned. Officials updated travel advice in response to Conte\u2019s announcement and advised against all but essential travel. Egypt announced similar measures aimed at countering the virus\u2019s spread. Authorities had already cancelled all upcoming cultural events. And you can read a summary of the day\u2019s earlier events here. A Royal Bank of Canada employee working at one of the lender\u2019s suburban Toronto offices, who was earlier suspected of having contracted coronavirus, has tested positive, Reuters is reporting. Citing a bank spokeswoman, the news agency said the employee worked in the Meadowvale office complex in Mississauga, about 25 miles west of the bank\u2019s downtown Toronto headquarters. The person has remained at home in self-isolation since late last week, the bank said. Last week, Royal Bank advised other employees working on the same floor to self-quarantine until further notice. The bank has also disinfected the affected floor, and all common areas, including elevators, the cafeteria and wash rooms, the spokeswoman said. We continue to work with Public Health in determining advice and next steps for our employees on the impacted floor. More than 111,600 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and over 3,800 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements. A patient at the Royal London hospital in Whitechapel has tested positive, Barts Health NHS Trust has confirmed. A spokesman has told the Guardian that \u201cstaff in close contact with the patient have been sent home to self-isolate, as per PHE guidance\u201d. The department of health and social care says it\u2019s unable to say whether or not the patient\u2019s included in or additional to the number of confirmed cases it released earlier today. It plans to update the figure tomorrow. Anyone who arrives in the UK from Italy should place themselves in isolation for two weeks, the UK government has said after their Italian counterparts extended quarantine measures to the whole country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has said: We have amended our travel advice to recommend against all but essential travel to Italy. The safety of British nationals is always our number one priority. The advice is that anyone who arrives from Italy subsequent to Italian government decision should now self-isolate for 14 days. The benchmark Australian index, the ASX200, is set to open down almost 5% after a horror day on US markets. It is likely to be the second day running of heavy falls, following a 7.4% tumble on Monday amid growing fears the coronavirus crisis will plunge an already weak global economy into recession. US markets plunged more than 7%, triggering a 15 minute \u201ccircuit-breaker\u201d halt to trading in New York \u2013 a precaution put in place following the global financial crisis in an attempt to stop enormous one-day falls. European markets were down almost 8%. Order books indicate Qantas, which fell almost 11% on Monday, was due to fall another 1.2% as the airline grounded more flights, reducing its international capacity by about a quarter. Qantas has reduced its international flying capacity by a quarter, grounding eight Airbus A380s, and leaving just two of the largest planes in its fleet flying. The cuts to international routes will last for six months following a \u201csudden and significant drop in forward travel demand\u201d. Smaller planes will now service a number of key international routes. The airline\u2019s signature Sydney-Singapore-London return service (QF1 and QF2) will be temporarily re-routed to become a Sydney-Perth-London service. To help cut costs, Qantas\u2019s chief executive Alan Joyce \u2013 Australia\u2019s highest paid executive who took home nearly AUD$24m (about \u00a312m) in 2018 \u2013 will take no salary this financial year. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, is due to reveal some of his government\u2019s plan to protect the economy from a recession caused by the coronavirus. The stimulus package, likely to include cash payments for pensioners, welfare recipients and small business owners, could cost up to $10bn (AUD). Morrison will argue that, while the covid-19 is a global health crisis, it will have real and significant economic impacts for Australia, potentially greater than the global financial crisis of 2008. According to preview reports of his speech, he\u2019s due to say: The epicentre of the crisis is much closer to home. The [global financial crisis] impacts were centred on the North Atlantic and back then China was in a position to cushion the blow. Australia\u2019s economy is hugely dependent on China. The country is the largest export destination for Australian resources and Australia relies heavily on imports of Chinese manufactured products. Additionally, Australia is a significant destination for Chinese students and tourists. Morrison will argue: We now have one goal in 2020: To protect the health, wellbeing and livelihoods of Australians through this global crisis, and to ensure that when the recovery comes, and it will, we are well positioned to bounce back strongly on the other side. Saudi Arabia has detected five new cases, Reuters is reporting; citing state TV. Four Saudi citizens have been diagnosed \u2013 three of whom had arrived from Iran and Iraq. The fifth case is of an Egyptian man who arrived from Egypt to the kingdom, the ministry has added. They bring the total of coronavirus cases detected in the kingdom to 20. Burkina Faso has reported its first two cases of coronavirus, making it the sixth nation in sub-Saharan Africa to be affected by the virus. Its health minister, Claudine Lougue, has told reporters the two patients \u2013 a husband and wife \u2013 recently returned to Burkina Faso from a trip to France and are now in isolation. Egypt has placed a nationwide suspension on \u201cany large gatherings of citizens, or those that involve the movement of citizens between governorates,\u201d its prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, has announced. The Egyptian ministry of culture separately cancelled any upcoming events taking place, including a film festival in Luxor, the site of a major outbreak of covid-19. Egypt\u2019s ministry of health has also said 59 people have so far been infected with the virus. The US and UK stock markets have both suffered their worst daily slump since the 2008 financial crisis. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has plunged by more than 2,000 points, closing down 7.8% tonight. Earlier, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 posted its fifth biggest fall ever. The index closed down 7.7%, which wiped \u00a3125bn off the biggest companies listed in London. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB index slumped by 11% (and was closed before PM Conte announced the country\u2019s new lockdown). Our business liveblog has more details. The announcement in Italy spells out the restriction of movement of more than 60 million people. The decree provides for banning all public events, closing cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs, funerals, weddings and all sport events, including Serie A matches. All schools and universities will remain close until 3 April Conte added that he will sign the decree now and it will come into effect on Tuesday morning. All sporting events will be suspended, Conte has told a press conference. The country is grappling to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of covid-19, which has claimed 463 lives and infected a total of 9,172 people. All of Italy will be placed under the lockdown conditions thus far imposed upon the so-called \u201cred zone\u201d in the north of the country, the Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte has said. The restrictions will include banning all public gatherings and preventing all movement other than for work and emergencies. According to the Reuters news agency, he has said the decision was necessary to protect Italy\u2019s most vulnerable citizens and that the right course of action now is for people to stay at home. A second Oxford University student has tested positive, the institution has said. Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed that a student at the University of Oxford has tested positive for coronavirus. Our priority is providing support for affected students and their families, as well as offering support and information to other university staff, students, visitors and the local community. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to two. PHE is currently assessing the individual and contacting those who had close contact with the student and will issue them with health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case. PHE will also be advising the university on any necessary next steps. We reported earlier that the Madrid regional government has ordered the closure of all schools and universities for a fortnight. Madrid has a population of 6.6 million and the school shutdown is expected to have a direct impact on 1.5 million people. The president of the Madrid regional government, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, said she was sorry to have to inform people of the new measures that will come into force on Wednesday but insisted they were necessary given the spread of the disease. These decisions haven\u2019t been easy to take, but we know that public health must come before everything else. D\u00edaz Ayuso also urged anyone showing symptoms of the virus to remain at home and not to go to work or to medical centres. People should instead call the coronavirus hotline, she added. Moreover, the regional government warned against all but essential travel and encouraged older people or those with chronic illnesses to remain at home. Salvador Illa, the Spanish health minister, also advised people to work from home. Data indicate a turn for the worse in Spain. Yesterday, there was a significant increase in the number of cases, especially in the Madrid area. In Catalonia, where 101 cases have so far been reported, the regional government also urged people to work from home and to avoid travel. A nursery school in Barcelona was closed today as a result of the virus but as yet the Catalan government is not proposing to shut down schools. The Photography Show and the Video Show, which organisers claim attracts more than 30,000 visitors and which was due to start in Birmingham this weekend, has been postponed amid coronavirus concerns. Organisers have said: To date, the Photography Show and the Video Show has been following government guidelines regarding the continuation of our event surrounding the outbreak of coronavirus. However, as the news has been progressing we have listened to the concerns, from all parties, around the health and welfare of their staff. The wellbeing of our visitors, exhibitors and staff is of the utmost importance, we have therefore taken the extremely difficult decision to postpone the Photography Show and the Video Show until later in the year, when we will be able to deliver the show you deserve. We are now working through the ramifications of this unprecedented situation. Iraqi authorities have ordered the closure of the Najaf province, home to holy Muslim Shi\u2019ites sites, for non-residents starting on Wednesday for a week to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the state news agency has said. Najaf is a major destination for Shi\u2019ite pilgrims. A taskforce bringing together unions, employers and government agencies should be convened to help tackle the outbreak, the Trades Union Congress (TUC) has said. The union body says the taskforce\u2019s main priorities would be: Designing an emergency support package to prevent businesses from folding and workers losing jobs and pay. Ensuring public services are kept running and public sector workers are protected from the virus. Fixing the UK\u2019s sick pay rules so that every worker has financial support regardless of how much they earn. The TUC\u2019s general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, has said: Getting unions, employers and government agencies around the table will help contain the damage to the public health and our economy. Ministers must do all they can to protect public services, workers and businesses. Taiwan\u2019s Centre Epidemic Command Center has disclosed information about a Taiwanese woman who showed symptoms upon her return to Taiwan; countering multiple Egyptian government statements that she was the source of the virus in their country. Instead, they said, the woman contracted the virus during her visit to Egypt. The woman returned to Taiwan in late February after taking a Nile cruise in the southern city of Luxor. 12 staff members on the same boat later tested positive for the virus, along with 33 passengers who arrived for a later cruise on the same ship. All 45 have been quarantined at a separate site, while other passengers on board told reporters they remain quarantined onboard. Egyptian officials have repeatedly said the Taiwanese woman was the source of the virus in the country; the Arab world\u2019s most populous nation. But, according to a statement from Taiwan\u2019s Centre for Disease control, the woman known as case #39 contracted a different strain of the virus to other Taiwanese patients. The strain of virus from Case #39 belongs to the same clade of the strains of virus in Europe, Nigeria, Brazil and Italy. The study showed that Case #39 is only an index patient who was first diagnosed with covid-19 but not the source of infection. It is determined that Case #39 contracted the novel coronavirus in Egypt, and developed symptoms after returning to Taiwan and that this is an imported case. Public health officials in Canada have recorded the country\u2019s first fatality from the coronavirus outbreak, after a man in his 80s died on Monday. He had been a resident in a long-term care facility in the province of British Columbia, where a number of cases have been documented. The provincial health officer, Bonnie Henry, has told reporters: He had a number of underlying health conditions, unfortunately, so (he was) in that risk group for people who were more likely to have severe disease. Two care workers at the Lynn Valley care centre in North Vancouver and two residents have also tested positive for the virus. The announcement comes two days after Henry, a veteran doctor who has worked on the frontlines of viral outbreaks including Sars, Ebola, H1N1 and polio, grew emotional during a daily briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult time,\u201d she told reporters, fighting back tears. \u201cI\u2019m feeling for the families and the people that are dealing with this right now.\u201d Canada has detected at least 74 cases \u2013 a number health officials believe will increase in the coming days. On Monday, Reuters reported that millions of safety masks in Ontario, stockpiled after the country\u2019s Sars outbreak, have expired. The news calls into question preparedness in British Columbia, which said it had a sufficient supply medical necessities to handle a spike in cases. This post was amended on 11 March 2020 to remove an incorrect reference to British Columbia as Canada\u2019s \u201cmost populous province\u201d. The Grand Princess cruise ship has arrived at a temporary berth in the Port of Oakland to the cheers of its weary passengers, the Reuters news agency reports. The 2,400 holidaymakers, who have been largely confined to their rooms since Thursday, are to begin disembarking on Monday for transport to either healthcare facilities or quarantine stations, depending on whether they need immediate medical attention. As we reported earlier, the UK government has set in motion plans to repatriate British passengers. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has cancelled his speech in the city of Mashhad for Persian new year on 20 March, to prevent further infections of coronavirus, according to his official site. The statement reads: The ceremony for the speech of the supreme leader of the Islamic revolution, which happens every year on the first day of the new year in (Imam Reza\u2019s holy shrine) will not take place this year and the supreme leader will not travel to holy Mashhad. It adds that the decision was based on the recommendation of health officials to minimise travel and attending gatherings to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Iran\u2019s health ministry has announced a total of 7,161 infections and 237 deaths from the virus, one of the highest death rates outside of China. The Madrid regional government has ordered the closure of all schools and universities for a fortnight in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Spain\u2019s total confirmed cases as of 6pm CET is 1,204; 577 of which are in Madrid. The country\u2019s death toll at 28 people \u2013 13 of them in the Madrid region. The decision was apparently taken during an emergency meeting on Monday afternoon and the closure will begin on Wednesday. Earlier on Monday, authorities in the Basque country also announced the closure of educational centres around the regional capital, Vitoria, where the second-worst cluster has been identified. *This post has been amended to correct the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths AFP also reports that Riester\u2019s feeling in good shape: The French culture minister, Franck Riester, has tested positive for the virus, his staff have told the Agence France-Presse news agency. They said he had spent a few days at the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale \u2013 the lower house of the French parliament \u2013 last week, where \u201cseveral cases have been confirmed\u201d. Here is a round-up of some of the day\u2019s main coronavirus developments: The number of deaths in the UK rose to five and the latest figures showed 319 people have tested positive for Covid-19. The country remains in the \u201ccontain\u201d phase of the outbreak and the government said it was preparing to move to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of the action plan. It is accepted that the outbreak will be \u201csignificant\u201d. Global stock markets had their biggest fall since the 2008 financial crash, while the oil price tanked amid panic selling over fears of a coronavirus-driven global recession and an oil price war. The FTSE 100 plunged almost 9% and slipped below 6,000 points when trading began this morning. Within a fortnight the UK government will advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to self-isolate for seven days. From tomorrow screening will begin of everyone arriving at hospital with a respiratory illness. Boris Johnson has urged people to not panic buy, to \u201cbehave responsibly\u201d and think of others. More than 100 Britons stuck on the coronavirus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California are planned to be flown home tomorrow, US authorities have said. Romania has announced that all schools and kindergartens will be closed from 11-22 March, with the option of extending the period further. \u201cOur concern is to prevent children from any risk of contamination that may arise during courses organised at school,\u201d the prime minister, Ludovic Orban, said on Monday evening. Companies and institutions will be required to allow employees to work from home, where possible. There have been 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country, of which five people have been discharged from hospital. There have been no fatalities related to the virus. Romania has suspended all flights to and from Italy until at least 23 March. There is a large Romanian community in the country. The Grand Princess cruise ship is expected to dock in Oakland at about noon PST. The vessel\u2019s 3,500 passengers, 21 of whom have tested positive for Covid-19, are to remain under 14-day quarantine. More on this story from our west coast reporters: While coronavirus deaths increase day after day in Italy, good news has emerged from the hospital in Pavia where Mattia, the Italian patient 1, has been treated since 21 February, is breathing autonomously and has been discharged from intensive care. A medical taskforce worked for weeks, day and night, to keep him alive. The man, 38, was the first Italian patient infected with the virus. To many, his recovery has inspired optimism that the battle against Covid-19 can be won. According to the patient\u2019s wife, Mattia had met an Italian friend, a manager in Castiglione D\u2019Adda who had returned from Wuhan, China, on 21 January. After some research, the manager, suspected of being patient zero, was tracked down but, incredibly, he tested negative for coronavirus. After analysis, the suspect seems not to have had any recent infections. Antibodies are a sort of register that collects, in molecular form, traces of infections that our immune system is called to cope with. The search for the origin of the epidemic in the country seems to be an impossible mission. The Irish government has allocated \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) to deal with coronavirus in anticipation of a surge in cases. The package includes \u20ac435m for the Health Service Executive, which runs hospitals, and a promise of \u20ac305 per week in sick pay for those affected by the virus, starting from their first day of illness. The self-employed will be eligible for payments. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announced the measures at a sombre press conference in Dublin. \u201cIt is possible we are facing events that are unprecedented in modern times,\u201d he said. Earlier, the government announced it was cancelling all St Patrick\u2019s day parades, dealing a heavy blow to pubs, hotels and other sectors that rely on a boost in sales in mid-March. Ministers are curbing St Patrick\u2019s-themed visits to New York and Washington \u2013 the highlight of the Irish-American political calendar \u2013 but Varadkar is still due to meet Donald Trump at the White House. The taoiseach said responses to coronavirus would be determined by medical advice and not be made \u201con foot of pressure\u201d from business, politics, the media or social media. US authorities are planning a flight tomorrow to repatriate Britons on the coronavirus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship. The UK Foreign Office issued the following statement: We continue to work closely with the US authorities to repatriate British nationals on board the Grand Princess. The US are currently planning for a flight to leave tomorrow evening, returning to the UK on Wednesday afternoon. We remain in contact with all British nationals on board and will continue to offer support. Chinese authorities reportedly scrambled to move people out of quarantine hotels which need safety inspections after the deaths of at least 10 people in a collapsed hotel. Laura (not her real name), a British teacher and her partner were suddenly placed in enforced isolation in Shenzhen after a ferry trip about 10 days ago. On Thursday, she told the Guardian she endured a \u201cterrifying\u201d experience as five people in hazmat suits came to test them at her home before they were whisked to quarantine. But their period in isolation has taken a new twist after a transfer to another hotel. \u201cWe were sitting on the bed and noticed orange speccy marks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe soon realised it was bed bugs and we were moved into the room next door. But the moment we came into the second room we lifted a corner of the sheet and a live bed bug ran across the sheet, then we found another one under the pillow.\u201d They were moved to a third room, but also found blood marks resembling those created by bed bugs. \u201cClearly the whole hotel is infested with bed bugs,\u201d she said. The couple have four days remaining in quarantine at Yinglun hotel in Shenzhen, but they don\u2019t want to risk sleeping in the bed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sitting on the table and window sill, avoiding fabrics, asking for help because there is nothing else we can do,\u201d Laura said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know who to be most frustrated with. Everybody here is just doing their job. They can clearly see this is ridiculous but they can\u2019t offer us a solution. \u201cOur school is saying they could deliver us some pesticide or send a mattress. It\u2019s really sweet but is this what it has come to? It\u2019s a farce.\u201d At the previous hotel, she had been passing the days practising yoga, reading and watching the sitcom Parks and Recreation, but she has spent her time at the new lodgings demanding another room while taking videos of the mess and lice. The hotel has offered the couple a \u201cfinal deal\u201d to remove the pillowcases and sheet, but cannot provide another double mattress. It has threatened to separate the couple into different rooms if they do not accept. \u201cI think it\u2019s just a threat,\u201d Laura said. \u201cBe quiet or we\u2019ll separate you.\u201d Twenty-three people remain missing after the five-storey hotel in Quanzhou, about seven hours from Shenzhen in southern China, collapsed on Saturday. According to Laura, this led to an assessment of all other quarantine hotels amid fears of others falling down. \u201cOurs needed a full inspection,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d questioned whether smoke alarms were working as there were guards smoking beneath the sensors. \u201cI was also told the electricity was extremely unable, which is why we could not have a fridge in our room. The whole building is being inspected today after it was abruptly emptied.\u201d Health authorities in Guangdong province have fiercely guarded against \u201cimported cases\u201d of coronavirus, after a 35-year-old man from Shenzhen who had been working in Bristol tested positive this month after flying from Heathrow to Hong Kong. It was unclear whether he became infected in the UK, but Chinese authorities said two of the patient\u2019s colleagues in Britain had reported coughs and fever. This post was amended on 19 March 2020 to remove some personal information. Iraq has banned all public gatherings and called on citizens to avoid visiting sacred cities and sites to stop the spread of the virus. Authorities also called on Iraqis arriving from Iran, China, South Korea, Italy, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Kuwait and Bahrain to stay at home for self-quarantine for 14 days. Israel will force anyone arriving in the country, from any part of the world, to self-isolate for at least 14 days, The prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has announced. The government has so far imposed some of the most stringent rules globally to block the spread of the virus. The move has also been interpreted domestically as a measure to avoid irking the country\u2019s close ally and benefactor in Washington, Donald Trump. Israel already requires travellers arriving from more than a dozen countries to spend two weeks in home isolation, in effect killing off incoming tourism. After outbreaks in the US, pressure had been building to add the country to the list. But rather than extending the rules specifically on US travellers, and risk an angry backlash from the White House, Israel broadened its policy out to the entire planet. Netanyahu spoke to the US vice president, Mike Pence, on Sunday, after Israeli media reported the country was considering barring visitors from parts of the US, such as New York and California. Health authorities have said the number of coronavirus cases in Israel jumped from 25 to 39 over the weekend. Approximately 80,000 Israelis are in self-isolation. Here are the main points from the press conference held by Boris Johnson. He was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Ministers will within a fortnight advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to stay at home for seven days, Whitty revealed. He said the government was not issuing this advice at present, because the chances of someone with a fever now having coronavirus are very low, he said. But he said that would change very quickly. Soon the number of infections would rise \u201creally quite fast\u201d, he said. He went on: We are now very close to the time, probably within the next 10-14 days, when the modelling would imply we should move to a situation where everybody with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever should be self-isolating for a period of seven days. This advice is likely to have huge repercussions for workplaces across the country. Johnson stressed that it was important for the government not to implement its delay and mitigating measures too early. He said: It is absolutely critical in managing the spread of this virus that we take the right decisions at the right time based on the latest and the best evidence, so we mustn\u2019t do things which have no or limited medical benefit, nor things which could turn out actually to be counter-productive. He sounded more defensive on this point than he was when he held a press conference last week, reflecting the fact that the government has been accused by some of being too complacent. Johnson said he was no longer shaking hands. Last week he was shaking hands but he said at today\u2019s Commonwealth Day service he was advised against this. He explained: We were all given an instruction not to shake hands, and there\u2019s a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don\u2019t shake somebody\u2019s hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands. So there\u2019s a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands, which is, I think I\u2019m right in saying \u2026 far more important. Whitty refused to comment on suggestions that 2 million people could be admitted to hospital. He said such figures were \u201clargely speculative\u201d. Whitty said from tomorrow the government would start screening everyone arriving at hospital with a respiratory illness. Until now people were screened only if they were in intensive care and had coronavirus-type symptoms, he said. Vallance said the aim of the measures to be introduced by the government would be to lower the mortality rate of those in the at-risk group by 20 to 30%. But he said it would be wrong to try to \u201csuppress\u201d the disease completely because it could result in a winter outbreak at a time of maximum pressure for the NHS. He said: What you can\u2019t do is suppress this thing completely, and what you shouldn\u2019t do is suppress it completely because all that happens then is it pops up again later in the year, when the NHS is at a more vulnerable stage in the winter, and you end up with another problem. A fifth patient in the UK has died after testing positive for coronavirus, NHS England has confirmed. In a statement on behalf of Epsom and St Helier University hospitals NHS trust, the chief executive, Daniel Elkeles, said: We can confirm that sadly a patient in their 70s, who was very unwell with a number of significant and long-term health conditions, has passed away at St Helier hospital. They had tested positive for Covid-19. Our thoughts and condolences remain with the patient\u2019s family and loved ones at this difficult time. In the past 24 hours the number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has risen from 366 to 463, officials have announced. They said 7,985 people were infected \u2013 1,598 more than Sunday. The total number of cases is 9,172; 724 have recovered from the illness. Italy is considering extending the closure of schools until 3 April. The UK government has announced it will work with local authorities to extend the hours that deliveries can be made to supermarkets and other food retailers to help the industry respond to the coronavirus. The new measures would mean firms can increase the frequency of deliveries to their stores and move stocks more quickly from warehouses across the country to replenish their shelves. The announcement follows last week\u2019s talks between the British environment secretary, George Eustice, and leading supermarkets, during which the industry said a relaxation of curfews would help retailers respond to the increased consumer demand for some products, namely hygiene goods and a limited number of long-life items. Current rules mean deliveries are prohibited overnight so vehicles don\u2019t disturb residents. The government will temporarily relax the enforcement of restrictions to give greater flexibility. Drive-through coronavirus testing is under way in a hospital car park in Seattle, NPR reports. Employees at the University of Washington\u2019s UW Medicine Center can get checked for the virus without leaving their cars if they have symptoms. The virus has claimed 17 lives in Seattle and infected at least 83 people. In a briefing this afternoon, Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, gave the latest US coronavirus figures: As of Sunday evening, 34 states, plus New York City and DC, have reported more than 500 cases of Covid-9 to CDC. We\u2019ve also received reports of 19 deaths. Nearly half of reported cases are in California and Washington; 18 of the deaths are in Washington. The remaining one is in California. On the issue of testing, which has been held back by a production flaw in the initial version of the publicly issued kits, Messonnier said: \u201cState and local public health labs across 50 states now have the capacity to test up to 75,000 people for Covid-19.\u201d Messonnier also gave this advice for caring for the elderly and vulnerable: If you do end up in the role of helping to care for a family member or friend who is at greater risk, we recommend you familiarise yourself with your loved one\u2019s medications to help them get extra to have on hand. Help them also get food medical supplies and other necessities, so they can minimise trips to the store. And create a plan for if they do get sick, and if you get sick. You may need to identify backups, who can take care of them if you can\u2019t. Residents recount to the Guardian\u2019s Jon Henley and Lorenzo Tondo what it feels like to be in Milan, Italy\u2019s financial and economic capital, during lockdown: Erika, 30: Personally, this situation has been scary for several weeks \u2013 although many have not felt it that way, probably aggravating the situation. The city felt surrounded by a feeling of unease and fear \u2013 fear not born from the limitation of movement, but from the awareness that the intensive care units are collapsing. For the past two weeks, my husband and I have been living with the awareness that precautions must be taken. We use gloves and masks to go out, especially to go to the market or to the pharmacy. I have often regretted seeing that so few of us took these precautions, despite not having any symptoms. Just care. I believe this is the reason that should push everyone to understand that we must stay at home and respect the measures. I hope there is no need to prolong them, but that depends on citizens and their common sense. I hope the civic sense will prevail in order to be able to fight this situation to get up again. Natalie, a French woman who has lived in Milan for 30 years: It\u2019s like a ghost town. Everything\u2019s basically shut, even the malls \u2013 only the supermarkets are open. You just have to ask yourself: do you really need to go out, and for what reason. If it\u2019s to buy food, you go \u2013 but you keep your distance from everyone, as instructed. It helps that some supermarkets are allowing only small groups of shoppers to enter at a time. It feels like the month of August. Worse \u2013 empty. It\u2019s really drastic. Like being in prison. In fact, there are prison sentences, up to three months for people who don\u2019t respect the orders. I work for a big company so there\u2019s been no problem working at home, but I worry that people won\u2019t take these measures as seriously as they should. It\u2019s not a good situation, and it\u2019s going to happen elsewhere \u2026 And I worry about the Italians \u2013 I love them, I\u2019ve been here 30 years, but disobeying the rules is like a national sport. You still see people driving with kids sat in the front of their car without a seat belt, so when it comes to this lockdown \u2026 There are always idiots. The real worry is that the hospitals won\u2019t be able to cope. Ryanair has announced it will suspend all domestic flights to red zones in Italy \u2013 from and to the airports of Bergamo, Milano Malpensa, Parma e Treviso. The suspension will start from midnight until 8 April. Pregnant women do not appear to be more susceptible to the consequences of coronavirus than the general population, and there is no evidence the virus can pass to a foetus during pregnancy, according to national guidance published by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The guidance says that, as a precautionary approach, pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus when they go into labour are being advised to attend an obstetric unit but their birth plan should be followed as closely as possible. There is no evidence the virus can be carried in breast milk, so it is felt the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of coronavirus. The full guidance on Covid-19 infection and pregnancy can be found here. At the press conference Boris Johnson says he is no longer shaking hands. At his press conference last week, he said he was still shaking hands with people. When asked during his press conference about panic buying, Boris Johnson urges anyone thinking of stockpiling to \u201cbehave responsibly\u201d and think of others. Back in Geneva, Dr Michael Ryan, the executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, says the real tragedy and moral dilemma that healthcare workers will face in coming days if they do not have personal protective equipment is whether to treat a Covid-19 patient in front of them. He says: We\u2019re still very much in the up cycle of this epidemic. But he says China and South Korea have shown \u201can element of controllability\u201d, which gives him hope. His colleague Dr Maria Van Kerkhove says: In many countries it will get worse before it gets better. But she says there is an opportunity in countries which have had very few or no cases. She cites the example of Wuhan, the Chinese province at the centre of the current outbreak, and the \u201cdrastic action\u201d in Singapore that has reduced transmission. She adds: We can see light at the end of the tunnel but how quickly we get there will depend on what countries do. At the press conference in Downing Street, Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has been speaking. He says soon coronavirus will spread \u201creally quite fast\u201d. Within about 10 to 14 days the government will advise people with even minor respiratory tract infections or a fever to self-isolate, he says. But that is because by that point the chances of their having coronavirus will be much higher than they are now. At the press conference in London, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, says it is important to introduce measures to delay the spread of coronavirus \u201cat the right time in the right combinations\u201d. Boris Johnson has just started giving a press conference in London about coronavirus. Earlier today he chaired a meeting of Cobra, the UK government\u2019s emergency committee to discuss the outbreak. Johnson says the UK is still \u201cin the contain phase of the outbreak\u201d. But he says scientists believe \u201ccontainment is extremely unlikely to work on its own\u201d. He says the government is now preparing to move to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of the action plan. There is further coverage of the press conference here, on Andrew Sparrow\u2019s UK politics live blog. More than 58,600 people have recovered in China, says Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, technical lead of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme. She estimates that more than 80% globally will recover. In China, 80% of cases have been mild or moderate. Mild can include a mild form or pneumonia, says Van Kerkhove. Diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease are among the risk factors for death. Van Kerkhove says mortality in people aged over 80 with coronavirus, according to Chinese data, is 20%. However, the figure is not based on the latest statistics, she says. Asked about use/or lack of of the word \u201cpandemic\u201d, Dr Michael Ryan, from the WHO, says countries such as Singapore and China have \u201cdemonstrated real success in turning the disease around\u201d. Tedros adds: Whether it\u2019s a pandemic or not, the rule of the game is the same: never give up. Ryan says a number of countries have imposed restrictions on the import of personal protective equipment. He describes such \u201choarding\u201d, preventing material reaching those who need it, as something the WHO would like to avoid. Our most exposed workers to this virus at the moment are frontline healthcare workers. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove says transmission in health facilities has not been a significant driver of the spread of the virus. Ryan adds: It\u2019s difficult to build a global picture in real time when you\u2019re not receiving real-time data from everyone. Tedros says only a handful of countries have signs of sustained community transmission. We must all take heart from that. Of the four countries with the most cases, China is bringing its outbreak under control and there is also a decline in new cases in South Korea. The rule of the game is never give up. Tedros praises Italy\u2019s aggressive measures: Let hope be the antidote to fear. Let solidarity be the antidote to blame. The World Health Organization is currently giving a press conference (you can watch the live feed at the top of this page). Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general, says the world \u201cis not at the mercy\u201d of the virus. He says with decisive, early action the spread of the virus can be slowed. Most people with the virus will recover, he says, pointing to China where he says 70% have recovered. Tedros also highlights that 93% of cases are from four countries. Closing schools and cancelling mass gatherings in countries can be considered in countries where the virus is rife, he says. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s response to the urgent question on coronavirus in the House of Commons just now: Hancock said there had now been four deaths from coronavirus in the UK. The fourth fatality has only just been announced. He said as of this morning there had been 319 cases in the UK. The UK would \u201cmake the right choices of which action to pursue at the right moment\u201d, he said. It would be a mistake to act too early, he said, adding: The scientific advice is clear: acting too early creates its own risk. So we will do what is right to keep people safe. Guided by the science, we will act at the right time. He said the number of cases in China and South Korea was still rising, but at a slowing rate. But he said the number of cases in Iran, Italy, Switzerland, France and Germany was growing. In Italy there were 1,492 more cases overnight, and 102 more deaths. Public Health England had tested nearly 25,000, and the time taken to carry out tests was being reduced, he said. He said the government was making available an extra \u00a346m to find a vaccine and develop more rapid diagnostic tests. Hancock said the NHS was \u201cwell prepared\u201d, with record numbers of doctors and nurses. An extra 700 people had been taken on to help the 111 phone line take calls, he said. Responding to coronavirus was a \u201cnational effort\u201d and everyone would have to play their part, Hancock said. For members of the public, that meant washing hands and following public health advice. But it could also mean volunteering, he said. He said the government would soon bring forward emergency legislation to help people and services deal with the outbreak. The bill would be \u201ctemporary and proportionate\u201d, he said. The government was taking action to help Britons on the Grand Princess cruise ship, off the coast of California, to come home. You can see Hancock\u2019s statement in full on our UK politics live blog. More than 111,600 people have been infected by coronavirus across the world, and 3,884 have died, according to the latest Reuters tally. Here is our video explainer featuring the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, on what we can do to protect ourselves. Madonna has cancelled shows in Paris on Tuesday and Wednesday due to restrictions imposed over the coronavirus outbreak, the promoter Live Nation has told Reuters. On Sunday France banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people as the death toll and number of coronavirus infections continued to rise. The Guardian\u2019s film editor, Catherine Shoard, reports that the organisers of the Cannes film festival continue to plan for the event to go ahead, despite France\u2019s ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people. Germany has reported its first two confirmed coronavirus deaths. A spokesman for the health ministry in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia said an 89 year-old woman had died in the town of Essen and another patient had died in the highly affected region of Heinsberg. The authorities in Heinsberg are due to hold a press conference at 6.30pm local time, at which they are expected to give more details. A 60-year-old who died in Egypt at the weekend was the first German citizen to die of the virus. The Irish government has decided to cancel the St Patrick\u2019s Day parade in Dublin, after advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team, according to the Press Association news agency. Another patient in the UK has died after contracting the coronavirus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has confirmed. A Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust spokesperson said: The trust can confirm that a patient in their 70s being treated for underlying health conditions has died. The patient had tested positive for Covid-19. The family has been informed and our condolences and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. We will not be commenting further and ask that everybody respects the family\u2019s privacy. You can read Hancock\u2019s statement in full on our UK politics live blog. The head of the port authority of New York and New Jersey has tested positive for coronavirus, the governor of New York has announced. Andrew Cuomo posted this thread on the most recent confirmed cases in New York state: Following an emergency meeting of the party leaders, the European parliament will sit for only one day this week, on Tuesday, and there will not be any votes as the chamber does not have the facility for its members to vote remotely. In the UK, the commissions of the House of Commons and the House of Lords have confirmed there are no plans to suspend parliament because of coronavirus. A joint statement said: \u201cThe commissions of both houses met today to discuss parliament\u2019s response to coronavirus. \u201cThere are no plans to suspend parliament. \u201cWe continue to act entirely in line with the advice of Public Health England, and the speakers and political leadership of both houses are keeping the situation under constant review.\u201d A priest in the Washington DC area has tested positive for coronavirus, according to local media. Worshippers who visited Christ church Georgetown last week have been instructed to self-isolate and the church has suspended all activities. In Brussels, the first case of coronavirus has been diagnosed among staff at the European commission. The woman had returned from Italy and has been in quarantine since last week. She is the third official or diplomat working within the EU\u2019s institutions in the city to be diagnosed. In Germany, where 1,153 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed by 2pm local time, the health minister, Jens Spahn, has appealed to citizens to travel as little as they can, to work from home when possible, and to contact doctors by telephone in cases where the virus is suspected. In a press conference held this afternoon with a leading virologist from Charit\u00e9 University teaching hospital in Berlin, as well as the director of the Robert Koch Institute, the leading body on public health, Spahn advised people to avoid public transport and to \u201cgo by bike or foot\u201d where possible, adding that the main goal was to slow the spread of the virus to avoid overburdening the health service, which has a total of 28,000 emergency beds. \u201cThe longer we can slow down the development of the virus, the better,\u201d he said, adding that the restrictions people would face to their daily lives \u201cwill last for months rather than weeks\u201d. He urged people to act just as they would if they wanted to avoid catching the flu or a cold. \u201cEvery individual should weigh up and decide what it is easier to avoid, and what is harder,\u201d he said, adding that going to work was more important than going to a football match. He said he was not in favour of shutting schools and kindergartens, because that would leave tens of thousands of medical staff unable to go to work, which would have a hugely detrimental effect on the health system. He said organisers of large events had so far been too hesitant to cancel them. Yesterday he followed France\u2019s example, by recommending the cancellation of all gatherings of 1,000 people or more, although because of Germany\u2019s federal system he could not enforce the recommendation, but could only hope that regional authorities would implement it. There are plans in place for Bundesliga games to take place in empty stadiums, so-called ghost matches. All St Patrick\u2019s Day parades in Ireland are expected to be cancelled in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, the Irish Times is reporting. Cork was the first Irish city to cancel its parade, with Dublin and others to follow. \u201cBased on the demographic of those attending the parade, the close proximity of people attending the event and the duration of the event (among other considerations), Cork city council is not in a position to provide the necessary assurances in relation to current WHO guidelines,\u201d the council said. The government was expected to make a similar announcement later on Monday after the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, chaired a cabinet subcommittee on coronavirus. Pressure had grown on the government to cancel the event, which draws 500,000 spectators and participants, after local authorities axed dozens of smaller parades around the country. Ireland has recorded 21 cases of coronavirus, including at least three involving community transmission. Authorities said over the weekend they could not dispute a report that 1.9 million people could become infected. Here is an update on the situation in Luxor. Egypt\u2019s ministry of tourism and state information service has announced that tour sites remain open in Luxor, despite an earlier statement from the national Tour Guide Association that trips would be cancelled today owing to concerns about coronavirus. \u201cTourist activities are proceeding normally in Luxor today,\u201d said the Ministry of Antiquities. \u201cThousands of visitors have flocked onto its different archaeological sites.\u201d The Tour Guide Association said this morning that hot air balloon rides, organised visits to archeological sites and other gatherings would be cancelled today. A tour guide in the area told the Guardian several tourists had been quarantined in their hotel rooms and on cruise ships, as they awaited a visit by officials to screen them for Covid-19, after 45 passengers and crew on a cruise ship tested positive for the virus and were quarantined last week. But some tourists arriving in Luxor today were not subject to the same measures, and moved freely around the ancient city. \u201cWe reached Luxor in the morning and were supposed to get to the cruise [ship] by 10am,\u201d said Ananya Bhattacharya, who arrived in Egypt for a holiday on 7 March and took a train to Luxor, arriving this morning. She said that her temperature was taken on arrival at Cairo airport and she was made to sign a declaration concerning the virus. Bhattacharya arrived in Luxor as Egyptian officials tried to contain the virus, while attempting to prevent damage to its tourism industry, which accounts for about 12% of GDP. \u201cWe visited Karnak and Luxor temples \u2013 both were open when we went,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were then told we\u2019d have to wait around until our cruise received an all-clear from health officials, who were inspecting it for signs of coronavirus.\u201d She added that they were finally able to board the ship at 3.30pm local time. An Indian passenger on the Asara nile cruise in Luxor, where 45 passengers and crew were quarantined after testing positive for the virus, told the Bangalore-based site the News Minute that many remained quarantined on the ship. This followed an onboard announcement on 6 March \u2013 hours before passengers were expecting to disembark \u2013 that they would be quarantined on board for 15 days, the passenger, Vanitha Rengaraj, said. \u201cWe have been asked to stay inside our rooms and not venture outside. There is a doctor on the ship all the time, and a few nurses. \u201cThey [officials] have also briefed us on what to do if we have symptoms like vomiting, fever etc,\u201d Rengaraj said. Manchester airport\u2019s Terminal 3 seems a lot quieter than usual. It was home to Flybe, which collapsed last week, so that is perhaps one of the reasons why. There are posters instructing people to self-isolate if they have flown in from certain parts of Italy. Terminal 3 also seems to be where most of the inbound and outbound Italian flights are. Seana Corr, from Wirral, travels to Milan quite often for work. Describing her flight from Milan today, the 27-year-old said it was one of the easiest she had experienced because there were only about five people onboard, so passengers got through security quickly. There did not seem to be any special checks or precautions, she said. \u201cInformation-wise, they told us to wash our hands frequently, which we should all be doing anyway, and there were signs everywhere. They gave us the standard information.\u201d Corr said in Milan it seemed like \u201ceverything has been cancelled\u201d, adding: \u201cThere are no social gatherings anymore. It\u2019s all closed down. \u201cThe area is supposed to be in lockdown. whether they\u2019re enforcing it or not right away is another matter. The streets are empty, people are out of work, the shops are empty because people have started stockpiling. Bars and restaurants are closed. There are no guards on the streets. Children are playing out in the streets, however, because they are not in school.\u201d Corr decided to find the earliest UK-bound flight available because she was afraid of being trapped in Milan. \u201cI was worried I wouldn\u2019t be able to get back, so I went online and panic-booked. Same-day flights were very expensive.\u201d A lot of people were feeling the area was like a \u201cpost-apocalyptic war zone\u201d, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really not. It\u2019s just quite boring because there\u2019s nothing on. It\u2019s not as exciting as everyone\u2019s making out. It was the right decision to leave.\u201d A total of 23 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland, up from 18 on Sunday, as the first minister warned of a \u201csignificant outbreak\u201d across the UK. Nicola Sturgeon told a press briefing on Monday afternoon that none of the Scottish patients were significantly unwell, and that Scotland may be a few days \u201cbehind the current\u201d, compared with some parts of the UK. \u201cThere is an increasing inevitability that we will face a significant outbreak of coronavirus across the UK,\u201d she said. She said Scotland, like the rest of the UK, was still in the containment phase of the outbreak. Measures to delay the spread of the virus \u2013 the next stage of the UK\u2019s response to the outbreak \u2013 would be \u201cabout mitigating the impact of the outbreak of the coronavirus, not eradicating it\u201d, Sturgeon said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s important to say, so there is clarity. Even with all these measures we are, in all likelihood, facing over the next number of weeks a very challenging situation.\u201d When asked whether Scotland\u2019s rurality would protect it from a large outbreak, Sturgeon said: \u201cI would expect to see an increase of cases \u2026 I would not want to assume our rurality would protect us in any way from this virus. I think we would be affected broadly in the same way as the rest of the UK.\u201d Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t read anything into the small numbers at the moment being reassuring. This is what happened in England at the beginning of the outbreak.\u201d A maintenance worker at Disneyland Paris has tested positive for coronavirus, but the theme park remains open in line with current official guidance about public gatherings, Press Association has reported. A spokesman said: \u201cWe have been notified that a cast member, who works backstage and does not have contact with guests, has tested positive and is receiving treatment. \u201cWe have been in regular contact with the local health authorities and continue to implement preventive measures in line with their recommendations to help protect our guests and cast members.\u201d On Friday, as French health authorities reported 577 confirmed cases of the virus including nine deaths, President Emmanuel Macron said the country was likely move to the highest level of epidemic alert in the coming days. A total of 319 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, up from 273 on Sunday, the Department of Health has said. A total of 24,960 people have been tested with 24,641 negative results. Three patients have died after testing positive for the illness. Our Brussels bureau chief, Daniel Boffey, reports that the EU\u2019s heads of state and government will hold a video conference on Tuesday to discuss the implications of coronavirus. The leaders will discuss sanitary, scientific and economic cooperation. The president of the European council, Charles Michel, tweeted: \u201cFollowing consultations, I will hold a EUCO members conference call shortly on Covid-19 to coordinate EU efforts. We need to cooperate in order to protect the health of our citizens.\u201d Over in New York, stock market trading was briefly suspended after coronavirus fears triggered a wave of selling. The S&amp;P 500 index plunged by 7% at the Wall Street open, which triggered automatic circuit-breakers to let investors catch their breath. Energy stocks and banks were particularly badly hit, as global markets suffered their worst day since the 2008 crisis. Head to our business live blog for more details. With cases of coronavirus jumping from 45 to 73 in less than 48 hours in Greece, health authorities have announced further precautionary measures to be enforced with immediate effect. The measures, which include a two-week ban on sporting events, came as Greece\u2019s Olympic Committee announced that for the first time since 1984 this week\u2019s flame-lighting ceremony for the Tokyo 2020 games will be held without spectators. The event, which usually takes place in front of an audience of thousands, is unlikely to be seen by more than a hundred people when it gets under way in ancient Olympia on Thursday, organisers say. The prefecture of Ileia in the west of Greece, to which Olympia belongs, is one of the regions hardest hit by the outbreak, although there were signs today of more cases in Athens, with media reporting that personnel at the Israeli embassy had also tested positive for the virus. A 40-year-old woman, who had visited Israel on a tour of the Holy sites, is in isolation in a hospital in Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos, also suspected of having contracted the virus. Although an official announcement is expected later today, doctors say the case has all but been confirmed and the woman\u2019s two children have been withdrawn from school at their mother\u2019s request. The case has raised fears of an outbreak on the island, which is hosting 27,000 migrants and refugees \u2013 with most housed in notoriously unhygienic conditions in Moria, its biggest camp. The woman, who works in a supermarket in Plomari, had by her own admission been in contact with countless people upon her return from the trip. A coronavirus outbreak on the island would seriously test its overstretched medical services. A body representing thousands of hospital doctors has postponed its annual conference so they can help the NHS\u2019s efforts to tackle the virus, amid fears that services could become overwhelmed. The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) announced it was putting off its Medicine 2020 gathering from April to next January \u201cso that doctors can concentrate on looking after patients with Covid-19 and avoid putting themselves at any increased risk from the virus. [The] move \u2026 signals the RCP\u2019s concern to protect the NHS frontline workforce as best it can\u201d. About 1,000 health professionals were due to attend the event at the ICC in Birmingham city centre. The college represents about 28,000 hospital doctors in England, though has some members elsewhere too. Prof Andrew Goddard, the RCP\u2019s president, said: Our aim is always to protect people\u2019s health, and it simply wouldn\u2019t be sensible to bring together hundreds of doctors from all over the UK, \u2013 and other countries too \u2013 when they are already stretched dealing with Covid-19 on top of all the other pressures on the NHS. We shouldn\u2019t put doctors at unnecessary risk of contracting or spreading the virus, so it is a wise precaution to postpone Medicine 2020. Now, as always, I want to protect the wellbeing of the NHS workforce. The RCP is the latest medical body to postpone a large gathering. Last week the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&amp;E doctors across the UK, cancelled its spring CPD conference. Here is a summary of today\u2019s lobby briefing, as reported by our political correspondents Andrew Sparrow and Rowena Mason. It was not a full briefing on Cobra as the meeting was ongoing, but here are the latest updates. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The UK is still in the contain phase, but it is accepted that the disease will spread at speed \u2013 and the outbreak will be \u201csignificant\u201d. Any steps to delay the disease have to be introduced at the optimum time. The Cobra meeting this morning discussed what measures could be brought in when it worsens. The government will be led by the evidence and scientific advice. If there is further guidance, it will be issued. At the moment the advice is for people to wash their hands thoroughly. Elderly people who are worried and already staying at home do not need to \u2013 the general advice applies to carry on business as usual and wash hands. The government has been issuing guidance to people returning from specific areas. Temperature checks on arrival are not effective and the government has an evidence-based clinical approach to this. The number of cases in the UK is increasing, there have been the first fatalities and it is clear that transmission is taking place in-country, not just from travellers. There are no plans to stop flights to the UK from quarantined areas of Italy. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) will be speaking to supermarkets about what measures can be taken to ensure supplies to shops. Defra will look at help for vulnerable and isolated groups at 4pm today but it is understood it will look closely at lifting restrictions on times when vans can deliver to homes. The Bank of England has said it will take all steps necessary to protect the economy. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport held a meeting with a range of sporting bodies this morning \u2013 events are not being cancelled at this point. The prime minister has said there is no need for panic buying. Whether local elections will be delayed is a matter for the Electoral Commission to advise on. The Foreign Office continues to work with US authorities on what can be done to bring home the 142 Britons on the Grand Princess cruise ship. A Sage meeting is expected tomorrow, along with a further Cobra meeting on Wednesday. You can follow Andy\u2019s coverage on our politics live blog, here. As the number of coronavirus cases in Italy soars, Italians seem to be following the official instructions to keep at least one metre apart in public spaces. So reports the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Milan correspondent: More details have been released about the six inmates who died while protesting against virus containment measures at a northern Italian prison. The deaths occurred after prisoners broke into the infirmary and took overdoses, Associated Press reports. The protest in Modena was among the first of more than two dozen riots at Italy\u2019s overcrowded prisons. Human rights advocates have been warning that increasing tensions over coronavirus were hitting inmates particularly hard, especially after restrictions were imposed on family visits to prevent transmissions. On Monday, inmates climbed on to the roof of the San Vittore prison in Milan and held up a painted sheet reading Indulto, Italian for \u201cpardon\u201d. The secretary general of the penitentiary police union accused the government of abandoning the prison system, refusing to provide sufficient measures to prevent the spread of the virus and leaving guards on their own to deal with prisoners who could now only speak to relatives via phone or Skype. He said there were more than two dozen prisons where protests were under way, including in Foggia where some inmates had escaped. Italy\u2019s overburdened court system has ground to a near halt because of virus containment measures. This has heightened tensions among prisoners, many of whom are already enduring long delays in justice. The Guardian has produced an interactive photo gallery that shows tourist sites in Asia before and after the coronavirus crisis. The World Tourism Organization has said the number of international arrivals is expected to drop sharply this year, reversing a previous forecast of a substantial increase. Arrivals are now projected to fall by 1-3%, instead of the previous estimate of 3-4% growth, with losses of $30-$50bn (\u00a323bn-\u00a338bn) in international tourism receipts anticipated. A member of staff at Transport for London has tested positive for coronavirus. A spokeswoman said: We are working closely with Public Health England and are following their advice after a member of staff tested positive for Covid-19. The safety of our staff and customers is our top priority, so we are taking all necessary precautions and a deep clean has taken place within the building used by the staff member. The party leaders of the European parliament are to hold an emergency meeting this afternoon on whether to cancel this week\u2019s session in light of the growing incidents of coronavirus infection in Brussels, reports the Guardian\u2019s Daniel Boffey. There were 39 new recorded cases of infection confirmed in Belgium on Monday, including a handful of cases among staff working within the EU\u2019s institutions. The tour guides association in Luxor, southern Egypt, has told its members that trips have been cancelled for the day, including big archeological sites, hot air balloon rides and a film festival. According to one guide, who spoke to the journalist Ruth Michaelson, the lockdown is being enforced by local police, with tourists shut in their cabins on cruise ships or inside hotel rooms. \u201cThe tourists are OK, they\u2019re happy to be checked,\u201d said the guide, who could not be named as they were not permitted to talk to the media. Officials from Egypt\u2019s health ministry are travelling to Luxor today to screen tourists for Covid-19 amid indications of a large outbreak. The city welcomed extra visitors this week for the film festival, which suspended some events due to the outbreak. The health ministry said overnight that 55 people were now infected with Covid-19 nationwide. Egypt, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country, reported its first death from the virus on Monday, a German tourist who was infected in Luxor and died in the resort town of Hurghada. Egypt\u2019s Ministry of Health said the tourist was transported from Luxor to Hurghada on Friday and died on Sunday in hospital. The tourist declined to be quarantined. A tally of officially reported cases indicates the German man was not included in the previous toll of those infected, despite official insistence that Egypt is being \u201ctransparent\u201d on this issue. Officials have tried to project an image of business as usual, sending the minister of tourism to inspect cruise ships after 45 passengers aboard one in Luxor tested positive for the virus. But the number of visitors developing symptoms after leaving the country in recent weeks has risen sharply. At least 25 foreign nationals have reported signs of the virus since returning home. This includes a Taiwanese national, reported to be the source of the outbreak on the Asara cruise ship in Luxor, who had symptoms after returning home in late February. Workers on the vessel contracted Covid-19 but remained on board to welcome new passengers last week, increasing the spread. Several cruise ship staff in the city have reportedly quitbecause of rising concern over the spread of the virus. The first case of Covid-19 has been confirmed on Lesbos, prompting concerns it could spread to refugee camps, reports the journalist Katy Fallon from the island. This morning, a hospital in Mytilene said the woman, who was admitted on Sunday morning, had been diagnosed with the virus. She had reportedly experienced flu-like symptoms in recent days and, according to local news reports, had returned to the area about a month ago after a trip to Israel. There are concerns about the extent to which coronavirus will have spread, because the woman, as yet unnamed, worked in a supermarket in the town of Plomari, about 14 miles away from Mytilene, the capital. The management of Covid-19 has been low on people\u2019s priorities on Lesbos, particularly in the humanitarian community, which has been focusing on staff securityafter attacks on aid workers, journalists and refugees in the past week. Given the recent unrest, the Moria refugee camp, a 15-minute drive from Mytilene, which has a population approaching 20,000, was calm this morning before the official announcement. However, camp residents, often with little else to occupy themselves, have been talking about the virus for weeks. Nearly everyone in Moria has some kind of health complaint, and most believe the poor living conditions have made them sick. Muhamad Abud, 50, originally a farmer from the outskirts of Idib province in Syria, sat smoking a cigarette at the top of the olive grove, an unofficial overspill site next to the main camp walls. He arrived with his wife four months ago. She has diabetes and her health has deteriorated drastically since she arrived, he says. \u201cShe\u2019s lost her sight a lot since being here and she coughs a lot from the dust. In Syria we had a good situation: the health services were really good, but they collapsed after the war. We came here thinking the health situation would be better but it\u2019s worse,\u201d Abud said. As a young boy from the camp walked along one of the dusty pathways, he sneezed. \u201cHey, he\u2019s got corona,\u201d his friend joked. An announcement by the island\u2019s authorities is expected this afternoon, which should detail how the virus will be treated and contained. The Irish Times is reporting that the France-Ireland rugby match, which was scheduled to conclude the Six Nations tournament in the Stade de France next Saturday, will be postponed. Six prisoners have died in Modena, Italy, after a riot erupted when inmates were informed that the new emergency decree includes restrictions on face-to-face visits with relatives. Lorenzo Tondo, the Guardian\u2019s southern Italy correspondent, reports that similar clashes also broke out in prisons in Salerno, Naples, Alessandria, Vercelli, Bari, Palermo, Foggia and Frosinone. Prisoners in several facilities set fire to mattresses, and two guards were held hostage briefly in Pavia. An investigation has been launched into the causes of the inmates\u2019 deaths. Iranian state television has confirmed 595 new coronavirus cases in the past day including 43 deaths. The new totals are now: 7,161 total infections and 237 deaths, with 2,394 confirmed recoveries. A reminder of this morning\u2019s dramatic events in the financial markets \u2013 Global stock markets have had their biggest falls since the 2008 financial crisis, while the oil price crashed amid panic selling because of the double threat of a coronavirus-driven global recession and an oil price war. Julia Kollewe reports that the FTSE 100 in London plunged almost 9% and fell through 6,000 points when trading began on Monday morning. It is currently trading 6% lower at 5,991, down 471 points. The index is on track for its worst one-day decline since 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers heralded the onset of the global financial crisis. Oil stocks are the biggest fallers, with BP and Shell down 18%, while the travel company Tui dropped 14%. The FTSE 100 is trading at levels last seen at the time of the Brexit vote. As panic selling spread across Europe, Germany\u2019s Dax tumbled 7.5%, France\u2019s Cac dropped 7.6% and Spain\u2019s Ibex lost 7%. The biggest sell-off was in Italy, the European country worst hit by Covid-19, with the FTSE Mib index down 10%. You can read all the latest updates from Graeme Wearden on our Business live blog here. The government was scheduled to hold a Cobra meeting at 11am. The Guardian\u2019s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, has this explainer of how exactly such meetings work. Cobra meetings are held in the basement of the Cabinet Office, not far underground from the Cabinet War Rooms, and represent the crown jewel of Britain\u2019s emergency planning system. Prime ministers, minsters, chief advisers and the most junior official have to hand in their mobile phones and tablets, encouraging attendees to concentrate on the topic in hand \u2013 ranging from a terrorism incident, a natural disaster or, in this case, a threatened pandemic. The acronym stands for Cabinet Office Briefing Room A, although in reality the largest meeting room is Room F, which sits 20 or so people around a coffin shaped table. Screens are mounted on the walls to show presentations and to patch in those who have to participate remotely, such as Scottish first ministers. The meetings are tightly structured to a pre-written \u201cchair\u2019s brief\u201d, which is intended to allow somebody to lead a meeting at short notice, if they are stressed, and to get quickly to key decisions. The first step is the Common Recognised Information Picture, the CRIP, an agreed statement of facts \u2013 designed to prevent needless arguments about what is going on on the ground. CRIPs are put together in advance, and may well be the product of a considerable amount of work. Boris Johnson, or whoever is chairing, then solicits advice from key figures such as the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, or the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, plus the senior ministers present. More junior officials are housed in satellite rooms in case there is a technical question that needs to be answered immediately; the idea is that there is nothing that should not be able to be clarified straight away. A good brief will warn the chair of likely points of conflict, or if there are going to be ministerial disagreements, and may even suggest ways through. But the idea is that after a relatively short period \u2013 it is not uncommon for a Cobra meeting to last just 45 minutes \u2013 it will reach the key decision point, in this case whether to formally move to the delay phase of dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. Meeting over and phones recovered, the idea is that everybody in the room will have a concise shared understanding of the problem and agree what the next steps are in tackling it. But some aspects sit ultimately with the prime minister alone: as when Tony Blair decided not to close the London Underground the day after 7/7, after what had been deemed to be a credible terrorism threat. No attack took place. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the coronavirus is a having a \u201cvast impact\u201d on Europe\u2019s economy during a press conference in Brussels to mark the first 100 days of her tenure leading the EU\u2019s executive branch. She said: The spread of the virus has a vast impact on people\u2019s lives but it also has a vast impact on our economy. We are looking into everything that we can do to help to address the impacts on the economy. In light of the epidemic, Von der Leyen criticised the EU\u2019s 27 member states for failing to agree on the next seven-year budget for the bloc. She said: \u201cIf I look at the tasks ahead of us we\u2019re running short of the flexibility to act in crises as we see them right now. I call urgently on all member states to find agreement now.\u201d More than 100 Britons stuck on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship off the coast of California will soon be allowed to leave, Press Association has reported. Passengers will disembark the Grand Princess from Monday, a process the liner\u2019s operator said would take a number of days. Britons onboard have described feeling tired and \u201cfed up\u201d, having been confined to their cabins since Thursday. See my earlier post here for background. A spokeswoman for the ship\u2019s operator, Princess Cruises, said: \u201cDisembarkation will commence in order of priority, as defined and directed by both state and local authorities. It is expected to be a multiple-day process.\u201d The government has said it is working to secure a repatriation flight for Britons stuck on a coronavirus-hit cruise ship. There are thought to be more than 140 British nationals onboard the Grand Princess, which is currently off the coast of California. 21 people onboard have tested positive for Covid-19. The ship is expected to dock in Oakland on Monday, but only passengers requiring treatment and state residents are expected to be able to disembark. The Foreign Office said it had contacted all British nationals on board the ship: We are working intensively with the US authorities on arrangements for a flight for British nationals who are currently on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California. We are in contact with all British nationals on board to offer assistance, as well as local authorities and staff on board the ship. Albania has announced measures to tackle a potential outbreak of Covid-19 after confirming its first two cases of coronavirus, reports Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. Speaking to the media this morning, the prime minister, Edi Rama, said all schools, as of today, would be closed for the next two weeks and flights to northern Italy cancelled until at least 3 April. Authorities in the country \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s poorest states \u2013 said two people, described as a father and son, had tested positive after recently returning to Albania from Italy. A short distance across the Adriatic Sea, Italy, like Greece, is home to a large community of Albanians who migrated after the collapse of communism. Calling for calm, Rama said a \u20ac3.2m fund had been set up to deal with the disease, with public health officials devising a plan of action to limit and delay the spread of the virus. Albania, which is desperate to begin accession talks with the EU, is still recovering from years of Stalinist rule with a health system that is far from robust. Rama said the government was in close consultation with the World Health Organization. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has written to the EU commission calling for an end to \u201cuse-it-or-lose-it\u201d rules, which he said could lead to some airlines running \u201cghost\u201d services to ensure they do not have their flight slots taken from them. The \u201c80:20\u201d rule \u2013 which means airlines must use 80% of their allocation \u2013 has already been eased on flights to and from Hong Kong and mainland China, and Shapps said such measures should be widened to cover other flights in and out of Europe. Dr David Nabarro, one of the World Health Organization\u2019s six special envoys on coronavirus, has said the government is likely to be considering restrictions on religious and community gatherings to help delay the spread of the disease. The PA news agency reports that he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: We need to recognise that it is advancing and the focus now needs to move to delay. In order to do that, it is really important to try and take the heat out of transmission, and that means helping people to stay further away from each other and reduce the risk they get infected. Dr Nabarro added: Very importantly, if you have symptoms that suggest you might have Covid, you absolutely must not be in contact with others. You are trying to reduce the spread. Then you look at large events. But it is not just the big events. I want to stress it is also gatherings in community halls, in religious spaces and services, and also in pubs and the like. It will be that sort of gathering that the government will look at, as well as of course the big events. The family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual national imprisoned in Iran, say she has been seen by a doctor and advised that her condition is likely to improve. They announced a week ago that they believed she had contracted coronavirus in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison, where she is serving a jail sentence for espionage, a charge she strenuously denies. The Free Nazanin campaign said in a statement on Sunday night: [A doctor] confirmed to her that her symptoms were clearly a virus and were consistent with coronavirus but he also confessed he was unable to test her with a testing kit \u2026 The doctor, however, did reassure Nazanin that since her symptoms had stabilised it was likely a positive sign that she was hopefully soon going to start to recover. Her family added that she was still not healthy and was persistently becoming sick even before the outbreak of coronavirus in Iran. Vietnam has suspended its visa-waiver programme for citizens from Denmark, Norway, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Spain, in an effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus within its borders. The Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent, Rebecca Ratcliffe, reports that the announcement follows confirmation of several new cases linked to a flight that arrived in Hanoi from London on 2 March. The country had gone 22 days without reporting any new infections before the new cluster of cases emerged. Seven British citizens are among the 14 new patients to test positive over recent days. Officials have since quarantined tens of passengers from the flight as well as their contacts. The British Foreign Office said it was in contact with authorities in Vietnam over the issue, but did not state how many British citizens were in isolation. As of Sunday, Vietnam reported that it had recorded a total of 30 infections. University Hospital Southampton has closed its surgical high dependency unit to new admissions after a staff member tested positive for coronavirus. They said in a statement: A healthcare professional who worked a single nightshift in our surgical high dependency unit on Friday 6 March has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19). They are now isolated at home. The small number of patients and staff who came into close contact with this individual have been informed and will be appropriately isolated. The surgical high dependency unit is temporarily closed to new admissions. Any patient affected by the temporary closure will be contacted directly. The former UK chancellor, George Osborne, has urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use this week\u2019s budget to introduce immediate measures to help individuals and smaller companies cope with the economic shock of the coronavirus, saying he would expect the UK to see an upsurge in cases in the coming weeks. The Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker reports that Osborne told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I\u2019m not an epidemiologist, but I can\u2019t help noticing that the UK cases are quite like the Italian cases were two weeks ago. And they\u2019ve gone and sealed off the whole of northern Italy, and an enormous city like Milan has been closed. I\u2019m not saying we will be there, but we could be there in the next two or three weeks. If I was chancellor I don\u2019t want some complicated scheme that\u2019s working in six months\u2019 time. I need to use the tools that are available to me right now. Ideas could include direct cash grants to people such as the self-employed, to \u201ccreate an incentive that if they feel ill they stay at home\u201d, and for smaller businesses with low cash reserves to be let off national insurance or other taxes for a period, Osborne said. The argument over longer-term fiscal rules could be set aide while the economy dealt with \u201ca very short, sharp shock to the system\u201d, he added. Asked if he would be nervous if he was in Sunak\u2019s shoes, Osborne added: I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be nervous. I think this is what chancellors and the Treasury are for. They are there to deal with events, and in any period of time there\u2019s going to be things thrown at you. This is exactly why we have a well-oiled democracy and a strong government. Reacting to the news of the third UK death from coronavirus, Dr Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds\u2019s Institute of Medical Research, said more such announcements were likely to be made. It is therefore critical that we do not overlook the many thousands of people in our country above retirement age, those who are living with chronic health conditions, or those with suppressed immune systems resulting from medication, infectious (eg untreated HIV) or inherited causes. In the absence of a vaccine for the short to medium term, this population would benefit tremendously from the availability of antiviral drugs. Thus, the ongoing trials of eg remdesivir in China and elsewhere are of critical importance for the short- to medium-term management of Covid-19. Going forward, the development of bespoke antivirals to combat infections such as this virus should be prioritised. The EU council, the Brussels institution that brings together diplomats and ministers from the member states for policy-making, said this morning it would hold only essential meetings due to coronavirus \u2013 and officials have suggested everyone avoid \u201chandshakes and kisses\u201d. Meanwhile, the former prime minister of Romania, Dacian Ciolo\u0219, who leads the Renew group in the European parliament, is seeking either the suspension of the chamber or a substantial reduction to its agenda. The session this week has already been moved to Brussels rather than Strasbourg because of the epidemic. Iranian state-linked media have announced that 16 people have died from alcohol poisoning in the south-western city of Ahvaz, the latest in a wave of deaths apparently driven by the mistaken belief that alcohol is a vaccine against the coronavirus. Alcohol is banned in the country but is still illegally imported or brewed at home \u2013 the latter occasionally resulting in deaths from bad batches. The head of Iran\u2019s crisis management authority, Ismail Najjar, is the latest official who has contracted the virus, which has infected 6,500 people according to Iran\u2019s official tally. Nearly 200 people have died, including at least 49 people over the weekend. The German government has decided on a raft of measures to soften the blow of the corona irus on Europe\u2019s largest economy, as the number taken ill rose to 1,112 on Monday, reports the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent, Kate Connolly. The measures include giving bridging loans to businesses and extending their tax payment deadlines as well as partially compensating employers who are forced to introduce reduced working hours to allow them to continue paying their employees\u2019 wages. In an emergency meeting that went on into the night, the Christian Democratic Union and their junior partners, the Social Democrats, who make up the grand coalition under Angela Merkel, said the measures \u2013 including a \u20ac12.4bn state investment package \u2013 were meant to ensure that Corona does not completely upend the German economy. It has already done considerable damage, with the German stock index, the DAX taking a severe hit, the nation\u2019s flagship airline, Lufthansa forced to cut its flights by half in an attempt to cope with the collapse in ticket sales, and large scale conferences and trade fairs, such as the international tourism fair, the ITB, and the Leipzig Book Fair having been cancelled. Bundesliga matches are likely to soon follow the list of cancelled events, after health minister Jens Spahn yesterday recommended that all gatherings involving 1000 people or more should be banned. The likelihood that schools and universities in the regions hardest hit \u2013 such as the western state of North Rhein Westphalia, which has 484 cases \u2013 will close in the coming days is growing, particularly if the number continues to rise. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has been speaking to BBC Breakfast before a meeting organised by his department with sporting bodies and broadcasters. Asked about holding games behind closed doors as is the case in Italy, he said: That is an option in the future but we are clear at this point there is no need for events to be cancelled. We are very cognisant of the impact the cancelling of events may have both in terms of the economic and social impact. He added: Any decision will be taken on the basis of the facts and the evidence. But we are very clear \u2013 at this stage we are still in the contain phase and that means that there is no need to cancel such events, there\u2019s no need for people not to go to sporting events, to museums and so on. The FTSE 100 leading index of shares has plunged more than 8% in early trading as investors react to the oil price war launched by Saudi Arabia overnight, which wiped 30% of the price of a barrel of oil. It is on track for its worst one-day fall since 2008. Graeme Wearden has more details on our Business live blog here. Today\u2019s Cobra meeting will be attended by senior ministers as well as the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser. In comments released before the meeting, Boris Johnson said: The number of coronavirus cases continues to rise in the UK and around the world. We are well prepared and will continue to make decisions to protect the public based on the latest scientific advice. Tackling coronavirus will require a national and international effort. I am confident the British people are ready to play their part in that. The most valuable thing people can do is wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. The government has set up a counter disinformation unit \u201cto protect and secure the UK from interference and disinformation linked to the coronavirus\u201d. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said: Defending the country from misinformation and digital interference is a top priority. As part of our ongoing work to tackle these threats we have brought together expert teams to make sure we can respond effectively should these threats be identified in relation to the spread of Covid-19. This work includes regular engagement with the social media companies, which are well placed to monitor interference and limit the spread of disinformation, and will make sure we are on the front foot to act if required. Israel is considering forcing anyone arriving in the country, from any part of the world, to self-isolate for at least 14 days, reports the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent Oliver Holmes. Its government has already imposed some of the most stringent rules globally to block the spread of the virus. The potential move has also been interpreted domestically as a measure to avoid irking the country\u2019s close ally and benefactor in Washington, Donald Trump. Israel already requires travellers arriving from more than a dozen countries to spend two weeks in home isolation, effectively killing off incoming tourism. Following outbreaks in the US, pressure has been building to add the country to the list. But rather than extending the rules specifically on US travellers, and risk an angry backlash from the White House, Israel might broaden its policy out to the entire planet. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with US Vice President Mike Pence on Sunday, after Israeli media reported the country was considering barring visitors from parts of the US, such as New York and California. The Israeli government has still not made a decision, although it could be announced in the coming hours. Health authorities have said that the number of coronavirus cases in Israel jumped from 25 to 39 over the weekend. Around 80,000 Israelis are already in self-isolation. The department of digital, culture, media and sport is to host a meeting of sports governing bodies and broadcasters to discuss holding events behind closed doors if the coronavirus outbreak worsens. The Italian government has ordered all major sporting events to be held without fans and the Italy v England Six Nations rugby match, due to be held in Rome in this weekend, has been postponed. Hello from London. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will chair an emergency Cobra meeting later today to discuss the response to the coronavirus outbreak. The meeting is expected to consider whether or not to move from the \u201dcontain\u201d phase to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of the government\u2019s four-part action plan. The \u201cdelay\u201d phase involves an acceptance that the virus has taken hold in the UK and focuses on \u201clowering the peak impact and pushing it away from the winter season\u201d. The phase could involve closing schools, banning large public gatherings and urging people to work from home. Here\u2019s a reminder of the phases of the government\u2019s plan to respond to coronavirus. Contain: detect early cases, follow up close contacts, and prevent the disease taking hold in this country for as long as is reasonably possible Delay: slow the spread in this country, if it does take hold, lowering the peak impact and pushing it away from the winter season Research: better understand the virus and the actions that will lessen its effect on the UK population; innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; use the evidence to inform the development of the most effective models of care Mitigate: provide the best care possible for people who become ill, support hospitals to maintain essential services and ensure ongoing support for people ill in the community to minimise the overall impact of the disease on society, public services and on the economy That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for now. I\u2019ll be back with you tomorrow. In the meantime, my colleague Frances Perraudin will be taking over the blog. You can find the latest summary of events here. France has banned gatherings of 1,000, as two more MPs are infected, bringing the number of French lawmakers infected with the virus to four, AFP reports. Oliver Veran confirmed the beefed-up measures on Sunday but said officials would issue a list of events considered \u201cuseful to national life\u201d that would be allowed to continue \u2013 such as demonstrations. With more than 1,100 recorded cases and 19 deaths so far, France is the second worst affected European country after its neighbour Italy, which has imposed a sweeping lockdown on the most hard-hit northern regions. The French government had already banned gatherings in confined venues of more than 5,000 people \u2013 a measure that had been set to continue until 15 April. Veran did not specify the terms of the latest, stricter ban. \u201cThis evening we are still in the \u2018second stage\u2019, meaning that our priority is to do everything to slow the spread of the virus in our national territory,\u201d he said. France is preparing to transition to its third level of alert, which would include school closures and public transport suspensions in an attempt to mitigate the consequences of an outbreak \u2013 measures that President Emmanuel Macron has said are \u201cunavoidable\u201d. A swathe of northern Italy was sealed off Monday as authorities struggled to contain the spread and impact of the deadly coronavirus. An area that is home to around a quarter of Italy\u2019s population was effectively shuttered \u2013 including the cities of Milan and Venice \u2013 mimicking a lockdown at the centre of the outbreak of the disease in China. Tens of millions of people are in virtual quarantine, but there are fears that the disease may spread further and disruptions could force several economies into recession. In Italy, police will set up controls at train stations, stopping all cars on main roads in and out, flights from Milan are suspended and there will be penalties of three months in jail or a \u20ac206 (US$233) fine for flouting the rules. The are mounting concerns that the US \u2013 the world\u2019s largest and most connected economy \u2013 could be the next Covid-19 hotspot. There are almost 110,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins. The total is currently 109,965. The total number of deaths from the virus stands at 3,824. Of the infections: 80,735 are in Mainland China 7,375 are in Italy 7,313 are in South Korea 6,566 are in Iran 1,209 are in France 1,040 are in Germany. Spain has the next highest number of cases, with 673, followed by the us with 547. Germany announces economic measures to stall \u2018corona-crisis\u2019 Germany announced measures to boost its sputtering economy in the face of the fast-spreading coronavirus on Monday, while also calling for the cancellation of large events, AFP reports. As the number of cases in Germany pushed beyond 900, Health Minister Jens Spahn said gatherings of more than 1,000 people should be scrapped. Acknowledging the financial hit to organisers of such events in Europe\u2019s biggest economy, Spahn said the government would help cushion the blow. Germany has over the last week scrapped several huge fairs, including Berlin\u2019s travel fest ITB, industrial show Hannover Messe and the Leipzig book fair. The coalition \u201cis taking action in the corona-crisis. Besides medical protection measures, we have agreed on a big aid package for the German economy,\u201d tweeted Markus Soeder, leader of Merkel\u2019s Bavarian allies CSU, calling the package \u201ccomprehensive\u201d. Rules governing compensation for workers forced to cut working hours because of the crisis will be eased, said the government in a statement after late-night talks. The relaxed criteria will apply from April and will be valid up to the end of the year. Berlin also pledged to draw up proposals on offering liquidity support for companies hardest hit by the impact of the outbreak. Talks with key representatives of the German economy as well as trade unions will be held shortly on the proposals. Separately, the government said it will also boost investments by \u20ac3.1bn per year between 2021 and 2024. The total hike in investments totalling \u20ac12.4bn will be entirely funded by 2019\u2019s budget surplus. After what has been an incredibly tense day of news, Australia\u2019s teenagers are here to offer some relief. While New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned students on Monday that Covid-19 was \u201cno joke\u201d, toilet paper panic buying remains fair game. The somewhat counterintuitive response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus has become a meme on social media, with young Australian TikTok users mocking those who are stripping supermarket shelves bare.. The #ToiletPaperEmergency or the great #ToiletPaperApocalypse, as it was dubbed on Twitter, has inspired a wave of content on TikTok, the video app popular among teenagers and younger users. One TikTok vidoe, set to the theme music used in the You Wouldn\u2019t Steal a Car anti-piracy campaign of the 2000s, received 33,000 likes and features a young man parodying the ad. Hannah Izzard reports. Down, down, down: Global markets are bracing for a crash when they open, after some Asian markets suffered their worst falls since the GFC. The FTSE100 is projected to plunge by more than 7% when trading begins on Monday morning, while the Dow Jones industrial average is on course to lose 4.9% in New York. The price of Brent crude fell almost 30%, a drop not seen since the start of the first Gulf war, in 1991. The Australian Securities Exchange closed down 7.3%, representing around AU$140bn (US$9o) in losses, in the worst day of trading for Australian shares since the 2008 GFC. Three Sydney pupils tested positive for Covid-19. Two year 10 students at St Patrick\u2019s Marist College, Dundas and a 12-year-old girl from Willoughby Girls Hugh school were the latest cases in the state. The numbers of new deaths and infections continued to fall in China. China reported 22 new deaths, the lowest new cases on record. There were 40 new cases nationwide, with most in Hubei. California is preparing to receive the Grand Princess cruise ship, on which there are 21 confirmed cases. Governor Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought Sunday to reassure the public that none of the passengers from a ship carrying people with the virus will be released into the public before undergoing a 14-day quarantine. Italy was plunged into chaos as fatalities increased more than 50% to 366 and the government plans to lockdown large parts of the country\u2019s north, or about 25% of the population, were leaked to the media. Saudi Arabia cordoned off the oil-rich, predominantly Shia region of Qatif, suspended air and sea travel to nine countries and closed schools and universities as the number of cases in the kingdom continued to increase. Organisers of the Australian Grand prix said there was \u201cno chance\u201d the race would be called off despite rising concerns about the event\u2019s large crowds facilitating the spread of the disease. The race is set to kick off the Formula One season in Melbourne on Sunday. Stock markets in Europe and the United States are braced for their biggest falls since the global financial crisis after the start of the trading week saw panic selling amid the double threat of a coronavirus-driven global recession and an oil-price war, Martin Farrer and Phillip Inman report. The FTSE100 is projected to plunge by more than 7% when trading begins on Monday morning, while the Dow Jones industrial average is on course to lose 4.9% in New York. It follows huge losses on Asian markets on Monday where fears about the worsening worldwide economic slowdown were exacerbated by the shock decision by Saudi Arabia over the weekend to increase oil production in an attempt to drive competitors such as Russia and the US out of the market. The price of Brent crude oil fell nearly 30% to $31.14 on Monday, its biggest single fall since the start of the first Gulf war in 1991. Some experts predicted that it could fall even further unless the Saudis and Russians returned to the bargaining table. \u201cI think all forecasts are out the window,\u201d said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Probis Securities in Sydney. \u201cIt seems like a race to the bottom to secure order(s).\u201d The Australian share market lost more than 7% as energy companies saw double-digit losses. In Vietnam, the British foreign office has confirmed that it is in contact with Vietnamese authorities, over tens of international travellers who are being quarantined over fears they may have been exposed to coronavirus after taking a flight from London to Hanoi. Seven British travellers are among those who have reportedly tested positive for the virus over recent days, prompting officials in the country to race to isolate any other passengers or contacts who may have been exposed. An Irish and a Mexican passenger are also reported to have been infected. The country had reported no new cases for several weeks, after schools were closed and employees told to work from home in an effort to halt a potential outbreak. But over recent days 14 new cases have been recorded, bringing the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 30. Officials are considering asking all citizens to complete a health declaration form as a precaution. It is not clear how long tourists will be required to stay in quarantine. Karen Beland, whose friend is among those being isolated, said people have received little information about what is happening. Her friend had travelled to Vietnam for a once in a lifetime trip to celebrate her 60th birthday. On Saturday, the cruise boat on which she was staying in Halong Bay was stopped, and she was brought by ambulance to a quarantine centre along with other tourists. \u201cThey\u2019re in a bare room, with six beds in a row with plastic mattresses, with no pillows, no sheets, no towels, and bars on the windows,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are people in their 50s, 60s, 70s, stuck with very little information and until recently not very much food either,\u201d she said, adding that one had been ill due to dehydration on Sunday morning. They have been in Vietnam for a week and have not experienced any symptoms, but are worried about staying in a quarantine facility with others who may be ill. The British Foreign Office said in a statement that it is \u201cin close contact with the Vietnamese authorities\u201d , adding: \u201cWe are providing consular assistance to the British people affected. \u201cWe advise all British nationals in Vietnam to follow our travel advice, which is kept under constant review.\u201d Over to Wuhan for a moment, where top party official has come under fire after saying the government would implement \u201cgratitude education\u201d so citizens can properly thank the Chinese Communist party for its efforts fighting the coronavirus outbreak. In comments published on Saturday, Wuhan party secretary Wang Zhonglin said: \u201cThe people of Wuhan are heroic people who understand gratitude,\u201d echoing previous comments by Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \u201c[We] must through various channels carry out gratitude education among the citizens of the whole city as well as cadres so that they thank the general secretary [Xi Jinping], thank the communist party, listen to the party\u2019s words, follow the party\u2019s way, and create strong positive energy,\u201d said Wang, who was sent to Wuhan in February to replace the former party secretary, amid rising public anger over local authorities\u2019 handling of the crisis. Wang\u2019s statement was met with such scorn that the party affiliated paper that published his comments, the Changjiang Daily, appeared to remove the original article. Chinese media has reportedly been instructed not to publish the article, publish commentaries or mention the incident in anyway. Australia \u2018set for recession\u2019 Here\u2019s a more on the ASX plunge today. Bloomberg Economics says the country is headed for recession: \u201cAustralia\u2019s economy will record its first recession since 1991 as the hit from China\u2019s virus-induced slowdown is amplified by slumping confidence and domestic disruptions from the outbreak intensifying Down Under, according to Bloomberg Economics\u2019s James McIntyre.\u201d The Australian stock market has endured its worst day since the global financial crisis, with around $140bn wiped from the market over fears that a widespread outbreak of Covid-19 could tip Australia\u2019s economy into recession, Katharine Murphy and Ben Doherty report. Australia\u2019s benchmark ASX200 share index market closed down 7.33% on Monday, shedding 455 points to 5,760 points. It was estimtaed that the overall loss of value from the market was around $140bn. The ASX 200 reached an all-time peak of 7,197 on 20 February. Oil stocks plunged and the price of oil fell by more than a fifth after Saudi Arabia slashed its official selling price and announced it would raise production. On some forecasts, retail petrol could be as low as $1 a litre in Australia soon. The Australian dollar has been caught up in the sell-off and was trading as low as 63.98 US cents. Confirmed cases of Covid-19, mainly among people who have travelled overseas, continue to grow across the country. New South Wales now has 46 confirmed cases, including the three schoolchildren, Queensland and Victoria 15 each. There are now 91 cases across Australia, with three deaths. Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the Morrison government will use the tax and transfer system to get financial support to Australian households as quickly as possible as part of a looming stimulus package to counter the negative economic impact of the coronavirus, Katharine Murphy and Amy Remeikis report. Ahead of a cabinet deliberation about the stimulus package expected on Tuesday, the treasurer was asked by reporters on Monday how the government intended to administer assistance to households, given the Coalition has criticised the Rudd government\u2019s stimulus package deployed during the global financial crisis. The ASX just closed with a 7.33% plunge, in the worst day of trading since the Global Financial Crisis. This represents around AU$140bn (US$90bn) being wiped off Australian shares. More soon... The ASX is down 7.9%. Markets will be closing any minute now. We\u2019ll have more exact figures soon, but this represents more than AU$130bn (US$85bn) being wiped off the Australian share market. This is the worst day of trading since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. Mutual travel restrictions imposed by South Korea and Japan took effect on Monday, rekindling a diplomatic and economic feud between the old foes. South Korea suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan on Friday, after Tokyo announced travel restrictions, joining more than 100 other countries limiting arrivals from South Korea. The spat, together with oil price swings, sent South Korean shares and the won sharply lower and prompted the finance ministry to issue a verbal warning against disorderly market movement. South Korean officials expressed hope on Monday that the country was nearing a \u201cturning point\u201d in the crisis, as the pace of new infections trended lower. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 69 new cases, continuing a downward trend. The death toll rose by one to 51 The new cases brought South Korea\u2019s total infections to 7,382, while the death toll rose by one to 51, the KCDC said. The rate of increase in new infections fell to its lowest in 10 days on Sunday in one of the countries most severely affected outside mainland China. \u201cI\u2019m still extremely cautious, but there\u2019s hope we can reach a turning point in the near future,\u201d Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Monday before returning to Seoul from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu. Health authorities say the number of new infections being identified has dwindled as most of the roughly 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the centre of the epidemic in Daegu have now been tested. Staying in Western Australia for the time being, chief executive of east metropolitan health services, Liz McCloud is speaking about the clinics there, which she reiterates, \u201care to test those people who have cold and flu-like symptoms and have travelled overseas or believe they have in contact with a known case.\u201d In Western Australia, the state health minister Roger Cook says the state has confirmed its sixth case, in addition to the case reported this morning. I have the sad news to report that we have our sixth case of coronavirus. This in addition to the fifth case I reported this morning. The sixth case is the son of the woman who travelled from Jakarta and then on to Melbourne. We\u2019ve tested all her family and only her son has now shown up with the coronavirus...We are now working with that family to understand all their movements. In Western Australia, the health minister Roger Cooke is speaking at one of the new Covid-19 clinics which will be open from 8am to 8pm tomorrow: \u201cThe way these clinics will work is they are available to anyone who is experiencing flu-like symptoms; Have travelled overseas in the recent past; have come in contact with someone who has travelled overseas or believe they have come in contact with someone with a positive diagnosis. We are expanding the role of the clinics from when we announced them on the weekend.\u201d As the coronavirus hits more US states, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Sunday his campaign is gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health experts say could be breeding grounds to spread the potentially deadly illness. Obviously what is most important to us is to protect the health of the American people, Sanders said as he appeared in a series of TV interviews. \u201cAnd what I will tell you, we are talking to public health officials all over this country.\u201d On Sunday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams noted that the average age of death for people from the coronavirus is 80, while for those needing medical attention, it is 60. But that so far hasn\u2019t led President Donald Trump or his two remaining major Democratic rivals, Sanders and Joe Biden, to cut back on big campaign events. Each man is in his 70s. The number of infections swelled to more than 500, scattered across the U.S. Still, concerns about the spreading virus haven\u2019t stopped thousands from thronging campaign rallies in recent days. At a Trump rally last week in Charlotte, North Carolina, the virus threat didn\u2019t deter enthusiastic fans who shared buckets of chicken fingers in the stands and dunked their hands into shared vats of popcorn while they awaited the president\u2019s arrival. Sanders drew more than 7,000 to a convention hall in downtown Detroit on Friday night and his campaign said 15,000 people attended his rally in Chicagos Grant Park on Saturday. Goldman Sachs cut its second- and third-quarter Brent price forecasts to US$30 per barrel, citing the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia and a significant collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus. Oil fell by the most since 1991 on Monday after Saudi Arabia started a price war with Russia by slashing its selling prices and pledging to unleash its pent-up supply onto a market reeling from falling demand because of the virus outbreak. \u201cThe aggressive cut to Saudi\u2019s Official Selling Prices and Russia\u2019s reluctance to be pushed into a deal on Friday point to a low probability of an immediate (OPEC+) agreement,\u201d Goldman said in a note dated March 8. A three-year pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia ended in acrimony on Friday after Moscow refused to support deeper oil cuts and OPEC responded by removing all limits on its own production. Assuming no change in production policy, Goldman expects a supply deficit to emerge in the fourth quarter of 2020, which would run down excess inventories through 2021. The bank said the prospect of inventory draws would help prices to rebound to $40 per barrel by the end of this year. In Australia, Sky News has reported that Prime Minister Scott Morrison is considering cash handouts to ordinary citizens as part of an expected A$10 billion (US$6.50 billion) fiscal stimulus package. However, the idea is facing fierce opposition from Finance and Treasury officials, Sky added. Also on the table are wage subsidies for small businesses and business tax incentives as Morrison\u2019s government work to combat the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Mark Scott from the New South Wales Department of Education is speaking now about the new cases confirmed at schools this morning. \u201cApart from those students asked to self-isolate, [Willoughby Girls High School] will be open again on Wednesday morning. Epping boys high school was closed last Friday, and Epping boys high has opened this morning and is operating successfully.\u201d In Australia, New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant is speaking now. She says, \u201cWhile we are actually expecting to see continued rises in case numbers, that reflects very strong health protection system. We want people that are returning from overseas who develop symptoms within 14 days to present for testing. And that allows us to act promptly at identifying contacts and breaking the chain of transmission.\u201d New South Wales state health minister Brad Hazzard says of the new cases, \u201cThere was a14-year-old boy and a 15-year-oldgirl, both at year 10 at St Patrick\u2019s Marist College, Dundas. There was also a 12-year-old, a young lady from Willoughby Girls High School. \u201cIn regard to the two young people from Dundas, St Patrick\u2019s MaristCollege, their fathers, aged in their 50s, have also been confirmed as having the coronavirus. We have the year seven student, her mum has also been confirmed as having COVID-19. She\u2019s a lady of Iranian origin, but hasn\u2019t travelled recently. So there\u2019s a lot of work to do there to determine the source of that particular infection.\u201d We\u2019re in Sydney now for another update state health minister Brad Hazzard, who says, \u201cWe\u2019ve established now a new orthodoxy. If a child or anyone else at a school is found to have the Covid-19 virus then effectively a breather will be taken. They will take a day out.\u201d \u201cThis is the new normal,\u201d he said. A new song to wash your hands to: In the US, the state of Maryland reported two new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, raising to five the total confirmed cases in the state. In Maryland, a Harford County resident in her 80s who contracted the virus while traveling overseas and was hospitalized and a Montgomery County resident in his 60s who contracted the virus while traveling overseas and was briefly hospitalized. California Governor Gavin Newsom and the mayor of Oakland sought Sunday to reassure the public that none of the passengers from a ship carrying people with the virus will be released into the public before undergoing a 14-day quarantine. There are 21 confirmed cases on board the ship. The Grand Princess carrying more than 3,500 people from 54 countries is expected to dock Monday in Oakland, in the east San Francisco Bay, and was idling off the coast Sunday as officials prepared a port site. Those needing acute medical care will come off first. A special North Korean flight carrying presumably dozens of diplomats and other foreigners arrived in Russia\u2019s Far East on Monday as the country tightens its lockdown intended to fend off the coronavirus. North Korea has not publicly confirmed a single case of the Covid-19, but its state media reports suggest about 7,000 North Koreans have been quarantined as part of strict prevention measures. Seemingly dozens of passengers, most of them masked and some accompanied by children, lined up at Pyongyang International Airport. North Korean health workers wearing white protective suits scanned them for fevers. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many were flown out to Vladivostok. The North lifted a monthlong quarantine on foreign diplomats based in Pyongyang on March 2, allowing them to leave the country if needed. Colin Crooks, the British ambassador to Pyongyang, tweeted: The North has called its anti-virus campaign a matter of \u201cnational existence\u201d while banning foreign tourists, shutting down nearly all cross-border traffic with China, intensifying screening at entry points and mobilizing health workers to monitor residents and isolate those with symptoms. Many experts say North Korea is highly vulnerable to infectious diseases due to its chronic shortage of medical supplies and outdated health care infrastructure. China\u2019s excessive coronavirus public monitoring could be here to stay Over the last two months, Chinese citizens have had to adjust to a new level of government intrusion. Getting into one\u2019s apartment compound or workplace requires scanning a QR code, writing down one\u2019s name and ID number, temperature and recent travel history. Telecom operators track people\u2019s movements while social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo have hotlines for people to report others who may be sick. Some cities are offering people rewards for informing on sick neighbours. Chinese companies are meanwhile rolling out facial recognition technology that can detect elevated temperatures in a crowd or flag citizens not wearing a face mask. A range of apps use the personal health information of citizens to alert others of their proximity to infected patients or whether they have been in close contact. State authorities, in addition to locking down entire cities, have implemented a myriad of security measures in the name of containing the coronavirus outbreak. From top officials to local community workers, those enforcing the rules repeat the same refrain: this is an \u201cextraordinary time\u201d feichang shiqi, requiring extraordinary measures. There\u2019s \u2018No chance\u2019 of the Australian Grand Prix happening behind closed doors, organisers say. Italian Formula One teams have started arriving in Australia and there is no chance of the opening grand prix of the season being cancelled, postponed or being held behind closed doors, despite fears over the coronavirus. Andrew Westacott, CEO of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, said on Monday the race will proceed as planned at Albert Park, after it was announced the next race on the calendar, the Bahrain GP on 22 March, will be run without spectators present. April\u2019s Chinese Grand Prix has already been postponed. The operator of cruise ship Costa Fortuna said it was heading to Singapore to end its journey on Tuesday as planned, after it was turned away from ports in Malaysia and Thailand over coronavirus fears. Italian cruise line Costa Crociere said there were no suspected virus cases among its guests, which includes Italians \u2013 Italy has the largest number of cases of the virus outside China with 7,375 infections. Costa Crociere said it would cancel a cruise due to depart on March 10 from Singapore. Singapore port authorities have not yet said whether they would allow the ship to dock. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the country will extend its ban on travellers from China and Iran for another seven days. Walt Disney Co\u2019s Shanghai Disneyland said on Monday it will resume a limited number of operations at its resort as part of the first step of a phased reopening, although the main theme park will remain shut amid worries about a coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. A limited number of shopping, dining, and recreational activities would be available at Disneytown, Wishing Star Park and Shanghai Disneyland Hotel though they will operate under limited capacity and reduced hours of operation, Shanghai Disneyland said in a statement on its website. The Shanghai Disneyland had been shut from Jan. 25 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. How to boost your immune system to avoid colds and coronavirus You\u2019re washing your hands 10 times a day and have stopped touching your face. What else can you do to improve your health and avoid bugs? Sheena Cruickshank, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, has a \u201cshocking cold\u201d when we speak at a safe distance, over the phone. To know how to take care of your immune system, she says, first you need to understand the weapons in your armoury \u2013 a cheeringly impressive collection, it turns out. \u201cWhen you come into contact with a germ you\u2019ve never met before,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got various barriers to try to stop it getting into your body.\u201d As well as skin, we have mucus \u2013 \u201csnot is a really important barrier\u201d \u2013 and a microbiome, the collective noun for the estimated 100tn microbes that live throughout our bodies, internally and externally. Some of these helpful bugs make antimicrobial chemicals and compete with pathogens for food and space. In Australia, a notice was sent to the parents at Willoughby Public School today \u2013 the school shares grounds with Willoughby Girls, which confirmed a case of Covid-19 among one of its students today \u2013 saying it is \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for now. Willoughby public has around 1,000 students from kindergarten to year 6. Hong Kong has had its third Covid-19 death, a 76-year old woman who had an underlying health condition who had been diagnosed early this month, the Hospital Authority said on Sunday. Her husband has also been confirmed to have the virus. The two lived in Sham Shui Po in Kowloon. Hong Kong\u2019s Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday that it was investigating five new cases, bringing the total confirmed infections in the city to 115. Two of the five new cases are related to a tour group that travelled to India. Hong Kong stocks saw their worst fall in two years on Monday, with the Hang Seng index dropping by more than 4%, its worst one-day decline since February 2018. As China reported no new cases outside of Hubei province, optimism is growing in Wuhan. According to CCTV, 11 out of 14 temporary hospitals built to take patients with milder conditions have now closed. The three remaining temporary, emergency hospitals have about 100 patients in each. Deputy head of the central steering group leading the government\u2019s response to the crisis Chen Yixin said at a meeting on Sunday: \u201cWe cannot be blindly optimistic.. we must concentrate our efforts in wiping out [the virus] and at the same time plan ahead for the resumption of work and allow people to leave Wuhan orderly and in batches.\u201d The message to doctors has always been clear: if you get sick, do it on your own time, writes Ranjana Srivastava. \u201cThe rule of thumb in medicine is that if you aren\u2019t sicker than your patients, you turn up to work. After all, a temporary viral illness is nothing compared to conditions that some other doctors endure: the death of a parent; a complicated pregnancy; and of course, mental illness whose manifestations are far harder to share than a fractured arm or a blinding headache. Organisations are splashed with well-intentioned messages highlighting the importance of self-care and even offering free help, because we know all too well that illness doesn\u2019t distinguish between patients and doctors. Unfortunately, like all attractive offers, there is a huge catch: in order to get better, you must be prepared to tax your fellow doctors. No one says you can\u2019t take a day off, but it is an unspoken expectation that you will not be covered.\u201d The stock market rout won\u2019t reach the bottom until the coronavirus is contained in the United States, according to an Australian economist. The Australian share market is now down 6.5% on what is proving to be one of the most disastrous days for the ASX200 in recent history. The mounting concerns about a global recession caused by the virus have been compounded by the shock decision by Saudi Arabia to start an oil price war, sparking a 20% fall in the cost of benchmark Brent crude. Stocks in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong are also deep in the red. But despite an emergency rate cut by the US Federal Reserve last week there has been no let up in the selloff which is now into its third week. David Bassnese, chief economist at BetaShares Capital in Sydney, said on Monday that there could be buying opportunities for investors after such large falls but the market would not bottom out until the situation in the US was clearer. \u201cWe need a cellar sign that the outbreak in the US is contained but we\u2019re not there yet because the number of cases and deaths is still on the rise. We have to see what happens with containment measures there, such as travel restrictions and shutdowns. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that we\u2019ve seen the last of the bad news. We need to see in the US the sort of containment of the virus that we\u2019ve seen in China, if you believe the figures. \u201cWhat is the mortality rate of this virus? They need to do more testing in the US. That is the key. Is it Spanish flu [that killed millions after the first world war], or is it swine flu, that infected 60 million people in the US in 209 according to some estimates but killed \u2018only\u2019 12,000 people?\u201d Oil futures suffered their biggest daily loss since 1991 on Sunday after Saudi Arabian state oil giant Aramco slashed its official selling price (OSP) and announced plans to raise crude production significantly, signalling the start of a price war. Those moves came after Russia on Friday balked at OPEC\u2019s proposed steep production cuts to stabilize prices hit by economic fallout from the coronavirus, AFP reports. Saudi Arabia said it plans to boost crude output above 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in April after the current deal to curb production between OPEC and Russia \u2013 known as OPEC+ \u2013 expires at the end of March, two sources told Reuters on Sunday. Saudi Arabia cut its OSP for April for all crude grades to all destinations by anywhere from $6 to $8 a barrel, sending oil into a tailspin. Brent futures fell US$9.95, or 22.0%, to $35.32 a barrel by 6:34 p.m. EDT (9:34 am Monday AEDT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell $8.99, or 21.8%, to $32.29. Earlier in the session, both contracts fell to their lowest since February 2016, with Brent down to $31.02 per barrel and WTI at $30. That puts Brent and WTI on track for their second biggest daily percentage drops in history behind declines for both in January 1991 over 30%. Still in Australia for the moment, we have a bit more information on the coronavirus case at Willoughby Girls High school: A letter sent from principal Ms E Diprose said the school will not be operational for the remainder of today, Monday 9 March, and tomorrow, Tuesday 10 March. The letter to parents said: A student at the schools has returned a positive test for Covid 19 at Willoughby Girls High School. Students will be released from their classrooms from 11.30am. We are endorsing the use of mobile phones today so you can message your daughter when you arrive to collect her. To provide time for NSW Health to conduct their contact tracing process the school will be non-operational today and tomorrow. In accordance with NSW Health advice staff and students at the school should self-isolate for the next two days while the contact tracing process is finalised. Staff and students will be contacted again today and also advised if they can resume school as normal on Wednesday,11 March 2020 or if a further quarantine period will be required. Information on COVID 19 is available on NSW Health website. The main takeaway from Australia\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers is that the economy was already in bad shape before coronavirus hit. \u201cThe government should be considering ways to get support into the hands of workers and businesses and communities as soon as possible,\u201d he said. Australia\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers says, \u201cThe response needs to be broad enough to make a difference and big enough and fast enough.\u201d He is now talking about petrol retailers who, he says, \u201cshould not be taking us for mugs\u201d by holding on to petrol price reductions. Australians need this price relief he says. Australia\u2019s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers is speaking now, with a much less reassuring message \u2013 albeit one focussed on criticising the government \u2013 listing the challenges faced by Australia\u2019s economy beyond coronavirus. \u201cThis Coronavirus will have a very big impact on our economy and it warrants and demands a substantial response from our government. The economy was already weak, heading into the challenges of the fire season and the Coronavirus and now it is getting weaker. Already before the virus hit, we had slowing quarterly growth, annual growth was well below average, business investment went backwards for three-quarters in a row. We have got stagnant wages, very high household debt, issues with consumption and productivity.\u201d Australian shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers is now speaking about the economy: \u201cI am conscious that the stock market has again taken a big hit, as confidence here and around the world has suffered from the outbreak of the virus. I know it is having an impact on our dollar as well, which is lower again. There is a lot of anxiety and a lot of concern in our economy and in our community.\u201d Brendan Murphy, Australia\u2019s Chief medical officer, says \u201cthousands\u201d have been asked to self-isolate, but he does not have exact numbers. The gist of that presser is: Return travellers with symptoms, get tested There has been only one case of community transmission in the country The focus at the moment is therefore on return travellers Australian Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy is addressing media at the moment about the general status of the outbreak in the country. Asked whether those who have not had contact with recent travellers from China or South Korea, but have a runny nose, whether you should get a test, Murphy says: Not unless you are a returned traveller and you have symptoms, symptoms that suggest you might have an upper respiratory infection - a cough, a significant runny nose and fever.\u201d In Australia, we\u2019re hearing from the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, who says: There may come a point where the focus is on isolating people who are symptomatic and test positive, and keeping them away from the rest of the community. And where contact tracing becomes less important. We are not at that point yet. At the moment, we\u2019re focusing very aggressively on tracing and isolating contacts, because all of the evidence suggests that the best way to temper, delay and reduce the size of any outbreak in Australia is to contain it. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says pregnant women should take particular care with their health but that there haven\u2019t been any major issues in pregnant women who\u2019ve been infected \u2013 that\u2019s the advice from China. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy is talking a bit about the special clinics being set up to deal with the outbreak. \u201cSometimes they might be located within an existing clinic, but with a separate entrance. The idea is to keep potential cases away from the general community,\u201d he says. REPORTER: So they will be essentially in the suburbs and towns, more so than the major metro areas? Murphy: \u201cWe\u2019re working for a range of them. It will be more difficult in rural and regional areas.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says screening at the airport \u201chasn\u2019t picked up many people so far. Most people end up becoming unwell when they come here. But we certainly do have very enhanced screening at the moment.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy is addressing the media about the status of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Asked about travel bans \u2013 given he has just said the most important consideration for the spread of the virus in Australia is from return travellers to monitor themselves and report to doctors if they have any symptoms: \u201cOur current travel bans are proportionate. No more travel bans are recommended,\u201d he says. In Australia, the country\u2019s chief medical officer Brendan Murphy says: Our message remains. The most important thing for Australia to slow the progression of this disease is for return travellers who become unwell with flu-like symptoms, upper respiratory symptoms \u2013 cough, sore throat, fever and the like, to contact their doctor and get tested. That is the best way that we will contain the growth in this disease. Australia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy is speaking now about the country\u2019s latest coronavirus cases. He says Australia still has only one case of community transmission, in Sydney. \u201cThe majority of cases in Australia continue to be from return travellers from an increasing number of countries around the world.\u201d The Hang Seng index has open down nearly 4%, in line with the falls we\u2019ve already seen in Australia and Japan this morning. For the record the ASX200 in Sydney is off an eyewatering 6.2% now and Tokyo has lost 5%. Here\u2019s the latest from China, where new infections and coronavirus-related deaths continue to slow. China reported 22 new deaths, the lowest new cases on record There were 40 new cases nationwide, the National Health Commission said, with most in Hubei, the central province at the epicentre of the outbreak. The 22 new deaths \u2013 which were all in Hubei except one \u2013 bring the country\u2019s toll to 3,119. More than 80,700 people have been infected in total in mainland China. A senior government official hinted last week that China could soon lift the lockdown on the province imposed in late January, which has effectively restricted the movement of some 56 million people in Hubei. However, there have now been 67 cases of imported infections brought into the country, the health commission said, with four new cases confirmed Monday. The rise in imported cases is raising fears that the country\u2019s progress in bringing infections down could be undone, and several local authorities are imposing quarantines on those arriving from hard-hit areas. Saudi seals off Shiite-majority region, closes schools over coronavirus Saudi authorities Sunday cordoned off the eastern region of Qatif, a stronghold of the kingdom\u2019s Shiite minority, in a bid to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus as the total number of cases rose to 11, AFP reports. The lockdown on Qatif, home to around 500,000 people, is the first action of its kind across the Gulf region that has confirmed more than 230 coronavirus cases \u2013 most of them people returning from religious pilgrimages to Shiite-majority Iran. \u201cGiven that all 11 recorded positive cases of the new coronavirus are from Qatif... it has been decided... to temporarily suspend entry and exit from Qatif,\u201d the interior ministry said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency. Although the ministry said the lockdown was temporary, it risks fuelling resentment in the flashpoint region whose residents have long accused the Sunni-dominated government of discrimination, a charge Riyadh denies. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province \u2013 which includes Qatif \u2013 has seen bouts of unrest since 2011 when protesters emboldened by that year\u2019s Arab Spring uprisings took to the streets. Air New Zealand has withdrawn full-year guidance it downgraded just two weeks ago amid mounting disruption from the global coronavirus outbreak. The carrier\u2019s chief executive has also taken a pay cut as it braces for a greater-than-expected hit from virus-related closures and travel bans that are hurting the wider aviation industry. Air NZ in February predicted the Covid-19 hit to FY20 earnings would be in the range of $NZ35 million ($A34 million) to $NZ75 million ($A72 million) due to lower demand and capacity cuts. The company on Monday said financial impact is now likely to be more significant than previously estimated. \u201cAnd with the situation evolving at such a rapid pace, the airline is not in a position to provide an earnings outlook to the market at this time,\u201d Air New Zealand said in a release. The company has already cut flights to Hong Kong, suspended Shanghai services until March, and Seoul flights from March to June. Australia\u2019s Qantas airline on Friday announced it would cut more international flights as it too grapples with falling demand. Qantas\u2019 latest cuts to destinations including Tokyo, Sapporo, Osaka, Hong Kong and Auckland are on top of its grounding the equivalent of 18 planes as it cut international and domestic capacity last month. The ASX is now down 6%. The Australian Financial Review is reporting that \u201cAustralian shares are on track for their worst day since the GFC.\u201d Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is wrapping up now, he says there is a coordinated response to the crisis from central banks. I was on a call with the International Monetary Fund just the other day. And on that call were Central Bank governors from China, from the United States, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England. Everyone is equally concerned. We\u2019re seeing this in the global economy. But this is very different to the GFC, and so the response needs to be very different. And our response is both on the supply and the demand side, because we are seeing disruptions to the economy. Still in Australia, where Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is addressing the media. Asked about the concerns casual workers have over disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak, he says: I\u2019m very conscious that Australians in employment, be it casual or permanent, will be concerned about their job security. This is obviously an issue that will be raised at tomorrow\u2019s meeting between the Minister for Industrial Relations and the peak employee and employer groups. Our focus is on getting a cooperative workplace. Our focus is ensuring that businesses are flexible, given the stresses and the strains that we will see as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. The ASX-200 is now down 5.8%. Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg says, \u201cAustralia is well prepared, economically, and we go into this challenge from a position of strength.\u201d Asked about today\u2019s ASX tumble, Frydenberg says, \u201cThis is a very different situation to what we saw through the GFC, which was essentially, a problem with the banking and the financial system and issues of liquidity. We haven\u2019t seen those same problems in relation to this health crisis.\u201d Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the economic impact of Coronavirus is \u201cvery significant\u201d. We\u2019ve seen disruptions to international supply chains. We\u2019ve seen a hit on particular sectors, including the tourism sector, agriculture sector, seafood sector and education sector. We\u2019ve already seen the Reserve Bank adjust interest rates downwards and the major banks pass those rate cuts on in full. Still in Australia for the moment, the ABC\u2019s state political reporter in Perth Jacob Kagi said in a tweet that the fifth case in Western Australia contracted the virus from her husband, who had recently returned from Iran. A fifth case of Covid-19 has been confirmed in Western Australia, the ABC reports. In Australia, \u201cas far as prioritising our testing capacity in coming weeks, the state government will be prioritising testing for health care workers,\u201d says health minister Jenny Mikakos. Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos is briefing the media on the latest cases in the state. Asked whether she would like to apologise for her use of the word \u201cflabbergasted\u201d referring to the story of a doctor who presented to work last week with symptoms, she says: \u201cLook, I needed to stress \u2013 and I will continue the stress the fact \u2013 we need to be alive to the facts. This is a public health emergency of an unprecedented nature that our nation and that the entire global community is facing.\u201d In Australia, Victoria health minister Jenny Mikakos says, \u201cWe\u2019ve increased in Victoria, the the biggest jump we have had so far. Three additional cases just today. A big jump from 10 to 15 cases in the last three days. In Australia, Victoria health minister Jenny Mikakos is asked whether she wishes to apologise to Chris Higgins, the doctor who presented to work despite having flu-like symptoms and was later diagnosed as having Covid-19. She responds by thanking all health care workers for their work. \u201cWe will not make any apology for the fact that we will always prioritise public health,\u201d she adds. There are three additional cases today in Victoria. Victoria health minister Jenny Mikakos is giving a press conference, she says there have been around three hundred presentations at hospitals in the state. She is issuing a reminder to health care practitioners to not come to work if they are showing any symptoms and to stay away until those symptoms have completely gone away. In Australia, Victoria health minister Jenny Mikakos is giving a press conference. In this emergency, \u201cWe cannot operate on fear or favour,\u201d she says. The trading day is under way in Japan and South Korea and it\u2019s more of the same with the Nikkei down 4.5% as signalled by the futures market earlier. In Seoul, the Kospi index has lost 3%. US government bond yields have also sunk to new lows this morning, a sign of increasingly negative outlook on the global economy as investors take money out of risky assets such as shares and commodities (oil, for example) and put it into rock solid investments with a guaranteed return. Others safe havens such as the Japanese yen and gold have also risen in value. The benchmark US treasury 10-year bond yield (basically the interest rate paid on government bonds) has fallen to 0.4949% in trade in Japan this morning. So just to recap that, in New South Wales, Australia, the state health minister Brad Hazzard has confirmed another case in a school: A year 7 student at Willoughby Girls school has tested positive to Covid-19. Health authorities are interviewing the girl, her family members, and undertaking contact tracing, he says. This brings the new cases for New South Wales to six this morning, Still in New South Wales Australia, for the moment, where state health minister Brad Hazzard says, \u201cThis is a virus is active across the world. We can anticipate it will be active here, although thus far, New South Wales and Australia are doing extraordinarily compared to the rest of the world.\u201d New South Wales\u2019 Health Minister Brad Hazzard says \u201cThese are matters are evolving and literally as I walked into the media conference I was being informed [of what was happening]\u201d. He adds that if you have mild systems, you should call your GP for advice. If you have severe symptoms you should call your ED right away to arrange a visit. More on the response at St. Patrick\u2019s Marist College in Dundas, Executive director of Catholic Schools Parramatta, Greg Whitby, who says parents have been directed to pick their children up from school when they are able to. He does not know how long measures will be in place for, and said the school could not close as not all parents are able to arrange child care on short notice. We couldn\u2019t close the school because we had students who may or may not have access to childcare. We briefed the staff, as soon as they arrived, on the situation. Asked those that felt that they had close contact that they might need to self-isolate, and then we did the same process with the students. In Australia, New South Wales\u2019 Health Minister Brad Hazzard says a year seven student has been confirmed at Willoughby High school. The other cases include two men in their fifties who \u201cappear to have some connection, \u2013 family contact \u2013 with some of the cases that have previously been announced.\u201d The other four new infections are the two students at St. Patrick\u2019s Marist, the student at Willoughby and a mother connected with the Willoughby student. In Australia, New South Wales\u2019 Health Minister Brad Hazzard says there are another six cases confirmed in the state. In the US, the price of futures contracts for the S&amp;P 500 index, a Wall Street benchmark, fell more than 4% on Sunday as off-hours trading for U.S. equity markets resumed, a sign that investors fear the toll from the fast-spreading coronavirus will deepen. Italy, the country hardest hit by the virus in Europe, essentially locked down much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic attempt to contain an outbreak that saw the number of deaths leap sharply on Sunday. Contracts for the S&amp;P 500 E-mini fell 4.2% to 2839. The decline indicates how much the S&amp;P 500 might fall when trading begins on Monday. The implied yield on the futures contract for the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell below 0.5% for first time. The benchmark Treasury hit a historic low on Friday, closing at 0.707%, as markets reacted to the coronavirus. It was the first time the 10-year note had traded below 1%. Corporations around the world have begun issuing profit warnings and curbing activities as the virus spreads. The ASX200 is in freefall this morning, losing 5.5% with energy stocks bearing the brunt of the selling. Santos shares have fallen 23% in response to the shock decision over the weekend and Woodside Petroleum is down 18%. The energy sector as a whole is off 20%. https://twitter.com/GrogsGamut/status/1236800247705341952 The dramatic selloff has been sparked by Saudi Arabia\u2019s shock decision over the weekend to increase rather than decrease oil production. A cut had been expected to keep prices stable in the wake of falling global demand due to the coronavirus. But after Opec ministers met In Vienna and then failed to persuade Russia to agree to the cut which would reduce supply and boost prices, the Saudis appear to have decided to embark on a price war designed to drive competitors such as Russia and the US shale industry out of the market altogether. Once that\u2019s done, Saudi Arabia would, in theory, be left to control production and therefore set higher prices. But whether or not it\u2019s possible to ever eliminate fleet-footed US shale producers is a matter of debate. The Australia Securities Exchange (ASX) is now down 5.5%, wiping more than AU$140bn off the Australian share market. US senator Ted Cruz has released a statement saying he \u201cbriefly interacted with an individual who is currently symptomatic and has tested positive for Covid-19\u201d while at the Conservative Political Action Conference ten days ago. He says he is not experiencing any symptoms and that the interaction \u2013 \u201ca brief conversation and a handshake \u2013 does not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s criteria for self quarantine and that none of the people Cruz has interacted with in the last 10 days. He has nevertheless decided to remain in Texas for the remainder of the 14-day period. More on the latest infections in New South Wales, Sydney now. Two students in Year 10 at St Patrick\u2019s Marist College, in Dundas, in Sydney\u2019s northwest, have been confirmed as having contracted Covid-19. The school has asked parents to collect their children from the school, and the school will be closed tomorrow. It is not known whether the students had travelled overseas recently. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard is expected to speak shortly about Covid-19 transmission in NSW. 42 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed across the state. In Australia, the ASX is now down 5.3%.

The ABC is reporting that Epping Boys school was thoroughly cleaned over the weekend after a year 11 student there tested positive last week. Here\u2019s that story from Friday: In Australia, we\u2019re expecting to hear shortly from a New South Wales representative regarding the two new infections in Sydney among two Year 10 high school students at St. Patrick\u2019s Marist College in Dundas. Stay tuned. The Australian share market is down 4% in what could be the most turbulent day yet during this coronavirus-driven markets crisis. Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets and Stockbroking in Sydney, said US stock futures are trading significantly lower this morning after crude oil futures dropped more than 20% at the opening of the US Sunday night session. \u201cRussia\u2019s hard line at a Friday meeting of OPEC+ oil producing nations means it will no longer observe supply restraint to keep crude oil prices higher. The break down in supply agreements comes as the Covid-19 virus has many analysts revising demand forecasts downward, and the double-hit is playing havoc with prices. The growing fears over the impact of virus containment measures and the slump in crude prices may see stocks outstrip falls foreshadowed on Saturday morning.\u201d Full story on that crucial Saudi Arabina decision on oil is here: Australian Unions will ask the federal government for compensation for casual workers who don\u2019t get paid sick leave, AAP reports. The government is preparing a multi-billion dollar stimulus package to offset the impact of coronavirus on the economy. Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Sally McManus said the package must address the financial risk to Australia\u2019s 3.3 million casual workers in retail, hospitality, health and aged care, who will lose pay if they get sick. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people with virus or people with symptoms going to work, but they are going to have to choose between paying the bills and feeding themselves or going to work,\u201d she told Nine\u2019s Today program on Monday. In Sydney, Australia, Channel Nine is reporting that two Year 10 pupils at St Patrick\u2019s Dundas in Sydney have tested positive for coronavirus. We\u2019ll have more on this shortly.

I will still be making a donation to help the victims of the Australian bush fire. I\u2019m sorry to miss everyone in Australia, but I will be back soon.\u201d The concert organiser TEG Dainty said the whole concert had now been cancelled and ticket holders would be refunded. \u201cWe are very sad that Miley Cyrus has announced that she will not be travelling to Melbourne and that as a result the World Tour Bushfire Relief concert at Lakeside Stadium on Friday 13 March can no longer go ahead. All fans will receive a full refund and will be contacted by Ticketek shortly, a statement from statement from TEG Dainty said. \u201cWorld Tour\u2019s Saturday night show with Robbie Williams will still be going ahead, and we look forward to bringing Melbourne a fantastic night of entertainment. Robbie is already on his way to Australia.\u201d The lineup of the fundraising concert had been due to feature country-rap star Lil Nas X, alongside pop duo the Veronicas and DJ Seb Fontaine. On Sunday, Cyrus posted video from a rehearsal, which featured Dance Moms star Jojo Siwa. On Tuesday morning, Miley Cyrus appeared on the Today show on Channel Nine to promote the concert. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something I could do from home,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something that required me to physically go and connect with the Australian people that have always just been so welcoming to me.\u201d The Bushfire Relief concert was part of World Tour: a series of concerts organised by Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith\u2019s company Westbrook Inc, in conjunction with Apollo World Touring and Australian renewable energy company AgBioEn. Set to raise funds for the WWF Australian Wildlife and Nature Recovery Fund and the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal, the Melbourne event is a co-production with Australian promoter TEG Dainty. Miley Cyrus is just the latest artist to have Australian tour dates impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. The Australian composer Brett Dean was diagnosed with Covid-19 last week, leading him to cancel a major appearance at the Adelaide festival; and Shanghai Ballet\u2019s tour for Queensland Ballet was cancelled as a result of the travel bans. The musician Ziggy Marley and author Lindy West have also recently cancelled Australian appearances, due to \u201cunforeseen family responsibilities\u201d in the case of the former, and \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d for the latter.",

Created by Nigel Jamieson 11 years ago, its \u201cfuturistic\u201d projections of people perishing in a world on fire felt all too real for a nation still processing the trauma of the summer\u2019s bushfire carnage. I didn\u2019t wait to see if it had a happy ending, instead fleeing to an adjacent stage to wig out to Japanese psychedelic five-piece Kikagaku Moyo.</p> <p>Still, this year\u2019s Womadelaide gave us plenty of reasons to look up from our doom-predicting phones: the smiling faces in the all-ages crowd (children 12 and under are given free entry), the almost-full moon gleaming through the canopy of century-old Moreton Bay figs, the blinking faces of local environmentalists projected on to the trees at night by artist Craig Walsh, and the four-metre-high human and animal puppets of France\u2019s Company Archibald Caramantran which danced alongside the audience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d82ade4d366dd586a35c018560caed6395b4b915\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d82ade4d366dd586a35c018560caed6395b4b915/0_0_7293_4867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Faces projected in the trees around Botanic Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blinking faces are projected in the trees around Botanic Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Trutwin/Womadelaide</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>French-Tunisian collaboration Ifriqiyya \u00c9lectrique, who combine the sacred sub-Saharan ritual music of Banga with a rush of doom-laden post-industrial cacophony, had the desired effect of possessing some audience members, while also prompting a mass exodus of boomers clutching their fold-up chairs. Luckily they didn\u2019t have to walk far to the next stage where Lu\u00edsa Sobral, the composer of Portugal\u2019s 2017 Eurovision-winning song, was interspersing her melodious ballads with tender stories about octogenarians finding true love.</p> <p>Clearly not everyone received the loved-up memo though, because when I left Botanic Park on Monday night, it was to the strains of expletives being barked by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/live/2019/feb/11/sleaford-mods-webchat-post-your-questions-now\">Jason Williamson</a> from curmudgeonly English duo <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/mar/05/sleaford-mods-guide-to-modern-britain-lots-of-pain-english-tapas\">Sleaford Mods</a>.

Blind gospel legends the Blind Boys of Alabama opened the festival on Friday evening in sparkly black suits, delivering joyful renditions of People Get Ready and Spirit in the Sky, and bringing us some much-needed \u201cgood news\u201d: \u201cWe\u2019re still here!\u201d hollered gravelly-voiced Jimmy Carter, who at 87 is the only remaining original member of a group that played its first show in 1944 at the height of segregation. At 80, Chicago gospel great Mavis Staples told us she still has \u201cwork to do\u201d. Rocking the full-bodied pipes and infectious laugh that in 1964 prompted Bob Dylan to propose (she said no), Staples delivered civil rights anthem Freedom Highway with the same urgency her family band the Staple Singers brought to it in the 1960s, when they were playing alongside Martin Luther King and galvanised by the protest marches from Selma to Montgomery. \u201cThe struggle\u2019s still alive,\u201d Staples told us. \u201cYou gotta keep marchin\u2019 with me. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go up to that White House. I\u2019m gonna find that little boy up there. I\u2019m gonna grab him by that red hat. And I\u2019m gonna smack him up,\u201d Staples said, waving her hand back and forth in a slapping motion. She only seemed half joking when she added: \u201cYou know, I might just run for president myself.\u201d Maintaining the rage (and elation) \u2013 but from another generation and continent \u2013 were Spinifex Gum, a project comprising a dozen teenage girls from Cairns\u2019s Indigenous Marliya choir and spearheaded by Cat Empire frontman Felix Riebl, who has a way with an uplifting chorus. Lush harmonies and choreographed moves combined with topical songs in English and Yindjibarndi about Indigenous incarceration (the heart-rending Ms Dhu and Locked Up) and the voice to parliament (a cover of Dream Baby Dream). By the time Yorta Yorta rapper Briggs joined them on stage for The Children Came Back, the emotional crowd had clearly forgotten health authorities\u2019 warnings about not touching their faces. Not long out of her teens, Sydney neo-soul singer Odette brought Tina Turner levels of exuberance (\u201cI\u2019m dancing more than an asthmatic girl should be dancing,\u201d she gasped) to a set that ended with a blistering rendition of Place That I Don\u2019t Know. On Sunday, Jan Fran\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day address was one long glorious Frant delivered in a kitsch yellow muumuu. Its premise, that there is \u201cnothing scarier than a teenage girl with opinions\u201d, was a paean to the Gretas and Malalas of this world, and a good number of teenage boys nodded along in the audience. The magnificently beehived New Zealand-based Canadian soul singer Tami Neilson was another International Women\u2019s Day gift, belting out her rollicking feminist songs and a mic-dropping version of It\u2019s a Man\u2019s Man\u2019s Man\u2019s World that snuck in a new verse: \u201cIt was a woman who discovered stem-cell isolation /And over in New Zealand we\u2019ve got a prime minister who just had a baby while she\u2019s RUNNING THE WHOLE DAMN NATION!\u201d Theatrical folk singer Aldous Harding proved an instant role model for one eight-year-old girl in the audience \u2013 an aspiring singer-songwriter who became so transfixed by the New Zealander\u2019s performance that security let her into the photographer\u2019s pit to watch the rest of the show. Given a key part of Harding\u2019s stage schtick is sustained audience eye contact \u2013 scrutinising us with as much intensity and bemusement as we do her \u2013 it was somewhat of an OH&amp;S fail to place her on a west-facing stage at 5.15pm. Nature had a way of encroaching on many artists\u2019 sets: Pakistani Sufi singer Ustad Saami, a 76-year-old perfectionist and master of a 49-note microtonal scale of which he is the last surviving practitioner, probably didn\u2019t count on a colony of chattering bats hanging over the stage while he performed a 75-minute song designed to mark the end of summer and welcome autumn. And the rather large spider that decided to abseil \u2013 spotlit \u2013 from an overhanging tree branch into the audience during the haunting set of Scottish singer-songwriter Kathryn Joseph only added to the performance\u2019s unsettling gothic beauty, complete with hall-of-mirrors stage props and an open piano whose innards were as exposed as the emotionally raw songs. This year\u2019s outdoor aerial spectacular was the climate catastrophe-themed show As the World Tipped, a reimagining of the 2009 Copenhagen UN climate change summit (it was oddly comforting to hear Kevin Rudd\u2019s and Barack Obama\u2019s voices boomed into the night) and performed by acrobats on a slowly tipping stage that became a horizontal screen suspended 13 metres above the audience. Created by Nigel Jamieson 11 years ago, its \u201cfuturistic\u201d projections of people perishing in a world on fire felt all too real for a nation still processing the trauma of the summer\u2019s bushfire carnage. I didn\u2019t wait to see if it had a happy ending, instead fleeing to an adjacent stage to wig out to Japanese psychedelic five-piece Kikagaku Moyo. Still, this year\u2019s Womadelaide gave us plenty of reasons to look up from our doom-predicting phones: the smiling faces in the all-ages crowd (children 12 and under are given free entry), the almost-full moon gleaming through the canopy of century-old Moreton Bay figs, the blinking faces of local environmentalists projected on to the trees at night by artist Craig Walsh, and the four-metre-high human and animal puppets of France\u2019s Company Archibald Caramantran which danced alongside the audience. French-Tunisian collaboration Ifriqiyya \u00c9lectrique, who combine the sacred sub-Saharan ritual music of Banga with a rush of doom-laden post-industrial cacophony, had the desired effect of possessing some audience members, while also prompting a mass exodus of boomers clutching their fold-up chairs. Luckily they didn\u2019t have to walk far to the next stage where Lu\u00edsa Sobral, the composer of Portugal\u2019s 2017 Eurovision-winning song, was interspersing her melodious ballads with tender stories about octogenarians finding true love. Clearly not everyone received the loved-up memo though, because when I left Botanic Park on Monday night, it was to the strains of expletives being barked by Jason Williamson from curmudgeonly English duo Sleaford Mods. Which, to be fair, perfectly encapsulated my feelings about returning to the real world.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus outbreak has carved more than $5,900 from the average superannuation balance in just a fortnight, new data shows. Data prepared by analysts Morningstar for Guardian Australia shows the fall in the stockmarket since 21 February has reduced the amount held in the most common account type \u2013 the \u201cbalanced\u201d option \u2013 by 5.45%. The falls, which do not include the market\u2019s spectacular tumble on Monday or its rebound on Tuesday, are far worse for other, more aggressive, options. An average super account holds about $107,000 but the actual amounts vary wildly between individuals depending on how long they have been in the workforce and how much they have been paid. Savers who are richer and closer to retirement have also taken a bigger hit in dollar terms because their super funds are usually larger, with more than $18,000 erased over the fortnight from the average $332,700 held by a man between 55-65 who has invested in the balanced option. Super savers can generally choose between a variety of options depending on their appetite for so-called \u201cgrowth assets\u201d \u2013 shares and property \u2013 that carry higher returns but also higher risk. Savers who have chosen a conservative option, which Morningstar defines as one with 20% or less invested in growth assets, have seen their balances shrink by a miniscule 0.89%. But those in \u201caggressive\u201d options, where 80% or more of the assets held by the fund are shares and property, have had more than 10% sliced from their balances. Cautious investors have also benefited from returns from bonds, which have grown by between 1.6% and 2% since the coronavirus outbreak began to rattle markets on 21 February. Even after rebounding on Tuesday morning after US president Donald Trump announced a stimulus package, the benchmark ASX 200 index is down 18.5% since the selling frenzy began. \u201cDiversification helps to smooth out volatility in the market,\u201d Morningstar analyst Michael Malseed said. \u201cThe average balanced fund has a smoother ride than concentrated high growth funds.\u201d However, the punishment meted out to super funds came after an exceptionally good year in 2019. Morningstar\u2019s balanced fund index soared 15.5% over 2019 while the aggressive option reaped a mammoth 23%. Even the conservative option index rose by a healthy 8%. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to put the recent falls of the last fortnight into the context of the strong returns that we saw over 2019,\u201d Malseed said. \u201cThe market has come off fairly high levels.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As the World Health Organisation warned the threat of a global coronavirus pandemic \u201chas become very real\u201d, Australian governments have cautioned they may struggle to keep services running if the health crisis becomes acute. Infections globally have passed 110,000, but the vast majority \u2013 93% \u2013 are in just four countries: China, South Korea, Iran, and Italy. In Australia, 100 people have been confirmed with cases of Covid-19. Three people have died. NSW is the most affected state, with 55 confirmed cases. In Victoria, the state\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, warned that every person had a 50-50 chance of contracting the illness. He said efforts by medical authorities were an attempt to delay the peak of the virus\u2019s spread to July, but he conceded the peak could come as soon as May. He said social distancing measures, including school closures and the possible cancellation of mass gatherings, would continue, but that the pandemic phase would almost certainly be over by Christmas. Victoria has now recorded cases of human-to-human transmission of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19. The premier, Daniel Andrews, gathered his cabinet\u2019s security and emergency management committee to discuss the crisis, including its expected impact on the public sector \u2013 about 310,000 people in the state. \u201cClearly, being able to maintain all forms of public service at a time when our own workforce is likely to be impacted is going to be a challenge,\u201d the Victorian attorney-general, Jill Hennessy, said. Hennessy said the impact of coronavirus on casual workers \u2013 who have no access to sick leave but might be forced to self-isolate \u2013 would also be discussed. \u201cI would hope that people can bring a spirit of pragmatic compassion to all of those challenges,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are in vulnerable employment circumstances, it\u2019s pretty difficult to survive without that funding and I know that\u2019s something that is being discussed at an ongoing level at intergovernmental forums.\u201d Victoria\u2019s dedicated Covid-19 phone line and the Nurse-On-Call Hotline crashed on Tuesday because of an influx of calls, and a former Australian Medical Association head resorted to swabbing patients in a car park. \u201cWe thank the community for their patience as we work to increase the capacity of the hotlines \u2013 including putting on additional staff,\u201d Ambulance Victoria said on Tuesday. Six cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Western Australia, and three coronavirus clinics opened on Tuesday at three hospital. More can be opened on an as-needed basis. The message from the federal government, meanwhile, is \u201cupscaling\u201d. \u201cNow is the moment of pressure, so we\u2019re upscaling, the states are upscaling, the GPs are upscaling,\u201d said the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. That \u201cupscaling\u201d included reviewing travel advisories for Italy, where infection rates have been rapidly rising; diverting staff to the inundated coronavirus information hotline; and ensuring that GPs and hotline operators had clear instructions on where to send people for testing, with many people having been referred to clinics that were not testing for Covid-19. Hunt also acknowledged growing community concerns about precarious or casual workers, for whom the quarantine requirements or a period of prolonged illness may be particularly detrimental. The attorney-general, industrial relations minister, and the chief medical officer had \u201cmet at a round table with employers and employees\u201d to discuss maintenance of those workers and their livelihoods, Hunt said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a very important part of preparedness but also in terms of equity,\u201d he said. He did not discuss the outcomes of that meeting. There were no recommendations yet for a complete lockdown of any areas of Australia, said the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy. Murphy also sought to clarify who should or should not present for testing for the virus. \u201cOur focus at the moment is testing people who are returned travellers who have acute respiratory symptoms, cough sore throat and the like, and contacts of confirmed cases,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment we are not recommending that general members of the community with acute respiratory symptoms \u2013 colds, flu, and the like \u2013 be tested.\u201d He said wider testing might be undertaken if community transmission increased. The ASX steadied to be up by almost 1.2% with two hours of trade left in the day on Tuesday, a dramatic turnaround from the grim picture at the opening of trade, when the benchmark ASX 200 index tumbled 3.7%. US president Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a stimulus package shortly after 10am Australian time reversed what was looking to be a second day of heavy losses. The World Health Organization defines a pandemic as a scenario in which \u201cthe whole world\u2019s population would likely be exposed to this infection and potentially a proportion of them fall sick,\u201d said Michael Ryan, the head of the WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, said. He stressed, \u201ceven if we call it a pandemic, still we can contain it and control it\u201d. \u201cIt would be the first pandemic in history that can be controlled.

      "body": "<p>It has killed thousands, sown widespread fear and disruption and caused the worst day for Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. One man, however, is not panicking about the coronavirus.

One headline on Monday described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/09/coronavirus-is-trumps-chernobyl/\">Trump\u2019s Chernobyl</a>\u201d, a reference to the Soviet nuclear disaster that authorities could not censor away.</p> <p>The commander-in-chief\u2019s past attempts to bend reality to his will have often been met with derision or mirth. But this time it is hardly an exaggeration to say thousands of lives are at stake.

Blair added: \u201cHe\u2019s been quite the germaphobe for many decades. One time I interviewed him he said: \u2018You\u2019re lucky I shook your hand.\u2019 In the election campaign and Oval Office, it was hard for him to not shake hands but we can be sure there was a bottle of Purell nearby.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/us-coronavirus-death-toll-cruise-ship-oakland-florida\">Cruise ship carrying at least 21 with coronavirus docks in California</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has contradicted experts to downplay the coronavirus threat, perhaps not least because it could hurt him in a presidential election year. He has inaccurately claimed that a vaccine will be available soon, that anyone who wants a test can get one and that the virus will be killed off by the spring weather. \u201cA lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat \u2013 as the heat comes in,\u201d he said last month. \u201cTypically, that will go away in April.\u201d</p> <p>And despite years of warnings from scientists that a pandemic would come someday, Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/us-coronavirus-budget-cuts-trump-underprepared\">reduced the the White House national security staff and cut jobs addressing global pandemics</a>. He has sought to portray the coronavirus as a bolt from the blue. \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. \u201cWho would have thought we would even be having the subject?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When reality does not fit, Trump tries to find a workaround. Visiting the CDC while wearing a red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, he suggested he would prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they would not inflate the national total. \u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault ... I\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally.\u201d</p> <p>The blas\u00e9 president spent the weekend playing golf in Florida, then began Monday fundraising for his re-election before making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-white-house-trump-pence-testing\">a fleeting appearance</a> at a White House briefing. On Twitter, he continued to deny the impact of the virus on tumbling stocks: \u201cSaudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!\u201d</p> <p>He also continued to express \u201cnothing to see here\u201d views out of step with the public mood. \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year.

      "bodyText": "It has killed thousands, sown widespread fear and disruption and caused the worst day for Wall Street since the 2008 financial crisis. One man, however, is not panicking about the coronavirus. Donald Trump just spent two successive days on the golf course. Even for a US president who has made a habit of denialism \u2013 from global heating to the size of Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration crowd \u2013 the current crisis is raising the bar. One headline on Monday described it as \u201cTrump\u2019s Chernobyl\u201d, a reference to the Soviet nuclear disaster that authorities could not censor away. The commander-in-chief\u2019s past attempts to bend reality to his will have often been met with derision or mirth. But this time it is hardly an exaggeration to say thousands of lives are at stake. The international crisis that many feared would test his norm-busting presidency has arrived. \u201cDenial, accusation, distraction, lies \u2013 these are his four principal responses to any rival,\u201d said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer. \u201cOnly this time it\u2019s not a person. When you think of that model, it doesn\u2019t work with germs. A tweet doesn\u2019t knock over a potential global pandemic.\u201d At a Fox News town hall last week, Trump was reminded that he is a \u201cself-proclaimed germaphobe\u201d. Blair added: \u201cHe\u2019s been quite the germaphobe for many decades. One time I interviewed him he said: \u2018You\u2019re lucky I shook your hand.\u2019 In the election campaign and Oval Office, it was hard for him to not shake hands but we can be sure there was a bottle of Purell nearby.\u201d Trump has contradicted experts to downplay the coronavirus threat, perhaps not least because it could hurt him in a presidential election year. He has inaccurately claimed that a vaccine will be available soon, that anyone who wants a test can get one and that the virus will be killed off by the spring weather. \u201cA lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat \u2013 as the heat comes in,\u201d he said last month. \u201cTypically, that will go away in April.\u201d And despite years of warnings from scientists that a pandemic would come someday, Trump has reduced the the White House national security staff and cut jobs addressing global pandemics. He has sought to portray the coronavirus as a bolt from the blue. \u201cWho would have thought?\u201d he asked during a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. \u201cWho would have thought we would even be having the subject?\u2019\u201d When reality does not fit, Trump tries to find a workaround. Visiting the CDC while wearing a red \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, he suggested he would prefer that people exposed to the virus on a cruise ship be left aboard so they would not inflate the national total. \u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault ... I\u2019d rather have them stay on, personally.\u201d The blas\u00e9 president spent the weekend playing golf in Florida, then began Monday fundraising for his re-election before making a fleeting appearance at a White House briefing. On Twitter, he continued to deny the impact of the virus on tumbling stocks: \u201cSaudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That, and the Fake News, is the reason for the market drop!\u201d He also continued to express \u201cnothing to see here\u201d views out of step with the public mood. \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\u201d Trump has also accused Democrats of seeking to exploit the virus for political gain. Such comments have caused dismay among public health officials. Critics say the president is clearly out of his depth. Rick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project and author of Everything Trump Touches Dies, said: \u201cWhen Trump is confronted with something that doesn\u2019t follow him on Twitter, that doesn\u2019t watch him on Fox News and doesn\u2019t come to his rallies, he\u2019s lost. \u201cTrump is a day trader. He runs out every morning and throws whatever he\u2019s got in his head against the wall. It does not do the country a service when he is strongly inclined to believe his own bullshit.\u201d Wilson, who has experience in crisis management, described the president\u2019s response so far as \u201cthe usual Trumpian irresponsibility and mendacity in one package\u201d. He added: \u201cPresidents get judged not on the easy stuff but the hard stuff. He\u2019s going to have people judging him on how he\u2019s handled this. He has not inspired confidence.\u201d Trump previously appeared blas\u00e9 and uncaring when Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico. He memorably tossed paper towels into a crowd. But the coronavirus is on another scale altogether. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: \u201cTrump has had a history of defying political conventions but the game is up. He has made a colossal mistake with how he\u2019s handling the coronavirus. He has put himself front and centre. \u201cHe has belittled experts, his administration has not made adequate preparations and he undermined existing precautions and steps that had been taken for just this emergency. His fingerprints are all over this.\u201d Jacobs added: \u201cTrump appears disconnected from reality.

Clearly you have Stockholm syndrome.</p> <p>One thing you will learn when working from home is that you\u2019ll be amazed what kinds of foods actually go together. Home-workers are born survivalists. We can create a snack out of almost anything in the fridge or cupboard if it means not having to go to the shop. While I\u2019ve been writing this, I\u2019ve been absentmindedly dipping cream crackers into a tub of Philadelphia. Later I\u2019ll probably have some leftover anchovies on a crumpet, or a pear smeared in peanut butter. You know you\u2019ve hit the jackpot, however, when it\u2019s cold curry eaten barefoot straight from the fridge \u2013 for breakfast.</p> <p>Also, get a slow cooker. You can have a delicious dinner ready for when your partner/children/flatmates return home with minimal effort, impressing them while aiding them in overlooking the full sink of washing up you simply didn\u2019t get round to because you spent the afternoon watching a nature documentary about krill (all nature documentaries are ultimately about krill). Your family still, by the way, won\u2019t believe that you have a real job. They never will. Accepting this now will save you a lot of strife in the long run, as will the fact that your parents will always phone you for \u201ca natter\u201d at 2pm under the assumption that you\u2019re not busy. You will bond with them in new ways as a result.</p> <p>Tedious bores will tell you that you need a designated workspace in order to work from home, but this shows a tragic lack of imagination. Why not take advantage of your entire living space? Answer some emails on the toilet, do some spreadsheets in bed, then hop over to the sofa for a bit of a change of scene. Regular trips to the kitchen for hot drinks and snacks help to mix it up a bit. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be home-working in hot weather, invest in a wifi connection that reaches to the back garden or balcony. That way you can sunbathe while occasionally refreshing your email.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/25/extreme-loneliness-or-the-perfect-balance-how-to-work-from-home-and-stay-healthy\">Extreme loneliness or the perfect balance? How to work from home and stay healthy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for workwear: forget getting dressed properly, wear whatever feels good. Some veterans will advocate a full pyjama; that is their right. Personally I prefer a get-up that I refer to as \u201cfool\u2019s pyjamas\u201d: leggings, slipper socks, some form of T-shirt, cardigan. It just about passes as being daywear when you venture to the shop or answer the door to accept your neighbours\u2019 Amazon packages (it\u2019s too late for me, but I cannot stress enough how you must absolutely never, ever agree to accept your neighbours\u2019 parcels. Within a fortnight of working from home you will have become known as your neighbourhood\u2019s local parcel depot). Consider investing in some tracksuit bottoms or lounge pants. If you manage to remember to brush your hair by lunchtime, then you\u2019re basically winning. If you absolutely must, because you have a Skype meeting or something, you may get dressed from the waist up. Just make sure not to forget when you stand to fetch yourself a glass of water mid-meeting.</p> <p>Self-care is important, and it is vital that home-workers and the self-employed remember that. Nap as much as you need, it acts as a sort of cognitive refresher. You could also probably stand to do some exercise. I like a nice lunchtime swim, an online yoga class, or a go on the exercise bike. Working from home provides an excellent opportunity to spend time on your hobbies, whether that is making your own chutney, practising guitar, or creating your own oatmeal face-masks. Remember that if you\u2019re at the point where you are googling the weather, it\u2019s probably time to go outside (besides, you\u2019ll need to stock up, as when friends visit, it is only acceptable to ask them to bring you a total of three items, not your entire weekly shop). You have to leave the house sooner or later, if only to note that the world basically has nothing to offer, before you retreat again indoors. Welcome to a brave new world, my friends. All you need to do now is work out an acceptable time at which to start drinking.</p> <p>\u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author</p>",

We can create a snack out of almost anything in the fridge or cupboard if it means not having to go to the shop. While I\u2019ve been writing this, I\u2019ve been absentmindedly dipping cream crackers into a tub of Philadelphia. Later I\u2019ll probably have some leftover anchovies on a crumpet, or a pear smeared in peanut butter. You know you\u2019ve hit the jackpot, however, when it\u2019s cold curry eaten barefoot straight from the fridge \u2013 for breakfast. Also, get a slow cooker. You can have a delicious dinner ready for when your partner/children/flatmates return home with minimal effort, impressing them while aiding them in overlooking the full sink of washing up you simply didn\u2019t get round to because you spent the afternoon watching a nature documentary about krill (all nature documentaries are ultimately about krill). Your family still, by the way, won\u2019t believe that you have a real job. They never will. Accepting this now will save you a lot of strife in the long run, as will the fact that your parents will always phone you for \u201ca natter\u201d at 2pm under the assumption that you\u2019re not busy. You will bond with them in new ways as a result. Tedious bores will tell you that you need a designated workspace in order to work from home, but this shows a tragic lack of imagination. Why not take advantage of your entire living space? Answer some emails on the toilet, do some spreadsheets in bed, then hop over to the sofa for a bit of a change of scene. Regular trips to the kitchen for hot drinks and snacks help to mix it up a bit. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be home-working in hot weather, invest in a wifi connection that reaches to the back garden or balcony. That way you can sunbathe while occasionally refreshing your email. As for workwear: forget getting dressed properly, wear whatever feels good. Some veterans will advocate a full pyjama; that is their right. Personally I prefer a get-up that I refer to as \u201cfool\u2019s pyjamas\u201d: leggings, slipper socks, some form of T-shirt, cardigan. It just about passes as being daywear when you venture to the shop or answer the door to accept your neighbours\u2019 Amazon packages (it\u2019s too late for me, but I cannot stress enough how you must absolutely never, ever agree to accept your neighbours\u2019 parcels. Within a fortnight of working from home you will have become known as your neighbourhood\u2019s local parcel depot). Consider investing in some tracksuit bottoms or lounge pants. If you manage to remember to brush your hair by lunchtime, then you\u2019re basically winning. If you absolutely must, because you have a Skype meeting or something, you may get dressed from the waist up. Just make sure not to forget when you stand to fetch yourself a glass of water mid-meeting. Self-care is important, and it is vital that home-workers and the self-employed remember that. Nap as much as you need, it acts as a sort of cognitive refresher. You could also probably stand to do some exercise. I like a nice lunchtime swim, an online yoga class, or a go on the exercise bike. Working from home provides an excellent opportunity to spend time on your hobbies, whether that is making your own chutney, practising guitar, or creating your own oatmeal face-masks. Remember that if you\u2019re at the point where you are googling the weather, it\u2019s probably time to go outside (besides, you\u2019ll need to stock up, as when friends visit, it is only acceptable to ask them to bring you a total of three items, not your entire weekly shop). You have to leave the house sooner or later, if only to note that the world basically has nothing to offer, before you retreat again indoors. Welcome to a brave new world, my friends. All you need to do now is work out an acceptable time at which to start drinking. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist and author",

Checkpoints on motorways, toll booths, train stations and airports are expected to be introduced on Tuesday. Those who have to leave their region or their cities out of serious necessity can do so only if they have self-certification stating that they must cross the borders for compelling business reasons, health reasons, or because they have to return home. On Sunday, the whole of Lombardy, including the financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, were shut down until 3 April, as Italy experienced its highest day-on-day rise in deaths from coronavirus. The country was plunged into chaos after details of the plan were leaked to the press, sending thousands into panic as they tried to flee. Thousands crowded train stations or jumped into their cars after a draft decree banning people from leaving or entering the region was revealed by Corriere della Sera late on Saturday afternoon.

I am very, very worried about the impact the virus will have on our health system.\u201d There are about 500 available beds for intensive care in Lombardy\u2019s public health sphere, with another 160 in private care facilities. Despite a massive effort to locate additional space there are still not enough.",

Checkpoints on motorways, toll booths, train stations and airports are expected to be introduced today. \u201cThere is no more time. I will take responsibility for these measures. Our future is in our hands,\u201d Conte said. The government has told people to \u201cstay at home\u201d and banned all public gatherings. \u201cWe need to change our lifestyle.

The US president suggested his administration was proposing measures for hourly wage earners to ensure they can take time off, loans for small businesses, and tax relief.</p> \n<p>Anyone arriving in the UK from Italy should self-isolate for two weeks, UK officials have warned. Within a fortnight the government is set to advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/matt-hancock-under-fire-from-mps-over-uk-coronavirus-response\">self-isolate for seven days</a>. There is reassuring evidence that the 14-day self-isolation and quarantine measures being adopted around the world are striking the right balance, because people still carrying the virus can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-sufferers-symptom-free-for-five-days-on-average-study\">appear to be symptom-free for an average of up to five days</a>.

It is a crucial test for Bernie Sanders, the other main contender, who is battling to reverse the momentum Biden gained on Super Tuesday a week ago. If an ageing rocker\u2019s endorsement counts for anything then Neil Young has enthusiastically offered his to Sanders, declaring: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/neil-young-endorses-bernie-sanders-every-point-he-makes-is-what-i-believe-in\">\u201cEvery point he makes is what I believe in.\u201d</a> The Sanders campaign has been working hard across Michigan, which has the most delegates of any of the voting states today.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Boy marooned in hospital \u2013 </strong>A disabled 10-year-old boy has been living for nearly a year on an acute NHS medical ward because the local council has failed to find appropriate accommodation for his family, the Guardian has learned. Ahmed has cerebral palsy and scoliosis, is fed through a tube and is registered blind. He was admitted to the Royal Manchester children\u2019s hospital on 1 March 2019 and after six weeks was well enough to be discharged. But his hospitalisation has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/09/severely-disabled-boy-stuck-in-acute-nhs-bed-for-nearly-a-year\">ended up costing taxpayers at least \u00a3115,000</a> when a three-bedroom home nearby would cost about \u00a310,200 a year. His parents and sisters, who have sought asylum, have been living in a one-bedroom flat at Ronald McDonald House. A Manchester council spokesperson said: \u201cA very specific type of property is required by the family \u2026 we will continue to work with the family to try to find a property that will meet their priority needs.\u201d The hospital trust declined to comment.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Endometriosis link to body shape \u2013 </strong>Girls who are tall and lean in childhood may be more at risk of later developing endometriosis, the painful, often debilitating condition in which womb tissue grows elsewhere in the body. Researchers made the findings after studying decades of data from Denmark on children\u2019s height and weight at 13 years of age, then correlating it with hospital data from the age of 15 onwards. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/10/women-who-were-tall-and-lean-in-childhood-more-at-risk-of-endometriosis-study\">Body size during these ages is an indicator for later risk</a>,\u201d said Dr Jennifer Baker, a co-author of the research from the University of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg hospital in Denmark. \u201cIt really tells us that the roots of this disease lie earlier in life than people have previously thought.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Light shed on Saudi royal intrigue \u2013 </strong>The arrests in Saudi Arabia of two leading royals followed discussions between the two men about using the \u201callegiance council\u201d, led by one of them, to block Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s accession to the throne, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/arrested-saudi-royals-allegedly-aimed-to-block-crown-princes-accession\">Martin Chulov writes this morning</a>. The council exists to ensure a smooth transition of power and was instrumental in securing Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince in 2017. Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, who is believed to have voted against him, was arrested along with the former crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, on what are thought to be treason charges. The murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in late 2018 remains a potent issue for the crown prince\u2019s critics, many of whom claim he lacks the judgment or temperament to become leader.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Seagrass looks greener \u2013 </strong>Lost underwater meadows are being resurrected along Britain\u2019s coast that promise to capture carbon emissions and harbour marine life.

Oil prices also bounced back from a record-setting fall. Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark jumped 1.8%, Sydney added 1.2% and Shanghai climbed 0.6%. Shares edged slightly lower in Tokyo and Seoul after bouncing in and out of negative territory. Brent crude, the basis for international oil prices, gained 6.7% but still was down by nearly half from its January peak.

People will only be able to travel between cities for emergency reasons and can face fines and up to three months in jail for breaking quarantine rules. Checkpoints on motorways, toll booths, train stations and airports are expected to be introduced today. \u201cThere is no more time. I will take responsibility for these measures. Our future is in our hands,\u201d Conte said. The government has told people to \u201cstay at home\u201d and banned all public gatherings. \u201cWe need to change our lifestyle. We need to change it now \u2026 We cannot let meetings become occasions of contagion,\u201d Conte warned. Italy is struggling to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of Covid-19, which has claimed 463 lives and infected 9,172 people there. In the US, Donald Trump has said he will today announce \u201cmajor\u201d measures to protect the US economy after global markets went into freefall. The US president suggested his administration was proposing measures for hourly wage earners to ensure they can take time off, loans for small businesses, and tax relief. Anyone arriving in the UK from Italy should self-isolate for two weeks, UK officials have warned. Within a fortnight the government is set to advise anyone with a fever or a mild respiratory tract infection to self-isolate for seven days. There is reassuring evidence that the 14-day self-isolation and quarantine measures being adopted around the world are striking the right balance, because people still carrying the virus can appear to be symptom-free for an average of up to five days. More developments throughout Tuesday at our live blog. * * * Sequel Tuesday \u2013 Joe Biden will aim to cement his position as frontrunner for the Democratic nomination today as millions of voters in six states have their say in primary contests ahead of the US presidential election. It is a crucial test for Bernie Sanders, the other main contender, who is battling to reverse the momentum Biden gained on Super Tuesday a week ago. If an ageing rocker\u2019s endorsement counts for anything then Neil Young has enthusiastically offered his to Sanders, declaring: \u201cEvery point he makes is what I believe in.\u201d The Sanders campaign has been working hard across Michigan, which has the most delegates of any of the voting states today. * * * Boy marooned in hospital \u2013 A disabled 10-year-old boy has been living for nearly a year on an acute NHS medical ward because the local council has failed to find appropriate accommodation for his family, the Guardian has learned. Ahmed has cerebral palsy and scoliosis, is fed through a tube and is registered blind. He was admitted to the Royal Manchester children\u2019s hospital on 1 March 2019 and after six weeks was well enough to be discharged. But his hospitalisation has ended up costing taxpayers at least \u00a3115,000 when a three-bedroom home nearby would cost about \u00a310,200 a year. His parents and sisters, who have sought asylum, have been living in a one-bedroom flat at Ronald McDonald House. A Manchester council spokesperson said: \u201cA very specific type of property is required by the family \u2026 we will continue to work with the family to try to find a property that will meet their priority needs.\u201d The hospital trust declined to comment. * * * Endometriosis link to body shape \u2013 Girls who are tall and lean in childhood may be more at risk of later developing endometriosis, the painful, often debilitating condition in which womb tissue grows elsewhere in the body. Researchers made the findings after studying decades of data from Denmark on children\u2019s height and weight at 13 years of age, then correlating it with hospital data from the age of 15 onwards. \u201cBody size during these ages is an indicator for later risk,\u201d said Dr Jennifer Baker, a co-author of the research from the University of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg hospital in Denmark. \u201cIt really tells us that the roots of this disease lie earlier in life than people have previously thought.\u201d * * * Light shed on Saudi royal intrigue \u2013 The arrests in Saudi Arabia of two leading royals followed discussions between the two men about using the \u201callegiance council\u201d, led by one of them, to block Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s accession to the throne, Martin Chulov writes this morning. The council exists to ensure a smooth transition of power and was instrumental in securing Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince in 2017. Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, who is believed to have voted against him, was arrested along with the former crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, on what are thought to be treason charges. The murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in late 2018 remains a potent issue for the crown prince\u2019s critics, many of whom claim he lacks the judgment or temperament to become leader. * * * Seagrass looks greener \u2013 Lost underwater meadows are being resurrected along Britain\u2019s coast that promise to capture carbon emissions and harbour marine life. The seagrass meadows were once common but more than 90% have been lost to pollution-fed algae, anchor damage and port and marina building. The meadows store carbon 35 times faster than tropical rainforests and harbour up to 40 times more marine life than seabeds without grass. The Seagrass Ocean Rescue project will ultimately place 20km of rope laden with bags carrying a million seagrass seeds on the shallow seafloor, where they will sprout through the bags and restore the habitat.

Lunchtime read: \u2018Felt like intentional torture\u2019 It has been two years since the government apologised for the Windrush scandal and promised to rectify the injustices. Yet those affected are still being failed by the Home Office \u2013 with some remaining destitute, writes Amelia Gentleman. Sport This week, despite the shadow cast by the coronavirus and much uncertainty in recent days over whether it would happen at all, the Cheltenham Festival takes place. But the outbreak of the virus continues to impact other areas of sport, with all domestic sporting activity at all levels in Italy suspended until 3 April at the earliest, the Champions League game between PSG and Borussia Dortmund to be played behind closed doors, the tennis event at Indian Wells cancelled and Ireland\u2019s Six Nations match in France called off. The EFL has told the government that some clubs fear going out of business if games have to be played behind closed doors, the Guardian understands. The Premier League is as yet unaffected though, and Harvey Barnes and Jamie Vardy both scored twice as Leicester hammered Aston Villa 4-0 at the King Power Stadium. Phil Neville has praised Ellen White after the England striker came to the Lionesses\u2019 rescue in New Jersey against Japan in the SheBelieves Cup. And Joe Marler is facing a season-ending suspension after he was cited for grabbing Alun Wyn Jones\u2019s genitals during England\u2019s Six Nations win over Wales. Business Asian stock markets have taken a breather with several regional benchmarks gaining more than 1% after New York futures reversed on news that Donald Trump plans to ask Congress for a tax cut and other quick measures as a buffer against coronavirus. Oil prices also bounced back from a record-setting fall. Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark jumped 1.8%, Sydney added 1.2% and Shanghai climbed 0.6%. Shares edged slightly lower in Tokyo and Seoul after bouncing in and out of negative territory. Brent crude, the basis for international oil prices, gained 6.7% but still was down by nearly half from its January peak. The pound is at $1.304 and \u20ac1.148 while at time of writing the FTSE is tracking higher ahead of the open.

I use \u201cnoises\u201d advisedly \u2013 none of Boris Johnson\u2019s announcements ascend to the status of explanation or argument. Instead, just an emollient chuntering, that it will be better if we don\u2019t panic. School closures, by definition dramatic, are the opposite of keeping calm and carrying on. Ultimately, though, positive self-talk is not an effective response to a potential pandemic.</p> \n<p>There is nothing to suggest that the disease will avoid the same trajectory here as in northern Italy. The chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/04/prof-chris-whitty-the-expert-we-need-in-the-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">Prof Chris Whitty</a>, has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/uk-two-more-patients-in-england-test-positive-for-coronavirus\" title=\"\">warned</a> that closing schools may be necessary \u201cfor quite a long time, probably more than two months\u201d.

A decade ago <a href=\"https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2020/03/the-economic-effects-of-pandemic.html\" title=\"\">Simon Wren-Lewis</a> found that such a virus could reduce GDP by \u201ca few percentage points\u201d in the first quarter. But \u201cif schools close for around four weeks, that can multiply the GDP impacts \u2026 by as much as a factor of three, and if they close for a whole quarter by twice that.\u201d All things considered, he believes the GDP effect with schools closed for three months would be a loss of just under 5%; the greatest impact under every model he tried would be 6%.</p> \n<p>Yet as the markets go into freefall and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/08/oil-price-to-plunge-as-much-as-20-as-saudis-vow-to-step-up-production\" title=\"\">oil price tumbles</a>, economists discuss every possible factor, so long as they relate to us as producers and consumers. From panic buying and panic not-buying, to dislocations in supply and demand as the virus hits different countries at different times, and governments respond with varying efficacy, to sectoral analyses of tourism, manufacturing and leisure. But the reality is, whatever crisis comes will be mediated not through our wallets but through our homes: who are we caring for, and for how long?</p> \n<p>Single parents in work would be worst and fastest hit, and a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/single-parents-child-poverty-charity-uk-charity-children-food-health-money-finance-benefits-a8221741.html\" title=\"\">third of children</a> in these families already live in poverty.

There\u2019s a real tendency, especially among mothers, to mask how close to capacity they run, having a full-time job and young children \u2013 and for good reason, because the discrimination they face, both overt (unfair dismissal) and subtle (lack of progression) is well documented. But the regular fray of day-to-day crises, minutely avoided and privately smoothed over, will turn into something quite different when everyone is facing the same crisis, and it\u2019s continuous.</p> \n<p>The response will break one of two ways, though possibly both simultaneously: a scramble for someone to blame, and given the government\u2019s probity it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll have to look far; but also a recognition of how many apparently private struggles are, in fact, collective. This has so far only considered the generation in the active workforce, not the grandparents \u2013 who may themselves be relying on informal familial care \u2013 and the children, for whom virus season ends just as exam season begins.</p> \n<p>This will force a new perspective on old conversations. After a decade of considering citizenship only in terms of economic activity \u2013 whether you work and how hard \u2013 the reality will land of how few sole traders there actually are in society. Almost all of us are in a nexus of need and care, keeping the economy afloat with a doggedness that could never be monetised; and nobody would ever think to count until it ground to a halt.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Most other options are completely unaffordable on an average income. Grandparents often step in for the regular holidays \u2013 60% look after their grandchildren after school or outside term time \u2013 but to close a school to contain a virus, then send the children to be looked after by the group it most affects, would feel wrong even for the most desperate parent. Currently, the noises emanating from government are that schools will hopefully not have to close, and large gatherings do not yet need to be cancelled. I use \u201cnoises\u201d advisedly \u2013 none of Boris Johnson\u2019s announcements ascend to the status of explanation or argument. Instead, just an emollient chuntering, that it will be better if we don\u2019t panic. School closures, by definition dramatic, are the opposite of keeping calm and carrying on. Ultimately, though, positive self-talk is not an effective response to a potential pandemic. There is nothing to suggest that the disease will avoid the same trajectory here as in northern Italy. The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has already warned that closing schools may be necessary \u201cfor quite a long time, probably more than two months\u201d. His credentials put him in pole position to make predictions at a time of unknowns, and it is worth noting his emphasis \u2013 he\u2019s not saying this will happen, only that it will be considered. Yet he, along with every known commentator, puts school closures in a category with cancelling major sports events and large cultural gatherings. And every parent is listening to that open-mouthed, thinking there is no possible comparison between eight unexpected weeks of childcare, and postponing the Six Nations Ireland v Italy showdown. Economists have modelled the effects of a pandemic. A decade ago Simon Wren-Lewis found that such a virus could reduce GDP by \u201ca few percentage points\u201d in the first quarter. But \u201cif schools close for around four weeks, that can multiply the GDP impacts \u2026 by as much as a factor of three, and if they close for a whole quarter by twice that.\u201d All things considered, he believes the GDP effect with schools closed for three months would be a loss of just under 5%; the greatest impact under every model he tried would be 6%. Yet as the markets go into freefall and the oil price tumbles, economists discuss every possible factor, so long as they relate to us as producers and consumers. From panic buying and panic not-buying, to dislocations in supply and demand as the virus hits different countries at different times, and governments respond with varying efficacy, to sectoral analyses of tourism, manufacturing and leisure. But the reality is, whatever crisis comes will be mediated not through our wallets but through our homes: who are we caring for, and for how long? Single parents in work would be worst and fastest hit, and a third of children in these families already live in poverty. Eligible employees are allowed to ask for parental leave but it is unpaid, and generally limited to four weeks for each child. Naturally that\u2019s based on secure employment, which given the growth of zero-hours contracts is a bold assumption. Ninety percent of single-parent households in the UK are headed by women, and single mothers are more likely than fathers to be living with school-age children. In a standard double-breadwinner model, it may make more sense for the parent with the most precarious work to take the least time off, but a competing imperative will be that public sector workers \u2013 likely to be in more secure jobs \u2013 will come under intense pressure to keep the show on the road, especially in health and other essential services. Closures would immediately expose how many people are relying on school, not just for the core hours but for the wraparound time and the free school meals. There\u2019s a real tendency, especially among mothers, to mask how close to capacity they run, having a full-time job and young children \u2013 and for good reason, because the discrimination they face, both overt (unfair dismissal) and subtle (lack of progression) is well documented. But the regular fray of day-to-day crises, minutely avoided and privately smoothed over, will turn into something quite different when everyone is facing the same crisis, and it\u2019s continuous. The response will break one of two ways, though possibly both simultaneously: a scramble for someone to blame, and given the government\u2019s probity it\u2019s likely we\u2019ll have to look far; but also a recognition of how many apparently private struggles are, in fact, collective. This has so far only considered the generation in the active workforce, not the grandparents \u2013 who may themselves be relying on informal familial care \u2013 and the children, for whom virus season ends just as exam season begins. This will force a new perspective on old conversations. After a decade of considering citizenship only in terms of economic activity \u2013 whether you work and how hard \u2013 the reality will land of how few sole traders there actually are in society. Almost all of us are in a nexus of need and care, keeping the economy afloat with a doggedness that could never be monetised; and nobody would ever think to count until it ground to a halt. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

She emigrated to the United States as a teenager and from 1900 started working as a cook for wealthy New York families.</p> <p>A pattern emerged. Her employers and other domestic staff members became feverish and nauseous \u2013 stricken with typhoid, some fatally \u2013 while Mallon, busy in the kitchen, remained healthy. Oblivious to her infection, she would move on to another household.</p> <p>In 1906 Mallon cooked for the family of Charles Henry Warren, a banker, at their rented house in Oyster Bay, Long Island. When six of the 11 people in the household fell ill, the owners hired George Soper, a civil engineer, to investigate.</p> <p>Through a process of elimination he tracked down Mallon as the source \u2013 the US\u2019s first confirmed asymptomatic carrier of the disease. Seven of eight families she had worked for had become infected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e831238e8ef6656a7167ef055816ba4a0ea85eb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e831238e8ef6656a7167ef055816ba4a0ea85eb0/0_0_3475_2380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Mallon, known as Typhoid Mary, in a photo circa the 1900s after she was institutionalized on Brother Island, where she stayed from 1914 until her death in 1938.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Mallon, known as Typhoid Mary, in a photo circa the 1900s after she was institutionalized on North Brother Island, where she stayed from 1914 until her death in 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann Archive</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mallon denied any responsibility and reputedly rebuffed Soper\u2019s request for stool and urine samples by brandishing a carving fork.

An official who had to sit on her in the ambulance compared it to being <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/media-frenzy-an-irishman-s-diary-on-mary-mallon-typhoid-mary-1.4026388\">\u201cin a cage with an angry lion\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Mallon insisted she was healthy and felt unjustly held in isolation at a clinic on North Brother Island. After three years, in 1910, she was released on condition she no longer cook.</p> <p>Mallon worked in laundries but the pay was poor so she changed her name to Mary Brown and resumed working in kitchens, including the Sloane Hospital for Women.

      "bodyText": "Mary Mallon was a super-spreader before the term existed, a disease carrier so notorious she acquired a celebrity nickname: Typhoid Mary. Mallon showed no symptoms but was infected with typhoid and triggered multiple outbreaks in New York at the turn of the 20th century. She was a cook for affluent families, and everywhere that Mallon went the bacterial infection followed, sickening one household after another. In 1907 a medical researcher identified her, leading to Mallon being forcibly quarantined for the rest of her life on North Brother Island, a containment site on New York\u2019s East River. She died in 1938, aged 69, vilified in folk memory as \u201cthe most dangerous woman in America\u201d, a patient zero who needed to be isolated and locked up, a de facto prisoner, until death. A century later it is the turn of cruise ship passengers, air travellers and millions of people in Italy, China and other countries to be quarantined \u2013 temporarily \u2013 in the battle to control coronavirus. Measures range from pleas for social distancing and self-isolation to travel restrictions, bans on public gatherings and strict surveillance. A church congregation at the centre of an outbreak in South Korea has been accused of murder. In some parts of China there are rewards for informing on sick neighbours. China\u2019s drastic measures seem to be working, fuelling debate about how far to curb individual liberty in order to protect public health. Mallon\u2019s fate offers a cautionary tale about getting the balance wrong, according to scholars who started revisiting her case in the wake of HIV, Sars and other epidemics. They cast Mallon, an Irish immigrant, as a victim of public hysteria and official overreach, a woman who committed no crime but ended up incarcerated and dehumanised as a metaphor for contagion. \u201cIt is very difficult for most healthy Americans to envision themselves as the ones whose liberty might be threatened in the effort to protect the health of the community,\u201d Judith Leavitt, a historian, wrote in her book Typhoid Mary: Captive to the Public\u2019s Health. Mallon was born in 1869 in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She emigrated to the United States as a teenager and from 1900 started working as a cook for wealthy New York families. A pattern emerged. Her employers and other domestic staff members became feverish and nauseous \u2013 stricken with typhoid, some fatally \u2013 while Mallon, busy in the kitchen, remained healthy. Oblivious to her infection, she would move on to another household. In 1906 Mallon cooked for the family of Charles Henry Warren, a banker, at their rented house in Oyster Bay, Long Island. When six of the 11 people in the household fell ill, the owners hired George Soper, a civil engineer, to investigate. Through a process of elimination he tracked down Mallon as the source \u2013 the US\u2019s first confirmed asymptomatic carrier of the disease. Seven of eight families she had worked for had become infected. Mallon denied any responsibility and reputedly rebuffed Soper\u2019s request for stool and urine samples by brandishing a carving fork. After Soper published his results in the Journal of the American Medical Association authorities detained her. She did not go quietly. Five policemen were involved in her capture. An official who had to sit on her in the ambulance compared it to being \u201cin a cage with an angry lion\u201d. Mallon insisted she was healthy and felt unjustly held in isolation at a clinic on North Brother Island. After three years, in 1910, she was released on condition she no longer cook. Mallon worked in laundries but the pay was poor so she changed her name to Mary Brown and resumed working in kitchens, including the Sloane Hospital for Women. It had a typhoid outbreak in 1915. Mallon was exposed and returned to quarantine for the rest of her life, linked to dozens of infections and three deaths. Lurid rumours claimed she had infected thousands. On the island she was frequently tested and prodded but left largely ignorant about her condition. \u201cI have been in fact a peep show for everybody,\u201d she wrote in a letter. \u201cEven the interns had to come to see me and ask about the facts already known to the whole wide world. The tuberculosis men would say \u2018There she is, the kidnapped woman\u2019.\u201d Mallon\u2019s refusal to recognise the danger she posed to others, and act responsibly, put authorities in a difficult position. However, Leavitt and other scholars believe that as a poor, unmarried Irish immigrant, and a woman, she suffered prejudice not shown to other asymptomatic typhoid carriers, including some who infected more people than Mallon but were quarantined for only a few weeks. Today workers in service industries across the world face a choice about whether to stop working as a precaution against coronavirus \u2013 and possibly forfeit pay and health insurance. In a 2001 book the late television chef Anthony Bourdain defended Mallon as a kindred rebel spirit who worked because she needed to work. \u201cCooks work sick. They always have. Most jobs, you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get paid. You wake up with a sniffle and a runny nose, a sore throat? You soldier on \u2026 it\u2019s a point of pride, working through pain and illness.\u201d",

But, disinformation experts say, there remains little evidence of concerted efforts to spread falsehoods about the virus, suggesting that the misleading information in circulation is spread primarily through grassroots chatter. For now, the health service\u2019s efforts are focused on spreading accurate information about how to treat and prevent the virus, which causes the disease Covid-19. NHS England has been \u201cfighting bad advice and misinformation about the virus in the media and online, working with Twitter to suspend a false account posing as a hospital and putting out inaccurate information about the number of coronavirus cases, and publicly condemning homeopaths promoting false treatments\u201d, a spokesperson said on Tuesday. The organisation is also working with social media companies to verify more than 800 accounts belonging to NHS organisations, including hospital trusts and local commissioning groups, in order to ensure that users know where to find trustworthy information. It has already partnered with Google, Twitter and Facebook to ensure that members of the public searching for news about the virus are given the option of finding accurate information on the NHS website. In a statement, Facebook\u2019s vice-president for Northern Europe, Steve Hatch, said the company was \u201cdetermined\u201d to ensure users \u201ccan access credible and accurate information\u201d. Pointing to the way searches of relevant material on Facebook and Instagram trigger pop-up information from the NHS, he added: \u201cWe\u2019re also removing false claims and conspiracy theories which have been flagged by leading health organisations and that could cause harm to people who believe them.\u201d Despite the prevalence of false claims about the virus, there is slim evidence of a concerted effort to spread misinformation.

      "bodyText": "While frontline healthcare workers fighting the US coronavirus outbreak continue to struggle with what they have called a dramatic lack of preparedness, ever-shifting guidelines on treatment are raising concerns that America\u2019s response is dangerously inconsistent. Nurses working amid this outbreak \u2013 which continues to see increasing numbers of diagnoses and deaths \u2013 maintain that the guidelines keep shifting due to fluid federal mandates and continued staffing and supply shortages. Of more than 6,500 nurses across 48 states, Washington DC and the Virgin Islands recently surveyed by National Nurses United (NNU), just 44% said their employers had given them information on novel coronavirus and \u201chow to recognize and respond to possible cases\u201d. A mere 63% of nurses surveyed had access to N95 masks in their divisions, while just 27% had access to powered air purifying respirators. Less than one-third \u2013 30% \u2013 of survey participants reported that their employers had enough personal protective equipment (PPE) in stock should there be a quick upswing in potential coronavirus patients. An emergency room nurse at a private hospital in New York City\u2019s Bronx borough told the Guardian last week that access to certain respirators had been curtailed, and said available masks would not necessarily fit. \u201cWe are starting to see all the hospitals get in line to undermine the precautions that should be in place,\u201d said David Pratt, a New York State Nurses Association health and safety representative, explaining the growing pushback against inconsistent information. \u201cThere are different things being said.\u201d Pratt claimed that a whistleblower told his organization that healthcare employers were pushing the federal public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to loosen protection guidelines \u2013 which, in turn, would change them. \u201cIt\u2019s not just coronavirus, but a virus that can spread through contact as well as through droplets,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cEmployers have been pushing to get the CDC to back off on the requirement that, for example, the nurses and other staff use N95 respirators.\u201d Some employers want healthcare staff to reuse N95 masks, a particular type of mask.

Residents without stable housing cannot follow the basic recommendations of self-quarantining when needed, and they can also struggle to access water for handwashing.</p> <p>\u201cYou can tell people to stay home, but the shelters are people\u2019s homes and it\u2019s a dangerous place to be,\u201d said Eve Garrow, the homelessness policy analyst with the ACLU of Southern California. Garrow has researched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/16/homeless-shelters-orange-county-aclu-report-condemns\">unsanitary, unsafe and crowded conditions</a> inside the state\u2019s shelters. \u201cWe have many older adults with compromised immune systems living in the shelters, sharing living spaces, restrooms, showers and eating areas. It\u2019s almost impossible to think this wouldn\u2019t create a reservoir for the transmission of highly infectious viruses.\u201d</p> <p>At the URM at Skid Row, which has beds for roughly 1,000 people, Bales said he has installed new hot-water handwashing stations and ordered protective equipment. The not-for-profit is also prepared to quarantine coronavirus patients in a gym in the building, and has put up signs telling people to report to staff if they have a fever and cough, ensuring them they will have a place to stay if sick. \u201cCan you imagine people suffering on the streets alone? We can\u2019t bear that thought.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f14886ffd12cd16e1f59346aa2a6d035888e520\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f14886ffd12cd16e1f59346aa2a6d035888e520/0_0_4606_3685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Union Rescue Mission, one of the main Skid Row shelters, as it preps for coronavirus.

Health authorities have told Bales to prepare to quarantine people without tests, since the kits would first go to hospitals, care homes and other organizations once they are available: \u201cWe are last on the list to receive the tests, even though we are the most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>That means the URM will treat anyone with a fever and cough as a coronavirus patient.

      "bodyText": "The lack of a coordinated coronavirus strategy for homeless communities could be catastrophic for sick and older people already struggling to survive in tents and overcrowded shelters in California, advocates warned. Homeless organizations in California, which now has the highest numbers of reported Covid-19 infections along with New York and Washington state, say they lack the resources and government support to effectively stop the virus\u2019 spread in encampments and shelters, and that the shortage of tests and beds could have devastating consequences. California is home to the largest homeless population in the US, with a housing crisis that is already a public health emergency in Los Angeles, the Bay Area and other regions. \u201cWe are not prepared yet for a crisis like this,\u201d said Rev Andy Bales, who runs the Union Rescue Mission (URM) at Skid Row, the epicenter of homelessness in downtown LA. \u201cIndividually, we are doing everything we can \u2026 but we will be losing precious souls out on the street if we don\u2019t take immediate action.\u201d The coronavirus death toll in the US was at 26 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins\u2019 tracker, with more than 700 confirmed cases and significant outbreaks on the west coast. California declared a state of emergency after authorities reported cases in LA, the Silicon Valley region and elsewhere, and on Monday, the Grand Princess cruise ship, which had infected passengers on board, also docked in Oakland, where officials were preparing to move people into quarantine. There have been no reports yet of cases among California\u2019s homeless populations. That lack of confirmed cases is expected given how sparse the testing has been so far, but advocates are bracing for potential outbreaks as some experts have warned that the US is past the point of containment and must look toward mitigation. Fear and anxiety has escalated among some homeless communities. \u201cI ain\u2019t ready to die yet,\u201d said Kevin Wilkerson, a 52-year-old Skid Row resident, who said he was worried about Donald Trump\u2019s flippant response to coronavirus and the fact that the president has pursued funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThis virus is nothing to play with.\u201d The challenges for the homeless population are severe and complex. Residents without stable housing cannot follow the basic recommendations of self-quarantining when needed, and they can also struggle to access water for handwashing. \u201cYou can tell people to stay home, but the shelters are people\u2019s homes and it\u2019s a dangerous place to be,\u201d said Eve Garrow, the homelessness policy analyst with the ACLU of Southern California. Garrow has researched the unsanitary, unsafe and crowded conditions inside the state\u2019s shelters. \u201cWe have many older adults with compromised immune systems living in the shelters, sharing living spaces, restrooms, showers and eating areas. It\u2019s almost impossible to think this wouldn\u2019t create a reservoir for the transmission of highly infectious viruses.\u201d At the URM at Skid Row, which has beds for roughly 1,000 people, Bales said he has installed new hot-water handwashing stations and ordered protective equipment. The not-for-profit is also prepared to quarantine coronavirus patients in a gym in the building, and has put up signs telling people to report to staff if they have a fever and cough, ensuring them they will have a place to stay if sick. \u201cCan you imagine people suffering on the streets alone? We can\u2019t bear that thought.\u201d But because there is a national shortage of coronavirus test kits, URM does not expect it will be able to test any residents in the near future. Health authorities have told Bales to prepare to quarantine people without tests, since the kits would first go to hospitals, care homes and other organizations once they are available: \u201cWe are last on the list to receive the tests, even though we are the most vulnerable.\u201d That means the URM will treat anyone with a fever and cough as a coronavirus patient. Health officials have also advised the organization to send residents to the emergency room only in the most severe cases, Bales said: \u201cWe cannot take someone to the hospital unless they are at the point of struggling to breathe.\u201d Chronic lung disease is common among URM residents. \u2018The shelters could be a death sentence\u2019 In LA county, where 44,000 people live unsheltered in cars, tents and makeshift quarters, an average of nearly three homeless people die each day. That rate could climb, warned Stephen \u201cCue\u201d Jn-Marie, a Skid Row pastor: \u201cThe shelters can be a death sentence because people are so close in proximity.\u201d On Monday, San Francisco officials announced a $5m emergency fund to protect the homeless from coronavirus, which will go toward expanded cleaning in shelters and single-room occupancy (SRO) hotels, extended shelter hours and meal options, and an enhanced food delivery program for elderly SRO residents who are staying inside to protect themselves.

      "body": "<p>A flight between Shanghai and Chongqing now costs $4, about the price of a tall latte at Starbucks. Flights from New York to Miami were on offer for $51 last week, roughly the same as the cab fare from the airport to Manhattan. If Miami didn\u2019t appeal, you could have taken off for Paris for $278. The problem for the airline industry is: will anyone take them?</p> <p>As the coronavirus outbreak continues to hit stock markets hard, the travel industry is suffering its worst crisis in more than 18 years. Businesses have advised employees to avoid non-essential travel, conferences are cancelled, and would-be vacationers are avoiding foreign and domestic travel.</p> <p>The already bleak picture for airlines, hotels and cruise companies continued to darken on Monday as an oil price war and widening coronavirus infections bit deeply into investor confidence.</p> <p>So bad have things become that last week, Southwest\u2019s chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/southwest-airlines-travel-decline-coronavirus\">Gary Kelly, warned</a> the \u201cprecipitous decline in bookings\u201d was similar to the drop the airline experienced after the September 11 terrorist attacks.</p> <p>\u201c9/11 wasn\u2019t an economically driven issue for travel \u2013 it was more fear, quite frankly,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s manifested this time \u2026 It has a 9/11-like feel. Hopefully we\u2019ll get this behind us very quickly.\u2019\u2019</p> <p>Comparisons to 9/11 are not exaggerated. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) trade body calculates that revenue worldwide this year could decline by between $63bn and $113bn, or as much as 20%. After 9/11, airline revenues fell by 7%, or $23bn, according to IATA.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just airlines. Cruise stocks plummeted harder still after the US state department <a href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/cruise-ship-passengers.html?fbclid=IwAR23mRlu4-382HLuSM8i0KWQBSaZ4heDniggmxR3kBR6e2EgWiKr6B0EseM\">warned US travelers, especially the elderly and those with underlying health issues</a>, to avoid cruises.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/global-stock-markets-post-biggest-falls-since-2008-financial-crisis\">Global stock markets post biggest falls since 2008 financial crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Shares of Carnival fell 19% on Monday, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Royal Caribbean fell more than 25%. In less than two months, the three US-based operators have lost more than $42bn in market capitalization, more than half of their value.</p> <p>\u201cThey will likely survive but no guarantees,\u201d C Patrick Scholes, an analyst at SunTrust, wrote in an email on Monday.</p> <p>That came as thousands of passengers on a third Princess Cruises ship were being kept onboard while crew members get tested for Covid-19. The Caribbean Princess, on a 10-day trip to the Panama Canal, was placed under a \u201cno sail order\u201d from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>That came as hotel industry stocks continued their declines. Over the first two months of the year, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, a broad measure of the sector\u2019s health, has dropped 18.5%, according to the trade publication <a href=\"https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4097402.html\">HospitalityNet.</a></p> <p>\u201cHotel stocks fell off a cliff at the end of the month due to mounting Covid-19 concerns domestically, and the broader stock market correction has disproportionately impacted travel-related stocks,\u201d Michael Bellisario, senior hotel research analyst and director at Baird, told the publication.</p> <p>The travel and leisure industry is one of the US\u2019s largest employers and the White House is worried. The White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, announced \u201ctargeted measures\u201d to offset the negative impact on the industry from the coronavirus outbreak last week and Donald Trump, who recently signed an $8.3bn emergency coronavirus spending bill, met with airline executives to discuss the impact of the outbreak. The White House called another meeting with business leaders on Monday to discuss options.</p> <p>Any financial package would need the approval of Congress \u2013 difficult in an election year. Among the range of options open to the White House are tax deferments for industries hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, including the cruise, travel and airline industries.</p> <p>Improving public confidence in industries substantially affected by Covid-19 may be even more difficult than agreeing a bailout package given the level of uncertainty about the virus, how many will be affected and how long it will go on.</p> <p>According to the airline industry expert Robert Mann, the reaction of businesses to the threat does not necessarily match reality but the impact is still real.</p> <p>\u201cI can understand businesses having a duty of care to employees, so saying \u2018if you don\u2019t want to travel, don\u2019t travel\u2019 is one thing. But saying flat out \u2018don\u2019t travel\u2019, that has implications for their businesses but also a lot of implications for the travel industry as a whole \u2013 airlines, hotels, rental cars, Uber, Lyft and all the related expenditures,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a behavioral economics problem,\u201d Mann says. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation where people throw probabilities out the window, react irrationally, and socially oriented businesses pay the price. The issue here is to get over the hysteria.\u201d</p> <p>But with people dying and case numbers rising, worry is warranted right now, even if it proves to be short-lived. The consequences for some businesses are likely to be severe.</p> <p>\u201cIn the current crisis, a 30% drop in front-cabin, business traveler bookings represents of drop of roughly half in overall industry revenue,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t see more airlines going out of business.\u201d</p>",

Businesses have advised employees to avoid non-essential travel, conferences are cancelled, and would-be vacationers are avoiding foreign and domestic travel. The already bleak picture for airlines, hotels and cruise companies continued to darken on Monday as an oil price war and widening coronavirus infections bit deeply into investor confidence. So bad have things become that last week, Southwest\u2019s chief executive, Gary Kelly, warned the \u201cprecipitous decline in bookings\u201d was similar to the drop the airline experienced after the September 11 terrorist attacks. \u201c9/11 wasn\u2019t an economically driven issue for travel \u2013 it was more fear, quite frankly,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s manifested this time \u2026 It has a 9/11-like feel. Hopefully we\u2019ll get this behind us very quickly.\u2019\u2019 Comparisons to 9/11 are not exaggerated. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) trade body calculates that revenue worldwide this year could decline by between $63bn and $113bn, or as much as 20%. After 9/11, airline revenues fell by 7%, or $23bn, according to IATA. It\u2019s not just airlines. Cruise stocks plummeted harder still after the US state department warned US travelers, especially the elderly and those with underlying health issues, to avoid cruises. Shares of Carnival fell 19% on Monday, while Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Royal Caribbean fell more than 25%. In less than two months, the three US-based operators have lost more than $42bn in market capitalization, more than half of their value. \u201cThey will likely survive but no guarantees,\u201d C Patrick Scholes, an analyst at SunTrust, wrote in an email on Monday. That came as thousands of passengers on a third Princess Cruises ship were being kept onboard while crew members get tested for Covid-19. The Caribbean Princess, on a 10-day trip to the Panama Canal, was placed under a \u201cno sail order\u201d from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That came as hotel industry stocks continued their declines. Over the first two months of the year, the Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, a broad measure of the sector\u2019s health, has dropped 18.5%, according to the trade publication HospitalityNet. \u201cHotel stocks fell off a cliff at the end of the month due to mounting Covid-19 concerns domestically, and the broader stock market correction has disproportionately impacted travel-related stocks,\u201d Michael Bellisario, senior hotel research analyst and director at Baird, told the publication. The travel and leisure industry is one of the US\u2019s largest employers and the White House is worried. The White House chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, announced \u201ctargeted measures\u201d to offset the negative impact on the industry from the coronavirus outbreak last week and Donald Trump, who recently signed an $8.3bn emergency coronavirus spending bill, met with airline executives to discuss the impact of the outbreak. The White House called another meeting with business leaders on Monday to discuss options. Any financial package would need the approval of Congress \u2013 difficult in an election year. Among the range of options open to the White House are tax deferments for industries hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, including the cruise, travel and airline industries. Improving public confidence in industries substantially affected by Covid-19 may be even more difficult than agreeing a bailout package given the level of uncertainty about the virus, how many will be affected and how long it will go on. According to the airline industry expert Robert Mann, the reaction of businesses to the threat does not necessarily match reality but the impact is still real. \u201cI can understand businesses having a duty of care to employees, so saying \u2018if you don\u2019t want to travel, don\u2019t travel\u2019 is one thing. But saying flat out \u2018don\u2019t travel\u2019, that has implications for their businesses but also a lot of implications for the travel industry as a whole \u2013 airlines, hotels, rental cars, Uber, Lyft and all the related expenditures,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a behavioral economics problem,\u201d Mann says. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation where people throw probabilities out the window, react irrationally, and socially oriented businesses pay the price. The issue here is to get over the hysteria.\u201d But with people dying and case numbers rising, worry is warranted right now, even if it proves to be short-lived. The consequences for some businesses are likely to be severe. \u201cIn the current crisis, a 30% drop in front-cabin, business traveler bookings represents of drop of roughly half in overall industry revenue,\u201d says McKenzie. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t see more airlines going out of business.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>With every push-notification news alert about coronavirus, it\u2019s natural to feel more anxious. But what actions should we be taking to keep our friends, families and loved ones safe? We spoke to some high-profile medical professionals and scientists to find out how they are adapting their daily routines. Because if we should follow anyone\u2019s lead, it should be the experts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"43a174281963816a39f15a13f25798dc9848a535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a174281963816a39f15a13f25798dc9848a535/2_62_2194_2740/801.jpg\" alt=\"Rosena Allin-Khan \u2026 \u2018I always try to use hand gel before shaking the next hand.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosena Allin-Khan \u2026 \u2018I always try to use hand gel before shaking the next hand.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m trying to avoid shaking hands as much as possible\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, MP for Tooting and candidate for deputy Labour leader</strong></p> <p>As someone with a background in A&amp;E medicine, I\u2019m very careful about hand hygiene anyway. Now, when I get home, I put my clothes into the laundry basket and wash my hands before hugging the kids. I\u2019ve been talking to my kids a lot about handwashing: we sing Happy Birthday twice while washing our hands at home, and I\u2019ve drilled it into them that they need to be doing the same at school.</p> <p>MPs on the campaign trail are exactly the sort of people who could be super-spreaders, so I\u2019m being extra-careful. I\u2019m trying to avoid shaking hands as much as possible, although sometimes it\u2019s difficult not to: if someone comes up to you, says they\u2019re supporting you and sticks out their hand, of course you shake it because you don\u2019t want to be rude. But I always try to use hand gel before shaking the next person\u2019s hand. I find the government\u2019s proposal to bring in retired doctors to address the staffing shortfall mind-boggling. Those are the exact people who are in the age group that makes them vulnerable to coronavirus.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Panic buying isn\u2019t helpful. We all need to get on with life\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Prof David Lalloo, director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m travelling a lot at the moment, and am much more conscious of washing my hands. A big thing for me is trying not to touch my face, eyes and mouth. It\u2019s hard to avoid it \u2013 it\u2019s a natural human response, and we all do it.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t cancelled any holiday or work-travel plans, but I\u2019m monitoring the situation. My plans may change if the epidemic continues. Face masks aren\u2019t necessary in my opinion unless you\u2019re a healthcare worker in close contact with infected individuals. If you are just out and about, you\u2019re unlikely to be in close enough contact with someone for enough time to be infected by respiratory droplets.</p> <p>It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t allow concern to overtake common sense. There\u2019s no doubt that this could be a nasty epidemic in the UK, but panic buying isn\u2019t helpful. We all need to get on with normal life as much as possible.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1411c4e9957a39d470e54427ff7dc152c2fd6b96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1411c4e9957a39d470e54427ff7dc152c2fd6b96/0_149_1535_1918/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Dominic Pimenta \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m wearing a respiratory mask.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Dominic Pimenta \u2026 \u2018I\u2019m wearing a respiratory mask.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image supplied by Dr Dominic Pimenta</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018On the tube, I lean against the wall at the end of the carriage\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Dominic Pimenta, cardiologist and author of Parts</strong></p> <p>My sister had a cold recently, so we cancelled a family gathering, just to be on the safe side \u2013 I have two kids and elderly relatives.</p> <p>When I\u2019m on the tube, I don\u2019t touch anything. I lean against the wall at the end of the carriage. I\u2019m also wearing a respiratory mask because I\u2019m a bit of a face toucher. I carry alcohol-based hand sanitiser around with me. When I get home from work, I put my clothes in the wash and wash my hands before I hug the kids.</p> <p>This attitude that you don\u2019t need to worry about coronavirus if you are young and healthy because it only affects older and infirm people is really irresponsible. These people are your mum, your dad and your friends who are going through cancer treatment. Washing your hands has a huge impact on how the virus can spread.</p> <p>I think the government has prioritised managing the economy over the public-health side of things. If we\u2019re blase about things, it\u2019s easier for the virus to spread. It\u2019s not extreme or silly to be taking precautions. I appreciate that we don\u2019t want to create panic. But telling people to wash their hands is a basic thing \u2013 and hopefully won\u2019t cause panic.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I went for a coffee with my dad, and we chatted about death\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Molly Case, nurse specialist and author of How to Treat People: A Nurse at Work</strong></p> <p>As a nurse, one of the things that you have drilled into you during training is handwashing. As a student, you would wash your hands and somebody would shine a UV light on you afterwards to show the dirt left behind. So I haven\u2019t adapted my behaviour because I\u2019m already an expert at handwashing.</p> <p>The only positive thing to come out of coronavirus is that it has opened up important conversations. My dad is 82. I went for a coffee with him recently, and we chatted about death and how he would want to die, which is always a conversation worth having. But my dad is a sturdy RAF veteran. I\u2019m not too worried.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eed5418c43a412058fac379587165da26477ab36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eed5418c43a412058fac379587165da26477ab36/0_0_6541_3925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Case \u2026 \u2018My dad is a sturdy RAF veteran.

I\u2019m not planning on changing any of our travel plans, unless the situation changes.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not going to lock myself in a sealed room until Christmas\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Dr Adam Kay, author of This Is Going to Hurt and Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas</strong></p> <p>The situation isn\u2019t great. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re scaremongering about the dangers of coronavirus. If anything, I think the situation has been underplayed. Very few NHS professionals believe the NHS can cope if half the country ends up infected. This is an NHS that is already working at capacity. It doesn\u2019t have a buffer. It has been treading water for a decade.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9c284b3fa6f76578ff8cfdb266ff53906a87e79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9c284b3fa6f76578ff8cfdb266ff53906a87e79/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Kay \u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re scaremongering.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Kay \u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019re scaremongering.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People are saying: \u201cOh well, it will only affect the elderly and the unwell.\u201d Where\u2019s the compassion? Go through your phone book, and think about everyone in there who is elderly. Think about your friends who are immunosuppressed due to chemotherapy. I\u2019m prepared to roll the dice myself: there\u2019s a 97% chance I\u2019ll live so I\u2019m not going to lock myself in a sealed room until Christmas. But the modifications I\u2019m making to my life, I\u2019m doing for those people.</p> <p>I\u2019m using hand gel, often, and I\u2019ve stopped shaking hands. I\u2019m also trying to do some social distancing: putting space between myself and other people in public seems like a sensible idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"409fb69e5f5f8711c4be769ad0b73dff31612185\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/409fb69e5f5f8711c4be769ad0b73dff31612185/0_0_1000_1250/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Jarvis \u2026 \u2018I suggested individual cups for communion wine.\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Jarvis \u2026 \u2018I suggested individual cups for communion wine.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Image provided by Dr Sarah Jarvis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018In church, everyone shakes hands. We\u2019ve been waving instead\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical director of the online appointment-booking system patientaccess.com</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m using a paper towel to open doors. And I would rather walk around with wet hands than use a communal towel to dry my hands. I\u2019m also making more of an effort to clean my phone. I gave up handshaking and cheek-kissing a few weeks ago. I don\u2019t kiss anyone now apart from my husband and my kids.</p> <p>I rang up the vicar at my local church and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing about coronavirus?\u201d He gave me the Church of England spiel, and I said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s acceptable.\u201d So I strong-armed him a little bit because the people at my church tend to be older. Usually when you share the peace with the congregation, everyone shakes hands, but we\u2019ve been waving at each other instead. I\u2019ve stopped taking communion. I suggested having individual cups for the communion wine, but they didn\u2019t go for it.</p> <p>I\u2019m still visiting my father, who is 93, but my family is absolutely obsessive about washing our hands before we see him. I have been thinking about whether it\u2019s wise for the young children in our family to visit him because we know that children are super-spreaders of flu. But I think it\u2019s too early at this point to stop visiting elderly relatives. If we ask people to stop visiting their grandparents now, and it\u2019s eight months before we get the epidemic under control, that\u2019s a long time for them to go without visitors.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018If I reach 80 and a </strong><strong>coronavirus kills me, I won\u2019t complain\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Phil Hammond, NHS doctor, comedian and Private Eye\u2019s medical correspondent</strong></p> <p>I haven\u2019t changed anything in my personal daily routine. No masks, no extra gels, no changes in my travel, recreation or work schedule. As a comedian, I do a lot about the meaning of life, to love and be loved, which involves the audience in consensual hugging. They now do consensual foot-shakes, and any show of affection that does not involve rubbing together moist mucous membranes.</p> <p>Personally, I think I\u2019m laughing more. Laughter is the best medicine unless you have syphilis, in which case it\u2019s penicillin. As there are no drugs for coronavirus, and nowhere near enough intensive care unit (ITU) beds for prolonged intubation, I think laughter will become increasingly important, and it\u2019s certainly more useful than panic.</p> <p>If I reach 80 and a new coronavirus kills me, I won\u2019t complain and I wouldn\u2019t want prolonged intubation on ITU. Doctors generally want less intervention and good end-of-life pain relief when they get old and seriously ill. We haven\u2019t got many ITU beds, so getting people to say in advance whether they would want prolonged intubation or not might help the inevitable rationing process. Maybe the upside of coronavirus is that it will get us talking about death in a grownup way.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I have four children \u2026 I\u2019m not remotely concerned on their behalf\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Gabriel Weston, Author of Direct Red: A Surgeon\u2019s Story</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m definitely washing my hands more often. After the gym, I wash them straight away or when I get home \u2013 not because I\u2019m particularly worried, but because it\u2019s a sensible thing to do.</p> <p>I have four children between the ages of six and 16. I\u2019m not remotely concerned on their behalf. I\u2019ve said to them: \u201cDo not come home from school!\u201d</p> <p>The only thing at the back of my mind is that there may come a time when, as NHS staff, we\u2019re asked to work more than our usual hours. I\u2019m thinking about how I might be able to schedule that into my life, were I needed to help out at the hospital on that front. But I\u2019m not remotely concerned and my behaviour hasn\u2019t changed at all \u2013 other than the handwashing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c5adde910f7a0c6a2971230ab0e95cf1fae8feca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5adde910f7a0c6a2971230ab0e95cf1fae8feca/9_259_1969_2459/801.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin Fong \u2026 \u2018You have to think about the weakest people in society.\u2019\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Fong \u2026 \u2018You have to think about the weakest people in society.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not avoiding elderly relatives, but I am being mindful of vulnerable people\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Dr Kevin Fong, broadcaster and author of Extremes: How Far Can You Go to Save a Life?</strong></p> <p>I haven\u2019t changed my routine much. I\u2019m probably taking a bit longer over washing my hands, but I\u2019m reasonably good at doing that anyway. I know it\u2019s boring to keep saying: \u201cWash your hands.\u201d People want us to say something dramatic, but that does work.</p> <p>I\u2019m not avoiding elderly relatives, but I am being mindful of people who are vulnerable. This collective shrug of \u201cwell, it won\u2019t affect me\u201d is an interesting attitude. We all have a collective duty. You have to think about the weakest people in society, and how you can protect them with your behaviour. It\u2019s pretty cynical to think that just because you\u2019re in the group of people least likely to get infected with coronavirus, it\u2019s not a big deal.</p> <p>It\u2019s really important that we listen to the advice coming out of Public Health England. At the moment it\u2019s clear, and there\u2019s no need for any further modification than that, really.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We may take over my father\u2019s care worker\u2019s responsibilities\u2019</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Saleyha Ahsan, journalist and broadcaster</strong></p> <p>I have an elderly father with asthma, and another close relative has had a kidney transplant and is immunocompromised. Whatever information I\u2019m gleaning from my hospital authorities, I\u2019m passing on to my family, whether it\u2019s information about what you should do if you\u2019ve been exposed to a person with coronavirus or what areas to stay away from.</p> <p>My father normally has a care worker who comes to visit him at home. My siblings and I have been wondering if we should ask them to stop coming until the epidemic dies down. We haven\u2019t decided yet \u2013 we\u2019re watching to see how the situation unfolds.

      "bodyText": "With every push-notification news alert about coronavirus, it\u2019s natural to feel more anxious. But what actions should we be taking to keep our friends, families and loved ones safe? We spoke to some high-profile medical professionals and scientists to find out how they are adapting their daily routines. Because if we should follow anyone\u2019s lead, it should be the experts. \u2018I\u2019m trying to avoid shaking hands as much as possible\u2019 Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, MP for Tooting and candidate for deputy Labour leader As someone with a background in A&amp;E medicine, I\u2019m very careful about hand hygiene anyway. Now, when I get home, I put my clothes into the laundry basket and wash my hands before hugging the kids. I\u2019ve been talking to my kids a lot about handwashing: we sing Happy Birthday twice while washing our hands at home, and I\u2019ve drilled it into them that they need to be doing the same at school. MPs on the campaign trail are exactly the sort of people who could be super-spreaders, so I\u2019m being extra-careful. I\u2019m trying to avoid shaking hands as much as possible, although sometimes it\u2019s difficult not to: if someone comes up to you, says they\u2019re supporting you and sticks out their hand, of course you shake it because you don\u2019t want to be rude. But I always try to use hand gel before shaking the next person\u2019s hand. I find the government\u2019s proposal to bring in retired doctors to address the staffing shortfall mind-boggling. Those are the exact people who are in the age group that makes them vulnerable to coronavirus. \u2018Panic buying isn\u2019t helpful. We all need to get on with life\u2019 Prof David Lalloo, director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine I\u2019m travelling a lot at the moment, and am much more conscious of washing my hands. A big thing for me is trying not to touch my face, eyes and mouth. It\u2019s hard to avoid it \u2013 it\u2019s a natural human response, and we all do it. I haven\u2019t cancelled any holiday or work-travel plans, but I\u2019m monitoring the situation. My plans may change if the epidemic continues. Face masks aren\u2019t necessary in my opinion unless you\u2019re a healthcare worker in close contact with infected individuals. If you are just out and about, you\u2019re unlikely to be in close enough contact with someone for enough time to be infected by respiratory droplets. It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t allow concern to overtake common sense. There\u2019s no doubt that this could be a nasty epidemic in the UK, but panic buying isn\u2019t helpful. We all need to get on with normal life as much as possible. \u2018On the tube, I lean against the wall at the end of the carriage\u2019 Dr Dominic Pimenta, cardiologist and author of Parts My sister had a cold recently, so we cancelled a family gathering, just to be on the safe side \u2013 I have two kids and elderly relatives. When I\u2019m on the tube, I don\u2019t touch anything. I lean against the wall at the end of the carriage. I\u2019m also wearing a respiratory mask because I\u2019m a bit of a face toucher. I carry alcohol-based hand sanitiser around with me. When I get home from work, I put my clothes in the wash and wash my hands before I hug the kids. This attitude that you don\u2019t need to worry about coronavirus if you are young and healthy because it only affects older and infirm people is really irresponsible. These people are your mum, your dad and your friends who are going through cancer treatment. Washing your hands has a huge impact on how the virus can spread. I think the government has prioritised managing the economy over the public-health side of things. If we\u2019re blase about things, it\u2019s easier for the virus to spread. It\u2019s not extreme or silly to be taking precautions. I appreciate that we don\u2019t want to create panic. But telling people to wash their hands is a basic thing \u2013 and hopefully won\u2019t cause panic. \u2018I went for a coffee with my dad, and we chatted about death\u2019 Molly Case, nurse specialist and author of How to Treat People: A Nurse at Work As a nurse, one of the things that you have drilled into you during training is handwashing. As a student, you would wash your hands and somebody would shine a UV light on you afterwards to show the dirt left behind. So I haven\u2019t adapted my behaviour because I\u2019m already an expert at handwashing. The only positive thing to come out of coronavirus is that it has opened up important conversations. My dad is 82. I went for a coffee with him recently, and we chatted about death and how he would want to die, which is always a conversation worth having. But my dad is a sturdy RAF veteran. I\u2019m not too worried. I have a four-month-old baby and I took her to the GP recently, and was quite keen for people not to touch her, but I would be that way anyway. We\u2019re going on holiday to Malta later this month. I\u2019m not planning on changing any of our travel plans, unless the situation changes. \u2018I\u2019m not going to lock myself in a sealed room until Christmas\u2019 Dr Adam Kay, author of This Is Going to Hurt and Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas The situation isn\u2019t great. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re scaremongering about the dangers of coronavirus. If anything, I think the situation has been underplayed. Very few NHS professionals believe the NHS can cope if half the country ends up infected. This is an NHS that is already working at capacity. It doesn\u2019t have a buffer. It has been treading water for a decade. People are saying: \u201cOh well, it will only affect the elderly and the unwell.\u201d Where\u2019s the compassion? Go through your phone book, and think about everyone in there who is elderly. Think about your friends who are immunosuppressed due to chemotherapy. I\u2019m prepared to roll the dice myself: there\u2019s a 97% chance I\u2019ll live so I\u2019m not going to lock myself in a sealed room until Christmas. But the modifications I\u2019m making to my life, I\u2019m doing for those people. I\u2019m using hand gel, often, and I\u2019ve stopped shaking hands. I\u2019m also trying to do some social distancing: putting space between myself and other people in public seems like a sensible idea. \u2018In church, everyone shakes hands. We\u2019ve been waving instead\u2019 Dr Sarah Jarvis, GP and clinical director of the online appointment-booking system patientaccess.com I\u2019m using a paper towel to open doors. And I would rather walk around with wet hands than use a communal towel to dry my hands. I\u2019m also making more of an effort to clean my phone. I gave up handshaking and cheek-kissing a few weeks ago. I don\u2019t kiss anyone now apart from my husband and my kids. I rang up the vicar at my local church and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing about coronavirus?\u201d He gave me the Church of England spiel, and I said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s acceptable.\u201d So I strong-armed him a little bit because the people at my church tend to be older. Usually when you share the peace with the congregation, everyone shakes hands, but we\u2019ve been waving at each other instead. I\u2019ve stopped taking communion. I suggested having individual cups for the communion wine, but they didn\u2019t go for it. I\u2019m still visiting my father, who is 93, but my family is absolutely obsessive about washing our hands before we see him. I have been thinking about whether it\u2019s wise for the young children in our family to visit him because we know that children are super-spreaders of flu. But I think it\u2019s too early at this point to stop visiting elderly relatives. If we ask people to stop visiting their grandparents now, and it\u2019s eight months before we get the epidemic under control, that\u2019s a long time for them to go without visitors. \u2018If I reach 80 and a coronavirus kills me, I won\u2019t complain\u2019 Dr Phil Hammond, NHS doctor, comedian and Private Eye\u2019s medical correspondent I haven\u2019t changed anything in my personal daily routine. No masks, no extra gels, no changes in my travel, recreation or work schedule. As a comedian, I do a lot about the meaning of life, to love and be loved, which involves the audience in consensual hugging. They now do consensual foot-shakes, and any show of affection that does not involve rubbing together moist mucous membranes. Personally, I think I\u2019m laughing more. Laughter is the best medicine unless you have syphilis, in which case it\u2019s penicillin. As there are no drugs for coronavirus, and nowhere near enough intensive care unit (ITU) beds for prolonged intubation, I think laughter will become increasingly important, and it\u2019s certainly more useful than panic. If I reach 80 and a new coronavirus kills me, I won\u2019t complain and I wouldn\u2019t want prolonged intubation on ITU. Doctors generally want less intervention and good end-of-life pain relief when they get old and seriously ill. We haven\u2019t got many ITU beds, so getting people to say in advance whether they would want prolonged intubation or not might help the inevitable rationing process. Maybe the upside of coronavirus is that it will get us talking about death in a grownup way. \u2018I have four children \u2026 I\u2019m not remotely concerned on their behalf\u2019 Dr Gabriel Weston, Author of Direct Red: A Surgeon\u2019s Story I\u2019m definitely washing my hands more often. After the gym, I wash them straight away or when I get home \u2013 not because I\u2019m particularly worried, but because it\u2019s a sensible thing to do. I have four children between the ages of six and 16. I\u2019m not remotely concerned on their behalf. I\u2019ve said to them: \u201cDo not come home from school!\u201d The only thing at the back of my mind is that there may come a time when, as NHS staff, we\u2019re asked to work more than our usual hours. I\u2019m thinking about how I might be able to schedule that into my life, were I needed to help out at the hospital on that front. But I\u2019m not remotely concerned and my behaviour hasn\u2019t changed at all \u2013 other than the handwashing. \u2018I\u2019m not avoiding elderly relatives, but I am being mindful of vulnerable people\u2019 Dr Kevin Fong, broadcaster and author of Extremes: How Far Can You Go to Save a Life? I haven\u2019t changed my routine much. I\u2019m probably taking a bit longer over washing my hands, but I\u2019m reasonably good at doing that anyway. I know it\u2019s boring to keep saying: \u201cWash your hands.\u201d People want us to say something dramatic, but that does work. I\u2019m not avoiding elderly relatives, but I am being mindful of people who are vulnerable. This collective shrug of \u201cwell, it won\u2019t affect me\u201d is an interesting attitude. We all have a collective duty. You have to think about the weakest people in society, and how you can protect them with your behaviour. It\u2019s pretty cynical to think that just because you\u2019re in the group of people least likely to get infected with coronavirus, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s really important that we listen to the advice coming out of Public Health England. At the moment it\u2019s clear, and there\u2019s no need for any further modification than that, really. \u2018We may take over my father\u2019s care worker\u2019s responsibilities\u2019 Dr Saleyha Ahsan, journalist and broadcaster I have an elderly father with asthma, and another close relative has had a kidney transplant and is immunocompromised. Whatever information I\u2019m gleaning from my hospital authorities, I\u2019m passing on to my family, whether it\u2019s information about what you should do if you\u2019ve been exposed to a person with coronavirus or what areas to stay away from. My father normally has a care worker who comes to visit him at home. My siblings and I have been wondering if we should ask them to stop coming until the epidemic dies down. We haven\u2019t decided yet \u2013 we\u2019re watching to see how the situation unfolds. If it looks as if there are more cases in London, where he lives, we\u2019ll take over the care worker\u2019s responsibilities ourselves. I\u2019m feeling the need to skip the tube. Next time I\u2019m in London, I\u2019ll probably get a cab or walk. \u2018When I\u2019m flying, I wipe down the tray tables and seat backs\u2019 Prof Jonathan Quick, author of The End of Epidemics I just cancelled a cycling holiday in Tuscany in June. I\u2019d been watching the spread of the virus through Italy and keeping an eye on all the official warnings. I held out as long as possible, but it became apparent that the epidemic wasn\u2019t under control in northern Italy. When I\u2019m flying, I wipe down the tray tables and seat backs with antibacterial wipes. I\u2019m extremely vigilant in aeroplane washrooms because a place like that with heavy traffic is likely to have respiratory droplets left behind. I turn off the tap with the back of my hand and use a paper towel to open the door to get out. I\u2019ve noticed in the UK that you don\u2019t tend to have paper towels in public bathrooms, so I\u2019d advise people to carry handkerchiefs, so they don\u2019t have to touch door handles. I\u2019m advising everyone to base their decision-making on information from the official public-health bodies. Their core concern is keeping the public safe. They don\u2019t have any hidden agendas.",

For Sars and Mers, in upper airway, virus peaks a week to 10 days after the onset of symptoms, so you probably have five to 10 days to intervene after you start to feel crummy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Food banks in Britain are running out of staples including milk and cereal as a result of panic-buying and are urging shoppers to think twice before hoarding as donations fall in the coronavirus outbreak. Donations from shoppers at branches of Sainsbury\u2019s and Waitrose slumped to 25% of their normal volume at one food bank in London, while they have fallen by a third at a Kirkcaldy food bank \u2013 where UHT milk has run out. Some facilities have warned they may close because of concerns about cross-infection, and a food bank in Stonebridge, a deprived area of north-west London, will cut the size of its food parcels by a third from Wednesday, with larger families facing the biggest reductions. \u201cPanic is going to be more dangerous than the virus,\u201d said Joyce Leggate, the chair of Kirkcaldy food bank, which helps up to 350 families a week. \u201cOur food parcels are essential for the health of many of the people we support.

      "body": "<p>It started life as a cosy Q&amp;A at a comedy festival. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/24/steve-martin-and-martin-short-do-you-think-the-queen-will-come-to-our-show\">Steve Martin and Martin Short</a> \u2013 comedians, movie legends and best friends \u2013 expanded the banter into a stage show. Recorded for <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80186850\">Netflix</a>, it was Emmy-nominated for outstanding writing for a variety special. And now this late-career double act arrives in the UK for a week-long tour.</p> <p>Any concerns that the duo, 74 and 69 respectively, might be yesterday\u2019s news are allayed by instant engagement with today\u2019s. \u201cIf you do find something funny,\u201d Martin begins by advising the crowd, \u201cplease pull your surgical mask away from your face\u201d \u2013 the better to let the laughter be heard. Coronavirus is tonight\u2019s ice-breaker: no sooner have Martin and Short greeted one another on stage than they\u2019re cracking open the hand sanitiser. These Audience With \u2026 celebrity vehicles often feel complacent; this one is immediately more mischievous and lighter on its feet.</p> <p>A variety show weaving together standup and conversation, music and song, it\u2019s at its best when the Two Amigos are exchanging affectionate insults. They have a fine line in mutual mickey-taking, whether that\u2019s Short mocking Martin\u2019s pale complexion (\u201cIn the 80s, I think I tried to snort you\u201d) or Martin feigning concern for Short\u2019s career slump, which lasted \u201cfrom 1972 until last week\u201d. The raillery is just as pointed when turned on themselves and their show: Martin has a running gag about the mechanism for audience complaints (\u201cThat email again \u2013 ToughShitNoRefunds@gmail.com\u201d), and he deploys it, after this or that creaky gag from Short, with comic timing to die for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5c57d0b2cb8e5a677f364c77492e5ef64787d8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5c57d0b2cb8e5a677f364c77492e5ef64787d8c/5_210_2161_1296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Three Amigos, 1986\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mutual mickey-taking \u2026 Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Three Amigos, 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His introverted deadpan finds a perfect foil in extrovert, attention-seeking Short. When they operate as a double act (\u201cWe\u2019re like Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un without the sexual tension\u201d), you want more.</p> <p>But the show as often keeps them separate, or creates less fruitful formats for their partnership \u2013 like the odd sequence in which they recite other comedians\u2019 well-loved one-liners, or the faux chatshow where they tell rehearsed anecdotes about their life and work.</p> <p>The latter is a rare brush with celebrity slickness and self-congratulation. The closing paean to Glasgow\u2019s \u201cbest audience in the world\u201d rings hollow too, given that the duo were visibly disconcerted earlier when references to their career achievements (engineered to elicit whoops from a US audience) met with indifferent silence. Later, Short\u2019s solo sequence, culminating in the spoof musical number (from his 2006 Broadway show <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/18/theater/reviews/18fame.html\">Fame Becomes Me</a>, Stepbrother to Jesus) threatens \u2013 without his partner\u2019s restraining influence \u2013 to become too much of a showy thing. I prefer Martin\u2019s section with bluegrass outfit the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/15/steve-martin-steep-canyon-rangers-review\">Steep Canyon Rangers</a>, featuring terrific banjo work from Martin and sumptuous harmony-singing from the band.</p> <p>Seriously though Martin takes his music, even that isn\u2019t immune to mockery, and Short\u2019s interruption in the improbable role of a set of bagpipes (tartan-clad, carried aloft by a burly Scotsman, and caterwauling the tune of Amazing Grace) makes for one of the show\u2019s most indelible WTF moments.</p> <p>This cheerful silliness, and the blunt incongruity of their rudeness to one another, is the making of the show \u2013 because it all reveals how much fun they\u2019re having in one another\u2019s company. As they clamber atop a piano in a tangle of limbs, then deliver a Send in the Clowns that tiptoes between send-up and celebration of this late-career live-comedy fling, it\u2019s a pleasure to share that fun with them.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/steve-martin-martin-short-tickets/artist/1591479\">At </a><a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/steve-martin-martin-short-tickets/artist/1591479\">SSE Arena Belfast on 12 March; Royal Albert Hall, London, on 14-15 March</a><a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/steve-martin-martin-short-tickets/artist/1591479\">. </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It started life as a cosy Q&amp;A at a comedy festival. Then Steve Martin and Martin Short \u2013 comedians, movie legends and best friends \u2013 expanded the banter into a stage show. Recorded for Netflix, it was Emmy-nominated for outstanding writing for a variety special. And now this late-career double act arrives in the UK for a week-long tour. Any concerns that the duo, 74 and 69 respectively, might be yesterday\u2019s news are allayed by instant engagement with today\u2019s. \u201cIf you do find something funny,\u201d Martin begins by advising the crowd, \u201cplease pull your surgical mask away from your face\u201d \u2013 the better to let the laughter be heard. Coronavirus is tonight\u2019s ice-breaker: no sooner have Martin and Short greeted one another on stage than they\u2019re cracking open the hand sanitiser. These Audience With \u2026 celebrity vehicles often feel complacent; this one is immediately more mischievous and lighter on its feet. A variety show weaving together standup and conversation, music and song, it\u2019s at its best when the Two Amigos are exchanging affectionate insults. They have a fine line in mutual mickey-taking, whether that\u2019s Short mocking Martin\u2019s pale complexion (\u201cIn the 80s, I think I tried to snort you\u201d) or Martin feigning concern for Short\u2019s career slump, which lasted \u201cfrom 1972 until last week\u201d. The raillery is just as pointed when turned on themselves and their show: Martin has a running gag about the mechanism for audience complaints (\u201cThat email again \u2013 ToughShitNoRefunds@gmail.com\u201d), and he deploys it, after this or that creaky gag from Short, with comic timing to die for. His introverted deadpan finds a perfect foil in extrovert, attention-seeking Short. When they operate as a double act (\u201cWe\u2019re like Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un without the sexual tension\u201d), you want more. But the show as often keeps them separate, or creates less fruitful formats for their partnership \u2013 like the odd sequence in which they recite other comedians\u2019 well-loved one-liners, or the faux chatshow where they tell rehearsed anecdotes about their life and work. The latter is a rare brush with celebrity slickness and self-congratulation. The closing paean to Glasgow\u2019s \u201cbest audience in the world\u201d rings hollow too, given that the duo were visibly disconcerted earlier when references to their career achievements (engineered to elicit whoops from a US audience) met with indifferent silence. Later, Short\u2019s solo sequence, culminating in the spoof musical number (from his 2006 Broadway show Fame Becomes Me, Stepbrother to Jesus) threatens \u2013 without his partner\u2019s restraining influence \u2013 to become too much of a showy thing. I prefer Martin\u2019s section with bluegrass outfit the Steep Canyon Rangers, featuring terrific banjo work from Martin and sumptuous harmony-singing from the band. Seriously though Martin takes his music, even that isn\u2019t immune to mockery, and Short\u2019s interruption in the improbable role of a set of bagpipes (tartan-clad, carried aloft by a burly Scotsman, and caterwauling the tune of Amazing Grace) makes for one of the show\u2019s most indelible WTF moments. This cheerful silliness, and the blunt incongruity of their rudeness to one another, is the making of the show \u2013 because it all reveals how much fun they\u2019re having in one another\u2019s company. As they clamber atop a piano in a tangle of limbs, then deliver a Send in the Clowns that tiptoes between send-up and celebration of this late-career live-comedy fling, it\u2019s a pleasure to share that fun with them. \u2022 At SSE Arena Belfast on 12 March; Royal Albert Hall, London, on 14-15 March.",

      "bodyText": "You may have read that there are just eight, or 10, or 12 years to save the world from the climate crisis. There are not. It is already here, gaining strength every day as carbon emissions pour into the atmosphere. It is a slow-motion disaster. Action to avert the worst should have started last week, last year, last decade. This is not a message of despair, though, but one of measured hope. The gap between the action we could take to reduce global heating and the action we are actually taking can be measured by a brutally simple metric: human suffering. That means every action that closes that gap, however small, is meaningful. Deadly floods, hurricanes, heatwaves and bushfires are already taking lives and ruining livelihoods, and large and rapid cuts in carbon emissions are needed to prevent the damage from becoming far greater. But there is no deadline after which the planet explodes, no point at which action becomes pointless. The idea of a deadline for saving civilisation stems from a 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a collaboration of the world\u2019s top scientists. It found that cutting emissions by about 45% by 2030 would give a reasonable chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C, the target agreed on by UN nations in Paris in 2015. But the scientists who wrote the report have said it is wrong to interpret that as a 12-year deadline, with some suggesting a Guardian headline at the time is partly to blame. Other media, such as the Washington Post, used similar framing, and the 12-year deadline has been cited by people as disparate as UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, Prince Charles and Jeremy Corbyn. With a problem to solve, setting a timeline feels necessary. But Greta Thunberg, with characteristic clarity, recently spelled out the mistake: \u201cIt\u2019s never too late to do as much as we can, every fraction of a degree matters,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are of course no magical dates for saving the world.\u201d Fundamentally, fighting the climate crisis is about fighting the injustice that it magnifies.

As Prof Myles Allen of the University of Oxford has pointed out, slavery was once a highly profitable provider of energy and we brought it to an end because it was an affront to the values that make us human. All very noble, you might be thinking. But what about the cost of action? The answer is that the cost of inaction is far greater. The Paris agreement already passes the cost-benefit test and, in any case, there is no economic growth on a destructive, hothouse Earth \u2013 as the financial sector is beginning to recognise. Taken together, the justice and economic arguments make it imperative that every decision taken every day by governments, businesses and communities must pass the climate test: will it cut emissions? From power plants to buildings, transport to farming, projects commissioned today will be running well beyond 2030. Tackling the climate emergency means tough decisions today, not promises for tomorrow. In the UK, one imminent test is whether the government\u2019s long-delayed \u00a3100bn national infrastructure plan, which includes many green initiatives, survives the coronavirus outbreak.

It\u2019s not like dried pasta or toilet roll which you can put in a cupboard \u2013 with frozen food you have to put it somewhere cold.\u201d \u201cThere is going to be some pressure on the supply chain but most companies will be able to respond to that,\u201d said Harrow. \u201cThe unknown is if the coronavirus starts to take hold and factories lose workers \u2013 but nobody knows that.\u201d The surge in sales of frozen food and freezers comes amid a spate of panic buying which has forced major retailers to impose restrictions on in-demand goods. Many shoppers were greeted with empty shelves at the weekend after a run on pasta, anti-bacterial wipes, hand soap, toilet paper and children\u2019s medications. The major supermarkets including Tesco, Asda and Morrisons have already imposed limits on the number of items shoppers can purchase in key product areas such as antibacterial cleaner, toilet paper, hand sanitiser and long-life milk. On Tuesday, Sainsbury\u2019s imposed a limit of five items per customer on cleaning products and hand wash, and two packs of pain relief medication.",

No awards, books or television career to speak of, but he once saw a bloke on the tube laughing out loud while reading his column. He lives in hope that in another five years or so he might spot another one. Or even the same one</p>",

      "bodyText": "A range of companies, ranging from the world\u2019s biggest exhibition company to a furniture retailer and a firm which runs hostels for backpackers, have spelled out the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on their businesses. Informa, which specialises in business-to-business events around the world, has postponed or cancelled almost 130 events worth more than \u00a3400m in revenue due to the coronavirus outbreak. Furniture retailer DFS said that more than \u00a3200m of sales it would normally expect in the run-up to Easter are now at risk, while Safestay, which operates hostels across Europe, said it was facing \u201ca material downturn\u201d in bookings. Informa, a FTSE 100 company, which has suffered a \u00a31bn drop in its market value since the start of the year as a result of share price falls, said that its events arm accounts for about 65% of \u00a32.9bn in total group revenues. It has rescheduled about 45 large events worth about \u00a3350m in budgeted revenue. Another 70 smaller events have been rescheduled worth about \u00a350m. Thirteen events, worth about \u00a325m, have been cancelled so far. The company has a portfolio of more than 450 business-to-business events and exhibitions with about 40% of revenue in North America, 30% in Asia, 10% from the Middle East and the remainder across Europe and the rest of the world. Exhibitions that have been moved include the Natural Products Expo, Game Developers Conference (GDC), HotelEx and Aesthetic World Congress. Stephen Carter, Informa\u2019s chief executive, said that in the case of widespread cancellations the company is not fully covered by insurance. He said insurance policies either don\u2019t cover communicable diseases or have \u201cpayouts capped or collared in some way\u201d. The hostel company Safestay said in a stock market update that the spread of coronavirus was having an impact on bookings throughout its network, which includes hostels in the UK, Italy, Germany, Spain and several other European countries. \u201cWe have experienced a material reduction in new bookings over the last week against our expectations and there have been a growing number of group bookings from schools and colleges which have been cancelled or postponed,\u201d the company said. The furniture retailer DFS, which also owns Sofology, Dwell and Sofa Workshop, said the number of shoppers coming into its showrooms had dropped since last Tuesday. The chief executive, Tim Stacey, said the firm normally takes \u00a3330m of orders between now and June, the end of its financial year, with Easter and the May bank holidays particularly busy. Some of that is already in its order book, but the rest \u2013 about \u00a3220m \u2013 is at risk if the virus continues to spread in the UK. DFS has four factories in China which were shut for an extra three weeks following the lunar new year break, but are getting back to normal. A UBS analyst, Olivia Townsend, said the impact of the virus on retailers had shifted away from potential stock shortages from factory shutdowns in China to the impact on sales. Clothing retailers, she said, could also suffer as many spring and summer ranges are due to launch this month, but she also said DFS could take a big hit in coming months: \u201cThe high ticket value of sofas may mean DFS is more impacted by lower consumer spending than retailers selling lower-priced items.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been three cases of coronavirus in Gloucestershire, including one in the Cheltenham area.</p> \n<p>Measures have been put in place to quickly remove anybody from the racecourse who is suspected of coming down with the virus during the event. Teams of paramedics and St John Ambulance workers patrolled the grounds.</p> \n<p>Ian Renton, a regional director for the Jockey Club, said the organisers had been liaising closely with government over the last fortnight.</p> \n<p>Asked if it would have been wiser to call off the event, Renton said: \u201cWe have to listen to the advice of the government. We shouldn\u2019t be making our own decisions on this. We will put everything in place for racegoers to make sure precautions are here.\u201d</p> \n<p>There was no sign that the number of Irish visitors had dropped off significantly.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But as the crisis in Italy grows, so does the niggling fear here.

There are good clinical reasons for not leaping to the nuclear options yet, including the risk that people will get bored and break out of self-isolation if it lasts too long, but any whiff of political interference from a government desperate to keep the economy ticking over sets alarm bells ringing.

      "bodyText": "The world is \u201cway off track\u201d in dealing with the climate emergency and time is fast running out, the UN secretary general has said. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres sounded the alarm at the launch of the UN\u2019s assessment of the global climate in 2019. The report concludes it was a record-breaking year for heat, and there was rising hunger, displacement and loss of life owing to extreme temperatures and floods around the world. Scientists said the threat was greater than that from the coronavirus, and world leaders must not be diverted away from climate action. The climate assessment is led by the UN\u2019s World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with input from the UN\u2019s agencies for environment, food, health, disasters, migration and refugees, as well as scientific centres. In 2019 the oceans were at the hottest on record, with at least 84% of the seas experiencing one or more marine heatwaves. Surface air temperatures around the world were the hottest ever recorded, after a natural El Ni\u00f1o event boosted figures in 2016. The report says results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate 2018-19 was the 32nd year in a row in which more ice was lost than gained. The melting of land ice combined with thermal expansion of water pushed sea levels up to the highest mark since records began. The long-term decline of Arctic sea ice also continued in 2019, with the September average extent \u2013 usually the lowest of the year \u2013 the third worst on record. \u201cClimate change is the defining challenge of our time.

Floods and storms contributed most to displacing people from their homes, particularly Cyclone Idai in Mozambique and its neighbours, Cyclone Fani in south Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The number of internal displacements from such disasters is estimated to have been close to 22 million people in 2019, up from 17 million in 2018. The US saw heavy rains, with the total from July 2018 to June 2019 being the highest on record. Total economic losses in the US for the year were estimated at $20bn, the WMO said.

The WMO said unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, which is the worst for decades and expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.

      "bodyText": "Up to 100 new pop-up fever clinics, a $30m advertising campaign and a Medicare item for telehealth consultations will form part of a $2.4bn government health package aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus. The health response, to be unveiled by the Morrison government on Wednesday, comes as Australia recorded its 100th confirmed case of coronavirus, and as doctors criticised the \u201cconfusing\u201d process that had seen patients queuing for hours at public hospitals to access a test for the Covid-19 virus. The government is also finalising a \u201csubstantial\u201d multifaceted economic stimulus package, expected to be detailed on Thursday, aimed at averting a widely tipped recession that could end Australia\u2019s 29-year record of uninterrupted economic growth. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and health minister, Greg Hunt, will announce details of the health package on Wednesday, with the health sector to receive a $2.4bn funding injection to help cope with the looming crisis. A key part of the package will be $205m for up to 100 new pop-up fever clinics that will be located in areas of need, and which will test people who are concerned they may have the virus. The aim is to divert people with mild or moderate symptoms away from hospital emergency departments and GP clinics to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. Severe cases will still present at hospitals. Each of the slated clinics, to be staffed by GPs and nurses, will be able to see up to 75 patients a day over six months, with the potential of testing up to a million individuals within the next six months. Some of the new clinics will be established in existing practices, while others will be set up as standalone pop-up centres, with existing clinics to receive an initial $150,000 to set up and to help offset losses from normal business. While the government has indicated a pandemic is likely, efforts have so far been aimed at slowing the spread of the virus to allow the health system to cope with an expected surge in demand. Authorities are warning the spread of the disease could peak as early as May, ahead of the normal winter flu season. Today\u2019s package will also include a new Medicare item to allow doctors to charge for phone or video consultations for people with coronavirus symptoms who remain at home in self-isolation and quarantine, costing $100m for the next six months. The service, which will start on Friday, is aimed at reducing the risk of exposure to others in the community and will be fully bulk billed. It will be made available to people isolating themselves at home on the advice of a medical practitioner or the guidance of the chief medical officer, and those who meet the \u201cprotocol criteria\u201d for suspected infection based on advice from coronavirus hotline numbers or other trained staff. Vulnerable groups, including those aged over 70, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged over 50, those with chronic health conditions, parents with new babies and people who are pregnant, will also be able to use the service. Any doctor forced into home isolation or quarantine will be able to continue providing services to their patients via telehealth, \u201cas long as they have the capacity to provide services safely and in accordance with normal professional standards from home or other isolation area\u201d. The funding boost will be accompanied by a national $30m communications campaign, expected to start within days, that will have information to \u201cprevent and mitigate the impacts of coronavirus\u201d. Morrison said the package, which also includes a $500m hospital funding package already announced for the states, would ensure Australia was as well prepared \u201cas any country in the world\u201d to respond to the virus threat. \u201cWe\u2019re ensuring our health system is well-prepared and has the resources it needs for our fight against coronavirus,\u201d Morrison said, ahead of Wednesday\u2019s announcement. \u201cOur medical experts have been preparing for an event like this for years and this is the next step up in Australia\u2019s plan.\u201d The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government\u2019s focus was on ensuring the capacity of the health system to be able to effectively assess, diagnose and treat people with the virus in a way that minimised the spread of the disease in the community. \u201cWe are ensuring people can access essential care in a way that reduces their potential exposure to infection,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, the shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said the telehealth rebate and a better testing process needed to be \u201curgent\u201d priorities for the government, and also backed the need for a comprehensive public information campaign. He also called for the government to increase resources for pathology testing, a new information app, and for the government to respond to concerns from GPs about access to medical supplies such as face masks and protective equipment. \u201cSome doctors have said to me that they are getting enough support but many have said they\u2019re not and really we cannot have any situation where a doctor feels they are not getting enough support,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve given the government time, we\u2019ve given the government constructive engagement but the time has now passed for discussion, we need to give GPs and healthcare professionals every support possible.\u201d",

Albanese\u2019s approval is steady on 41% and the Labor leader\u2019s disapproval is up two points from 31% to 33%. These movements are largely inside the poll\u2019s margin of error, which is plus or minus 3%.</p> <p>The poll also suggests Australian voters have a firmer fix on Morrison than Albanese. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of the prime minister\u2019s performance, only 10% of the survey said they didn\u2019t know, while a quarter of the sample is still on the fence about Albanese. But the trend in the survey suggests people are beginning to develop clearer views about the Labor leader. Last July, 37% of the sample didn\u2019t know whether they approved or disapproved, compared with 26% now.</p> <p>The mild recovery for Morrison comes as the government finalises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/morrison-warns-coronavirus-hit-could-be-worse-than-gfc-amid-recession-predictions\">a multi-billion dollar stimulus</a> to try and stave off <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/australian-stock-market-down-733-in-worst-day-since-gfc-as-coronavirus-sparks-recession-fears\">a domestic</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/global-stock-markets-post-biggest-falls-since-2008-financial-crisis\">recession triggered by the coronavirus</a>. Morrison on Tuesday warned the economic effects of the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/morrison-warns-coronavirus-hit-could-be-worse-than-gfc-amid-recession-predictions\">could be worse than the global financial crisis</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/stimulus-package-to-protect-economy-from-coronavirus-impact-expected-within-days\">The government has signalled</a> that a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/09/deeming-rates-explained-how-they-work-and-why-pensioners-want-them-changed\">changes to deeming rates</a>, and immediate support for small and medium-sized businesses will form part of the stimulus package, which is expected to be unveiled before Morrison meets the premiers this Friday at the Council of Australian Governments. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also softened the ground for some form of handout to boost consumption, confirming the government will look to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/australian-government-stimulus-package-promises-financial-support-as-fast-as-possible\">support people through the tax and transfer system</a> to ensure \u201cthe support gets out there as fast as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Ahead of the stimulus package, the government will unveil a $2.4 billion health package aimed at boosting the capacity of the sector to cope with the outbreak and slowing the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The Morrison government also continues to be dogged by the sports grants controversy, which shows no sign of abating. Senate hearings are under way to try and untangle mismanagement in the grants program that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/01/while-bridget-mckenzie-hovers-in-no-mans-land-were-left-waiting-for-a-clear-explanation\">savaged by the Australian National Audit Office</a>.</p> <p>Voters remain concerned. A majority of the Guardian Essential sample, 71%, wants sports \u201crorts\u201d investigations to continue. Less than half the sample (43%) believes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/02/bridget-mckenzie-resigns-following-sports-rort-affair\">the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s resignation</a> is the end of the matter.</p> <p>Public sentiment about the coronavirus is also evolving <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/this-is-a-mess-put-on-your-mask-diary-from-the-frontline-of-the-coronavirus-health-crisis\">as events rapidly unfold</a>. The survey this fortnight suggests more people are \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the virus than they were a month ago, but less people say they are \u201cquite\u201d concerned.</p> <p>Around a third of the sample believe they will become infected as the virus hits the point of community transmissions, while 69% of the sample thinks it is somewhat unlikely or very unlikely that they will get ill.</p> <p>According to responses to a series of questions posed this week about which major party is best placed to manage particular events \u2013 voters continue to rate the Coalition as better than Labor at managing both a major health crisis and an economic one \u2013 even though the then Rudd government\u2019s management of the global financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/jun/30/labors-stimulus-package-got-us-through-a-crisis-turnbull-saying-otherwise-is-silly\">helped keep Australia out of recession</a>.</p> <p>The Coalition is also rated ahead of Labor on managing security threats and on managing the challenge of Australia\u2019s ageing of the population.

A majority said the Coalition was better at managing the economy to benefit big business, and a majority thought Labor was better at managing the economy to benefit workers.</p> <p>The government was rated ahead of Labor at managing the economy generally and managing the economy to benefit small business, while Labor was in front on managing the economy to benefit older Australians and people in regional communities.</p> <p>With the government signalling it will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/28/angus-taylor-to-announce-shift-in-climate-investment-away-from-wind-and-solar\">rebalance support away from renewables and towards other low emissions technologies</a> as part of a looming energy policy roadmap, voters were also asked for their views on that shift.</p> <p>A majority of the sample clearly favours further taxpayer funded research into renewables (71%) while some of the technologies favoured by the government are down the priority list. Hydrogen attracts a thumbs up from 57%, \u201cclean\u201d coal 50% and nuclear energy 38%.</p> <p>There has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/jun/07/opinion-polls-fail-federal-election-australian-politics-live-podcast\">controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling</a>, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory last May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48.</p> <p>The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/21/as-pollsters-we-are-rightly-in-the-firing-line-after-the-australian-election-what-happened\">flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis</a>.</p> <p>Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/09/conservatives-agitating-for-religious-freedom-law-but-coalition-voters-not-on-board-essential-poll\">responses to questions</a> about the leaders and a range of policy issues.</p> <p>The sample size this fortnight is 1,096 respondents.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has pulled back in front of Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister, and Morrison has recorded a slight improvement in his approval rating as the coronavirus has dominated the headlines, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. As the government moves to finalise its stimulus package, the latest survey finds Morrison is preferred as prime minister by 40% of the sample and Albanese by 35% \u2013 a five-point rebound. The prime minister lost his lead on the head-to-head preferred prime minister measure in January during the sharp voter backlash over the catastrophic summer bushfires, and the slump was sustained. Last month Morrison and Albanese were level pegging on 36%. Morrison\u2019s approval has also increased from 39% to 41% in a month, and his disapproval has gone from 52% to 49%. Albanese\u2019s approval is steady on 41% and the Labor leader\u2019s disapproval is up two points from 31% to 33%. These movements are largely inside the poll\u2019s margin of error, which is plus or minus 3%. The poll also suggests Australian voters have a firmer fix on Morrison than Albanese. Asked whether they approve or disapprove of the prime minister\u2019s performance, only 10% of the survey said they didn\u2019t know, while a quarter of the sample is still on the fence about Albanese. But the trend in the survey suggests people are beginning to develop clearer views about the Labor leader. Last July, 37% of the sample didn\u2019t know whether they approved or disapproved, compared with 26% now. The mild recovery for Morrison comes as the government finalises a multi-billion dollar stimulus to try and stave off a domestic recession triggered by the coronavirus. Morrison on Tuesday warned the economic effects of the pandemic could be worse than the global financial crisis. The government has signalled that a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners through changes to deeming rates, and immediate support for small and medium-sized businesses will form part of the stimulus package, which is expected to be unveiled before Morrison meets the premiers this Friday at the Council of Australian Governments. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has also softened the ground for some form of handout to boost consumption, confirming the government will look to support people through the tax and transfer system to ensure \u201cthe support gets out there as fast as possible\u201d. Ahead of the stimulus package, the government will unveil a $2.4 billion health package aimed at boosting the capacity of the sector to cope with the outbreak and slowing the spread of the virus. The Morrison government also continues to be dogged by the sports grants controversy, which shows no sign of abating. Senate hearings are under way to try and untangle mismanagement in the grants program that was savaged by the Australian National Audit Office. Voters remain concerned. A majority of the Guardian Essential sample, 71%, wants sports \u201crorts\u201d investigations to continue. Less than half the sample (43%) believes the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s resignation is the end of the matter. Public sentiment about the coronavirus is also evolving as events rapidly unfold. The survey this fortnight suggests more people are \u201cvery\u201d concerned about the virus than they were a month ago, but less people say they are \u201cquite\u201d concerned. Around a third of the sample believe they will become infected as the virus hits the point of community transmissions, while 69% of the sample thinks it is somewhat unlikely or very unlikely that they will get ill. According to responses to a series of questions posed this week about which major party is best placed to manage particular events \u2013 voters continue to rate the Coalition as better than Labor at managing both a major health crisis and an economic one \u2013 even though the then Rudd government\u2019s management of the global financial crisis helped keep Australia out of recession. The Coalition is also rated ahead of Labor on managing security threats and on managing the challenge of Australia\u2019s ageing of the population. Labor is rated ahead of the Coalition on managing a major environmental crisis, and also managing the transition to a low carbon economy. Voters in the sample were also asked more specific questions about economic management. A majority said the Coalition was better at managing the economy to benefit big business, and a majority thought Labor was better at managing the economy to benefit workers. The government was rated ahead of Labor at managing the economy generally and managing the economy to benefit small business, while Labor was in front on managing the economy to benefit older Australians and people in regional communities. With the government signalling it will rebalance support away from renewables and towards other low emissions technologies as part of a looming energy policy roadmap, voters were also asked for their views on that shift. A majority of the sample clearly favours further taxpayer funded research into renewables (71%) while some of the technologies favoured by the government are down the priority list. Hydrogen attracts a thumbs up from 57%, \u201cclean\u201d coal 50% and nuclear energy 38%. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory last May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The sample size this fortnight is 1,096 respondents.",

Banks are coming under more funding pressure and margins are compressed. Although they passed on the rate cut last week they don\u2019t have much wriggle room left. As rates are cut, banks lend less because they can\u2019t make as much. Mortgages are less available, not more.\u201d Not every industry professional is pessimistic, however, with many believing that the tried and tested benefits of investment in property will overcome any short-term difficulties that might emerge. Frank Valentic, a buyer\u2019s agent at Advantage Property in Melbourne, says there is no sign of any impact from the virus and notes that the market has already passed the last peak in September 2017. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain scare factor out there but I\u2019ve not seen any sign of it so far. People are still queueing up to get in the door for inspections. \u201cIf anything the situation with the stock market this week could have the opposite effect on property. People will want to put money into bricks and mortar. Its doubling every 7-10 years compared to watching savings lose value overnight in the share market.\u201d",

For the next month, until 3 April, 60 million Italians will be obliged to remain at home, and have been ordered to go outside only for \u201curgent\u201d work, to attend health appointments or to purchase basic provisions.

Earlier this week, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston quoted a UK government source as saying Italian officials\u2019 measures showed that \u201cthey\u2019re who not to follow\u201d, and that their approach has been \u201cpopulist\u201d and \u201cnon-science-based\u201d.</p> <p>There is some basis for these criticisms.

In response, thousands of people from Italy\u2019s worst-hit areas headed south to relatively poor regions such as Puglia and Calabria, which until now have been largely unaffected by the virus, to avoid being separated from friends and relatives. This was a huge political blunder: a lapse of institutional protocol and civic responsibility that has put the weakest parts of Italy\u2019s health infrastructure at risk. Conte\u2019s decision to extend the lockdown to the entire country is, above all else, an attempt to limit that exodus.</p> <p>The facts that underpin the lockdown demonstrate how dangerous political infighting can be in moments of emergency.

Whatever the motivation, this is not the first time League officials have worked to undermine Rome. Last week, as Conte sought to contain public panic, the president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, attacked the government\u2019s \u201ccomplacency\u201d on a television talkshow, while wearing a face mask. Matteo Salvini, the party leader, has <a href=\"https://qz.com/1807049/hysteria-over-coronavirus-in-italy-is-reminiscent-of-the-black-death/\" title=\"\">blamed immigrants</a> from both China and Africa for the outbreak, and has suggested that the ruling coalition\u2019s \u201copen border policy\u201d has played a role in the spread of the virus. Managing a public health emergency requires trust between the state and citizens. These figures have actively weakened that bond, putting health at risk.</p> <p>Yet despite these political tensions, it would be unfair to dismiss the work of the Italian authorities as a whole. In fact, contrary to Peston\u2019s source in the UK government, health experts continue to point to Italy as a model example of how to tackle the coronavirus. Shortly before Conte\u2019s announcement on Monday, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised the \u201caggressive measures\u201d that the Italians have taken, confirming that the organisation fully supports their actions. Italy\u2019s doctors and nursing staff have worked efficiently to track and treat Covid-19. The country has conducted <a href=\"https://en24.news/n/2020/03/coronavirus-todays-toll-97-dead-7985-positive-in-italy.html\" title=\"\">53,826 swabs</a> for the virus \u2013 a figure that is significantly higher than any other European country \u2013 and it has been admirably transparent in sharing information. This foresight should enable Italy to work efficiently on containment in the longer term. More importantly, this data has already enabled Conte to declare an emergency and to secure concessions on EU borrowing limitations in order to tackle it. The government has announced <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-51782513\" title=\"\">a programme</a> of wage subsidies, tax cuts, exemptions from utility bills and suspended mortgage repayments to help those living under quarantine.</p> <p>Conte continues to insist that the Italian government will prioritise its citizens\u2019 health over the budget, spending whatever it has to in order to limit the emerging epidemic. It\u2019s hardly surprising, then, that Italians have seen Donald Trump\u2019s continued insistence that this is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237027356314869761\" title=\"\">akin to the common flu</a> \u2013 or the UK\u2019s delay in implementing measures such as banning large gatherings and sports fixtures \u2013 as astonishingly complacent. While the mortality rate remains fairly low, the country has seen a huge spike in patients who have required intensive care.

For the next month, until 3 April, 60 million Italians will be obliged to remain at home, and have been ordered to go outside only for \u201curgent\u201d work, to attend health appointments or to purchase basic provisions.

First, the paper panickers (PPs): the people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-stockpiling-supermarkets-toilet-paper-hand-gel\" title=\"\">stockpiling toilet paper</a>. While most PPs are well aware that loo roll is inedible and does not wipe away the virus, they do not seem to care; they are hoarding it anyway. These people do not want to die with any stain on their reputation.</p> <p>The second group, who are <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-shares-twitter-meme-fiddling-critics-compare-nero/story?id=69488386\" title=\"\">fiddling while Rome burns</a>, are the narcissistic Neros. By \u201cgroup\u201d, I mean Donald Trump. While it is tempting to include Boris Johnson in this category, I reckon he is type three: public school psychopath. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1237053212886212609?s=20\" title=\"\">recent TV appearance</a>, Johnson suggested one approach to the virus would be to \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d and \u201callow the disease to move through the population\u201d. This is another way of saying \u201clet vulnerable people die\u201d.</p> <p>Then there are the fatalists. A big shoutout to the woman I saw on the subway eating crisps with the same hand she was using to hold the pole.</p> <p>Last but not least, the grifters \u2013 the people embracing coronacapitalism. Take Scott Disick. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is selling T-shirts and hoodies with PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS written on them. The hoodies cost $129.</p> <p>This is nothing compared with the US televangelist Jim Bakker, who recently got in trouble for a claim made on his show that a product for sale on his website, called Silver Solution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/09/jim-bakker-letitia-james-coronavirus-product-stop-promoting\" title=\"\">could cure coronavirus</a>.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus crisis has revealed five distinct personality types. First, the paper panickers (PPs): the people stockpiling toilet paper. While most PPs are well aware that loo roll is inedible and does not wipe away the virus, they do not seem to care; they are hoarding it anyway. These people do not want to die with any stain on their reputation. The second group, who are fiddling while Rome burns, are the narcissistic Neros. By \u201cgroup\u201d, I mean Donald Trump. While it is tempting to include Boris Johnson in this category, I reckon he is type three: public school psychopath. In a recent TV appearance, Johnson suggested one approach to the virus would be to \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d and \u201callow the disease to move through the population\u201d. This is another way of saying \u201clet vulnerable people die\u201d. Then there are the fatalists. A big shoutout to the woman I saw on the subway eating crisps with the same hand she was using to hold the pole. Last but not least, the grifters \u2013 the people embracing coronacapitalism. Take Scott Disick. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is selling T-shirts and hoodies with PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS written on them. The hoodies cost $129. This is nothing compared with the US televangelist Jim Bakker, who recently got in trouble for a claim made on his show that a product for sale on his website, called Silver Solution, could cure coronavirus. Nor is Disick as bad as the people who are trying to flog hand sanitiser on Amazon for hundreds of pounds, or the Amazon sellers hawking books such as Jesus vs Satan: The Origins of Coronavirus, which claims that the devil caused the epidemic. (Satan could not be reached for comment.) Coronavirus is not only a public health crisis; it also seems to be a money-making opportunity.

Tens of thousands of flights have been cancelled. Italian bishops are not conducting mass. Across much of central China, factories have been closed, with knock-on effects around the world.</p> <p>The virus has disrupted several events linked to the fossil fuel industry. In the past few weeks, the Geneva Motor Show was cancelled, after Switzerland banned all public gatherings of more than 1,000 people. In Houston, the giant annual CeraWeek gathering of oil and gas executives was called off, as was the Formula One grand prix in Shanghai.</p> <p>More carbon savings will come from the cancellations of international conferences. Donald Trump has postponed a 14 March summit with the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The London Book Fair, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Adobe\u2019s annual live summit and even South by Southwest, the huge annual film, music and media conference in Austin, Texas, have all been called off, which means thousands of tonnes less CO<sub>2</sub> from flights taken by international delegates.</p> <p>The worlds of entertainment, fashion and sport are similarly affected. Stormzy, Mariah Carey, Slipknot and New Order have all cancelled or postponed gigs, though most of the attendees were likely to have been local so the climate impact will be more modest. A bigger effect is likely to come from the postponement of Art Dubai, the biggest art fair in the Middle East. The closure for several weeks of Tokyo Disneyland and Disneysea, or the Universal Studios theme park in Osaka, Shanghai Disneyland and other attractions that usually draw tens of thousands of visitors every day, are also expected to result in fewer flights.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f0063561c3f29c32f75e6cf118ac7e0b4624e0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f0063561c3f29c32f75e6cf118ac7e0b4624e0b/0_27_4710_2826/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Root of Slipknot: the band have postponed their upcoming Asian tour, including Knotfest Japan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim Root of Slipknot: the band have postponed their upcoming Asian tour, including Knotfest Japan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Campanella/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global air traffic decreased by 4.3% in February with cancellations of tens of thousands of flights to affected areas. But Rob Jackson, the chair of <a href=\"https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/\">Global Carbon Project</a>, said this would only be meaningful if it led to long-term behavioural change, particularly in aviation, which is one of the fastest growing source of emissions.</p> <p>\u201cIf this could change the way we travel, it could lead to more virtual meetings,\u201d he said. Otherwise, \u201cI see no silver lining to the coronavirus. If gas emissions drop temporarily then great, but it won\u2019t be a meaningful change in the long term unless it shocks us in a global recession. Nobody wanted that in 2008 and nobody wants it now.\u201d</p> <p>There are encouraging signs. The 189-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending organisation, the World Bank, will replace their usual spring gathering in Washington with a virtual teleconference. This is a one-off emergency measure, but the economic and carbon savings could prompt calls for this to become the norm every year.</p> <p>The question is whether changes are temporary. China\u2019s climate gains \u2013 so far estimated at about 200 megatonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> \u2013 could be short-lived if factories later reopen and crank up production to make up for lost business. President Xi Jinping has indicated the government will provide extra stimulus packages to help the economy recover. Some reports suggest this could prove counterproductive for the climate if this means ramping up coal production or relaxing environmental controls. The last time China suffered a major threat to GDP growth was during the 2008-9 financial crisis. Within a year, extra government spending ensured both the economy and CO<sub>2 </sub>were back on an upward trajectory.</p> <p>Analysts say it is too early to know if coronavirus will push global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions onto the downward path that is needed if the world is to have any hope of keeping global heating to a relatively safe level of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. That depends on how far the outbreak spreads, and whether the economic effects are prolonged.</p> <p>Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia, said that so far the crisis is only likely to slow CO<sub>2</sub> growth, not reverse it. \u201cOver the past 10 years, emissions have grown at an annual rate of 1%, or about 317 megatonnes, so you would need a really big reduction to see a fall this year. It\u2019s plausible but I don\u2019t think we can say at this stage.\u201d</p> <p>But, Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 noted, even a slowdown would gain time for action \u2013 advances in technology, lower renewables prices and more public pressure on governments to change tack. The response to the coronavirus could also demonstrate that radical steps can work.</p> <p>\u201cYou can see that when governments see there is an emergency they act straight away with measures commensurate with the threat. That assessment has not yet been made in the case of climate change although governments have declared it an emergency,\u201d she said.</p> <p>If the outbreak continues, there are concerns that the virus could also force the cancellation of the EU-China summit in Leipzig in September, which would be bad news for diplomatic efforts to build a climate alliance between these two powers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"492a844db95f61d882c884b63d702de649872ef9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/492a844db95f61d882c884b63d702de649872ef9/0_359_5377_3226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evening traffic in Brussels.

Ryanair has followed British Airways and other airlines in reducing the number of flights to and from the country. The government said those arriving at Heathrow from Italy who were not easily able to self-isolate were being asked if they wanted to enter quarantine at a large hotel near the airport.

The sixth death happened on Monday night at Watford General hospital, part of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust. The patient was in their 80s and had underlying health conditions.

In other developments on Tuesday: The Foreign Office confirmed it was in contact with Britons in Vietnam after reports of nine new cases confirmed among travellers onboard a flight from London to Hanoi on 2 March, including seven British citizens. It said US authorities were planning a flight on Tuesday to repatriate British nationals on the Grand Princess cruise ship at the Port of Oakland, California. The Queen did not shake people\u2019s hands at a Buckingham Palace reception \u2013 unlike last week when she greeted people and shook hands while wearing gloves. Updated guidance for pregnancy advised expectant mothers suspected or confirmed to have coronavirus to attend an obstetric unit for birth.

The figures, released daily with a 24-hour delay to allow for verification, show eight areas where the virus has been detected for the first time. Earlier on Tuesday, the deputy chief medical officer for England defended the government\u2019s strategy of holding off on cancelling major outdoor events such as football matches and closing schools.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>I myself am no public health expert, but I am almost certain that sweeping statements about school closures and how the severity of the virus is being \u201cdownplayed\u201d are going to do nothing but generate clicks and spread panic.

The top track for our dancing was Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way by Richard\u2019s former band the Communards, a long-time favourite of my partner\u2019s. However, I cannot agree with the suggestion that Christians suffer equally with others in bereavement. Since my Janis died I have grown to envy Christians for their belief in pearly-gate reunions. This comfort is not available to atheists \u2013 for us it really is the end.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/10/cabinet-secretary-mark-sedwill-to-be-questioned-by-mps-about-work-of-government-and-priti-patel-live-news?page=with:block-5e67b8538f087df56e4c5d1b#block-5e67b8538f087df56e4c5d1b\">3.57pm.) </a>All opposition parties apart from the DUP backed the rebel amendment, tabled by the former Tory leader <strong>Sir Iain Duncan</strong> Smith, that was intended to stop the government using Huawei in 5G from 2023. Duncan Smith, who thinks the Chinese firm is a threat to UK national security, said that he was flexible about the deadline, but that he did want the government to set at timescale for the removal of Huawei from the network. Ministers have said that they will cap Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G at 35%, and that they want to lower this cap over time, as other supply options become available. In the debate <strong>Oliver Dowden</strong>, the culture secretary, said that the government would bring forward a telecommunications security bill by the summer, which MPs could amend, and that the government was committed to working with Five Eyes partners (ie, intelligence allies) on developing an alternative to Huawei during this parliament. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/10/cabinet-secretary-mark-sedwill-to-be-questioned-by-mps-about-work-of-government-and-priti-patel-live-news?page=with:block-5e67a7e58f087df56e4c5c0a#block-5e67a7e58f087df56e4c5c0a\">2.48pm.) </a>At one stage it looked as if the Dowden concessions had been choreographed to match the Duncan Smith demands and that Duncan Smith might withdraw his amendment. But during the debate Dowden failed to give Tory MPs the verbal assurances that they wanted, and Duncan Smith decided to force a vote.

We need to know that it is the government\u2019s intention to rid ourselves of high-risk vendors such as Huawei, it is the government\u2019s intention to do this within the bill that will come before us, and they will work now aggressively and at speed with our Five Eyes colleagues, inviting them in immediately to create a system that allows us to do that at the earliest opportunity, and to commence the beginnings of that retraction before the end of this parliament.

Neither side had to formalise the arrangement.</p> <p>The deal: that Johnson allows Sedwill to remain in his vastly influential dual role, as cabinet secretary and national security adviser, and in return Sedwill lets Johnson and his chief political aide Dominic Cummings, as one former official put it, \u201cdo whatever they want\u201d in terms of radical Whitehall reforms, a bold policy programme, and a hardline Brexit negotiating strategy.</p> <p>One senior official familiar with the workings of Johnson and Sedwill described the cabinet secretary as \u201cBoris\u2019s lackey\u201d.</p> <p>The phrase underlines the widespread view behind the scenes in Whitehall that Sedwill is failing in his duties to protect civil servants and special advisers \u2014 and the government at large \u2014 from the excesses of Johnson\u2019s Downing Street, and is unable to now control the conflict inbuilt in his role as adviser to the prime minister, broker to the cabinet, and head of the civil service.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e675f448f08c2df6d27691a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T09:38:41.977Z\">9.38am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Excluding Huawei from Britain\u2019s 5G network will \u201csignificantly set back\u201d the government\u2019s ambitions to extend broadband access, a former chairman of BT has warned.

In an open letter Rake said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Any attempt to further restrict Huawei 5G equipment, or to remove existing 4G equipment, will not only incur very significant costs, but prejudice trade relationships with China and will significantly set back the government\u2019s broadband ambitions.</p> <p>This in turn will further damage our competitiveness as an economy, at what is a critical moment.</p> <p>We cannot afford to set back the important technological and communication progress we have made, with ill-informed assertions which are not supported by the facts and the experts.</p> <p>The government has taken an evidence-based decision and we should all support it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rake was speaking ahead of a debate this afternoon which will see Tory rebels try to defeat the government on an amendment saying that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/09/huawei-government-tries-to-head-off-5g-network-rebellion\">Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G network should not last beyond the end of 2022. </a>But it is not clear yet whether or not the amendment will be \u201ccalled\u201d by the Speaker - ie, put to a vote.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e67524d8f08c2df6d2768c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T09:15:55.274Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill to be questioned by MPs about work of government and Priti Patel</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Good morning. House of Commons select committees finally started sitting last week, and this morning much of Westminster will be focused on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC), where<strong> Sir Mark Sedwill</strong>, the cabinet secretary, is giving evidence.</p> <p>Sedwill is the most powerful civil servant in Whitehall and even in quiet times his job is fascinating. More recently, for a host of reasons, he has found himself at the centre of the news agenda. This is what the committee is saying about the hearing.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Following the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, formerly permanent secretary to the Home Office, and his allegation of constructive dismissal and bullying against the home secretary, Rt Hon Priti Patel MP, the committee will examine the working relationships between government ministers and officials. This is likely to include the role of the cabinet secretary in resolving disputes and the provisions of the ministerial code.</p> <p>The wide-ranging session will also investigate other topical issues, including the appointment, terms of employment and accountability of special advisers (SPADs); changes to the machinery of government and to the constitution; and preparations for the 2021 census. The committee will also ask about the work of the Cabinet Office more broadly.</p> </blockquote> <p>In theory the hearing should be gripping. But in practice - well, maybe not. Cabinet secretaries are a bit like the Queen; they may know everything, but they have also perfected the art of speaking at length in public without giving anything much away. We will find out soon whether PACAC has enough guile to tempt Sedwill into making news.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> <p><em>9.45am: </em>Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 12.30pm:</em> MPs begin debating the remaining stages of the telecommunications infrastructure (leasehold property) bill.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is under pressure to announce a firm deadline for the removal of Huawei from the UK\u2019s 5G network after 38 Tory MPs rebelled in a vote on the issue, slashing his majority by almost three quarters. The PM still won the division reasonably comfortably, but he should have a working majority of 87, and instead he won by just 24. (See 3.57pm.) All opposition parties apart from the DUP backed the rebel amendment, tabled by the former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, that was intended to stop the government using Huawei in 5G from 2023. Duncan Smith, who thinks the Chinese firm is a threat to UK national security, said that he was flexible about the deadline, but that he did want the government to set at timescale for the removal of Huawei from the network. Ministers have said that they will cap Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G at 35%, and that they want to lower this cap over time, as other supply options become available. In the debate Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, said that the government would bring forward a telecommunications security bill by the summer, which MPs could amend, and that the government was committed to working with Five Eyes partners (ie, intelligence allies) on developing an alternative to Huawei during this parliament. (See 2.48pm.) At one stage it looked as if the Dowden concessions had been choreographed to match the Duncan Smith demands and that Duncan Smith might withdraw his amendment. But during the debate Dowden failed to give Tory MPs the verbal assurances that they wanted, and Duncan Smith decided to force a vote. (See 3.03pm.) The government is under growing pressure to toughen up its coronavirus response as the number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 373 and a sixth death was announced. There is full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak on our special live blog here. Ministers should behave professionally and courteously when dealing with civil servants and could be given training if they fail to do so, Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK\u2019s most senior civil servant, has told MPs. The chancellor must use the budget on Wednesday to announce an emergency stimulus package to help the economy cope with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, according to one of Britain\u2019s biggest investment companies. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The official division list for the Huawei vote is now up. Some 38 Tory MPs actively rebelled - two serving as tellers, and 36 voting against the government. That is 10 more than the number of Conservatives who signed the Iain Duncan Smith amendment that was put to the vote. There were also 22 Tory MPs who did not vote. Most of those were probably authorised absences, but the list may include some MPs who were actively abstaining rather than supporting the government. There were 17 Labour MPs who did not vote. Boris Johnson also had the support of the DUP in this vote, but only partially. Five of the DUP\u2019s eight MPs voted with the government; the other three did not vote. Last year the House of Commons became very good at releasing division lists quickly after votes took place. They were often available within 15 minutes or so. But today they have been hopeless - they\u2019re \u201ca bit rusty\u201d, an official told me - and they are still not available on the Commons website. But the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush has done us all a favour and compiled a list of the 38 Tory rebels. Here it is. Yesterday Rory Stewart, the former Tory international development secretary, made a dramatic intervention in the coronavirus debate, calling for all schools to be closed now. Stewart says his views were shaped by what happened with Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which led him to conclude that early action was vital in these circumstances, but there were also suspicions that his desire to say something hard-hitting may have been influenced by the fact that he is standing as an independent candidate for London mayor, and not making much of an impact in the race so far. Stewart\u2019s weakness as a candidate has been highlighted by new polling today for the Evening Standard showing his support on just 13%. He is in third place. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor, is miles ahead, on 49%, with a 25-point lead over his Conservative rival, Shaun Bailey. Philip Cowley, politics professor at Queen Mary University of London, has an analysis of the results here. Here is an excerpt. After four years in office, Londoners largely know what they think about their Mayor Sadiq Khan, and these impressions are more positive than negative. More Londoners thought he was strong (33 per cent) than weak (25 per cent); competent (43 per cent) rather than incompetent (25 per cent), honest (45 per cent) rather than dishonest (16 per cent), more in touch (40 per cent) than out of touch (30 per cent) and a \u201creal Londoner\u201d (47 per cent) rather than not (24 per cent). These might not be brilliant ratings but they\u2019re alright. As well as a rebellion on Huawei, earlier today the government faced some \u2013 so far mild and very polite \u2013 objections to another area of policy from Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and rival to Boris Johnson for the Tory leadership. At health questions in the Commons, Hunt, who has so far been pointedly loyal since returning to the backbenches, asked about post-Brexit plans for immigration, and how a preferential system for health workers does not apply for social care staff \u2013 something the sector is deeply worried about. Addressing the new junior health and social care minister, Helen Whateley, Hunt said: Can I congratulate the department on securing this NHS visa, but as the minister knows, it does not apply to nurses and care workers in the social care sector. What is the department\u2019s assessment of the gap there will be in the social care workforce as a result of this new immigration policy, and how are discussions going with the Home Office and No 10 on that issue? Whateley replied that she was \u201cwell aware\u201d of concerns in the social care sector, but indicated the government was not about to shift. She said: It\u2019s important that employers are taking the steps that they can take to make sure that social care jobs are attractive, and of course should be well paid. This is a row which could run. Here is the Labour MP Toby Perkins on the Tory rebels. This is from the Tory MP Tim Loughton, explaining why he voted against the government. From the BBC\u2019s Vicki Young And this is from Bob Seely, who is one of the Tory rebels. The Conservative MP Steve Baker, who is something of an expert in organising Tory backbench rebellions, but who did back the government over Huawei this afternoon, says he thinks the government will have to include a firm deadline for the exclusion of Huawei from 5G when it introduces its telecommunications security bill later this year. As City AM\u2019s Cat Neilan points out, the result means that, if another 12 Tory MPs were to change sides, then Boris Johnson would see his majority disappear completely. The government has won the vote, but it has seen its majority slashed. MPs voted down Sir Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s amendment by 306 votes to 282 - a majority of 24. Allowing for the non-appearance of Sinn Fein, and deputy speakers not voting, Boris Johnson should have a working majority of 87. This is from Labour\u2019s Lucy Powell, who is missing the vote because her train has been held up. Earlier during the debate Liam Fox, the Conservative former international trade secretary, made a speech attacking government policy on Huawei. He said he had not accept the government argument that it had to use Huawei to develop 5G. He explained: This idea we must have Huawei because there are no other alternatives is also untrue. The United States is going to get 5G without Huawei because they will not bring that risk into their own national security, so what is wrong with the United Kingdom having to wait a little longer to get 5G, but 5G that will give us security in the long-term, even if it means waiting that little bit longer ... So what if it costs us a little bit more? Sir Iain Duncan Smith moves his amendment, amendment 1. MPs are now voting. The government has won the first vote, defeating a Labour amendment, by 343 to 242 - a majority of 101. According to the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford, Iain Duncan Smith will put his amendment to a vote. The debate is now over, and MPs are voting on a technical Labour amendment that has nothing to do with Huawei. Voting will take about 15 minutes, and the government will almost certainly win. Once that is over, Sir Iain Duncan Smith will get the chance to move his amendment. It is still not clear yet whether or not he will, but some of his colleagues certainly want him to. (See 3.09pm and 3.26pm.) They think the Oliver Dowden assurances did not go far enough. Owen Paterson, the Tory former cabinet minister and one of the supporters of the Iain Duncan Smith amendment, is speaking now. He says last week the government said it eventually wanted no Huawei involvement in 5G. But today, he says, MPs wanted to hear how it would get there. He says they needed to hear that there would be a point where there would be no high-risk vendors in the network. But he says the government is just talking about being able to get to a point where nobody \u201chas to use\u201d Huawei. He says nobody has to use Huawei; they can always use other suppliers. What is needed is a commitment to a date at which point there will be no high-risk vendors in the system, he says. From my colleague Dan Sabbagh Seely says, if MPs want to know what GCHQ thinks about Huawei, they should read what the Huawei oversight board says about the company. He quotes from the board saying it cannot give assurances about the safety of the company. These are from the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn on the Tory Huawei rebels. In the debate Bob Seely, one of the Tory MPs most critical of Huawei, is speaking now. He says in a Westminster Hall debate last week Matt Warman, the junior culture minister, was clear about how the government wanted to eventually end Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G. But he says Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was less clear about this today. In the Westminster Hall debate Warman said: \u201cWe want to get to a position where we are not reliant at all on high-risk vendors.\u201d This is from the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope. Oliver Dowden has now finished his speech. Earlier it sounded as if Sir Iain Duncan Smith was preparing to bank the concessions offered by the government and to pull his amendment - there is a very strong overlap between his list of conditions (see 2.29pm) and the Dowden offer (see 1.34pm and 2.48pm) - but at the last minute it started to look as though Dowden might have fluffed the negotiation. He was initially a bit equivocal about the government being committed to ending Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G, not just reducing it, and, even when he did clarify the government\u2019s desire to see Huawei out for good, he could not set a timetable for this. Duncan Smith does not have to say until the end of the debate whether or not he will put his amendment to a vote. In theory the debate could run until 6pm, but it is expected to wrap up well before that. Dowden is winding up his speech now. He says he accepts he has not given the Tory rebels everything they want. But he says that he hopes he has given them some of what they want, and explained how the government can get to the point which they all want to see, where there are no high-risk vendors in the network at all. I hope that through the remarks I\u2019ve made I have given some, and I accept that it is not all that right honourable members have been seeking, some comfort that first of all, the government appreciates the concerns they have raised. Secondly, that we are starting to set out a path to that ideal point that we all want to get to where we won\u2019t have any high-risk vendors at all and that they in turn will appreciate that this is not the end of the process. He stresses the point about how there will be \u201chuge opportunities\u201d for Tory MPs to propose amendments when the 5G legislation, the telecommunications security bill, comes to the Commons. The Tory MP Steve Brine says he will not support the Duncan Smith amendment. But he wants to know if the telecommunications security bill will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny. Dowden says he wants there to be maximum consultation on it. Labour\u2019s Chi Onwurah says he has heard nothing new from Dowden. Is Dowden just talking about diversification? Or is he talking about diversifiction, with a view to having no Huawei involvement? Dowden says he is making three new commitments today. He has promised to bring forward a new bill. He has promised to work with Five Eyes partners on this. And he has said that this process will happen in this parliament. And he is promising that the national cyber security centre will be allowed to give evidence to parliamentary committees about Huawei. The Tory MP Bob Seely asks if the government has a timetable for when Huawei might be removed from the network. Dowden says the government is not setting out a timetable now. But he says MPs will be able to table amendments on this when the 5G legislation comes to parliament. Sir Iain Duncan Smith intervenes again. He says the commitment to engage with Five Eyes is new, and a five-year timescale is new. But he says he wants clarity on the government being committed to having no involvement from Huawei. If he does not get clarity, he will push his amendment to a vote. Dowden says Duncan Smith will be able to raise this issue in the 5G legislation later this year. He says Duncan Smith\u2019s message has been heard and understood. He says the government wants to reduce its reliance on high-risk vendors. And he says he wants to get to the position where the government does not have to use them at all. But to get from point a to point b, the government needs to generate more capacity, he says. And he says other committees, as well as the intelligence and security committee, will be allowed to scrutinise this. Asked if the government can introduce 5G without Huawei, Dowden says of course it could be done without Huawei. Dowden says the government is clear it wants to diversify away from Huawei. He is setting out today how that might happen. He says the government is committed to working within this parliament to finding the capacity so that it can start to move away from Huawei. Owen Paterson, another Tory former cabinet minister who signed the Duncan Smith amendment, asks if the government can commit to getting Huawei\u2019s involvement down to zero. Dowden says the government is committed to diversification. David Davis, the Tory former Brexit secretary and a signatory to the Duncan Smith amendment, says Dowden is wrong to say there are no alternative providers. Dowden says Ericsson and Nokia are the only other providers available. But that is not enough at the moment. But he says the government is committed to working with its Five Eyes partners within this parliament to find alternative providers. Sir Iain Duncan Smith intervenes. He asks if it now government policy to move towards \u201cno involvement of high-risk vendors within our system\u201d? Dowden says he thinks they all agree; they would like to have no involvement from high-risk vendors. But, he says, there is no alternative capacity at the moment. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is speaking now. He says the government will introduce its 5G legislation before the summer recess. He says the government is \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about the risk posed by high-risk vendors. He says the 35% cap (the maximum amount of the 5G network allowed to Huawei) will be kept under review. And the government will be working with partners on finding alternative providers. That work will be carried out in this parliament, he says. But he says he cannot set a deadline for when Huawei might be excluded. He says MPs will be able to propose amendments on this when the 5G bill is being debated. This is what Sir Iain Duncan Smith said in the debate a few minutes ago when he set out what were effectively his negotiating demands to ministers - the conditions that would have to apply to persuade him not to put his amendment to a vote. He said: I need some absolute clarity from the secretary of state, as my colleagues I think do. Number one, that we do plan, and it is the government\u2019s intention, to move to essentially rid ourselves of high-risk vendors [ie, Huawei] from our system. And the point about that is there needs as well to be a concept of timescale in this. So I want the government to recognise and to accept that we have to set ourselves the task to do this ... we need to work with our real allies to get ourselves in the position where we can actually go on to rid ourselves of these high-risk vendors. I don\u2019t say that\u2019s not without difficulty. I do say to the government they need to make that pledge very clearly and they need to give it the timescale that they will have achieved this by, and commenced the process of winding out those high-risk vendors. And, last of all, if they don\u2019t want us to try and create trouble on this bill, I simply say they must give an absolute lock-tight commitment that the bill that is relevant to this returns before the summer break, as early as possible - it could be in May - so that we can properly see these commitments, plus others, written into the face of the bill so that we can understand that it is the government\u2019s intention. But it is absolutely critical for me, and I will only make my mind up on this when I have heard the absolute words of the secretary of state in this debate. We need to know that it is the government\u2019s intention to rid ourselves of high-risk vendors such as Huawei, it is the government\u2019s intention to do this within the bill that will come before us, and they will work now aggressively and at speed with our Five Eyes colleagues, inviting them in immediately to create a system that allows us to do that at the earliest opportunity, and to commence the beginnings of that retraction before the end of this parliament. I give way a little bit on these timescales, but I think I\u2019m being fairly reasonable. Duncan Smith says the government has said that it wants to work towards having no high-risk vendors (ie, no Huawei) in 5G. He accepts that this bill might not be the best vehicle for an anti-Huawei amendment. But he says he wants three things. First, he wants an assurance that the government will move towards eliminating Huawei from the network. That means working with allies. He says that pledge must be made clearly, with a timescale. And he says the government must commit to bringing forward a bill later this year, by May, setting out the government\u2019s intentions. He says he will only decide whether or not to pull his amendment when he has heard what the minister is saying. And he says the government must \u201ccommence the beginnings of that retraction before the end of this parliament\u201d. He repeats the point about willing to be flexible on his precise deadline. (See 1.59am.) Duncan Smith offers to call off revolt if government promises to include long-term plan to exclude Huawei in legislation. In the light of the commitments already made by Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, in his letter to MPs (see 1.34pm), it sounds more likely than not that Duncan Smith will pull his amendment later. Duncan Smith says the UK is alone in its assessment on this matter. He says its security partners take a different view of the threat posed by Huawei. Damian Green, the Tory former first secretary of state, says if the UK allows Huawei to build its 5G, other countries will do the same. So the effect of this decision will be to allow the Chinese to infiltrate telecoms in many countries, he says. Duncan Smith says that is a powerful argument. China will capture telecoms in these countries, he says. Duncan Smith says there is a danger that the UK would become even more dependent on Huawei. One estimate is that after three years the UK would be fully dependent on it for 5G. He says this would be a threat to national security. He says there are three other firms that could supply 5G infrastructure to the UK: Nokia, Ericsson and Samsung. He says people say these providers would cost more. But in a debate between cost and security, security should win every time, he says. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and former work and pensions secretary, is speaking now. He has tabled the rebel amendment backed by 26 Tories. (See 12.18pm and 1.30pm.) He says it is wrong to describe Huawei as a private company. It is owned by Chinese trade unions, and controlled by the Chinese government. And he says it is wrong to describe this as a market failure problem. He says it is just that other companies have not been able to compete with Huawei because it has been subsidised by the Chinese government. The Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence committee, intervenes. He says Duncan Smith\u2019s amendment may not be put to a vote today because of the latest assurances from the government. (See 1.34pm.) But he says they will have put down a marker. He says there are five possible global vendors. But two of them are not allowed to operate outside Japan and South Korea. If they were, the UK would not need to use Huawei, he says. Duncan Smith accepts this point. He says there used to be 12 firms in this market. He says he does not think Huawei technology is superior. It is just that they are cheaper because they are so heavily subsidised. The Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke asks if Duncan Smith would be willing to change the deadline he has set (December 2022) for the removal of Huawei. Duncan Smith says he is \u201cflexible\u201d on the date. But what matters is the government\u2019s commitment to getting rid of Huawei, he says. This is from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth on today\u2019s debate. Onwurah says Labour\u2019s amendment differs from Sir Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s (see 1.30pm) in two respects. She says Labour\u2019s would ban Huawei (or equipment from a \u201chigh-risk vendor\u201d, to use the government\u2019s terminology) immediately, while Duncan Smith\u2019s would only bring in a ban from 2023. And she says Labour\u2019s amendment would only apply to \u201cnewly deployed\u201d telecommunications infrastructure, while Duncan Smith\u2019s would apply to all telecommunications infrastructure, she says. These are from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Onwurah says Labour is not opposed to the bill as a whole. But Labour is siding with the Tory rebels. Jeremy Corbyn has tabled an amendment to the bill that is very similar to Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s. The Corbyn amendment says: Clause 1, page 2, line 16, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(f) the operator does not use designated high-risk vendors, as defined by the National Cyber Security Centre, in newly deployed electronic communications services.\u201d And the Duncan Smith amendment says: Clause 1, page 2, line 16, at end insert\u2014 \u201c(f) the operator does not, after 31 December 2022, use vendors defined by the National Cyber Security Centre as high-risk vendors.\u201d MPs have just started the report stage debate on the telecommunications infrastructure (leasehold property) bill. The bill has a very limited purpose. It is about giving telecoms firms the right to enter blocks of flats to install broadband when the tenants want it, but the landlord is failing to respond to requests for engineers to have access. But Tory MPs want to use the debate, and a vote on Sir Iain Duncan-Smith\u2019s amendment (see 12.18pm), to make a point about Huawei. The Duncan Smith amendment would not ban Huawei from the entire 5G network after 2022, only from networks being installed in leased premises under the terms of the bill, but later this year the government is planning to put forward legislation covering 5G, and MPs voting against Huawei today are also likely to vote against Huawei\u2019s general involvement in 5G when that bill gets debated. Chi Onwurah, the shadow industrial strategy minister, is opening for Labour. She welcomes the fact that Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is on the government bench, ready to speak for the government. Cabinet ministers normally leave it up to junior ministers to speak in report stage debates like this one, and Onwurah speculates that Dowden might be here to announce a government U-turn. As HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh reports, towards the end of health questions Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said the government would extend sick pay coverage so that the lowest-paid and the self-employed can get sick pay if they need to take time off because of coronavirus. Philip Hammond has warned that the country should be braced for a \u201csignificant dip\u201d in the economy as it deals with coronavirus and urged the new chancellor to intervene to help small businesses. Ahead of the budget tomorrow, Hammond, who served as Theresa May\u2019s chancellor, said the impact of the illness on the country would be \u201creal\u201d and he expected an economic slowdown. He suggested Rishi Sunak, who was promoted by Boris Johnson last month, should consider helping small firms with cashflow problems by postponing deadlines for VAT payments, national insurance and PAYE deductions. Hammond told the BBC\u2019s Radio 4 Today programme: [Coronavirus] will have an effect on the economy because that\u2019s already starting to happen. Whatever the outcome epidemiologically, the economic impact will be real and the chancellor will want to address that in his budget speech. I think he will want, and I would strongly advise that he announces, immediate short-term measures to ease the cashflow pressure that many small businesses will be feeling, and indeed some larger businesses. Boris Johnson is definitely facing a Commons revolt this afternoon, my colleague Dan Sabbagh reveals. He says it is understood that the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has selected the Huawei amendment to the telecommunications infrastructure (leasehold property) bill being debated this afternoon. Twenty-six Conservative MPs have signed the amendment tabled by the former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, Dan reports. Even though Labour is gearing up to support the rebels (see below), this would not be enough to defeat the government. Taking into account the non-attendance of Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, and the three deputy speakers who do not normally vote, Johnson has a working majority of 87. But if there is a vote (it is always possible Duncan Smith could pull his amendment in response to verbal assurances from the minister at the dispatch box), it will be the first proper revolt Johnson has faced on a Commons vote since the general election. There is an urgent question at 12.30pm, so the debate will probably start at around 1pm. In the Commons, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has just told MPs that the government is considering reviewing the list of people allowed to provide medical services in the light of coronavirus. Last week Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, told a committee that greater use could be made of medical students. This is what the health minister Jo Churchill told MPs a moment ago: that she was planning to give GPs an exemption from some health bureaucracy to allow them to have more time to focus on coronavirus. She was responding to Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, who asked if the government would suspend requirements for GPs to fill in forms relating to appraisals, and the quality and outcomes framework (QOF) during the crisis. Churchill replied: I\u2019m currently having those discussions to make sure that we can lift, within the bounds of making sure patients stay safe, all appropriate bureaucracy. In response to a question from Ashworth about the distribution of personal protective equipment to GPs, she said two thirds of this had been rolled out already, and that the rest would be arriving imminently. In the Commons Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, asks if government will lift the bureaucratic requirements on GPs so that they have more time to focus on coronavirus. Jo Churchill, the health minister who is replying, says that she is considering this. The public administration and constitutional affairs committee hearing has not quite finished, but Sir Mark Sedwill has managed to get through it so far without setting off many ripples across the pond of news. In the Commons, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has just started taking health questions. In response to a question about public health grants to councils, he said local authorities could plan with confidence on the basis that their budgets could be going up in real terms, and that a full announcement would be made shortly. Q: The government wants to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. But under the act, a committee is due to be set up this summer to review its operation. Will that still go ahead? Sedwill says in one sense the answer to this is the same as the answer on the democracy commission. (See 11.16am.) Options are being offered to ministers. The act could be repealed wholesale, or non-controversial parts of it could be retained, he says. Q: Is there a cut-off point when you have to decide whether or not to have the committee reviewing the act? Sedwill says he thinks that would have to be set up between June and November. He says it has not been decided yet what would happen. Q: Do you think it is best just to revert to the royal prerogative if the act is repealed? Sedwill says it is possible. But the question of whether the royal prerogative (ie, the PM\u2019s power to decide the date of a general election) would resume automatically if the FTPA was repealed, or whether if would have to be actively restored, has yet to be decided. He says elements of the FTPA were good. It gave clarity about the length of a parliament. But other aspects of it did not work well, as people discovered last year. Q: Can you tell us what the government\u2019s democracy commission will involve? Sedwill says officials have been working on options, but ministers have not taken the final decisions yet. Manzoni says there were 800 people working for the Department for Exiting the European Union when it closed. He says they moved to the Cabinet Office initially. Then around 100 went to the Foreign Office. Large numbers of staff also went to the business department and to HMRC, he says. And some of them joined David Frost\u2019s Brexit negotiating team. Sedwill says some of the former DExEU staff have been working on coronavirus, because they were already working on contingency planning. Q: Is there any precedent for all ministers being shared between two departments (as they are now, between the Foreign Office and DfID)? Sedwill says he is not aware of one. But he says in the past some ministers served the Foreign Office and DfID. Q: We now have joint ministers serving the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. To whom are their officials accountable? To both departments, Sedwill says. He says the costs are shared out. Q: If someone had expressed support for jihadis online, would they be acceptable? Sedwill says, of course, in those circumstances security vetting would be removed. He says he does not want to comment on Andrew Sabisky, or his views or on the vetting that he received. Q: Was Andrew Sabisky a special adviser or a contractor? Sedwill says he was a contractor. He was on a day rate, Sedwill thinks. He says it is not unusual for contractors to be used. Q: Did the PM approve his appointment? Sedwill says the PM does not approve contractors. Q: Was Sabisky vetted? Sedwill says it is normal for people to be vetted. In certain cases this is not necessary. But he says in this case he thinks security clearance was done. He says Sabisky would only have been at meetings for which he had appropriate security clearance. Q: What vetting process did Sabisky go through with regard to security? Sedwill says he will write to the committee about this. There are different checks he says: a basic security check; a counter-terrorism check; a more advanced security clearance; and developed vetting, which used to be called positive vetting, which is the highest check, used for people with access to security matters. Sedwill says he does not want to elaborate on what developed vetting involves. A few minutes later William Wragg, the committee chair, says he has just found the developed vetting form online. Sedwill says the form may be online, but he does not want to say what background checks are involved. Labour\u2019s Lloyd Russell-Moyle goes next. Q: The Conservative spad website says the No 10 communications director would be ultimately responsible for all hiring decisions. Is that correct? Or is the PM ultimately in charge? Sedwill says the website is not a matter for him. Q: Will the government benefit from having more weirdos and misfits in government? Sedwill says he likes Gus O\u2019Donnell\u2019s take on this; O\u2019Donnell, a former cabinet secretary, said anyone willing to work long hours for less money than they would get elsewhere could be considered a weirdo or a misfit. Sedwill says he would not necessarily use these terms. But he supports the idea of trying to bring new people into government who might have something to contribute. Sedwill says that in principle he approves of Dominic Cummings\u2019 desire to bring more \u2018weirdos and misfits\u2019 into government. Q: A new spad website has been set up. How is that being handled? Sedwill says that is nothing to do with him. It is a Conservative party matter. He says it is up to politicians to identify advisers they might want to recruit. Q: So who pays for it? The Conservative party, says Sedwill. He says Jack Straw, who he used to work for, ran a recruitment process when he was looking for special advisers. He says after ministers have identified people they want to hire, the civil service then brings them into the system. Q: Do you decide salaries? Sedwill says that is a government minister\u2019s decision. Various rules apply. Sedwill says anyone operating on behalf of the PM has to operate with his authority, and ultimately with his approval. And he says the PM is the ultimate arbiter of the ministerial code. He says he can only advise the PM on this. Q: Can you tell us about the new HR adviser being appointed to oversee special advisers (spads)? Sedwill says the government has been trying to provide more professional HR support to spads. He says spads serve with the consent of the PM. If that consent is withdrawn, statutory employment rights apply. Q: When is the review of spads\u2019 employment terms going to end? Sedwill says it is not a \u201ccapital R\u201d review. Q: Do spads join a trade union? Sedwill says they can. Some join the First Division Association. Q: How will incidents like the one involving Sonia Khan be resolved in future? Sedwill says he cannot discuss this specific case. But he says any special adviser who loses their job has statutory employment rights. Q: Does the ministerial code need to be rewritten? Sedwill says spads are part of collective government, but normally they have a close relationship with their minister too. Q: There has been media speculation that you could not focus properly on the problems in the Home Office because of your national security role? Sedwill says he was on leave some of the time during this period. He would have been on leave even if he had not been national security adviser. But he was in touch constantly anyway. He says the composition of the job has changed in the past, and will change again in the future. David Mundell, the Tory former Scottish secretary, is asking questions now. Q: There has been a lot of criticism of your \u201cdouble jobbing\u201d (Sedwill being national security adviser and cabinet secretary). How do you respond to that? Sedwill says this is not a new issue. In the past the cabinet secretary was also running the civil service, doing the job that John Manzoni does. He says, as cabinet secretary and national security adviser, his responsibilities overlap with the PM\u2019s. He says before 2010 there was no national security adviser. Before 2010 the cabinet secretary also oversaw national security. Q: Is there anything that the permanent secretary to the Scottish government does not have to report to you? Yes, says Sedwill. He says he would not expect the Scottish government\u2019s permanent secretary to tell him about Scottish government policy. Q: If there was a problem in devolved administrations, would the permanent secretary come to you? Sedwill says the cabinet secretary could become involved. Q: Has the permanent secretary in the Scottish or Welsh government ever had to report misbehaviour by a first minister to you? Sedwill says there is a limit to what he can say on this case. But he says the system as he described (that ultimately a complaint would be brought to him) has applied. Q: Why is the Northern Ireland civil service considered a separate service, but not the Scottish and Welsh civil service? Sedwill says the Northern Ireland civil service is separate because the Irish civil service was separate before 1922. That separation continued after 1922, he says. But he says they try to bind the Northern Ireland civil service into the GB one, so that they have access to the same talent pool. Q: Do permanent secretaries still have weekly meetings? Yes, says Sedwill. Q: And government policy is discussed there? Yes, says Sedwill. They also talk about civil service capabilities. Q: Do the permanent secretaries of the Scottish and Welsh government attend? Normally yes, says Sedwill. But he says that was not the case during the 2014 referendum (when the UK government and the Scottish government were at odds over independence). Sedwill says these meetings are normally information sharing meeting. Sedwill says he is the line manager for the head of the civil service for the Scottish government and the Welsh government. But he says, in that situation, the first minister is equivalent to a cabinet minister, who is expected to get on with the permanent secretary of their government, but also equivalent to the UK PM, in that they have the final say. Q: So if the Scottish government managed to stop Brexit, you would have given the permanent secretary of the Scottish government five stars for implementing Scottish government policy. Sedwill says (jokes?) that that would depend on whether or not the Scottish government\u2019s civil service deserved the credit. Q: Would you describe yourself as the line manager for permanent secretaries? Sedwill says he is their line manager. He conducts annual performance appraisals. He says he has had to have a conversation where someone\u2019s performance was \u201coff the pace\u201d. Sedwill says he has had to tell permanent secretaries to improve their performance. The SNP MP Ronnie Cowan asks about Sir Philip Rutnam\u2019s accusations against Priti Patel. Sedwill says there is a limit to what he can say. He says Rutnam has threatened legal action, although he has not initiated that yet. Q: But where could someone like Rutnam go with a complaint like that. Sedwill says, speaking generally, a permanent secretary could take it to him. He might take it up with the PM. Q: Have you ever warned a PM before appointing someone to cabinet? Sedwill says his advice to the PM. But before cabinet appointments are made, he gives advice, based on what he knows. Q: Would that be a private matter if you were asked about that at an employment tribunal? Sedwill says he would have to take legal advice on that. But he would not expect to have to disclose that. Sedwill indicates that he would not want to tell an employment tribunal about any advice be gave to the PM before he appointed Priti Patel as home secretary. Sedwill says he regards the resignation of Rutnam as a \u201cregrettable incident\u201d. But he says he does not see the need for \u201cfurther regulations\u201d governing the relationship between permanent secretaries and cabinet minister. In most cases, the status quo works, he argues. Sedwill says he does not see the case for new rules governing official/ministerial relations in the light of Philip Rutnam\u2019s resignation. Q: What can a permanent secretary do if they are unhappy with their minister? Sedwill says their job is to make this work. Sedwill says the job of officials is to give candid, honest, impartial advice, right up to the point where a decision is taken. He says secretaries of state have a role in appointing permanent secretaries. But they have tenure. If they did not, they would be under pressure just to tell ministers what they wanted to hear. He says 99% of the time people manage these relationships. Q: What course of action would be available to a minister dissastisfied with her permanent secretary? Sedwill says you would expect her to raise that with the official. If they could not raise it directly, he would expect them to raise it with him. Q: A civil servant was quoted in the Sunday Telegraph saying that the convention is that, if the relationship between a senior civil servant and new minister breaks down, the official should move. Is that right? Sedwill says sometimes officials do move. But he says the expectation is for officials and ministers to conduct themselves courteously. But if it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work. He would then take action. The Tory MP David Jones is asking the questions next. Q: There has been a lot of talk about one minister bullying staff. Do we need a definition of bullying for the ministerial code? Sedwill says he himself may have been seen as \u201cblunt and forthright\u201d. He says behaviour that might be acceptable towards an equal would be unreasonable if shown towards someone more junior. He says you can have bullying at junior levels too, between people on the same grade. He says fortunately people are now more confident about reporting complaints about bullying. Sir Mark Sedwill is speaking now. He says the job of the cabinet secretary is try to try to resolve disputes between ministers and civil servants. Q: Is there a formal process for restoring harmony? Sedwill says there is no formal process. But he tries to ensure the top team is working together. If there were a complaint about a minister, just as if there were a complaint about anyone, that would be investigated. That might lead to behavioural advice - telling people what they should do. Q: Would you recommend a secretary of state going for coaching? Sedwill says he has not recommended that. But there are proposals for ministers to get training in how to deal with major projects. Q: What about coaching for dealing with staff? Sedwill says he has not recommended that, but that might be an option. Sedwill does not rule out recommending coaching for ministers who need advice on how to deal with staff. William Wragg, the Conservative MP who chairs the committee, asks the first question. He asks Sir John Manzoni why he is still in post. He was due to leave last year, Wragg says. Manzoni says it was decided that it was not a good time to leave. His term of office was extended to 31 March, he says. The public administration and constitutional affairs committee hearing is just starting. There is a live feed here. The witnesses are Sir Mark Sedwill, who combines being cabinet secretary and head of the civil service with being national security adviser (a controversial arrangement, which may well come up) and Sir John Manzoni, the chief executive of the civil service. Last week BuzzFeed published a lengthy article about Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, by Alex Wickham and Alberto Nardelli exploring how someone who was widely expected to be forced out last summer when Boris Johnson became PM has now made himself indispensable to Johnson and his most powerful adviser, Dominic Cummings. It is worth reading in full, and it may well come up in the select committee hearing. Here\u2019s an extract. Some, including cabinet ministers, current and former senior officials, and government advisers past and present \u2014 who spoke to BuzzFeed News on condition of anonymity \u2014 went as far as talking about an \u201cunspoken pact\u201d between Sedwill and the prime minister. Neither side had to formalise the arrangement. The deal: that Johnson allows Sedwill to remain in his vastly influential dual role, as cabinet secretary and national security adviser, and in return Sedwill lets Johnson and his chief political aide Dominic Cummings, as one former official put it, \u201cdo whatever they want\u201d in terms of radical Whitehall reforms, a bold policy programme, and a hardline Brexit negotiating strategy. One senior official familiar with the workings of Johnson and Sedwill described the cabinet secretary as \u201cBoris\u2019s lackey\u201d. The phrase underlines the widespread view behind the scenes in Whitehall that Sedwill is failing in his duties to protect civil servants and special advisers \u2014 and the government at large \u2014 from the excesses of Johnson\u2019s Downing Street, and is unable to now control the conflict inbuilt in his role as adviser to the prime minister, broker to the cabinet, and head of the civil service. Excluding Huawei from Britain\u2019s 5G network will \u201csignificantly set back\u201d the government\u2019s ambitions to extend broadband access, a former chairman of BT has warned. As the Press Association reports, Sir Mike Rake, who now acts as an adviser to the Chinese tech giant, hit out at what he said were \u201cill-informed assertions\u201d about the dangers of allowing the company access to the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure. In an open letter Rake said: Any attempt to further restrict Huawei 5G equipment, or to remove existing 4G equipment, will not only incur very significant costs, but prejudice trade relationships with China and will significantly set back the government\u2019s broadband ambitions. This in turn will further damage our competitiveness as an economy, at what is a critical moment. We cannot afford to set back the important technological and communication progress we have made, with ill-informed assertions which are not supported by the facts and the experts. The government has taken an evidence-based decision and we should all support it. Rake was speaking ahead of a debate this afternoon which will see Tory rebels try to defeat the government on an amendment saying that Huawei\u2019s involvement in the UK\u2019s 5G network should not last beyond the end of 2022. But it is not clear yet whether or not the amendment will be \u201ccalled\u201d by the Speaker - ie, put to a vote. Good morning. House of Commons select committees finally started sitting last week, and this morning much of Westminster will be focused on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee (PACAC), where Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, is giving evidence. Sedwill is the most powerful civil servant in Whitehall and even in quiet times his job is fascinating. More recently, for a host of reasons, he has found himself at the centre of the news agenda. This is what the committee is saying about the hearing. Following the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam, formerly permanent secretary to the Home Office, and his allegation of constructive dismissal and bullying against the home secretary, Rt Hon Priti Patel MP, the committee will examine the working relationships between government ministers and officials. This is likely to include the role of the cabinet secretary in resolving disputes and the provisions of the ministerial code. The wide-ranging session will also investigate other topical issues, including the appointment, terms of employment and accountability of special advisers (SPADs); changes to the machinery of government and to the constitution; and preparations for the 2021 census. The committee will also ask about the work of the Cabinet Office more broadly. In theory the hearing should be gripping. But in practice - well, maybe not. Cabinet secretaries are a bit like the Queen; they may know everything, but they have also perfected the art of speaking at length in public without giving anything much away. We will find out soon whether PACAC has enough guile to tempt Sedwill into making news. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.45am: Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, gives evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. 11.30am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 12.30pm: MPs begin debating the remaining stages of the telecommunications infrastructure (leasehold property) bill. As my colleague Kate Proctor reports, Tory rebels wants to force a vote on an amendment that would force the government to remove Huawei from the UK\u2019s 5G network by the end of 2022. 3.15pm: John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, speaks at a conference on Parliament and Brexit. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. I will be covering some Westminster coronavirus developments, but our main coronavirus coverage is here, on our special live blog. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "European countries have scrambled to enact tough measures aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus as an unprecedented nationwide lockdown imposed by the Italian government won praise from the EU. As the rate of new infections and deaths continued to fall in China and South Korea, multiple European countries outlawed mass public events and announced bans on people entering their territories from virus-affected states. Austria\u2019s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, imposed a travel ban on all arrivals from Italy by car, train or plane, except for medical emergencies.

There was alarm in Washington after at least two Republican politicians who had recently met the president announced they were going into self-quarantine after potentially being exposed to the virus. In other developments: The coronavirus has now infected more than 116,000 people and killed more than 4,000 worldwide. The leaders of the EU 27 agreed to fund researchers developing a vaccine for the virus, allow greater flexibility for member states to subsidise hard-hit companies, and pledged to invest \u20ac25bn in parts of the economy devastated by the epidemic. A number of universities, including Harvard, NYU and Trinity College Dublin, have closed their premises to students and moved lectures online. Iran\u2019s health ministry reported 881 new cases and 54 deaths in the past 24 hours, both record figures. Confirmed cases are now at 8,042, with 291 dead. Hong Kong is to quarantine all visitors from Italy and affected parts of France, Germany and Japan for two weeks from 13 March. Weeks before Passover and Easter, Israel announced it would quarantine anyone arriving from overseas for 14 days. International financial markets stabilised on Tuesday amid hopes governments would act to protect their economies. Lebanon, Panama, Mongolia, Burkina Faso, northern Cyprus and the Democratic Republic of the Congo all confirmed their first cases. On Monday night Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced that the entire country would be covered by restrictions that \u201ccan be summarised as follows: I stay at home\u201d, with all travel banned unless justified on professional or health grounds. Ministers said on Tuesday that Italians could get a \u201choliday\u201d from mortgage payments under a raft of measures to ease the economic blow from the lockdown. The EU praised Italy\u2019s \u201cvery courageous measures\u201d on Tuesday and pledged to do all in its power to help. Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commission\u2019s executive vice-president, said the steps would \u201cput a great strain on the Italian people, but it\u2019s better to take them now to protect as many as possible\u201d. The total of 10,149 cases in the country (which include 631 deaths and 1,004 people who have since recovered) amount to the biggest outbreak after China. The country\u2019s Patient 1 \u2013 the first to be diagnosed with the illness \u2013 was now breathing on his own again, officials said on Monday. In France, President Emmanuel Macron said the country was \u201conly at the beginning of this epidemic\u201d, as authorities confirmed there had been 30 deaths and 1,606 confirmed infections. The country has already banned all gatherings of more than 1,000 people, but with only a fraction of the number of deaths reported in Italy, it has thus far held off from introducing the draconian measures ordered by Rome. Chinese authorities said 19 new cases had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, the lowest total since 20 January. President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the centre of the epidemic, on Tuesday, seemingly eager to demonstrate how the quarantine measures that are still largely in place were paying off. China has registered a total of 80,754 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 3,136 deaths. But as authorities continued to record a slowdown in new cases, the last of 14 makeshift hospitals that were opened during the past six weeks was closed, and restrictions beyond Hubei province were easing, with people returning to work, and factories and some schools reopening. Progress was also reported in South Korea, with authorities on Tuesday declaring 131 new infections, the lowest figure for a fortnight, taking the total to 7,513. Three more deaths took the country\u2019s death toll to 54. Yoon Tae-ho, of South Korea\u2019s central disaster management headquarters, said the rate of increase was \u201ccoming to a standstill\u201d but that the virus was still spreading, and advised against any relaxation of containment efforts.",

Galvin, sixth in the Ballymore last year, has been brought along steadily in non-handicaps and seems to have landed on a lenient rating. The handicap king, Gordon Elliott, appears to have saved him for this since November. </p> <p>Hold The Note didn\u2019t do his rating any favours by finishing second in a Grade Two last time and he might be up against it now. Espoir De Guye was also raised significantly for his last run but, as he won a valuable Ascot handicap by 10 lengths, it\u2019s only fair. He should have more to offer for Venetia Williams, seeking her first Festival win for seven years. Mitchouka is an interesting Irish raider at 25-1.

And he should, hopefully, recover in time to run at Aintree or perhaps Punchestown in April if his owners want to go there (and, for that matter, if the meeting is still happening, which can\u2019t be a given at the moment). </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e678e018f085f0b8d9459bb\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregwood\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T12:55:02.923Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Going is soft, heavy in places</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Simon Claisse, Cheltenham\u2019s clerk of the course, has just issued an update explaining the going change from soft all over to soft, heavy in places, despite the absence of any rain here at Cheltenham since the initial going report this morning.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just had another look round the track,\u201d Claisse said, \u201cand the crossing where the Old and New courses intersect were marginal first thing this morning in terms of might they be heavy, but we\u2019ve taken the decision to change the description \u2026 really only where those tracks intersect.

Joe Donnelly doesn\u2019t care; he owns both of them!

Asterion Forlonge, on the other hand, may have looked workmanlike in victory last time but he was doing it in a Grade One. Softening ground helps him and possibly also Fiddlerontheroof, last seen winning the Tolworth in the Sandown mud. Abacadabras, however, is a fast horse who might have fared better on good to soft.

Even the weather seems to have got the message \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly balmy, but what rain there is between now and Friday is expected to be minimal and occasional, a contrast to last year when the meeting opened in driving rain and low single-figure temperatures.</p> <p>All the same, the going will be soft all over for this afternoon\u2019s seven races after one of the wettest winters for many years. And it will feel very different too as what was, more years than not, Ruby Day, as Ruby Walsh and Willie Mullins worked their way through a series of short-priced favourites in the Supreme, Arkle, Champion Hurdle and Mares\u2019 Hurdle, is now up for grabs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/to-punters-cheltenham-festival-is-like-christmas-for-grown-ups\">To punters, Cheltenham Festival is like Christmas for grown-ups</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is never wise to second-guess the big stories of the day here, but the possibility that Rachael Blackmore will grab the top jockeys\u2019 prize by the scruff of the neck is too tempting to resist.</p> <p>The 6-1 available about Henry de Bromhead\u2019s stable jockey about a week ago has been clipped to 5-1 in recent days but that could still be a decent bet assuming she gets at least one winner on the board today. Notebook, in the Arkle, and Honeysuckle, in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle, are two of her best rides all week, but Captain Guinness is not without a chance in the opener and she is so consistently excellent when it comes to getting a horse settled and well-positioned that Trainwreck, in the novice handicap chase, should also give her supporters a run for their money.</p> <p>The bookmakers are, as usual, bending over backwards to get some money into punters\u2019 accounts after the Supreme Novice Hurdle. One firm is even offering seven places each-way on the opener, which is an obvious invitation to spread some money around with no obvious downside \u2013 while not forgetting that the idea is that any winnings will be retrieved with interest over the course of the next 27 races.</p> <p>Chris Cook\u2019s selections for the first day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/10/talking-horses-epatante-can-give-henderson-eighth-champion-hurdle-horse-racing-tips\">are here</a>, a few of my thoughts about the week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/to-punters-cheltenham-festival-is-like-christmas-for-grown-ups\">are here</a> \u2013 we concur on Who Dares Wins in today\u2019s Ultima, so take that as you will \u2013 and all the news, views, plunges, triumphs and disasters will be detailed here as Cheltenham 2020 unfurls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/10/talking-horses-epatante-can-give-henderson-eighth-champion-hurdle-horse-racing-tips\">Talking Horses: Epatante can give Henderson eighth Champion Hurdle</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T10:22:05.188Z\">at 10.22am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

I\u2019ll leave you with Chris Cook\u2019s Champion Hurdle report. Be lucky. 1 Ravenhill 12-1 (JJ Codd) 2 Lord Du Mesnil 11-2 (S Waley-Cohen) 3 Lamanver Pippin 33-1 (W Biddick) 4 Forza Milan 12-1 (Derek O\u2019Connor) Jamie Codd: the best amateur since the IT guy in the Office. Jamie Codd runs a superb race, coming from the back of the pack to outlast long-time leader Lord Du Mesnil. That\u2019s a first win of the Festival for trainer Gordon Elliott, too. I think Lamanver Pippin came home third, but awaiting official confirmation. Ravenhill and Lord Du Mesnil are neck-and-neck at the last, but Ravenhill gets a better jump. Behind them, Carefully Selected falls to end his comeback charge! Lord Du Mesnil is slowing up, with Ravenhill closing the gap and Carefully Selected powering up to third ... Lord Du Mesnil now leads Newtide by four or five lengths, with Lamanver Pippin third over the last open ditch. Three to jump ... Carefully Selected is down in seventh as they take on the last lap, with Lord Du Mesnil still leading and Ravenhill getting into contention. And Springfield Fox is down! Heading down the hill, 14 of 23 fences cleared, and the leading pair are unchanged. Lamanver Pippin and Ocean Cove are making moves behind them ... Lord Du Mesnil leads over the open ditch, ahead of Springfield Fox, but the pack are closing, led by Newtide and Forza Milan. It\u2019s not a belting pace so far ... Lord Du Mesnil edges into the lead, with The Hollow Ginge going well on the inside. Newtide up to fourth, no fallers so far ... Springfield Fox and Smoking Gun make the early running, with Newtide well-placed and Carefully Selected a little further back. This could be an attritional battle over three miles and five furlongs. It\u2019s a slightly reduced field, compared to previous years. Carefully Selected \u2013 5/4 Lord Du Mesnil \u2013 5/1 Springfield Fox \u2013 7/1 Ravenhill \u2013 12/1 Newtide \u2013 12/1 Forza Milan \u2013 12/1 Lamanver Pippin \u2013 28/1 The Hollow Ginge \u2013 28/1 Smoking Gun \u2013 33/1 Ocean Cove \u2013 33/1 (my e/w pick) Redzor \u2013 100/1 Anteros \u2013 250/1 Clondaw Clan \u2013 300/1 Some Can Dance \u2013 250/1 All odds via Oddschecker. 1 Imperial Aura (David Bass) 4-1 Jt Fav 2 Galvin (D N Russell) 4-1 Jt Fav 3 Hold The Note (J J Burke) 10-1 4 Whatmore (T J O\u2019Brien) 14-1 20 ran Non Runner: 13 Some reaction from trainer Kim Bailey after getting his first win of the week: And Rachael Blackmore after her victory in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle: In case you missed it earlier, here\u2019s Chris Cook\u2019s Champion Hurdle report: This odd race, a marathon novice chase for amateur riders, used to favour horses with plenty of chasing experience but this year\u2019s main contenders lack that. The hot favourite is Carefully Selected, unbeaten in three over fences but a bit chancy-looking at Naas last time. This is his toughest test yet and he needs to respond by jumping better, which is not how these things usually go. Ravenhill was beaten just a head in the Kerry National but his best form is on a much drier surface than this. Lord Du Mesnil loves the mud but it\u2019s fair to ask how much more he has to offer this season after some hard races. Newtide, a slightly fortunate Grade Two winner last time, has probably had a more helpful preparation and looks a real stayer in the making. David Bass leads Imperial Aura home, with a galloping Galvin unable to close the gap. Hold The Note completes an Irish podium sweep, with Whatmore fourth. Precious Cargo falls at the last! That leaves Imperial Aura with clear turf ahead, and Galvin a distant second ... They pick up the pace with Precious Cargo still holding off Imperial Aura, with Torpillo third, and Galvin and Hold The Note improving all the time ... Down the hill and past the halfway mark, before Precious Cargo stutters at the water jump. Imperial Aura up to second, with Trainwreck improving. Beakstown and Champagne Court in the mix, too ... Precious Cargo takes the lead from Champagne Mystery before the seventh, with Torpillo and Imperial Aura in contention. Galvin and Hold The Note mired in midfield ... Champagne Mystery leads over the third, while Jarveys Plate and Knight in Dubai both go down ... Imperial Aura still the 4-1 favourite, but Galvin is racing in at 9-2 as they get off and running. Richard Johnson will have to see the doctor before he can be cleared to race on Wednesday, after falling in the Arkle earlier on today.Richard Johnson will need to pass the doctor on Wednesday if he is to take his rides on day two of the Cheltenham Festival. The multiple champion jockey was partnering the Olly Murphy-trained Brewin\u2019upastorm in Tuesday\u2019s Arkle Challenge Trophy when he was unseated at the 10th fence. Johnson walked back into the weighing room, but was stood down from the remainder of his mounts. BHA spokesman Robin Mounsey said: \u201cRichard Johnson was stood down for the day by the doctor. He will need to pass a medical examination in the morning to be able to take his rides.\u201d Johnson only returned on action on February 27, having been out since January 21 after suffering a broken arm. He has three booked rides on Wednesday and three more on Thursday, including Apple\u2019s Jade in the Stayers\u2019 Hurdle. Imperial Aura \u2013 4/1 Galvin \u2013 13/2 Espoir De Guye \u2013 15/2 Hold The Note \u2013 9/1 Beakstown \u2013 12/1 Precious Cargo \u2013 14/1 Trainwreck \u2013 14/1 (my each-way pick) Whatmore \u2013 16/1 Champagne Court \u2013 18/1 Earlofthecotswolds \u2013 22/1 Champagne Mystery \u2013 25/1 Jarveys Plate \u2013 25/1 Knight in Dubai \u2013 28/1 Highest Sun \u2013 33/1 Lord Schnitzel \u2013 33/1 Mitchouka \u2013 40/1 Daily Tiger \u2013 50/1 De Plotting Shed \u2013 66/1 Paint The Dream \u2013 80/1 Torpillo \u2013 80/1 Odds via Oddschecker Imperial Aura has had a solid first season over fences without suggesting he has masses more to offer, so he is a slightly odd choice of favourite in a race which ought to be half full of unexposed types. Galvin, sixth in the Ballymore last year, has been brought along steadily in non-handicaps and seems to have landed on a lenient rating. The handicap king, Gordon Elliott, appears to have saved him for this since November. Hold The Note didn\u2019t do his rating any favours by finishing second in a Grade Two last time and he might be up against it now. Espoir De Guye was also raised significantly for his last run but, as he won a valuable Ascot handicap by 10 lengths, it\u2019s only fair. He should have more to offer for Venetia Williams, seeking her first Festival win for seven years. Mitchouka is an interesting Irish raider at 25-1. He\u2019s shown promise in two runs for a new yard and should improve for this return to longer. 1 Honeysuckle (Rachael Blackmore) 9-4 2 Benie Des Dieux (P Townend) 4-6 Fav 3 Elfile (D E Mullins) 16-1 9 ran Also: 12-1 Roksana 4th Non Runner: 3 Bookies would have feared the worst after Epatante won the Champion Hurdle, but Honeysuckle - owned by bookmaker Kenny Alexander - saw off the favourite there. A great tactical race too, with Honeysuckle going inside to get beyond Stormy Ireland and get an advantage into the home straight. \u201cThis mare is so special,\u201d says Blackmore. \u201cShe\u2019s unbelievable. I\u2019m lucky I get to steer him round. [Winning Grade Ones] gets better every time! You learn early on that they don\u2019t come along too often.\u201d It was billed as the battle of the day, and it delivered, with Blackmore and Townend going toe-to-toe over the final fence and up the hill - but Honeysuckle holds on! It\u2019s another Grade One win for Rachael Blackmore. Two to go: Benie Des Dieux moves to the outside, looking for room. Honeysuckle goes up the inside and gets ahead, and suddenly we\u2019re into the anticipated two-horse battle ... Four to go: Honeysuckle takes up the lead, with Elfile third. The front five pulling away, Roksana leading the back markers ... Six to go: Stormy Ireland canters a couple of lengths clear, with Benie Des Dieux, Honeysuckle and Lady Buttons in behind. Eight to go! The pack takes the long first turn, with Elfile and Stormy Ireland leading a mid-tempo affair. Here we go, then. Benie Des Dieux v Honeysuckle, Paul Townend v Rachael Blackmore. Benie Des Dieux starts 4-6 favourite ... Some news from the US, where Maximum Security\u2019s trainer, Jason Servis, has been fired by the racehorse\u2019s owner. Servis has been indicted over an alleged mass-doping scheme: Benie Des Dieux \u2013 8/13 Honeysuckle \u2013 11/4 Stormy Island \u2013 12/1 Roksana \u2013 14/1 Elfile \u2013 28/1 Lady Buttons \u2013 33/1 Popong \u2013 100/1 Cap Soleil \u2013 100/1 Desaray Girl \u2013 100/1 (my long-shot pick) All odds via Oddschecker. This has been billed as a clash between two top-class mares but the market has decided which one it likes. Benie Des Dieux would be seeking a hat-trick in this, but for falling on her face at the last a year ago. She might just have been getting tired but it was her first start for 11 months. This time, she comes off a win in the Galmoy, when she left her rivals 21 lengths behind and prompted Mullins to suggest she was the best mare he had trained (look away now, Annie Power and Quevega). She is the right favourite but the improving Honeysuckle will surely be a tough opponent after winning the Irish Champion at half a mile shorter last time. The rest have work to do, including Roksana, last year\u2019s winner, who seems regressive this season. Stormy Ireland, second last year, is going the right way and it is not impossible to imagine her getting involved. That win also moves Nicky Henderson past Willie Mullins, and back into the overall lead as Cheltenham\u2019s most successful trainer with 66 wins. 1 Epatante (B J Geraghty) 2-1 Fav 2 Sharjah (Mr P W Mullins) 16-1 3 Darver Star (Jonathan Moore) 17-2 17 ran Also: 7-1 Cilaos Emery 4th An elated Barry Geraghty says he had to keep Epatante in check, the mare wanting to take every fence on early. It all came together at the last, though - \u201call the lights were green\u201d. It\u2019s a second win of the day for Nicky Henderson, and his eighth Champion Hurdle. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very lucky to have such good horses,\u201d he says in a moment of textbook trainer understatement. The favourite has too much class, coasting away down the home straight with Sharjah the only runner getting close. Darver Star can\u2019t keep up and comes third, with Cilaos Emery emerging from the pack in fourth. Approaching the last: Darver Star takes the lead, Epatante second, with Ballyandy in touch and Sharjah tearing through the field ... Three to go: Petit Mouchoir extends the lead, and turning up the pace. Darver Star is second, Epatante moving into third. Supasundae and Silver Streak also in the mix, Cornerstone Lad fading ... Five to go: The pace drops a little, with Sharjah at the back and Pentland Hills having a quiet race so far. The front two lead by a couple of lengths ... Six hurdles to go! Petit Mouchoir the early leader from Cornerstone Lad. Epatante in midfield, with Darver Star and Not So Sleepy well placed ... Epatante goes away as 2-1 favourite. The first start goes awry as Darver Star and Not So Sleepy move a little too fast. That\u2019s the third false start of the day. They\u2019re off second time around ... The runners and riders are making their way down to the start. Some notable names, including Pentland Hills, Supasundae and Silver Streak, who was bought for just \u00a325,000 and placed here last year. I\u2019m fascinated by Le Patriote, ridden by conditional jockey Charlie Hammond and still available at an enormous 400-1 ... Epatante \u2013 9/4 Cilaos Emery \u2013 15/2 Pentland Hills \u2013 17/2 Supasundae \u2013 10/1 Darver Star \u2013 11/1 Coeur Sublime \u2013 16/1 Sharjah \u2013 16/1 Call Me Lord \u2013 14/1 Ballyandy \u2013 20/1 Silver Streak \u2013 25/1 Cornerstone Lad \u2013 33/1 Petit Mouchoir \u2013 28/1 Fusil Raffles \u2013 40/1 Not So Sleepy \u2013 33/1 Darasso \u2013 50/1 (my each-way pick) Gumball \u2013 150/1 Le Patriote \u2013400/1 Latest odds from Oddschecker. So here it is, the Champion Hurdle everyone has been talking down for months, which will prove extremely hard to win because there are 17 quality animals trying their luck. Epatante is the right favourite after her Christmas Hurdle romp but she needs to show her Cheltenham flop a year ago, as a novice, was an aberration. What Pentland Hills needs to do is drop the bit in the first mile, which he has notably failed to do so far this season. If he settles behind the likely strong pace (Not So Sleepy, Cornerstone Lad, Petit Mouchoir), he has a big chance, although he could have done without the recent rain. Willie Mullins has dug out Cilaos Emery as his main contender but this converted chaser was only fifth in the Supreme three years ago and lacks brilliance. Good old Supasundae has place possibilities but would be the oldest winner since Sea Pigeon. The progressive Darver Star looks a live runner, having chased Honeysuckle close last time. Darasso is wildly overpriced for a well-regarded horse with some excuses for his two recent defeats. David Bridgewater, who won this race as a jockey, gets his first victory at Cheltenham as a trainer after a frantic finish. Next up: it\u2019s the Champion Hurdle. 1 The Conditional (B Powell) 15-2 2 Kildisart (D Jacob) 10-1 3 Discorama (BJ Cooper) 11-2 JF 4 Vinndication (D Bass) 11-2 JF 5 Big River (D Fox) 20-1 Kildisart and The Conditional have the pace down the straight, and Brendan Powell hangs on to win by a nose! At the last: Vintage Clouds losing ground, with Cepage and Vinndication pushed hard by Kildisart and The Conditional ... Big River coming home strongly too ... Three to go: Discorama getting into midfield, Mister Malarky and The Conditional well placed, Who Dares Wins also travelling. The front three still clear, with Kildisart in behind. Six to go: Cepage, Vinndication and Vintage Clouds still the front three, with Ice Cool Champs a surprise contender. Burbank is slow, and Activial has lost ground ... Nine to go: Cepage has crept up the inside to lead, with Who Dares Wins travelling well. Vinndication and Vintage Clouds still in contention, but Cogry has been pulled up ... 12 to go: Kildisart joins the leaders, with The Conditional well placed as they go over the open ditch, where No Comment takes a fall. Discorama held up ... 15 fences to go: Cogry, Activial, Vintage Clouds among the early leaders, along with Vinndication. Elwood and Quarenta are early fallers ... Three miles and a furlong, 23 runners, with Vinndication going off the favourite, just ahead of Discorama. Richard Johnson, who took a big fall on Brewin\u2019upastorm in the Arkle, has been stood down for the day with a hip problem. Hopefully nothing too serious, but Aidan Coleman, winner of that race, will step in. Vinndication \u2013 6/1 The Conditional \u2013 7/1 Discorama \u2013 7/1 Kildisart \u2013 11/1 No Comment \u2013 11/1 Who Dares Wins \u2013 12/1 Mister Malarky \u2013 12/1 Cepage \u2013 16/1 Big River \u2013 20/1 Cobra De Mai \u2013 22/1 Elwood \u2013 25/1 Cogry \u2013 25/1 Mulcahys Hill \u2013 33/1 Brave Eagle \u2013 33/1 Burbank \u2013 33/1 Quarenta \u2013 40/1 Atlanta Ablaze \u2013 40/1 (my each-way pick) Vintage Clouds \u2013 40/1 Actival \u2013 50/1 Townshend \u2013 66/1 Soupy Soups \u2013 80/1 Vivas \u2013 250/1 Ice Cool Champs \u2013 250/1 Live odds via Oddschecker. Vinndication is quite a plausible winner as top weight, bearing in mind how impressive he was in beating a big field by five lengths at Ascot in November, his first start since a wind op. He looked a Gold Cup contender in the making, except for the knowledge that almost all his form is at right-handed tracks. Cepage was game to score here in January but the extra half-mile isn\u2019t sure to suit. Scotland\u2019s Big River, a running-on fourth last year, will relish every yard and has had a better preparation this time. A couple are interesting at 40-1 or so; Soupy Soups put up a career best when second in the Badger Beers last time and represents a yard that has won this before, while Townshend has won his last two and is well treated on old form. Townshend\u2019s jockey is very inexperienced, so a lot could go wrong for him on this hard puller who guesses at some of his fences, but that is more than built into the price. Elwood has been a chancy jumper too but is entitled to still be learning about the game. Discorama and Kildisart are well treated on their best form but seem to have lost the plot this term. Who Dares Wins, a Northumberland Plate winner, seems game and reliable and this step up in trip should help. Well, well. My each-way pick only won the race. Don\u2019t expect that to happen again any time soon. The race really turned three from home, with Aidan Coleman getting the better line than Mark Walsh, and Esprit Du Large\u2019s fall breaking up the field. Put The Kettle On is the first mare to win this race for 40 years. I\u2019m off to, well, put the kettle on. 1 Put The Kettle On (A Coleman) 16-1 2 Fakir D\u2019oudairies (M Walsh) 7-2 3 Rouge Vif (G Sheehan) 12-1 A 25-1 shot that jumped up the betting late on, it\u2019s a winner for jockey Aidan Coleman. Henry De Bromhead gets the result, but not with Notebook, who never got into the race. At the last: Put The Kettle On leads, but Fakir D\u2019oudairies is closing as they head into the final straight - it\u2019s another two-horse race ... Three to go: Maire Banrigh has fallen, and Brewinupastorm unseats Olly Murphy at the same fence. Put The Kettle On leads, with Cash Back under pressure and Global Citizen travelling ... Five to go: Notebook and Maire Banrigh have joined the leading pair, with Global Citizen at the back. All still together, though... Nine fences to go! Cash Back leads Put The Kettle On, with Brewin\u2019upastorm at the back, but a very leisurely pace so far ... Blackmore has raced on Notebook nine times, winning five races including two Grade Ones. Notebook and Cash Back are too keen, and it\u2019s a false start, but they\u2019re off at the second time of asking. Notebook \u2013 10/3 Fakir Doudaries \u2013 4/1 Brewinupastorm \u2013 6/1 Cash Back \u2013 15/2 Esprit Du Large \u2013 12/1 Rouge Vif \u2013 12/1 Maire Banrigh \u2013 14/1 Al Dancer \u2013 20/1 Put the Kettle On \u2013 25/1 (my each-way pick) Global Citizen \u2013 40/1 Our Merlin \u2013 400/1 Live odds provided by Oddschecker A nice feature on ITV on Rachael Blackmore, who will be on board the favourite, Notebook, in the next race. Blackmore has been keen to play down any suggestion she\u2019s a pioneer for female jockeys, but says \u201cI would hope any girls watching will think \u2018I could be a jockey\u2019. Because now she can.\u201d Notebook has jumped his way to the top of the two-mile novice chasers, just a year after being beaten 51 lengths in the Ballymore. Generally, you\u2019d hope to see stronger hurdles form in an Arkle contender\u2019s background but most of his rivals here don\u2019t have much more to offer on that front. The exception would be Al Dancer, who won the Betfair Hurdle and started joint-favourite for the Supreme a year ago, but he hasn\u2019t progressed over fences so far and got outpaced the last time. Brewin\u2019upastorm also showed some class over hurdles and he\u2019s unbeaten in two over fences but at a low level and he hasn\u2019t been seen since November. Esprit Du Large, a Grade One winner over fences, has also not been seen since last year, an unusually long absence for a winner of this race. Cash Back and Fakir D\u2019Oudairies have both been beaten by Notebook already though it might not take much to turn the tables back in their favour. Cash Back, who wears a hood, is at risk of racing too freely on this first visit to Cheltenham. Notebook also needs to settle down, having played around at the start a couple of times. So Shishkin defied gloomy pre-race predictions, and proved great value for those who stuck with him at 6-1. Nico de Boinville says \u201cit wasn\u2019t much fun to be honest. Everything that could go wrong did ... but it just shows what a fantastic horse this is\u201d. Nicky Henderson is made up, a fourth win in this race for the trainer, and a boost after the Altior news. 1 Shishkin (Nico de Boinville) 6-1 2 Abacadabras (D N Russell) 11-4 3 Chantry House (B J Geraghty) 15-2 15 ran Also: 9-4 Fav Asterion Forlonge 4th Non Runner: 11 A terrific two-way battle all the way down the home straight, with Nico de Boinville and Shiskin edging out Davy Russell\u2019s Abacadabras! One to go: Elixir D\u2019Ainay falls at the second last, and Abacadabras takes the lead! Shishkin is going away with him, Asterion Forlonge going backwards ... Three hurdles to go: Elixir D\u2019Ainay and Whatsnotoknow are keeping pace with the leader, with Shishkin making a mistake and Fiddlerontheroof moving back up through the field ... Six hurdles to go! The grey Asterion Forlonge leads the pack at a decent lick, with Soviet Pimpernel in second. Shishkin and Chantry House are well placed ... The grandstand is absolutely packed; it\u2019s making me feel slightly uneasy. The first race of the Festival, the Supreme Novices\u2019 Hurdle, is about to begin - ah, no, we have a false start. At the second time of asking, they\u2019re away! The Supreme Novices\u2019 favourite has an undeniable swagger: The testing ground appears to have put punters off Nicky Henderson\u2019s former favourite, Shishkin, with Willie Mullins\u2019 Asterion Forlonge now the clear front runner. Gordon Elliott\u2019s Abacadabras and Colin Tizzard\u2019s Fiddlerontheroof have both moved up in the betting. For the more casual readers, I\u2019m going to chuck in an each-way pick for each race, based on little more than gut instinct. For this one, it\u2019s Edwardstone (25-1). Asterion Forlonge \u2013 10/3 Abacadabras \u2013 4/1 Shishkin \u2013 6/1 Chantry House \u2013 6/1 Fiddlerontheroof \u2013 6/1 Captain Guinness \u2013 16/1 Elixir D\u2019Ainay \u2013 20/1 Edwardstone \u2013 28/1 Allart \u2013 33/1 Soviet Pimpernel \u2013 50/1 Berkshire Royal \u2013 150/1 Mario De Pail \u2013 200/1 Heaven Help Us \u2013 200/1 Whatsnotoknow \u2013 250/1 Hollow Sound \u2013 500/1 Live odds provided by Oddschecker ITV racing have AP McCoy and Ruby Walsh on punditry duties. Just the 89 Cheltenham winners between them. If you\u2019re dropping in and fancy a flutter, Chris Cook\u2019s Monday tips are well worth your time. And there\u2019s still time to enter our tipping competition. Here\u2019s more from Greg Wood on what Altior\u2019s withdrawal means for tomorrow\u2019s Champion Chase: The disappointing news that Altior will miss tomorrow\u2019s Champion Chase means that the much anticipated three-way duel in the two-mile chasing championship is now rather more of a head-to-head between Defi Du Seuil, the Tingle Creek Chase winner, and Chacun Pour Soi, who beat Defi Du Seuil by nearly five lengths at Punchestown back in April and ran a great trial for the Festival when winning the Dublin Chase at Leopardstown in early February. Give the fairly decisive nature of Chacun Pour Soi\u2019s defeat of his main rival less than a year ago, it is perhaps a little surprising that Defi Du Seuil is now the clear favourite for tomorrow\u2019s race at around 6-5, with Chacun Pour Soi next in the list at 6-4 and at least 14-1 on offer about their four remaining rivals. It may not be the race that everyone was hoping for but it still promises to be a fascinating clash between two outstanding young chasers, and while Altior himself is now 10, he should still have at least one more Festival in him if he stays sound. And he should, hopefully, recover in time to run at Aintree or perhaps Punchestown in April if his owners want to go there (and, for that matter, if the meeting is still happening, which can\u2019t be a given at the moment). Simon Claisse, Cheltenham\u2019s clerk of the course, has just issued an update explaining the going change from soft all over to soft, heavy in places, despite the absence of any rain here at Cheltenham since the initial going report this morning. \u201cI\u2019ve just had another look round the track,\u201d Claisse said, \u201cand the crossing where the Old and New courses intersect were marginal first thing this morning in terms of might they be heavy, but we\u2019ve taken the decision to change the description \u2026 really only where those tracks intersect. But we\u2019ve got a breezy, dry and mild afternoon in prospect. \u201cIt\u2019s looking as though it will stay dry today and tomorrow too. There may be a few showers on Wednesday night into Thursday but it looks as though we will start with two dry afternoons.\u201d A whole host of sporting events are being postponed, or moved behind closed doors, because of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe. At Cheltenham, there are regular PA reminders, and extra hand-washing facilities. Although I\u2019m not sure about this: 1.30 Supreme Novices Hurdle Shishkin\u2019s blazing speed impressed enough people to keep him at the top of the betting for weeks but the Asterion Forlonge bandwagon has shouldered him aside. Joe Donnelly doesn\u2019t care; he owns both of them! But you can see, now, why Nicky Henderson, trainer of Shishkin, was suggesting to Joe back in February that he might like to switch the Mullins-trained Asterion to the Ballymore Hurdle instead. The stats are against Shishkin, who hasn\u2019t raced above Listed level, whereas the past eight Supreme winners had all won a Graded hurdle. Asterion Forlonge, on the other hand, may have looked workmanlike in victory last time but he was doing it in a Grade One. Softening ground helps him and possibly also Fiddlerontheroof, last seen winning the Tolworth in the Sandown mud. Abacadabras, however, is a fast horse who might have fared better on good to soft. He split Envoi Allen and Darver Star at Fairyhouse in December, which looks very strong form. And here\u2019s Donald McRae\u2019s excellent interview with Paul Townend, who\u2019s poised to step out of Ruby Walsh\u2019s shadow this week: Barry Geraghty 38 Richard Johnson 23 Davy Russell 22 Nico De Boinville 10 Tom Scudamore 10 Paul Townend 10 Jamie Codd 9 Bryan Cooper 8 Sam Twiston-Davies 7 Paddy Brennan 6 Ruby Walsh has taken his 59 winners and ridden off into the RTV studios, leaving Barry Geraghty nicely clear. The bookies evidently expect Walsh\u2019s replacement at the Mullins yard, Paul Townend, to pick up the good work where the master left off, as he\u2019s favourite to be top jockey here for the first time. Rachael Blackmore, who famously beat Townend in her first pony race, is second-favourite, having been 100-1 to be top jockey a year ago. She has only two Festival wins to her name but will ride that many favourites this week. Top jockey betting Paul Townend 9-4 Rachael Blackmore 5-1 Davy Russell 11-2 Barry Geraghty 6-1 Nico de Boinville 10-1 Robbie Power 16-1 Patrick Mullins 20-1 Two years ago, Rachael Blackmore\u2019s only involvement at Cheltenham was taking horses out for a morning canter - before heading off to other race courses in search of a winner. This year, she could be the Festival\u2019s star jockey: It looks like the going has been changed at Cheltenham, and is now soft, heavy in places. This is the third year in a row where it\u2019s been uncertain whether the Festival would actually go ahead. In 2018 it was snow; last year it was the equine flu outbreak. This year, Cheltenham begins amid coronavirus concerns with special measures in place, as Steven Morris reports (and look out for the quality picture caption work): 1.30 Supreme Novice Hurdle Shishkin (nb) 4-1 2.10 Arkle Trophy Notebook 100-30 2.50 Ultima Handicap Chase Who Dares Wins (nap) 12-1 3.30 Champion Hurdle Epatante 11-4 4.10 Mares Hurdle Benie Des Dieux 4-7 4.50 Northern Trust Novice Handicap Chase Espoir De Guye 7-1 5.30 National Hunt Chase Newtide 11-1 The big problem here is that I\u2019ve only got the Irish down for two winners, which just doesn\u2019t feel right, especially with the rain tinkling merrily away on the window as I write this on Monday evening. The expectation of soft ground might be why Shishkin has gone out to 4s, as he\u2019s seen as a fast horse, while his main opponent, Asterion Forlonge, is a mudloving grinder. Who Dares Wins would be a first Festival winner for five years for Alan King, who last scored here with Uxizandre, Sir Anthony McCoy\u2019s farewell winner. Altior\u2019s withdrawal is a bitter blow for Nicky Henderson, and means one of the week\u2019s most anticipated battles, with the two-time Champion Chase winner taking on Defi Du Seuil and Chacun Pour Soi, will no longer take place. Here\u2019s more from PA: Henderson announced on Sunday morning that Altior was lame, after a dormant splint that had never caused a problem to the 10-year-old previously \u201creared its ugly head\u201d. The situation had improved markedly on Monday and he was declared for the two-mile showpiece at the 48-hour stage, although Henderson stressed more progress was needed - today, he revealed that it hadn\u2019t happened. \u201cWhat is really disappointing is the improvement from the night before last to yesterday morning was so good that we were genuinely optimistic that, as long as that recovery rate was maintained, we figured he\u2019d be sound this morning, and that is not the case,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cIt\u2019s flattened off, he hasn\u2019t improved at all from last night, whereas the night before he improved dramatically. Consequently I think it\u2019s only right now that he will be taken out of the race.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s brutal - it\u2019s not an issue that has ever bothered him before, he\u2019s never taken a lame step in his life. It\u2019s very cruel, and cruel on everybody to be fair ... he\u2019s been in such brilliant form, but he won\u2019t be there to show it.\u201d Altior would have been bidding for his fifth win at the Festival, having taken the Supreme Novices\u2019 Hurdle and Arkle Trophy before his two Champion Chase victories. Good morning all, and let\u2019s start with some breaking news. Nicky Henderson has confirmed Altior won\u2019t run in the Queen Mother Champion Chase on Wednesday. More on that to follow ... You could win a \u00a3100 account credit from Betfair by proving your tipping prowess on today\u2019s races. All you have to do is give us your selections for all of today\u2019s races at Cheltenham. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on each tip. Non-runners count as losers. Please post all your tips in a single posting, using the comment facility below, before the first race at 1.30pm. There are seven races at Cheltenham today and you must post a single selection for each race. Our usual terms and conditions, which you can read here will apply, except that this will be a strictly one-day thing. If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. If an entrant has to repost their selections because of a non-runner, we will use the time of their later posting for tiebreak purposes. If you don\u2019t win today, don\u2019t despair. We are running an identical competition on each day of the Festival. It has been difficult to anticipate this year\u2019s Cheltenham Festival in the normal way given the uncertainty over whether it would actually take place, but now we are here, with four days of the highest drama waiting to unfold, the excitement seems fiercer than ever. Even the weather seems to have got the message \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly balmy, but what rain there is between now and Friday is expected to be minimal and occasional, a contrast to last year when the meeting opened in driving rain and low single-figure temperatures. All the same, the going will be soft all over for this afternoon\u2019s seven races after one of the wettest winters for many years. And it will feel very different too as what was, more years than not, Ruby Day, as Ruby Walsh and Willie Mullins worked their way through a series of short-priced favourites in the Supreme, Arkle, Champion Hurdle and Mares\u2019 Hurdle, is now up for grabs. It is never wise to second-guess the big stories of the day here, but the possibility that Rachael Blackmore will grab the top jockeys\u2019 prize by the scruff of the neck is too tempting to resist. The 6-1 available about Henry de Bromhead\u2019s stable jockey about a week ago has been clipped to 5-1 in recent days but that could still be a decent bet assuming she gets at least one winner on the board today. Notebook, in the Arkle, and Honeysuckle, in the Mares\u2019 Hurdle, are two of her best rides all week, but Captain Guinness is not without a chance in the opener and she is so consistently excellent when it comes to getting a horse settled and well-positioned that Trainwreck, in the novice handicap chase, should also give her supporters a run for their money. The bookmakers are, as usual, bending over backwards to get some money into punters\u2019 accounts after the Supreme Novice Hurdle. One firm is even offering seven places each-way on the opener, which is an obvious invitation to spread some money around with no obvious downside \u2013 while not forgetting that the idea is that any winnings will be retrieved with interest over the course of the next 27 races. Chris Cook\u2019s selections for the first day are here, a few of my thoughts about the week are here \u2013 we concur on Who Dares Wins in today\u2019s Ultima, so take that as you will \u2013 and all the news, views, plunges, triumphs and disasters will be detailed here as Cheltenham 2020 unfurls.",

On a typical morning, it would be buzzing with customers having coffee, chatting or reading the newspapers. On Tuesday, however, as news that the whole of Italy was to be put under lockdown sunk in, only a handful of regulars called in. \u201cThink about it this way,\u201d said the barman, Francesco Maggi. \u201cOn Sunday, five of us were working. Today, there is only one.\u201d The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told 60 million Italians late on Monday to \u201cstay at home\u201d as the government introduced measures unprecedented in peacetime to contain Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of the coronavirus. Conte\u2019s message is starting to reverberate. The hashtag #iostoacasa \u2013 I stay at home \u2013 accompanied by images of home-cooked meals or a good book, has been shared by thousands on social media. In Orvieto, a town heavily dependent on tourism, bars and shops were already laying down duct tape to ensure customers stand at least a metre apart before Monday night\u2019s announcement. The mood on Tuesday morning was sombre but, unlike in other places across Italy, there was no sense of panic. People were walking around, some wearing masks or with scarves wrapped around their mouths. \u201cPeople are definitely taking it more seriously,\u201d said Federico Badia, a shoemaker. \u201cThey are staying home and only going out if necessary.

      "bodyText": "Brussels has reacted to the coronavirus epidemic by suspending the EU\u2019s use-it-or-lose it rules on airport landing slots, freeing airlines to halt \u201cghost flights\u201d in which planes have been taking off without any passengers. The aviation sector has been badly hit by the crisis after a collapse in customer demand and the requirement under EU rules that they use 80% of their allocated slots or risk losing them to a competitor. Airlines from across Europe have been unnecessarily burning their way through thousands of tonnes of fuel flying near empty planes at a time when takings are down and are expected to plummet further. The UK and its airlines remain tied to the EU rulebook until the end of 2020. Virgin Atlantic is among the carriers flying planes that are \u201calmost empty\u201d to keep takeoff and landing slots. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said she feared the situation for the aviation industry would only worsen in coming days and weeks. \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has a major impact on the European and international aviation industry. We see that the situation is deteriorating on a daily basis, and traffic is expected to decline further. And this is why the commission will put forward very rapidly legislation regarding the so-called airport slots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to make it easier for airlines to keep their airport slot, even if they do not operate flights in those slots, because of the declining traffic.\u201d Von der Leyen said it was a temporary measure aimed at helping the industry and environment. \u201cIt will relieve the pressure on the aviation industry and in particular on smaller airline companies, but it will also decrease emissions by avoiding the so called ghost flights.

Cuffe said: \u201cIt\u2019s worrying. I would hope she can use emergency commission powers rather than wait for the European parliament to commence voting again.\u201d Several large airlines have been hit hard by the outbreak and were taking emergency measures to cut their costs. The International Air Transport Association estimates the industry could lose $113bn (\u00a387bn) in sales. ACI Europe, which represents European airports, said its initial assessment was that passenger numbers between January and March would drop by 14%. \u201cThe Covid-19 epidemic is turning into a shock of unprecedented proportions for our industry,\u201d the director general, Olivier Jankovec, said. On Tuesday, British Airways suspended all flights to and from Italy, the European country in which the virus has had its biggest impact so far. Ryanair said no flights would serve Italy from Saturday until 9 April and easyJet has cancelled dozens of its flights to the country. Air France is reducing its traffic to Italy by half throughout March. Spain has also banned direct flights between Italy and its airports, which amount to 9% of all Spanish international air traffic.

      "body": "<p>As Matt Hancock was doing a not altogether convincing job of sounding as if he was on top of the coronavirus epidemic during health questions \u2013 being led by the scientific evidence increasingly sounds like ministerial code for making policy up on the hoof while trying not to panic \u2013 there was at least one part of Westminster that was functioning normally. As in barely functioning at all. For down on the committee corridor, cabinet secretary and senior civil servant Mark Sedwill found himself facing two hours of questions from the public administration and constitutional affairs select committee.</p> <p>Here was the perfect calm. A man who has never knowingly given a helpful or straight answer to anyone. Indeed Sedwill would consider it a gross dereliction of duty to be anything other than thoroughly opaque. To be forgotten is the highest compliment he can be paid. And a committee that \u2013 with a couple of notable exceptions \u2013 was hell-bent on finding out absolutely nothing of any interest at all costs. Not just by passive negligence but also by active design. On several occasions it felt as if the committee was alarmed Sedwill might accidentally say something noteworthy and tried to warn him off. Not that he required their help.</p> <p>The tone was set by chair William \u201cWet\u201d Wragg. Quite how this Conservative MP has come to be in charge of this committee is one of life\u2019s mysteries. It\u2019s not just that he appears to have little personality \u2013 no one can remember him making a single telling contribution in the five years he has been in parliament \u2013 but also because he seems to be almost entirely without intellectual curiosity. Every day is a wondrous new beginning for him where he wakes up astonished to find he is an MP \u2013 an astonishment that is shared by those who know him best \u2013 and his first instinct is to ask for instructions on what to do next. Anything for a quiet life.</p> <p>Wragg opened with a mumbled observation about bullying on the whole not being a very good thing. He sounded apologetic for bringing up such a potentially embarrassing subject and keen to move on to something less challenging. Sedwill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/10/ministers-should-be-courteous-to-officials-says-top-civil-servant-priti-patel\">agreed that everyone could probably do a bit better</a> and it might be an idea to introduce some coaching for ministers to help them tone down the bullying a bit.</p> <p>It was all kept deliberately vague and impersonal as no one was keen to mention <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/02/cabinet-office-to-investigate-priti-patel-bullying-claims\">the specific allegations against the home secretary, Priti Patel</a>. Because that would be awkward for all concerned and might raise tricky questions. Tory David Jones was keen to point out that it was very hard to differentiate between robust discussion and bullying and that the benefit of the doubt should always go to the minister. Besides, rather than create a fuss, why not ship out a civil servant who objected to being bullied and employ one who responded well to it instead. Fellow Conservative John Stevenson nodded eagerly. Quite right. Ministers should be allowed to choose their yes men and women.</p> <p>Sedwill, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Sir Humphrey as it is, responded by quoting directly from Yes, Minister.

      "bodyText": "As Matt Hancock was doing a not altogether convincing job of sounding as if he was on top of the coronavirus epidemic during health questions \u2013 being led by the scientific evidence increasingly sounds like ministerial code for making policy up on the hoof while trying not to panic \u2013 there was at least one part of Westminster that was functioning normally. As in barely functioning at all. For down on the committee corridor, cabinet secretary and senior civil servant Mark Sedwill found himself facing two hours of questions from the public administration and constitutional affairs select committee. Here was the perfect calm. A man who has never knowingly given a helpful or straight answer to anyone. Indeed Sedwill would consider it a gross dereliction of duty to be anything other than thoroughly opaque. To be forgotten is the highest compliment he can be paid. And a committee that \u2013 with a couple of notable exceptions \u2013 was hell-bent on finding out absolutely nothing of any interest at all costs. Not just by passive negligence but also by active design. On several occasions it felt as if the committee was alarmed Sedwill might accidentally say something noteworthy and tried to warn him off. Not that he required their help. The tone was set by chair William \u201cWet\u201d Wragg. Quite how this Conservative MP has come to be in charge of this committee is one of life\u2019s mysteries. It\u2019s not just that he appears to have little personality \u2013 no one can remember him making a single telling contribution in the five years he has been in parliament \u2013 but also because he seems to be almost entirely without intellectual curiosity. Every day is a wondrous new beginning for him where he wakes up astonished to find he is an MP \u2013 an astonishment that is shared by those who know him best \u2013 and his first instinct is to ask for instructions on what to do next. Anything for a quiet life. Wragg opened with a mumbled observation about bullying on the whole not being a very good thing. He sounded apologetic for bringing up such a potentially embarrassing subject and keen to move on to something less challenging. Sedwill agreed that everyone could probably do a bit better and it might be an idea to introduce some coaching for ministers to help them tone down the bullying a bit. It was all kept deliberately vague and impersonal as no one was keen to mention the specific allegations against the home secretary, Priti Patel. Because that would be awkward for all concerned and might raise tricky questions. Tory David Jones was keen to point out that it was very hard to differentiate between robust discussion and bullying and that the benefit of the doubt should always go to the minister. Besides, rather than create a fuss, why not ship out a civil servant who objected to being bullied and employ one who responded well to it instead. Fellow Conservative John Stevenson nodded eagerly. Quite right. Ministers should be allowed to choose their yes men and women. Sedwill, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Sir Humphrey as it is, responded by quoting directly from Yes, Minister. The whole job of being a civil servant was to keep the chips up rather than being forced into difficult situations when the chips were down. It was hard to know if he was just taking the piss out of the committee for being so hopeless or whether he always talked like this. Probably a bit of both. In any case he found another way of filling five minutes while saying precisely nothing. It took a while, but the SNP\u2019s Ronnie Cowan and Labour\u2019s Lloyd Russell-Moyle did eventually raise the unprecedented public resignation of home office permanent secretary Philip Rutnam and the various allegations agains Patel. But they too rather succumbed to the inevitable futility and faded into unconsciousness. Too long in Wragg\u2019s company can do that to you. Sedwill merely batted away any direct questions by saying he couldn\u2019t comment as legal proceedings were ongoing. Not that he would have even if they weren\u2019t. So no one ever got round to getting to the bottom of the key issues. Such as whether Rutnam had gone to Sedwill before his resignation. Whether Sedwill thought there had been a breach of the ministerial code. Whether Rutnam had had any run-ins with previous ministers. And whether Sedwill had warned Boris Johnson about Patel\u2019s previous. In fact, all the things the cabinet secretary had been summoned before the committee to answer.

The state-owned oil firm Saudi Aramco said in April, when a three-year Opec deal with Russia expires, it would increase output from 9.7m barrels per day (bpd) to 12.3m, flooding the market and bringing oil prices lower. On Monday, Brent crude plunged more than 30% to its lowest levels since February 2016. The drop was the biggest one-day percentage decline since the first Gulf war began in 1991. Within hours of the Saudi statement, Occidental Petroleum, the biggest shale oil producer in the US, slashed its dividend payout from 79 to 11 cents a share. The Houston-based company, which spent $57bn with mostly borrowed funds to buy the oil and gas rival Anadarko Petroleum last year, announced it would also cut investment this year to between $3.5bn and $3.7bn, from $5.2bn to $5.4bn in 2019, to cope with an expected drop in operating profits and a 50% dive in its share value after the price crash. \u201cDue to the sharp decline in global commodity prices, we are taking actions that will strengthen our balance sheet and continue to reduce debt,\u201d the company said. Several of the largest shale oil producers are heavily in debt and known to be unprofitable with an oil price below $50 a barrel. John Forsythe, the chief global strategist at Boston-based BrightSphere Investment, said: \u201cContinuing downward price pressures on the heavily leveraged US oil and natural gas industry could lead to missed debt payments. \u201cThat would have an outsized impact on the US economy given that the shale industry, for example, has accounted for as much as 10 percent of economic growth in recent years and the broader oil and natural gas industry supports more than 10 million jobs.\u201d Oil prices had rebounded by 8% on Tuesday after Russia signalled that talks to limit supplies in line with the Opec oil cartel, which broke down last Friday and triggered the biggest price drop in nearly 30 years, were still possible.

The Russian oil minister, Alexander Novak, said he did not rule out joint measures with Opec to stabilise the market, adding that the next meeting to discuss production levels and prices was planned for May-June. However, Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister told Reuters he did not see a need to hold a meeting in May-June if there was no agreement on what measures should be taken to deal with the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand and prices. \u201cI fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures,\u201d Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said. Oil company share prices recovered some of their Monday losses, with BP adding 11% to close at 333p and Shell up 3.7% to \u00a313.66.

Analysts at RBC said: \u201cPrice wars and pandemics are nothing new to the commodity markets, but both occurring simultaneously is something we have yet to witness in our careers.\u201d They said without a deal between Russia and the Opec countries it was difficult to see where the oil price would settle. The last time the price of Brent crude dropped below $40 a barrel in 2016, the US shale oil boom was in full flow and global oil markets were flooded with supply.",

One called the abrupt decision to axe all 60 BA routes as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. It left tourists and business travellers scrambling for alternative flights and road transport after Italy imposed a nationwide lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. \u201cI feel absolutely betrayed.

Another said \u201cRyanair has gone up in my estimation\u201d after the airline said it would continue with flights up to and including Friday and may also put on more flights to repatriate the marooned. As the UK Foreign Office activated plans to repatriate the 140 British nationals from the virus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship which docked in California on Tuesday, anger flared in Italy over BA\u2019s handling of the crisis. A UK passenger told reporters she felt \u201cdumped\u201d by the airline, while another said they had now ordered a taxi to Austria tomorrow morning to escape but were worried they might get stopped on the border without health certificates, something Slovenia is already demanding. \u201cTheir website was down, their call centres are overloaded and we got an email after midnight saying our flight was cancelled.

Another passenger described the British Airways move as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. The country is not completely cut off. On Tuesday Alitalia said it was carrying on with its twice daily services between Rome and Heathrow \u201ctoday, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and in the following days\u201d.

British Airways said: \u201cThis is a fast moving situation, and we recommend all customers check for the latest on their flight on ba.com.\u201d The Association of British Insurers said those that are currently in Italy should be able to invoke a \u201cdisruption\u201d contract in their insurance policy because the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had updated its official guidance on Italy warning that \u201call but essential travel\u201d was advisable. \u201cPeople who are there already or have cancelled after the FCO issued their advice need to check their insurance policy and if it has a disruption to travel clause they should be able to make a claim. \u201cIf you have a really cheap policy, it is unlikely that you will have cover for disruption. Some insurers offer it as standard but others offer it as additional,\u201d said a spokeswoman for ABI. Those who had planned weddings in Italy will be particularly hit but could be able to claim on insurance if the venue forced to cancel or they had wedding insurance, she added. City worker Ali McVan who has spent two years planning his wedding to Matthew on Ischia, an island off Naples, at the end of May said he was on tenterhooks. \u201cI would be devastated,\u201d he said if he had to cancel the event which is costing the couple around \u00a330,000. He emailed his 80 guests this morning to outline the two scenarios \u2013 holding tight and cancelling and was surprised by the determination of the guests to beat the ban. \u201cWe had people saying we didn\u2019t care, they would hire boats, or a hovercraft, they were so determined to make sure it happened,\u201d said Ali. Like many he is concerned that the insurance will only be covered if the FCO advice remains in place on the date of the wedding and may not offer cover if the lockdown is lifted but some guests have already chosen not to travel. Chiara Dall\u2019aglio, coordinator for the Tourist Board in Umbria, said it was difficult to quantify how many British were in the area but that the region was very popular with those with second homes. Despite the lockdown and an effective curfew on socialising there were no road blocks preventing people leaving the area for the airports to return to the UK, she said. \u201cWhat we cannot do is assemble, we have to keep a distance from others. So the shops stay open, you can go for a walk in the park and you can go to work, but all bars, cafes and restaurants must be shut by 6pm,\u201d she said.",

      "bodyText": "Speculation is mounting that Mark Carney will use his final week as governor of the Bank of England to announce a dramatic package of support for the British economy to help it through the coronavirus outbreak. City traders believe Threadneedle Street could announce an immediate cut in interest rates, and ease borrowing conditions for high street banks, to coincide with Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget on Wednesday, as part of a concerted effort to help households and businesses amid the unfolding economic crisis. Economists expect the Bank will cut interest rates by as much as 50 basis points to 0.25%, taking borrowing costs back down to the lowest level in the central bank\u2019s 325-year history. Hopes for a coordinated Bank-Treasury double act came as an early rally in share prices fizzled out after the biggest rout in global markets since the 2008 financial crisis on Monday. The pound fell by two cents against the dollar as the US currency rallied amid speculation that the White House would unveil emergency stimulus to shore-up confidence in the world\u2019s largest economy. The FTSE 100 had initially rallied by about 3.5% in early trading on Tuesday, as shares fought back from the steepest losses sustained since the weeks after Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse during the financial crisis. However, the index of leading UK company shares later surrendered the gains to end the day back in the red, sliding by five points to 5,960. With rising expectations for intervention designed to offset the worst of the economic fallout from the spread of the disease, the Trump administration announced that US health insurers had agreed to extend coronavirus treatment coverage in their benefit plans and waive fees charged for tests for the disease. However, the president attacked the US Federal Reserve on Twitter for a \u201cpathetic, slow moving\u201d response. He tweeted: \u201cThe Federal Reserve must be a leader, not a very late follower, which it has been!\u201d The Fed was the first big central bank to cut rates at an emergency meeting last week, although further cuts are expected. Analysts also expect the European Central Bank to cut rates and announce measures to bolster bank lending across the eurozone when its governing council meets on Thursday. Amid increasing concern as the global death toll climbs, City banks including Barclays, Nomura and ING said a swift response in the UK spearheaded by Carney and Sunak was increasingly likely. Carney is to stand down on Sunday to be replaced by Andrew Bailey the following day. Carney and Bailey revealed last week that the Bank was holding talks with Sunak to develop a \u201cpowerful and timely\u201d coordinated response between Threadneedle Street and No 11. Speaking to MPs on the Treasury committee, Carney dropped the broadest possible hint that rates could be cut soon, saying \u201call necessary steps to support the UK economy and the financial system\u201d would be taken. As well as the rate cut, Threadneedle Street is also expected to relax the amount of capital high street banks must hold in an effort to encourage them to lend to consumers and businesses, helping them to stay afloat. Similar measures were used after the shock Brexit vote to release \u00a3150bn worth of additional lending. Countries and companies are strengthening their efforts to contain the economic fallout as the death toll exceeded 4,000, out of more than 116,000 infections worldwide. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, announced a \u00a5430bn (\u00a33.2bn) funding package to help businesses affected by the outbreak. Companies across Britain also continued to spell out the impact the outbreak was having on their businesses. Halifax, Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender, said it was shutting a call centre in Belfast employing 1,000 people after one employee tested positive. Meanwhile Informa, the world\u2019s biggest exhibition and events organiser, said it had cancelled 130 events worldwide and would lose more than \u00a3400m in revenue. The furniture retailer DFS said it had noted an abrupt decline in shopper numbers since last week and that more than \u00a3200m of sales it would normally expect to make in the run-up to Easter were at risk. Safestay, which operates hostels across Europe, told the stock exchange it was facing \u201ca material downturn\u201d in bookings as travellers abandoned plans.",

The criticism comes despite the prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/australia-to-unveil-24bn-coronavirus-health-package-including-pop-up-fever-clinics\">Scott Morrison, announcing a $2.4bn health package</a> to fund up to 100 new pop-up fever clinics, a $30m advertising campaign and a Medicare item for telehealth consultations. Meanwhile, turmoil continued on financial markets amid growing fears of a recession and industry experts predict the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-could-hit-housing-hard-as-australia-teeters-on-edge-of-recession\">property market will come to a halt</a> if the virus gets out of control. In Europe overnight, stock markets continued to tumble and the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, issued a stark warning: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/australia-to-unveil-24bn-coronavirus-health-package-including-pop-up-fever-clinics\">\u201cThere is no more time \u2013 our future is in our hands\u201d</a> as he announced further measures to restrict public gatherings in a country already in lockdown. In the US, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced a \u201ccontainment plan\u201d for New Rochelle, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in the New York metro area. About 1,000 people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/new-york-coronavirus-new-rochelle-containment\">were placed under precautionary quarantine</a>. Confirmed cases of Covid-19 now exceed 116,000 and there have been more than 4,000 deaths. The number of deaths outside China has now surpassed 1,000.</p> \n<p><strong>Australia\u2019s highest court is to decide whether to go ahead with an appeal by the disgraced Cardinal George Pell against his conviction for child sex abuse. </strong>The 78-year-old was jailed for six years last year for sexually abusing two choirboys at Melbourne\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. Pell maintains his innocence. Pell\u2019s lawyers have two grounds for appeal. First, they say the court of appeal majority made an error in finding Pell was required to prove the offending was \u201cimpossible\u201d in order to raise reasonable doubt, and second, they argue the majority found there was a reasonable doubt and therefore made an error in asserting that the guilty verdicts were not unreasonable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/11/australias-highest-court-to-decide-if-disgraced-cardinal-george-pells-final-appeal-will-go-ahead\">If they are successful, Pell would be released from prison immediately.</a></p> \n<p><strong>Voting gets under way in the US in another round of crucial primaries in the Democratic race to face Donald Trump in the November presidential election. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-michigan-bernie-sanders-joe-biden-donald-trump-live-updates\">Voters in Michigan, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho and North Dakota</a> could cement Joe Biden\u2019s position as frontrunner, but there are signs Bernie Sanders could win once again in Michigan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">the state with the highest number of delegates</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 11 March. Top stories Australian doctors have criticised the federal government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak as a \u201cshambles\u201d, saying conflicting advice, a lack of testing kits and delays on hotlines are testing the health system. The criticism comes despite the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announcing a $2.4bn health package to fund up to 100 new pop-up fever clinics, a $30m advertising campaign and a Medicare item for telehealth consultations. Meanwhile, turmoil continued on financial markets amid growing fears of a recession and industry experts predict the property market will come to a halt if the virus gets out of control. In Europe overnight, stock markets continued to tumble and the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, issued a stark warning: \u201cThere is no more time \u2013 our future is in our hands\u201d as he announced further measures to restrict public gatherings in a country already in lockdown. In the US, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced a \u201ccontainment plan\u201d for New Rochelle, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in the New York metro area. About 1,000 people were placed under precautionary quarantine. Confirmed cases of Covid-19 now exceed 116,000 and there have been more than 4,000 deaths. The number of deaths outside China has now surpassed 1,000. Australia\u2019s highest court is to decide whether to go ahead with an appeal by the disgraced Cardinal George Pell against his conviction for child sex abuse. The 78-year-old was jailed for six years last year for sexually abusing two choirboys at Melbourne\u2019s St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral. Pell maintains his innocence. Pell\u2019s lawyers have two grounds for appeal. First, they say the court of appeal majority made an error in finding Pell was required to prove the offending was \u201cimpossible\u201d in order to raise reasonable doubt, and second, they argue the majority found there was a reasonable doubt and therefore made an error in asserting that the guilty verdicts were not unreasonable. If they are successful, Pell would be released from prison immediately. Voting gets under way in the US in another round of crucial primaries in the Democratic race to face Donald Trump in the November presidential election. Voters in Michigan, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho and North Dakota could cement Joe Biden\u2019s position as frontrunner, but there are signs Bernie Sanders could win once again in Michigan, the state with the highest number of delegates. Sanders unexpectedly won the state in 2016, when he took on Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination. Australia Scott Morrison is once again the country\u2019s preferred prime minister, bouncing back from the hit he took during the bushfires. The Guardian Essential poll found that 40% of the sample had him as their preferred choice despite the government\u2019s ongoing \u201csports rorts\u201d scandal. Economists have called for the Australian government to pump billions into the economy to avert the plunging stock market. The calls come after Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of dramatic measures delivered US markets from a repeat of Monday\u2019s coronavirus carnage. Scientists have warned that Australian climate science capability is lacking. The government-sponsored review found \u201ccritical gaps\u201d in the nation\u2019s ability to understand the processes that underpin climate change. The University of Tasmania will slash the number of courses they offer from 514 to 120 due to coronavirus. University vice-chancellor Rufus Black said the university suffered from an \u201coverreliance on China\u201d. The world UN secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres says the world is \u201cway off track\u201d in its efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Scientists in the UN\u2019s report on global climate in 2019 said the threat was greater than coronavirus, and world leaders must not be diverted from climate action. A study in the Nature Communications journal shows that large ecosystems such as the Amazon can collapse in decades once a tipping point has been passed. The study authors said the findings should warn politicians that they have less time than they may imagine to tackle the crisis. Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have asked that the movie producer be given a lighter sentence due to his \u201cremarkable accomplishments\u201d. In a letter sent to Judge James Burke, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers argue his \u201cstruggles\u201d and \u201clife story\u201d should not be disregarded. Food banks in the UK have started to run out of milk and other staples as shoppers panic buy due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Shoppers are being urged to think twice before hoarding supplies as donations fall.

The Age, Sydney Morning Herald and Courier Mail all take the same line, while the Australian leads with a headline describing Morrison\u2019s response as \u201cclinical\u201d. Crikey says the Nine board should delay the closure of Australian Associated Press until alternative funding can be found. Coming up The high court in Canberra will decide whether George Pell will be able to pursue his appeal.

In eight states \u2013 Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2013 the governor has statutory power to delay elections.</p> \n<p>But Grayson said the emergency laws mainly dealt with things like natural disasters and terrorism, not disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want our elections to be resilient and able to handle challenges, but this is a tough one,\u201d he said.</p>",

That might not be enough, said Mike Brickner, the director of the Ohio chapter of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. \u201cObviously this is pretty short notice and voters may not know that their polling location has moved and may not get that postcard in the mail, or see it, or read it,\u201d he said. He urged election officials to go the \u201cextra mile\u201d and said his group plans to text voters affected by the change. Anticipating a last-minute influx of absentee ballot requests, Ohio\u2019s LaRose also instructed local boards of election to allow people to drop off their absentee ballots in person on election day until 7.30pm, when the polls close. Coronavirus concerns, and the adapted measures, compound the existing challenges of the 2020 election, including unprecedented turnout, ageing voting equipment and cybersecurity threats. \u201cMost administrators already don\u2019t have sufficient resources (people and money). The uncertainty makes it even harder,\u201d said Trey Grayson, the former secretary of state of Kentucky. With three months of primary elections taking place across the country, election administrators are trying to reallocate resources at the last minute, Grayson said. \u201cYou could have too few opportunities for early voting, or not enough folks lined up to count mail ballots, or too many people at the polls on election day. Or the reverse if this thing doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact,\u201d he said. \u201cRegardless, planning is hard.\u201d Forty-five states have provisions that allow for changes to elections in case of emergency, though the procedures vary widely from state to state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In eight states \u2013 Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2013 the governor has statutory power to delay elections. But Grayson said the emergency laws mainly dealt with things like natural disasters and terrorism, not disease. \u201cWe want our elections to be resilient and able to handle challenges, but this is a tough one,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor is to pledge billions of pounds to ease the strain on the NHS as it tackles the Covid-19 outbreak and to reassure an increasingly nervous Britain after the nation\u2019s first MP contracted the virus. The health minister Nadine Dorries has been diagnosed and is in self-isolation, raising fears that the infection could have spread in Westminster, including No 10, where she attended an event with Boris Johnson last week. Focus will now fall on tracking down and testing the hundreds of people Dorries will have been in contact with in the past week, both in parliament and at the health department. With the UK facing the biggest financial threat in more than a decade amid fears the epidemic could cause a recession, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce a raft of measures in Wednesday\u2019s budget to safeguard jobs, extend the scope of sick pay, and prevent businesses going under by deferring tax payments. There was growing speculation in the City that the Bank of England would respond to crashing share prices on global financial markets with an unscheduled cut in interest rates, designed to dovetail with Treasury action. Sunak, who has been in the post for less than a month, has been forced to revise his budget plans after it became increasingly clear the government\u2019s priority needs to be managing the Covid-19 crisis. While the chancellor insisted on Tuesday that his speech would lay the foundations of a \u201cdecade of growth for everybody\u201d, the budget was expected to announce only limited action to deliver on the government\u2019s election pledge to spread prosperity to all parts of Britain. The government prepared to set out its financial rescue package following another turbulent day in which: The number of confirmed cases in the UK rose to 382 and a sixth death was announced. The NHS announced that it would rapidly scale up testing for the virus, so that 10,000 patients can be checked. Downing Street admitted the NHS 111 online service had been giving the wrong advice to travellers returning from Italy: that there was no need to self-isolate if they had no symptoms. They are now being told to self-isolate and stay indoors. British Airways and easyJet cancelled all flights to and from Italy, while Ryanair cancelled flights from this coming Friday until 8 April, as the Italian government\u2019s decision to place the entire country on lockdown came into effect. Angry British tourists accused airlines of leaving them \u201cstranded\u201d and scrambling for alternative flights and road transport. International financial markets stabilised amid hopes governments would act to protect their economies. The EU agreed to fund researchers seeking a vaccine for the coronavirus, allow member states greater flexibility on subsidies to companies, and invest \u20ac25bn in parts of the European economy worst hit. At least two US Republican politicians who had recently met Donald Trump announced they were going into self-quarantine after potentially being exposed to the virus at a conference. As the total number of global infections reached 116,000 and the death toll passed 4,000, the British government\u2019s broader strategy came into sharp contrast with draconian measures being rolled out by other European authorities. Austria announced a ban on Italians entering the country unless they were carrying a medical certificate, and Spain, which reported 35 deaths and 1,622 confirmed cases on Tuesday, shut schools in several regions, including the capital, Madrid. In Germany, which has 1,295 coronavirus patients and where two people have died, Berlin authorities announced the closure of all theatres, concert halls and opera houses until at least the end of the Easter holidays. The capital also became the seventh of Germany\u2019s 16 states to ban gatherings of 1,000 people or more. The UK government\u2019s strategy of holding off on closing schools or cancelling major outdoor events, such as football matches, was defended by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries. She said the argument for cancelling major events was not necessarily supported by science, adding: \u201cThe virus will not survive very long outside.\u201d Matt Hancock defended the government\u2019s handling of the crisis in the House of Commons, amid criticism that people were being told they could not be tested unless they had had contact with a known case. The health secretary said all of the government\u2019s advice was \u201cdriven by clinicians\u201d and was under constant review. Among those making subtle calls for a change of tactics was Dr Peter Drobac, an expert in infectious diseases at Oxford University, who said he believed it was time to seriously consider some of the social distancing adopted by other countries, including closing schools. \u201cThe evidence on social distancing is limited but pretty clear \u2013 it works better when done pre-emptively,\u201d said Drobac, adding that with hindsight it appeared Italy had waited too long before implementing such measures. The government was accused of playing roulette with the public by the editor of the Lancet medical journal. Dr Richard Horton called for the \u201curgent implementation of social distancing and closure policies\u201d. There was also firm support for the experts advising the government, including those on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which held a meeting chaired by the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at Reading University, said ministers should not be rushed into moving into the \u201cdelay\u201d phase. \u201cMore serious containment action, such as that seen in China and Italy, should not be used unless absolutely necessary. We must avoid \u2018something must be done, this is something so let\u2019s do it\u2019 scenarios,\u201d he said. However, others stressed that draconian measures did help to limit the impact of infectious disease outbreaks. Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, a lecturer in global health at St George\u2019s, University of London, said: \u201cSocial distancing measures have had a major effect in Wuhan, and in previous outbreaks, such as the recent Ebola outbreak in west Africa and Spanish Flu in 1918.

NT Health\u2019s Covid-19 plan says people suffering more than one illness and complicated health conditions in remote areas and their distance from major hospitals places residents there \u201cat risk for severe disease from Covid-19\u201d. \u201cThose who have been to countries currently listed as being at high and moderate risk should not visit unless absolutely essential and cleared with the health service,\u201d the plan says. It recommends health workers strongly promote flu vaccination to reduce the concurrent burden of the virus, as well as reduce any potential \u201cconfusion regarding diagnosis/causes of outbreaks\u201d. The plan acknowledges the challenges presented by \u201covercrowding in housing, poor hygiene and other environmental conditions that can increase disease transmission and raise attack rates\u201d. It notes that access to healthcare is often reduced due to a lack of transport and electronic communications infrastructure. On top of that, many ill people may present late. \u201cHealth workers should encourage early presentation of all respiratory illnesses, particularly in vulnerable community members, and isolate all respiratory cases who fit the clinical case criteria and their close contacts.\u201d But it acknowledges isolation is a challenge in overcrowded housing. The NT government is considering using non-residential community buildings for isolation purposes, including NT government buildings, and planning the delivery of food, prescribed medications and essentials such as disposable nappies to anyone placed in isolation. There would be \u201cmonitoring of the household situation, initially through social contact via telephone \u2013 this may be a nonclinical person telephoning daily to ask questions according to a protocol regarding material needs, emotional status and any worsening of symptoms\u201d. Social isolation could be managed through phone contact with a registered nurse, and if social contact identifies worsening of symptoms \u201cclients without telephone may need home visits, with sufficient distance maintained by contact person ie speak to household through window or from gate\u201d. But it says \u201cevacuation options are additionally being considered\u201d. The NT government has employed a communicable diseases nurse in Darwin and one in Alice Springs to provide advice and assistance to primary health carers. On Monday the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) lands introduced strict rules for entry to their lands, which they can do under the APY Land Rights Act. \u201cWe are protecting our people, especially those who hold our ancient cultural knowledge, and we know they are already vulnerable as they are quite old,\u201d APY general manager Richard King said. \u201cThe problem with this one is it has a 3.4% fatality rate, which is high, but with our cohort, if it gets here, it\u2019s going to be devastating.\u201d The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advisory group on Covid-19, made up of leaders from the Aboriginal community-controlled health sector, state and territory health and medical officials, Aboriginal communicable disease experts, the Australian Indigenous Doctors\u2019 Association and the National Indigenous Australians Agency had its first meeting on Monday. There are major issues to consider, \u201cdepending on how serious it gets, and events as they unfold\u201d, Olga Havnen, a member of the taskforce and CEO of the Darwin-based Aboriginal health organisation Danila Dilba said on Monday. \u201cWe would need deployment based on where the need is greatest,\u201d Havnen said. \u201cAnd will people want to do it?

We are going to ask a lot of Victorians.\u201d</p> <p>Federal education minister Dan Tehan said the trigger for more widespread closures of schools had not yet been reached, \u201cbut it does seem very clear now that the idea of containing the virus is getting harder and harder\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/australia-to-unveil-24bn-coronavirus-health-package-including-pop-up-fever-clinics\">Australia to unveil $2.4bn coronavirus health package including pop-up fever clinics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So far two schools in Sydney and two in Melbourne have temporarily closed after students tested positive. Across Australia, 107 people have tested positive for Covid-19, the majority in New South Wales.</p> <p>Tehan said state and federal governments were coordinating their responses and that the widespread closures of schools, while not yet necessary, might have to be considered.</p> <p>\u201cWe do have to prepare for all contingencies,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cIf there was to be a next step it is more likely to be localised school closures rather than statewide.\u201d</p> <p>Tehan said the trigger for larger-scale school closures would be the advice of state and federal health authorities.</p> <p>\u201cIf the medical advice says we need to take extreme measures that is what the government will do but at the moment the medical advice is very clear. What is occurring is schools are temporarily shutting down and that will be the case unless the medical advice says otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking to reporters late on Tuesday, Andrews said he wanted to publicly share the details of the government\u2019s planning \u201cnot to alarm anybody, but to simply prepare people for what the experts tell us is not an \u2018if\u2019 or \u2018if not\u2019, it is simply a matter of \u2018when\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is deeply frustrating we can\u2019t give you \u2026 the exact timing, but we are told by the experts that we are going to reach a phase where there is such significant transmission of this virus \u2026 that we will need to take extreme measures, that we will need to ask Victorians to do things we\u2019ve never asked them to do.\u201d</p> <p>The disruption would be significant, Andrews said, hurting the state\u2019s economy and inconveniencing \u201cmany, many people\u201d. But he said the fewer people who contracted Covid-19, the fewer would be critically ill.

      "bodyText": "Victorian premier Dan Andrews says the statewide closure of schools, workplaces, even the shutdown of industries is an \u201cinevitability\u201d as community transmission of the coronavirus makes containment impossible. Andrews stressed that \u201cwe\u2019re not announcing that schools are closing today, we are not cancelling the Grand Prix next week or footy the week after \u2026 now\u2019s not the time for those things, but that time will come, and it is appropriate ... to be frank with people, to be honest with people. We are going to ask a lot of Victorians.\u201d Federal education minister Dan Tehan said the trigger for more widespread closures of schools had not yet been reached, \u201cbut it does seem very clear now that the idea of containing the virus is getting harder and harder\u201d. So far two schools in Sydney and two in Melbourne have temporarily closed after students tested positive. Across Australia, 107 people have tested positive for Covid-19, the majority in New South Wales. Tehan said state and federal governments were coordinating their responses and that the widespread closures of schools, while not yet necessary, might have to be considered. \u201cWe do have to prepare for all contingencies,\u201d he told ABC radio. \u201cIf there was to be a next step it is more likely to be localised school closures rather than statewide.\u201d Tehan said the trigger for larger-scale school closures would be the advice of state and federal health authorities. \u201cIf the medical advice says we need to take extreme measures that is what the government will do but at the moment the medical advice is very clear. What is occurring is schools are temporarily shutting down and that will be the case unless the medical advice says otherwise.\u201d Speaking to reporters late on Tuesday, Andrews said he wanted to publicly share the details of the government\u2019s planning \u201cnot to alarm anybody, but to simply prepare people for what the experts tell us is not an \u2018if\u2019 or \u2018if not\u2019, it is simply a matter of \u2018when\u2019\u201d. \u201cIt is deeply frustrating we can\u2019t give you \u2026 the exact timing, but we are told by the experts that we are going to reach a phase where there is such significant transmission of this virus \u2026 that we will need to take extreme measures, that we will need to ask Victorians to do things we\u2019ve never asked them to do.\u201d The disruption would be significant, Andrews said, hurting the state\u2019s economy and inconveniencing \u201cmany, many people\u201d. But he said the fewer people who contracted Covid-19, the fewer would be critically ill. The plans being considered by the government were intended to keep people safe, Andrews said. \u201cPart of that plan is the inevitability that we will get to the point that rather than one school being closed, all of our schools will be closed,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than people simply distancing themselves and quarantining themselves, we may have entire sectors, entire workforces where people are working from home.\u201d Australia\u2019s university sector \u2013 significantly dependent on international students, particularly from China \u2013 is already being hard hit by coronavirus travel bans and student withdrawals. The University of Tasmania will cut the number of courses it offers from 514 to fewer than 120, as part of a major overhaul driven in part by an \u201coverreliance on China\u201d and the impact of the coronavirus. In an extraordinary missive, the university\u2019s vice-chancellor Rufus Black told staff the university was \u201cfacing sustained headwinds\u201d and \u201cworking against powerful forces\u201d in its efforts to become economically sustainable. Black said the combination of an \u201coverreliance on China as a market for international education and what is now emerging as a pandemic\u201d had forced the university to re-evaluate its curriculum. Southern Cross University will close its Lismore campus in northern NSW and its Gold Coast campus in southern Queensland after a visiting staff member from the Philippines tested positive for Covid-19. The man attended workshops at the two university campuses last week before returning to the Philippines on Saturday. He later became unwell and has since tested positive. \u201cThe university has identified 45 people who came into contact or proximity with the man during his time in Australia. In conjunction with the health authorities, the university is contacting each individual,\u201d Southern Cross said in a statement.",

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap, after another wild day in the markets. World stock markets have been hit by fresh turbulence, a day after their worst rout since the financial crisis. Fears over the coronavirus outbreak and the launch of an oil price war continue to rattle traders, leading to very volatile trading. The day began, and ended, with optimism that the White House was planning payroll tax cuts and support for businesses hurt by the current turmoil. But in between, fears of a global downturn weighed on stocks too. European markets closed in the red for the second day running, suffering fresh losses after their worst day since 2008. The Stoxx 600 lost almost 1% more, with Italy leading the selloff as economists predicted a deep recession this year. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 also began the day strongly, rising by over 3%, but that rally fizzled out. It closed flat at 5960. a four-year low, after slumping by almost 500 points yesterday. However, Wall Street jumped by almost 5% tonight, after president Donald Trump said his administration were helping travel and holiday companies. Last night, Trump promised a big response to the Covid-19 threat (while still playing down the scale of the crisis). According to Bloomberg, the risk of a US recession is now over 50%. With this in mind, Trump\u2019s White House appears to be aiming to persuade Congress to back a stimulus package to shield the economy from the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. According to one report, that could include assistance for the shale oil and gas production industry. Trump also lashed out at the US central bank, calling it \u201cpathetic\u201d for not cutting interest rates faster. Energy companies were in the firing line again today, with Saudi Aramco announcing plans to pump millions more barrels of oil each day - as part of a plan to drive down the oil price and put rivals out of business. In the UK, banks promised help for small firms and mortgage holidays for consumers affected by the coronavirus outbreak, as the number of cases continues to rise. On Wednesday, Britain\u2019s new chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to pledge billions of extra pounds to help the NHS, and boost infrastructure spending. Meanwhile in Europe, officials are preparing to suspend the EU\u2019s use-it-or-lose it rules on airport landing slots, ending the spectre of airlines running \u201cghost flights\u201d with few or no passengers at all. Thanks for reading and commenting. Goodnight! GW Wall Street\u2019s finest are looking more cheerful tonight, after watching stocks recover from Monday\u2019s rout: Speculation is mounting that Mark Carney will use his final week as governor of the Bank of England to announce a dramatic package of support for the British economy to help it through the coronavirus outbreak, my colleague Richard Partington writes. City traders believe Threadneedle Street could announce an immediate cut in interest rates, and ease borrowing conditions for high street banks, to coincide with Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget on Wednesday, as part of a concerted effort to help households and businesses amid the unfolding economic crisis. Economists expect the Bank will cut interest rates by as much as 50 basis points to 0.25%, taking borrowing costs back down to the lowest level in the central bank\u2019s 325-year history. Does today\u2019s Wall Street rally mean it\u2019s time to pile into the markets again? Not according to Oxford Economics, whose analysts urge caution. They predict some companies (perhaps US shale producers?) will face financial problems in the coming weeks: Specifically, investors face three key considerations: (1) continuing spread of coronavirus in the West, (2) the fall-out of the financial tightening for fragile US corporate balance sheets and weak European banks and (3) policy responses. Only (3) is risk positive while (1) and (2) are continuing to develop. Moreover, there are legitimate doubts about whether policy response can be effective. The key underlying vulnerability that the coronavirus-led impairment can expose and cause to unravel is US corporate sector balance-sheet weakness. Given high levels of debt, weak profitability and low interest cover, risks of corporate sector distress remain particularly high. Tonight\u2019s stock market rally came despite predictions that the US economy could start shrinking this year, due to the coronavirus. Bloomberg News\u2019s Recession Tracker has calculated that the probability of a US downturn has jumped over 50%, based on various financial indicators, economic data and other factors. They explain: The surge in the recession probability reflects a sharp deterioration in financial conditions that began in mid-to-late February. As the number of cases -- and deaths -- from the rapidly spreading coronavirus increased, stocks plummeted and credit spreads widened. The market suffered yet another blow after a collapse of OPEC+ talks led to a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, sinking oil prices. Optimism that the White House might launch a stimulus programme, or take steps to support oil companies, airlines and cruise operators, drove all three Wall Street indices higher tonight. The S&amp;P 500 bounced by almost 5%, recovering from its 7.6% slump on Monday -- worst day since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. But as we\u2019ve been covering tonight, there are some doubts about president Trump\u2019s pledge to cut taxes. As Marketwatch puts it: Stock-index futures found support Tuesday after President Donald Trump advocated for payroll tax relief and other measures to help businesses deal with the economic slowdown resulting from the coronavirus epidemic. Lawmakers in both parties though expressed skepticism about a payroll-tax cut to bolster the economy. Boom! That\u2019s last-minute scramble into stocks had helped Wall Street recover around half Monday\u2019s crash. The Dow has jumped by 4.89% to finish at 25,018.16 , a gain of 1,167 points. Wall Street is ending the day with a rally! The \u2018plunge protection team\u2019, as they\u2019re known on Wall Street, appear to be back: That suggests the White House is worried about the market selloff.... Bailing out the US shale industry would be controversial - especially if the White House resists calls for more paid sick leave for workers who may have the coronavirus. Here\u2019s why: Washington Post is reporting that America\u2019s shale oil producers could get a lifeline, to help them cope with the Saudi price war: Here\u2019s what\u2019s I mean about Donald Trump downplaying Covid-19 (which has now killed 4,000 people) Back in Washington, Donald Trump has told Republicans he favours a tax break that would run until the presidential election: That might suit Trump\u2019s electoral hopes - but it\u2019s hardly the best and only way to protect Americans. Especially as criticism of the White House\u2019s approach of downplaying the virus is growing: Europe\u2019s top central banker is pushing for governments to boost spending - to fight the risk of a recession this year: A Barclays employee in New York has tested positive for Covid-19, Reuters is reporting. Meanwhile, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has said all meetings are suspended for 10 days, after a colleague went down with the virus (as flagged earlier -- not the WHO as I wrongly typed, sorry). One of America\u2019s largest shale oil producers has announced it is slashing its dividend, hard, following the outbreak of the oil price war. Payouts to shareholders are being slashed by over 86%, as Occidental cuts capital spending to between $3.5 billion and $3.7 billion, from its earlier forecast of between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion. Occidental is also planning additional cost-cutting measures, as the slump in crude oil prices takes a massive bite out of its revenues. Our economics editor Larry Elliott agrees that Italy faces a recession this year -- and probably a rather deep one: With schools, universities, theatres and cinemas shut and its hugely-important tourist industry facing a washout summer, the economy is going to shrink in both the first and second quarters of 2020. The big question is whether such a downturn creates contagion across Europe, creating another eurozone crisis: For the rest of Europe Italy is a country that is too big to fail. So what\u2019s really at stake is not whether Italian GDP contracts by 1.5% or 4.5% in the second quarter but whether its financial crisis proves contagious. As it might. Charles Dumas, of TS Lombard, says: \u201cThe [Italian] banking system is unlikely to be able to remain solvent or liquid in the current conditions of nationwide lockdown. The tourist industry is effectively dead for 2020. Fiscal stimulus could be counter-productive if, as is possible, investors demand a much wider credit spread to accept fresh Italian paper. Italy will need massive support from eurozone partners to avoid going the way of Greece. In another blow to Italy, the number of Covid-19 deaths and infections has risen sharply again: The human cost of this crisis (which matters much more than the financial one) is rising sharply. Ashoka Mody, formally a deputy director of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s European Department, fears that the coronavirus will trigger a deep recession in Italy this year. He argues that policymakers should devise a precautionary bailout of \u20ac500bn to \u20ac700bn, to reassure markets that it can meet its debt obligations. Writing on Marketwatch, he says: The coronavirus will almost certainly cause the Italian economy to contract by about 3% in the first half of 2020, although the damage could be much larger than that. As the Chinese economy slows down further \u2014 and very likely itself contracts\u2014 in the coming few months, the lack of Chinese supplies of critical parts and ingredients will cause continuing damage to world production and trade. That damage is spreading to Germany, which even as it struggles remains Europe\u2019s strongest economy and an important market for Italian manufacturers. In Italy, the virus has forced not just the lockdown of the country\u2019s most vibrant regions \u2014 Lombardy and its fashion and finance hub in Milan, as well as large parts of Veneto and Emilia-Romagna regions \u2014 but now the entire country as of Tuesday. As people stay home and demand for services falls, the economically vulnerable \u2014 especially young Italians on precarious temporary jobs \u2014 will lose incomes, and demand will shrink further. And with one of the oldest populations in the world (about 23% of the people are above the age of 65), the coronavirus-induced illness and mortality \u2014 and the associated economic and financial stress \u2014 could persist longer than elsewhere. Traffic levels in Milan - a proxy for economic activity - has slumped in recent days as the coronavirus lockdown is imposed: Here\u2019s a clip of Donald Trump speaking at the White House earlier, promising (vague) help for cruise operators and airlines. The CBI have compiled a handy list of questions and answers for UK businesses, to help them understand how the coronavirus affects operations. It covers issues including whether to hold or attend conferences, travel advice, and how to help employees who are sick or need to self-isolate. Online here. Newsflash: European stock markets have closed in the red, as it fails to recover from Monday\u2019s huge losses. The Stoxx 600 index has provisionally ended the day down almost 1%, having been over 3% higher in early trading. In London, the FTSE 100 subsided.... ending the day 5 points lower -- on top of the 496-point plunge yesterday. It was propped up by the pound, which has weakened by 2 cents against the US dollar (boosting exporters and multinationals). Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB ended the day down 3%, as economists feared its economy will shrink sharply this year, while Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1%. That shows that the panic which triggered yesterday\u2019s crash has not abated. Instead, stocks have been highly volatile today -- as hopes of government stimulus packages have crashed against fears of a global downturn. The coronavirus has reached the World Trade Organization. The Geneva-based organisation has confirmed that a staff member has been infected with Covid-19. \u201cAll necessary precautions\u201d are being taken. If the WTO follows precedent, its headquarters could soon be closed for cleaning and staff could be self-isolated. The COVID-19 outbreak has forced the Royal Economic Society to cancel its Annual Conference. It was due to be held at Queen\u2019s University, Belfast from 6-8 April 2020, but has now been axed. There is compensation for Belfast - they\u2019ll get the 2021 annual conference instead (it is usually held at a different university each year). News of Trump and Pence\u2019s meeting with healthcare CEOs has dragged the US stock market back into positive territory. But the S&amp;P 500 is only slightly higher, having earlier surged by 3.5%. Newsflash: president Donald Trump is holding a meeting with healthcare bosses in the White House now. Vice-president Pence is telling Trump that all the insurance companies at their meeting today have agreed they will not charge customers for Coronavirus testing, by waiving the \u2018copays\u2019 which would normally be levied. Some states had already been insisting on free testing for Covid-19, but this announcement appears to make it a national policy. The bosses have also agreed to extend medical coverage to include coronavirus, Pence says, and to cover telemedicine for patients, such as the elderly, who get health care at home. These measures could encourage US citizens to be tested for the coronavirus, and protect them from medicals bills. Trump also weighed in, saying that the US authorities will help airline companies and cruise operators. They\u2019re two great industries and we\u2019ll be helping them through this patch, and so far I think it\u2019s been going very well\u201d The rally is fizzling out, as global stock markets continue to remain highly volatile. The Dow Jones industrial average has now turned negative on Wall Street, having been up 1,000 points when it opened two hours ago. The S&amp;P 500 index, which was up 3.7% earlier, has now dropped back to last night\u2019s closing levels. Investors may be losing faith in Donald Trump\u2019s stimulus plan, with insiders telling CNBC that it\u2019s not written yet. Democratic politicians are also insisting that any coronavirus stimulus programme provides proper sick pay for workers, to help people to actually self-isolate. They\u2019re not happy about simply pushing through tax cuts which would help the rich, House Democratic Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark told reporters at a news conference that potential aid should include paid sick leave, enhanced unemployment insurance, food security and affordable testing and treatment. So with Wall Street losing its mojo, European markets have that sinking feeling again... With 90 minutes to go, the European stock market rally is fizzling out. Italy\u2019s share index has sunk by 2%, as traders digest the implications of the nationwide lockdown announced yesterday. British Airways and Ryanair have both cancelled all international flights to and from Italy today, which will hurt tourism revenues (although clearly the right thing). London stocks are also fading, being dragged down by cruise operator Carnival (-4%). Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has lost 20% of its value this year. European stocks are down 17%, while Wall Street is roughly 13% lower. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a good time to buy, argues Clark Fenton, Portfolio Manager at investment company RWC Partners. Fenton reckons many stocks are still overpriced, despite the recent rout. \u201cInvestors should not be putting money to work yet in equities. It is too early to start buying simply on the basis that equity indices have sold off from their all-time highs. All that has happened in US equity markets, for example, is that they have gone from extremely overvalued to very overvalued, and that\u2019s before taking into account the ultimate effect of the COVID-19\u2019s impact on earnings. That doesn\u2019t scream buy to us. \u201cIn our fund equity exposure is therefore flat. We have, however, taken profits on positions that benefit from spikes in volatility, which served the fund well in February.\u201d Ouch! Deutsche Bank\u2019s chief German economist has predicted that Europe\u2019s largest economy will contract this year, due to the coronavirus. Stefan Schneider told Reuters that German economy will probably shrink 0.2% in January-March, and a hefty 0.8% in March-June. That would push it into recession. Newsflash: The European Union is getting ready to relax the rules which force airlines to keep flying routes, even if planes are empty, or lose their landing rights. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has announced that these \u2018airport slot\u2019 regulations should be temporarily stopped. At present, they mean airlines must operate 80% of scheduled services. But the slump in demand for flights to China and Italy, for example, make them an added burden on the industry. Von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels that airlines, and the environment, would both benefit. It will relieve the pressure on aviation industry and in particular on smaller airline companies\u201d Back in the UK, some major media groups are practicing for the coronavirus by getting thousands of staff to work remotely later this week. Mediacom, which is part of WPP, and Sky, will both test whether they can cope if staff are quarantined at home: Take note, business leaders. United Airlines has revealed that its CEO and president will forgo their bases salaries through until the end of June, as fears over the coronavirus hits demand. The airline has already announced dramatic cuts to its schedules within the US, and internationally, -- and its top brass are going to share the pain. A precedent for others?..... Newsflash: President Trump has launched a new assault on the US central bank, labelling it \u201cpathetic\u201d for not cutting interest rates more deeply. In another example of Trump\u2019s distain for central bank independence, he is pushing the Federal Reserve to get US interest rates down towards 0%. Last week, the Fed announced an emergency rate cut which lowered its Funds rate to 1%-1.25% (and promptly triggered a market sell-off). In contrast, the UK\u2019s interest rates are 0.75%, and the eurozone is 0% (or Minus 0.5% for bank deposits at the ECB). The Fed\u2019s policymakers meet next week - and are likely to cut again. Indeed, the markets are now pricing in US interest rates close to zero soon. Shares in some of America\u2019s biggest companies are rallying today, but they\u2019re still sharply lower than on Friday night: Wall Street won\u2019t let the bull market die! Especially not on its 11th birthday. Every stock on the Dow Jones industrial average is rallying this morning, as stocks bounce back. Energy companies, banks and travel firms, who led yesterday\u2019s slump, are among the top risers this morning. Goldman Sachs are up 5.4%, followed by oil producers Chevron (+5.2%) and Exxon (+4.3%). Last night\u2019s selloff left the S&amp;P 500 index down 19% from its recent peak - close to entering a Bear Market...but not quite. The current bull market started right back on 10 March 2009, when the sell-off triggered by the financial crisis finally ended. But it would only take one more selloff to end it. NEWSFLASH: Shares are surging on Wall Street, as investors return to duty after the worst one-day slump since the dark, troubling days of 2008. Stocks are jumping, pushing the main US indices up by around 3%. The Dow has risen by over 800 points. That would normally be a very big move, but it doesn\u2019t even recover half of Monday\u2019s rout. But still, president Trump\u2019s promise of a stimulus programme is helping traders to regain their poise, and calming some of the fears of a global recession (even though White House insiders say the plan isn\u2019t written yet....) Here we go again! Oh dear. White House insiders have been pouring some cold water on Donald Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201cmajor\u201d economic relief package to protect the US economy from the coronavirus. Unnamed administration officials have told CNBC that the White House is not ready to roll out specific economic proposals, such as the payroll tax cut floated by the president. One was stunned by Trump\u2019s claim Monday that he would hold a press conference Tuesday to announce an economic plan. \u201cThat was news to everyone on the inside. \u201cIt\u2019s not there right now....A lot of details need to be worked out.\u201d This is pulling Wall Street futures down from their earlier highs, but we\u2019re still expecting stocks to bounce back strongly from Monday. Wall Street bank JPMorgan thinks the markets got carried away yesterday. JPMorgan\u2019s chief U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas has calculated that Monday\u2019s slump implies a 65% to 75% chance of recession in the next 12 months. But that\u2019s too pessimistic, he writes: \u201cIn our view, however, the market has gone ahead and priced in too severe of an adverse scenario, assuming we get timely and strong counter-policy response and a COVID-19 outbreak that peaks in the coming weeks.\u201d But those assumptions may not transpire, of course.... Not so fast, Wall Street! Economic professor Nouriel Roubini isn\u2019t convinced that Donald Trump will push a tax cut through Congress, as he proposed last night. Instead, \u201cDr Doom\u201d fears any US coronavirus stimulus package could become bogged down by partisan fighting on Capitol Hill. Yesterday\u2019s rout was the busiest day ever for investment platform AJ Bell. And interestingly, many customers were bargain-hunting -- snapping up stocks which were suddenly much cheaper. The most popular stocks were oil giant BP and Shell, who led the tumble - and are leading today\u2019s recovery. Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at AJ Bell, explains: BP saw its share price fall almost 20% yesterday, while Shell saw an 18% fall following the collapse in the oil price. While the dividends of both of these stocks may be put under pressure following the oil price fall, at current valuations the dividend yield looks very attractive for income-seeking investors. Airlines easyJet and International Airlines Group (British Airways parent company) were both in demand too, having fallen by a quarter in recent weeks. Suter adds: \u201cUK finance firms were also top of the buy list for investors, including banking giants Lloyds and Barclays, and insurance groups Aviva and Legal &amp; General. All the companies saw a 10% fall on markets yesterday, adding to already significant falls over the past few weeks. With the FTSE 100 up 3.5% today, those who took a punt yesterday should be sitting on profits today. But City economists and fund managers are spending a lot of time analysing the latest statistics for Covid-19\u2019s spread across the globe. History professor Adam Tooze points out that China\u2019s infections are dropping, following the extreme measures imposed by Beijing. That may explain why Italy is now quarantining its entire population. Charlie Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, has also been tracking this data closely, and points out that school closures have helped curb Covid-19. Robertson reckons the UK is roughly two weeks behind Italy, based on the current infection rates..... The S&amp;P 500 futures contract has now hit its limit, for the second day running. But this time, the contract is too high! It\u2019s not permitted to jump (or fall) by over 5%, you see. It suggests Wall Street is going to rebound strongly from Monday\u2019s shocker. Royal Bank of Scotland is offering to defer mortgage and loan repayments for three months, for customers affected by the Covid-19 outbreak. The bank is also making it easier for customers to access cash without penalty, to help prevent cash flow problems (as is reportedly happening in Italy too). An RBS spokesperson explains: \u201cWe are monitoring the potential impact of Coronavirus across all our customers to ensure we can support them appropriately through any period of disruption. We have a strong track record in working with our customers who are affected by disruption outside of their control. RBS says it is supporting personal customers in five ways: Mortgage and loan repayment deferral for up to three months Customers can close fixed savings accounts to access cash with no early closure charge Refunds on credit card cash advance fees Customers can apply for increased temporary credit card limit Customers can request an increased cash withdrawal limit of up to \u00a3500 RBS has also \u201cproactively\u201d contacted 5,000 business customers to offer support, it adds. UK banks are taking steps to support British businesses through the economic shock of coronavirus. Lloyds Banking Group has pledged to offer \u00a32bn of new funding for small firms, which won\u2019t come with any arrangement fee, to help their cashflows cope with Covid-19. This will mean: No arrangement fees for new overdrafts or overdraft limit increases, for small companies No arrangement fees for new or increased invoice discounting and finance facilities In certain circumstances, repayment holidays to be provided, to those businesses impacted the most These measure should help fundamentally healthy firms cope with a short-term hit, if the UK imposes significant quarantine measures in the weeks and months ahead. David Oldfield, group director for commercial banking at Lloyds Banking Group said: \u201cWe fully understand how worrying these times are for business owners, concerned not only about their and their own family\u2019s health and wellbeing, but also of their employees. They are also worried what the outbreak might mean for their business and with no knowledge of how or when they might be affected. As our customers face into such uncertainty, we want to provide reassurance to them that, if needed, we are here to help with additional working capital to get them through temporary interruptions to their business and to their cashflow.\u201d Standard Life, one of the UK\u2019s biggest investment companies, has suspended all international travel as it tries to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The Edinburgh-based fund manager has also split its investment and functions staff into red and blue teams in Asia Pacific, with some working from home and others working in the office \u2013 and they have their temperature checked twice a day. The firm is rolling this out in the UK and the US in the coming weeks. Standard Life boss Keith Skeoch revealed this as he warned of more market turbulence this year. He said yesterday\u2019s heavy sell-off was driven by \u201cpure panic\u201d. He noted that markets have priced in a global recession, but said how western countries deal with the virus outbreak will be crucial. If they are \u201cas good as China\u201d in containing the epidemic, we could get a short, sharp downturn followed by an economic recovery in six months\u2019 time. Just in: Iraq has followed Saudi\u2019s lead, by cutting oil prices. After falling into a bear market yesterday, today\u2019s rally might drag European stocks out again. Wall Street is set to rebound today, partly thanks to Donald Trump\u2019s promise of tax cuts to support the US economy through the coronavirus crisis. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are UP 4% in pre-market trading, after both sliding almost 8% yesterday. This is driving European markets higher now, with France\u2019s CAC, Germany\u2019s DAX and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB now up 3%. But tax cuts won\u2019t fix a healthcare crisis, as analyst Ricardo Evangelista of ActivTrades points out: The dollar bounced back against other major currencies following political statements from the White House that showed a willingness to act, through concerted economic policies, to mitigate the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. The focus of the markets is very unlikely to divert from the virus\u2019 impact on the public health and economic prospects of several countries, including of course Italy, but also, and crucially, the United States, where some suspect the numbers of infected may be much higher than the figures published so far indicate. Some of yesterday\u2019s anxiety was driven by the fear of seeing the US finding itself in a situation similar to that already witnessed in China and Italy. The next few days will determine if today\u2019s rebound in the market is to continue, or if it is not more than the proverbial \u2018dead cat bounce\u2019. Saudi Aramco, the Kingdom\u2019s oil giant, has confirmed that it is flooding the markets with crude. From April 1, Aramco will offer customers 12.3m barrels of oil per day, up from 10m bpd previously, it says. This is confirmation that Saudi Arabia is launching a price war against rivals, after Russia refused to back Opec\u2019s proposed output cuts last week. That move was a major cause of Monday\u2019s rout. That\u2019s 300,000 barrels per day MORE than Aramco\u2019s \u2018maximum sustained capacity\u2019 -- implying that Saudi authorities plan to reduce their own oil reserves, to fuel the price war (having already driven the price down 20% yesterday). It\u2019s a blow to the new wave of US shale oil producers. Their shares plunged yesterday, some by almost 50%, on fears that the industry won\u2019t cope with oil below $40 per barrel. Energy analyst Gregory Bree explains: Britain\u2019s index of mid-sized companies, the FTSE 250, has jumped by 3% this morning - recovering half of Monday\u2019s slump. The technology, telecoms, industrial, consumer cyclical and healthcare sectors are leading the rally. Reuters is reporting that mortgage payments are be suspended across Italy, as part of Rome\u2019s measures to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. That would help families cope with the economic cost of the quarantine measures being imposed, which will hurt some sectors such as retail and tourism. Here\u2019s the story: Payments on mortgages will be suspended across the whole of Italy after the coronavirus outbreak, Italy\u2019s deputy economy minister said on Tuesday. \u201cYes, that will be the case, for individuals and households,\u201d Laura Castelli said in an interview with Radio Anch\u2019io, when asked about the possibility. Italy\u2019s banking lobby ABI said on Monday lenders representing 90% of total banking assets would offer debt moratoriums to small firms and households grappling with the economic fallout from Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Here\u2019s some instant reaction: Nearly every stock on the FTSE 100 is up this morning. Quite a contrast with Monday, when virtually everything was down. The coronavirus crisis is forcing more and more conferences to be postponed, my colleague Mark Sweney reports, on top of Informa\u2019s warning this morning. The UK FTSE 100 is pushing higher, as the recovery in London gathers pace. The Footsie is now up 121 points or 2% (which recovers roughly a quarter of yesterday\u2019s losses). It\u2019s being led by miners and oil companies, following the recovery in the crude price this morning. But European markets are lagging behind, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB only 0.6% higher today. It crashed by 11% yesterday. It\u2019s not unusual to see the markets rise after a day of heavy falls -- and it doesn\u2019t mean the crisis is over. As Kit Juckes of Societe Generale puts it: The expression \u2018dead cat bounce\u2019 was invented for mornings like this. Neil Wilson of Markets.com agrees: European stock markets looked to recover some ground early on Tuesday on hopes of a round of stimulus measures as the market tried to rally the troops after the rout of Black Monday. Investors are licking wounds and there is a stabilisation of the rout, but this looks like a short-term bounce on oversold levels, not a meaningful turn. It smells like a dead cat. The stimulus is coming, but the situation on the ground gets worse. It seems comments from Donald Trump, and overnight some emollient tones from the Japanese authorities, are helping. Japan is expected to announce a second stimulus package to combat the coronavirus later today. The wild losses of Crash Monday dominate today\u2019s UK newspaper front pages: Informa, the world\u2019s largest exhibition company, has postponed or cancelled almost 130 events worth \u00a3450m in revenue due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company, which has already suffered a \u00a31bn drop in its market value since the start of the year as a result of share price falls, said that its events arm accounts for about 65% of \u00a32.9bn in total group revenues. Stephen Carter, chief executive of the FTSE 100 company, says: \u201cWe are facing a 2020 impact from COVID-19 in our events-related businesses and so we have used our strong customer and supplier relationships to swiftly deploy a material postponement programme shifting our events calendar to later dates in 2020,\u201d This morning\u2019s rally has lifted Brent crude by over 5% this morning, to $36.29 per barrel. That suggests markets are coming to terms with Saudi Arabia\u2019s threat to flood the market with cheap oil, but still close to yesterday\u2019s four-year low: Newsflash: Stocks are rising in Europe at the start of trading, as investors try to put Monday\u2019s rout behind them. In London, the FTSE 100 has gained 73 points, or 1.2% -- a small improvement on Monday\u2019s 7.7% slump. Mining companies such as Rio Tinto (+4.5%) and Anglo American (+3%) are among the risers,. Oil giants BP (+3.5%) and Shell (+4%) are also gaining, after losing almost 20% each yesterday. They\u2019re benefitting from a recovery in the oil price today - up 5% (after tumbling over 20% yesterday). The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index is up 1%, with Germany gaining 0.9% and France up 1.3%. Asia-Pacific stocks have clawed back some of Monday\u2019s huge losses, amid hopes that China\u2019s coronavirus crisis may be easing Australia\u2019s S&amp;P 500 has jumped by over 3% today, having slumped by 7% yesterday. Japan\u2019s Nikkei, which fell 5% yesterday, has gained 0.85%. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite index recovered more than half of Monday\u2019s 3% slide, with a 1.8% bounce Traders were cheered to see China\u2019s president Xi Jinping visiting Wuhan today, meeting frontline medical workers, military, community staff, local party officials and residents. That could be a sign that Beijing thinks it\u2019s winning the battle. Faced with Wall Street\u2019s worst day in a decade, Donald Tump tried to assure Americans last night that he would tackle the economic impact of coronavirus. He told reporters that: His administration would ask Congress to pass payroll tax relief and other quick measures. He would seek help for hourly-wage workers to ensure they\u2019re \u201cnot going to miss a paycheck\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t get penalized for something that\u2019s not their fault\u201d. Trump continued to argue that Covid-19 had caught everyone on the hop (even though the first US case was reported back on 25 January). This blindsided the world, and I think we\u2019ve handled it very, very well, they\u2019ve done a great job. But Trump refused to respond to questions about whether he\u2019d been tested himself. That\u2019s not an idle question. Several members of his political circle are currently self-quarantining after they came into contact with a man later diagnosed with the disease, CNN reports. It\u2019s not escaped anyone\u2019s notice that Trump, along with Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, are all in the 70+ age bracket susceptible to the virus. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After their worst day since the financial crisis, European and US stock markets are expected to rebound from Crash Monday today. Investors are catching their breath, counting their losses, and hoping that governments will step up and protect their economies from the coronavirus threat. Last night, president Trump signalled that he\u2019s considering providing tax relief to companies who are struggling with the impact of Covid-19. Trump, who\u2019s under fire for downplaying the virus, said he was planning \u201ca timely and effective response to the coronavirus.\u201d He told reporters: \u201cWe are to be meeting with House Republicans, [Senate majority leader] Mitch McConnell, and discussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, very substantial relief.\u201d Any sign that Trump is taking Covid-19 more seriously is welcome, given criticism that US authorities were slow to test citizens and quarantine them. But a tax cut will not protect people from the virus, or stop it spreading. And it will not encourage consumer spending if people are too scared to visit the shops -- or are quarantined anyway. Other governments are devising stimulus measures too. Yesterday, Ireland announced a \u20ac3bn package that will include more health spending and early sick pay for all workers. But after Monday\u2019s losses, investors are deeply concerned that coronavirus will become a pandemic - inflicting significant economic harm (as well as many more deaths and illnesses around the globe). Yesterday\u2019s rout ended with the FTSE 100 at a four-year low, down almost 7.7% at 5965 -- wiping out \u00a3125bn off leading stocks. Wall Street had a shocker too, with the Dow ending down 2,000 points or over 7%. We\u2019ve not seen such wipeouts since the aftermath of Lehman Brothers collapse. The markets are also still coming to terms with the oil price war triggered by Saudi Arabia over the weekend, which wiped nearly a fifth of BP and Royal Dutch Shell last night. We\u2019ll be tracking all the action through the day.... The agenda 10am GMT: Eurozone fourth-quarter GDP",

front of a baying, wildly entertained audience at the San Siro in Milan. Those were different times, more innocent times. There will be no fans tonight, but there will probably be goals: it\u2019s more than a month since either side last kept a clean sheet, and in their most recent league game Atalanta thrashed Lecce 7-2. That was 10 days ago, the only match they have played since winning the first leg of this one 4-1 on 19 February. There may be a little ring-rustiness, but there should at least be no sign of fatigue. \u201cWe need to score, as well as stay focused and defend well,\u201d said Gian Piero Gasperini. \u201cA psychological aspect of our game that we are working on is ... we seem to get comfortable and assume the job is done when it really is not. The team were great in the first leg, but I will not celebrate until the second leg is over.\u201d<br></p> <p>The Valencia coach, Albert Celades, insisted that \u201cthe result from the first leg isn\u2019t a fair reflection of what happened in the game\u201d, which is true: Maxi G\u00f3mez displayed the finishing skills of a kitten as he spurned a number of fine chances in that one. He won\u2019t be spurning any chances tonight, though, as he\u2019s kept out by a broken foot. Still, where there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need a miracle to progress, not at all,\u201d surmised Albert Celades. I think I speak for all who saw the first game when I say: more of the same, please.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d98657c619699ed1016417aa85ab200aca6a5e4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d98657c619699ed1016417aa85ab200aca6a5e4e/0_0_3429_2286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The only fan in the stadium tonight is the statue representing a former fan, honoured by his club after he passed away two years ago by putting a statue of him in his seat.

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s all from me. Josip Ilicic hadn\u2019t scored a Champions League goal in his entire career until he came up against Valencia, and then he got five in two games. His left foot was the star of a game in which seven goals were scored and which ended with Atalanta storming into the last eight. Atalanta\u2019s players had a message for their club\u2019s Coronavirus-hit hometown after tonight\u2019s game: This is Reuters\u2019 on-the-whistle summary: Atalanta\u2019s Josip Ilicic scored four goals in a stunning individual display to lead them to a 4-3 Champions League last-16, second-leg win over Valencia, that completed an 8-4 aggregate victory, at an empty Mestalla on Tuesday. The Spanish side\u2019s stadium was shut to supporters as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, with the visitors coming from a high-risk zone in the north of Italy. Valencia defender Mouctar Diakhaby conceded two penalties in the first half, both converted by Ilicic, either side of Kevin Gameiro\u2019s equaliser. Gameiro headed home a second and Ferran Torres put Valencia ahead on the night but Slovenian playmaker Ilicic completed his hat-trick and then curled in a sumptuous fourth as his team reached the quarter-finals. Here\u2019s a report on tonight\u2019s other Champions League game, in which last season\u2019s beaten finalists were knocked out of the competition by RB Leipzig: 90+3 mins: It\u2019s all over! Atalanta march into the quarter-finals! 90+2 mins: A last-minute chance fro Gameiro to complete his hat-trick, but Sportiello denies him! Torres pokes the ball through, but the keeper is out quickly and Gameiro blasts his shot straight into him! 90+1 mins: Into stoppage time we roll. There\u2019ll be two minutes of it. Zapata gets it started by thumping a volley over from 15 yards. Wrong body shape/approach angle combo there. 88 mins: Atalanta spend a couple of minutes attacking gamely but inaccurately, having crosses cleared and passes intercepted, before they eventually kick the ball out of play. \u201cSurely the answer to empty stadiums is to have holograms of the fans chanting all around the stadium,\u201d suggests Justin Kavanagh. \u201cThe opposite of Vegas, where crowds pay good money to see performers like Elvis and Roy Orbison. It would certainly make the Emirates a livelier place.\u201d 87 mins: No players has ever scored four goals in an away match in the Champions League knockout rounds, until Josip Ilicic tonight. 86 mins: Remo Freuler blocks Soler\u2019s infield run from the left and gets a booking. 84 mins: Cheryshev just about gets back in time to get a toe on the ball and stop Zapata scoring the night\u2019s eighth, and the tie\u2019s 13th, goal. 83 mins: Atalanta make their final change, and it\u2019s Pasalic making way for Adrien Tameze. Another! Fine work from Freuler and Zapata in the build-up and the ball eventually rolls to Ilicic on the right of the area, who thumps it into the top left corner! 81 mins: Both teams are pushing forward now. There are more goals in this yet. 80 mins: Gameiro passes infield to Gaya, who had an excellent chance to shoot first-time from the edge of the area but instead tries to dribble past a couple of defenders, fails, and then has a shot while falling over that bobbles wide. 79 mins: Then Valencia bring on Alessandro Florenzi in place of Rodrigo. 78 mins: Atalanta take off Papu Gomes and bring on Ruslan Malinovskyi. 75 mins: It sounds like the fans outside the stadium have all gone home now. 74 mins: A bit of a delay, while Gosens gets a bit of treatment from the physios and Denis Cheryshev replaces Coquelin in the Valencia team. 73 mins: It\u2019s now 7-4 on aggregate. With no fans to celebrate with, Ilicic turns after scoring and makes a substitution-request signal at the bench. Atalanta break, and it\u2019s four against four as they move it to Zapata on the right. He passes infield to Ilicic, who cuts into the area and lashes a low shot into the bottom right corner! 71 mins: Atalanta aren\u2019t quite fully committed either in attack or defence at present, and are a bit too open at the back. Still, they\u2019ve got a decent cushion to protect them. 70 mins: Save! Hateboer picks out Zapata on the right of the area. There\u2019s nobody for him to square to, so he lashes a low shot from an unpromising angle with such accuracy and ferocity that it takes an excellent save with his legs for Cillessen to keep it out. A simple ball down the middle found Ferr\u00e1n Torres bursting forward, and Sportiello\u2019s rush to the edge of his area left him with the simple task of lifting a bouncing ball over the exposed goalkeeper and into the empty net! 67 mins: Ilicic prods through to Hateboer, who cuts in from the right, turns down an invitation to go down as Guedes lays a hand on his shoulder, and then runs out of room. 64 mins: Gomez is taken out on the left wing but the ball rolls on to Ilicic, but his cross finds Kondogbia rather than Zapata. When the ball goes out of play, Wass is booked for the foul on Gomez. He would miss the quarter-final if Valencia somehow have to play one. 60 mins: Zapata tees up Ilicic, whose thunderous left-footed drive hits Pasalic, his own teammate, when apparently top-corner-bound. 59 mins: At the other end Kondogbia, now playing at centre-back since Diakhaby\u2019s substitution, brings down Ilicic and is booked, a bit harshly. 57 mins: Now Guedes volleys over the bar from 20 yards. If Valencia could score one more goal then they would only need another goal to be in with a shout of scoring the goal that would leave them needing just one more goal. 55 mins: Half a chance! Soler passes to Gameiro, inside the area but to the left of goal, and he spins and spears a shot wide! There were a lot of white shirts in the penalty area, and probably better options available. That is his first attempt of the evening that hasn\u2019t gone in. 53 mins: Valencia are straight back on the front foot. They win a corner, and then another corner, which Sportiello makes an ill-advised attempt to claim. He just about gets his fingers to it and pokes it limply away, but gets away with it. Parejo\u2019s shot deflects to Ferr\u00e1n Torres on the right, and Gameiro meets his cross with a powerful header past Sportiello! 50 mins: Freuler hits the bar! It\u2019s a lovely shot from the right-hand corner of the area that zings over Cillessen, but doesn\u2019t quite dip enough to go in! 49 mins: Rodrigo crosses from the left, and Ferr\u00e1n Torres rises highest in the middle, but Sportiello makes the save. 46 mins: Peeeeeep! They\u2019re back under way, and Diakhaby has made way for Guedes. Not the finest night of his career, I\u2019d wager. The players are back out. Goncalo Guedes is going to come on for Valencia. More footage from outside the ground. It\u2019s bizarre to think that this is happening because of a bat/pangolin/whatever in a market thousands of miles away a few months ago. If this kind of display is mirrored at other games and grounds, I can\u2019t see the season concluding at all. 45+4 mins: The free-kick hits the raised arms of Valencia\u2019s one-man wall, and the second free-kick is pushed to safety by Cillessen. As the ball rolls out of play, the referee blows his whistle. 45+3 mins: Coquelin concedes a free-kick on the left, and Atalanta might be able to squeeze another chance into the half. 45+2 mins: This is the best video I can find from outside the stadium, where Valencia\u2019s fans continue to make a racket. You\u2019ll have to tilt your head a bit to watch it, but it gives you an idea of what they\u2019re up to. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time. There\u2019ll be three minutes of it, or similar. 45 mins: De Roon has gone off, and Duvan Zapata has come on. Atalanta don\u2019t seem minded to defend this lead. This time Ilicic smacks it low to his right, and the keeper goes the wrong way! Atalanta lead 6-2 on aggregate! 43 mins: The ball was bouncing into the area, and Ilicic trying to run onto it, when Diakhaby appeared to lean his arm into the ball. It looked to me like he expected Ilicic to touch it and was caught out when it ran straight on, but that was a clear handball. 42 mins: The referee goes to look at the replay screens, and swiftly concludes that it was indeed a handball. As he runs back towards the penalty area he brandishes a yellow card at Diakhaby. 41 mins: VAR are checking for a potential handball in Valencia\u2019s penalty area. It looks to me like Diakhaby might have conceded a second penalty here. 40 mins: Now De Roon is leaving the field, though he appears only in mild discomfort. 37 mins: De Roon gets a bit of Rodrigo\u2019s hand in his face, goes down, and the physios come on to kiss it better. 35 mins: This is a reasonable game, despite the lack of fans and Atalanta\u2019s dominant position. A second Valencia goal might really turbocharge it. Rodrigo tries to supply one, but his shot deflects wide. 32 mins: Coquelin is booked for clearing the ball when it was next to Pasalic\u2019s head and then somehow ending up with his foot resting on his opponent\u2019s shoulder. 27 mins: Pasalic passes to Gomez, just outside the penalty area towards the left corner, who tries to chip Cillessen. It was an outlandish effort, but Cillessen was too close to his line, and it anyway went well over the bar. 25 mins: And another chance from the corner, as Pasalic wins the header but sends the ball bouncing across goal and out of play. 24 mins: Nearly a chance for Atalanta! Gosens bursts down the left and sends in an excellent cross, but Hateboer can\u2019t quite reach it in the middle! The ball is played into the area towards Gameiro. His marker, Palomino, slides to intercept and pushes it away a bit but Gameiro reacts fastest, reaches the loose ball and turns it past Sportiello, who had neither committed to claiming it nor decided to stay on his line. 20 mins: The home side win a corner, but Hateboer heads it clear and when the ball is sent back into the box not only does Sportiello win it and punch it away, but Kondogbia is offside. 17 mins: Here are some Valencia fans, from a little earlier. They have only increased in number since then. This seems totally self-defeating, in that it\u2019s stuff like this that will convince the authorities not just to play games in empty stadiums, but not to play them at all: 12 mins: There\u2019s some crowd noise in the stadium, which is presumably being played through loudspeakers. There are lots of fans outside the ground, but they would have to be very noisy for it to be this clear on the inside. 9 mins: Shot! Soler hits a pretty good effort from 40 yards or so, which Sportiello pushes away. 6 mins: Valencia would presumably have discussed the importance of scoring the first goal and keeping a clean sheet. Two minutes, that lasted. They mount an attack and win a corner, but nothing comes of it. The VAR check complete, Ilicic thumps his penalty low and hard, straight down the middle, and it\u2019s 1-5 on aggregate! 3 mins: VAR is checking a possible offside in the build-up to the penalty. 2 mins: Less than 100 seconds on the clock and Ilicic runs from the right into the area, gets to the byline, cuts back, is clipped by Mouctar Diakhaby, and Atalanta can kill the game here (surely). 1 min: Peeeeeeep! Atalanta get the game started, and immediately hoist the ball into touch on the right wing. No handshakes, mind. So there\u2019s nothing now standing between us and football, except a referee\u2019s whistle. And out they come! Anthems, kids waving a giant Champions League football logo thing in the centre circle, and not a fan to be seen. Looks like they have turned on the big screens, though. For the ball boys, presumably. The players are in the tunnel, and a very handsome tunnel it is too at the Mestalla. There might not be any fans inside the ground, but it looks like there are a few outside it: It may help you to know that Uefa reckon Valencia will line up like this: While they think Atalanta will play something like this: Tonight\u2019s teams have been announced, and here they are: Valencia: Cillessen, Wass, Coquelin, Diakhaby, Gaya, Torres, Parejo, Kondogbia, Carlos Soler, Gameiro, Rodrigo. Subs: Domenech Jaume, Goncalo Guedes, Cheryshev, Lee, Sobrino, Florenzi, Guillamon. Atalanta: Sportiello, Djimsiti, Caldara, Palomino, Hateboer, de Roon, Freuler, Gosens, Pasalic, Ilicic, Gomez. Subs: Tameze, Czyborra, Muriel, Malinovsky, Castagne, Rossi, Zapata. Referee: Ovidiu Alin Hategan (Romania). I had the great pleasure of watching the first leg of this game, played in front of a baying, wildly entertained audience at the San Siro in Milan. Those were different times, more innocent times. There will be no fans tonight, but there will probably be goals: it\u2019s more than a month since either side last kept a clean sheet, and in their most recent league game Atalanta thrashed Lecce 7-2. That was 10 days ago, the only match they have played since winning the first leg of this one 4-1 on 19 February. There may be a little ring-rustiness, but there should at least be no sign of fatigue. \u201cWe need to score, as well as stay focused and defend well,\u201d said Gian Piero Gasperini. \u201cA psychological aspect of our game that we are working on is ... we seem to get comfortable and assume the job is done when it really is not. The team were great in the first leg, but I will not celebrate until the second leg is over.\u201d The Valencia coach, Albert Celades, insisted that \u201cthe result from the first leg isn\u2019t a fair reflection of what happened in the game\u201d, which is true: Maxi G\u00f3mez displayed the finishing skills of a kitten as he spurned a number of fine chances in that one. He won\u2019t be spurning any chances tonight, though, as he\u2019s kept out by a broken foot. Still, where there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope: \u201cI don\u2019t think we need a miracle to progress, not at all,\u201d surmised Albert Celades. I think I speak for all who saw the first game when I say: more of the same, please.",

The government\u2019s infrastructure strategy \u2013 a formal document setting out the plans in detail \u2013 is not expected to be published for several weeks.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of passengers aboard a cruise ship struck by the coronavirus waited anxiously on Tuesday for their turn to leave the vessel moored in the San Francisco Bay Area, even if it meant being shipped to military bases for weeks of quarantine. After days of idling off the northern California coast because of evidence that it was the breeding ground for new coronavirus infections, the Grand Princess docked on Monday at the port of Oakland with about 3,500 passengers and crew onboard, including 21 who had tested positive for the virus. About two dozen people who needed acute medical care were taken off the ship first on Monday, although it was not clear how many had tested positive for the virus, said Brian Ferguson, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. Many of the nearly 240 Canadians onboard left the ship after the critically ill departed and stood outside two tents displaying Canadian flags. Canada and Britain were among the countries sending chartered flights to retrieve their citizens. The ship carried people from 54 countries, and foreigners were to be flown home. About 150 Californians who left the ship were sent to Travis air force base, where they will be quarantined. Passengers left onboard on Monday night were eager to depart in the coming days. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to stay calm and we\u2019re trying to stay positive but it\u2019s getting harder and harder. They can\u2019t make up their minds how to keep us safe,\u201d said passenger Beryl Ward, 77, of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Ward\u2019s cabin mate, Carolyn Wright, 63, also of Santa Fe, said she looked out her cabin window as passengers lined up to depart and also saw people in yellow protective clothing, gloves and hazardous materials suits. Video images shot on Monday showed long lines of people forming near processing tents and ambulances waiting to take some passengers away. \u201cThey were queueing up the passengers like cattle,\u201d Wright said. \u201cEverybody was bunched up. They were physically touching each other and they were backed up along the gangplank.\u201d Some were taken away in chartered buses, Wright said. Before the ship arrived, four large private passenger buses were parked at the terminal, where workers in reflective jackets gathered. Departures resumed on Tuesday morning and an additional 270 passengers had left the ship by Tuesday afternoon, many of them who traveled on to Travis and Joint Base San Antonio Lackland in Texas to complete the mandatory quarantine. Passengers wearing masks trickling out of the Grand Princess on Tuesday morning and walked to the bottom of a ramp, where masked officials in yellow protective gear and blue plastic gloves took their temperature and led them to a tent for more screening before they lined up to board a bus. The Grand Princess had been held off the coast since Wednesday, after several coronavirus cases were discovered on the ship. Passengers had been isolated in their cabins for days.

About 1,100 crew members, 19 of whom have tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, which will dock elsewhere after passengers are unloaded. The California governor and Oakland mayor sought to reassure people that none of the cruise ship passengers would be exposed to the public before completing quarantine. Cruise ships have come under scrutiny by those who view them as potential germ factories because they pack thousands of people in close quarters. Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public health failure. A third vessel, the Caribbean Princess, was supposed to dock in Grand Cayman on Monday but the cruise line said it will keep its thousands of passengers and crew from disembarking until crew members are tested for the Covid-19 virus. Around the world, nations have limited the movements of millions of people in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. California officials expect the number of cases in the state to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks. Newsom told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon there are 157 confirmed cases in the state so far. California has thousands of coronavirus test kits, he said, but the state needs more reagents and personnel in order to conduct more tests. In northern California, Santa Clara county this week announced a ban of all large gatherings of at least 1,000 people through March. The announcement came hours after the county\u2019s public health department announced the county\u2019s first coronavirus death, a woman in her 60s. \u201cWe are clearly facing a historic public health challenge,\u201d Sara Cody, the public health officer for Santa Clara county, said on Monday night at a press conference. Newsom said he was working with Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, to pass measures to help California workers affected by the crisis. The virus has infected 600 people in the United States, and at least 26 have died, most in Washington state. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general, said communities will need to start thinking about canceling large gatherings, closing schools and letting more employees work from home, as many companies have done after an outbreak in the Seattle area.",

      "bodyText": "The National Bushfire Recovery Agency can not guarantee the funds set aside by the government to aid in the bushfire restoration will not also be used for the coronavirus response. As Labor raises questions about the access to grants and loans for those impacted by the summer bushfires, and the government acknowledged the need to shake up the bureaucratic process, the fate of the money already set aside for the bushfire recovery, particularly the tourism funds, remains up in the air. After a meeting of state tourism ministers last week ended in no formal guarantees, the $76m set aside to help disaster-stricken regions recover from the tourism hit would be increased to deal with the added impact of Covid-19. The National Bushfire Recovery Agency itself has been unable to confirm the already announced funds won\u2019t be used for broader purposes. \u201cAt this stage that is the intent [to remain bushfire recovery focused only] but with significant tourism affect in bushfire areas it is likely there may be some opportunity to work across both areas of impact,\u201d an agency spokesman told Guardian Australia. \u201cThis would remain a matter for government and at this time it is focused on the fire burn zone and surrounding areas.\u201d The government is already reviewing its suite of measures put in place to deal with the bushfire recovery, after a slow pick-up and complaints of overly bureaucratic processes. In an estimates hearing earlier this month, agency head Andrew Colvin said $380m had been paid out in a variety of different grants and loans, but of the 104 applications for a small business concessional loan, just five had been granted for a total of $400,000. For businesses which may have escaped destruction but lost their customer base because of the fires, the loans are some of the only assistance available. \u201cExperience from other disasters tells us it does take time for communities to begin the process of seeking the advice they need before they go forward with things they need such as loans and grants,\u201d Colvin told an estimates hearing. That same day, under questioning in parliament, Scott Morrison defended the money which had flowed through to communities, but admitted concerns about the progress of the small business grants. \u201cWe are currently in the process of looking to rephrase and revise how those grants are being constructed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will be doing that to ensure that we\u2019re backing those businesses in that [they] can see that they have a future where they are, going out not only over the next three months but over the next 12 months. That\u2019s what we\u2019re applying ourselves to do. \u201cThe New South Wales government will be working in that state to deliver those arrangements. They\u2019ve highlighted some issues, because they\u2019re the ones who are processing these applications. I look forward to us being able to deliver a better program.\u201d A spokesman for the agency said that review was under way and included \u201cdiscussions on broadening eligibility criteria, speed of delivery, tourism stimuli and physical support\u201d.",

There is nobody to blame when it looks in every match like we have a traumatic injury, that ends with months and months. We lost Son, we lost Bergwijn, and I don\u2019t want to speak about the ones we lost so long ago. And that\u2019s the history of this season. This season started with problems, look at the position we were in the table when I arrived. It is non-stop. Look to our bench. It\u2019s very hard. I can\u2019t blame the players.\u201d So are transfers afoot? \u201cThis summer, unless something happens during the Euros, we have Sissoko, Kane, Son, Bergwijn, so that is massive.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6812c38f087df56e4c6109\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T22:27:12.135Z\">10.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mourinho\u2019s take.</strong> \u201cOf course I was very positive yesterday, and that\u2019s the way I have to be all the time ... but we know that in this moment, it is very difficult, Leipzig are a very strong side ... we start the game, we had an opportunity that I thought it was almost an own goal, if you look to us lately, it was Rudiger that scored for us, it was a penalty, it\u2019s hard ... then they come, our first couple of mistakes, they score, and after that it is very difficult ... their physicality is very impressive ... we cannot hurt people, but they can hurt us all the time ... but if I can be critical, some of my players with some mistakes, I keep for us ... they tried to give what they can give, and that\u2019s it ... we made mistakes that we have analysed in previous matches but when you don\u2019t have more to give, you give what you can ... it is more difficult for me to work with players who cannot express their potential than ones who play within their limits and I cannot ask more from them ... so I am with the boys, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68108e8f08c2df6d277115\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T22:12:00.757Z\">10.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jose\u2019s verdict to come.</strong> But in the meantime, Jacob Steinberg\u2019s report from Germany has landed.

We had belief before the game, but this is the Champions League, and if you don\u2019t step up, you\u2019re going to be punished. After last year, it was a great run, so it is disappointing to go out like that. After the first goal went in, it didn\u2019t change much because we knew we had to score two to go through. But we conceded too many chances as a team and were punished. It\u2019s hard to come back when you\u2019re on top and then concede two goals. We had to show maturity and fight, and we didn\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t use [the absence of Kane and Son] as an excuse, we still have quality on the pitch, some good players. But that\u2019s football. We have to apologise to the fans who came out here all this way. We have to fight. We can\u2019t be in the position we\u2019re in in the league. We can\u2019t give up.

They need to snap that run with victory tonight, though their record this season of four wins in 21 away matches in all competitions won\u2019t fill them with too much confidence. Nor will the fact they\u2019ve lost all three of their matches against Bundesliga opposition in this campaign: the first leg of this tie, plus 3-1 and 7-2 defeats to Bayern Munich in the groups.</p> <p><strong>But all is not lost. </strong>In-form Leipzig may have won three and drawn two of their last five games, but they\u2019ve already lost at home in the Champions League this season, to Lyon. The 0-2 scoreline that evening is exactly the one Spurs require to get through. Additionally, while Tottenham\u2019s 2019-20 record against German teams is abysmal, they brushed aside Borussia Dortmund at this stage last season. And it\u2019s impossible to forget their last knockout tie in which they lost the first leg 0-1 at home. Spurs may not have won the competition last season, but they\u2019ll always have Amsterdam.</p> <p><strong>So this is balanced nicely. </strong>In Leipzig\u2019s favour, yes, but Spurs are far from out of it. And while Jose Mourinho has his critics - whisper it, more than one or two, we\u2019ve heard - he knows a thing or two about inspiring Champions League wins that looked almost impossible on paper. Just ask Manchester United (279 European Cup matches, seen off by Porto in 2004) or Barcelona (317, worked over by Inter in 2010). In that respect, Leipzig (13) will hold him no fears. It\u2019s on!</p> <p><strong>Kick off: </strong>8pm GMT, 9pm local in Saxony.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ll leave you to chew over that fine soliloquy. I\u2019m sure plenty of those words will be examined from all angles over the next few hours, days and weeks. Anyway, in lieu of all that, a reminder that Jacob Steinberg was in Germany to witness a sorry end to Tottenham\u2019s Champions League campaign. Here\u2019s his report ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! But of course that\u2019s not it. Does this exit cause Spurs problems going forward, asks BT Sport\u2019s Reshmin Chowdhury. \u201cI think probably it is good. Sometimes difficult moments are ones that can prepare the future in a better way. There is nobody to blame when it looks in every match like we have a traumatic injury, that ends with months and months. We lost Son, we lost Bergwijn, and I don\u2019t want to speak about the ones we lost so long ago. And that\u2019s the history of this season. This season started with problems, look at the position we were in the table when I arrived. It is non-stop. Look to our bench. It\u2019s very hard. I can\u2019t blame the players.\u201d So are transfers afoot? \u201cThis summer, unless something happens during the Euros, we have Sissoko, Kane, Son, Bergwijn, so that is massive.\u201d Mourinho\u2019s take. \u201cOf course I was very positive yesterday, and that\u2019s the way I have to be all the time ... but we know that in this moment, it is very difficult, Leipzig are a very strong side ... we start the game, we had an opportunity that I thought it was almost an own goal, if you look to us lately, it was Rudiger that scored for us, it was a penalty, it\u2019s hard ... then they come, our first couple of mistakes, they score, and after that it is very difficult ... their physicality is very impressive ... we cannot hurt people, but they can hurt us all the time ... but if I can be critical, some of my players with some mistakes, I keep for us ... they tried to give what they can give, and that\u2019s it ... we made mistakes that we have analysed in previous matches but when you don\u2019t have more to give, you give what you can ... it is more difficult for me to work with players who cannot express their potential than ones who play within their limits and I cannot ask more from them ... so I am with the boys, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Jose\u2019s verdict to come. But in the meantime, Jacob Steinberg\u2019s report from Germany has landed. Here it is! A grim-faced Dele Alli bravely faces the music on BT Sport. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating. We had belief before the game, but this is the Champions League, and if you don\u2019t step up, you\u2019re going to be punished. After last year, it was a great run, so it is disappointing to go out like that. After the first goal went in, it didn\u2019t change much because we knew we had to score two to go through. But we conceded too many chances as a team and were punished. It\u2019s hard to come back when you\u2019re on top and then concede two goals. We had to show maturity and fight, and we didn\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t use [the absence of Kane and Son] as an excuse, we still have quality on the pitch, some good players. But that\u2019s football. We have to apologise to the fans who came out here all this way. We have to fight. We can\u2019t be in the position we\u2019re in in the league. We can\u2019t give up. Confidence is obviously gone, but it\u2019s a big game at the weekend and we have to pick ourselves up and turn this around. We have to stay together, it\u2019s not down to one player to score goals and another to stop them. It was the whole team. We know it\u2019s not good enough.\u201d Baby Mourinho 4-0 Mou Classic. To Mourinho\u2019s credit, he goes straight over to Julian Nagelsmann and offers his opposite number warm congratulations. He then defiantly strides down the tunnel, his arm thrown around Lucas Moura. On BT Sport, Gary Lineker suggests that might be some sort of this-is-all-I\u2019ve-got-left signal to Daniel Levy, but let\u2019s not try to read too much into it. Though it is clear that last year\u2019s runners-up need a serious rebuild. If they can\u2019t turn their abysmal form around in short order - and Manchester United visit N17 on Sunday - this could be their last Champions League match for a wee while. Leipzig, by contrast, will take some stopping. For all Tottenham\u2019s faults, they\u2019ve been magnificent in both legs, and fully deserve to make the quarters for the first time in their short history. Leipzig - to the sound of the Beastie Boys - celebrate their advance to the quarter-finals. They\u2019ve fought for their right to party. Fully deserved. They\u2019ve been magnificent. Last year\u2019s losing finalists, by contrast, are knocked out with barely a whimper. 90 min +5: And to think it\u2019s been something of an off night for Timo Werner. Small mercies for Spurs. 90 min +4: Fernandes has a dig from distance. His effort rolls into the arms of Gulacsi. The Leipzig faithful cheer sarcastically, somewhat cruelly given the gap in quality on display tonight. 90 min +3: \u201cGrim as all this is, it will be as nothing as to Mourinho\u2019s performance-art piece of a post match interview where he basically turns the entire history of Tottenham Hotspur into a dirty protest,\u201d predicts Dom, who is currently perched \u201con a window ledge in Tunbridge Wells\u201d. It\u2019s been one of those nights for Spurs fans. 90 min +1: Aurier is replaced by Malachi Fagan-Walcott, who will be 18 tomorrow. A bittersweet early birthday present for the academy centre-half. 90 min: Spurs and an ashen-faced Mourinho just want this over. But there will be six added minutes. 89 min: Spurs have been better in this second half. But it was a low bar. Overall, they\u2019ve been thoroughly outplayed by Leipzig over both legs. Angelino crosses from the left. Aurier slides in to clear, but can only tee up Forsberg, who slams home from eight yards with his first touch, 32 seconds after making it onto the pitch! 86 min: Leipzig want a penalty, arguing Tanganga went in with unnecessary force. But the ref\u2019s not interested, and we play on. But not before Leipzig\u2019s two-goal hero is replaced by Emil Forsberg. 84 min: Upamecano romps down the middle, one-twos with Haidara, and nearly gets a shot away. Lloris comes out to claim. Tanganga comes across and gives the big defender the mother of all shoulder barges. Tanganga goes down having been clattered with some force. 82 min: Angelino makes ground down the left and feeds Werner, who wins a corner off Dier. Angelino takes. Spurs half clear. Upamecano chests down and blooters a volley straight into Tanganga\u2019s ribcage. That\u2019s winded the young Spurs defender, and play is stopped so he can catch his breath. 80 min: Spurs replace Lo Celso with Gedson Fernandes, the visit of Manchester United on Sunday now uppermost in Jose Mourinho\u2019s mind. 78 min: Leipzig stroke it around the back for a while, a textbook example of game management. 76 min: Adams zips down the right. His cross is deflected off Sessegnon and out for a corner. Werner\u2019s set piece is nothing to write home about. \u201cIs that Mourinho managing Alli and co., or is it Mourinho\u2019s brother?\u201d Ladies and gentlemen, please be upstanding for Mr Phil Grey. 74 min: Moura drives down the left, beats Upamecano and pulls back for Alli, who whistles a first-time shot straight down the throat of Gulacsi. Alli goes over Sabitzer\u2019s leg after shooting, and VAR has a look, but it\u2019s never a penalty. 73 min: Schick dribbles down the middle. He\u2019s got options to the right ... but weirdly passes to nobody on the left. 71 min: Mind you, Leipzig are putting it around as well. Sabitzer is booked for bowling Alli to the ground. Everyone\u2019s getting a little tetchy. 70 min: Alli is booked for a mist-down swipe at Angelino\u2019s ankles. Frustration seems to have taken hold of Tottenham. 69 min: Tanganga is booked for giving Werner a rugby-style cuddle. 68 min: Some good news on the stricken Mukiele: he was briefly unconscious, having swallowed his tongue. But thankfully he\u2019s reportedly recovered and all is now well. 66 min: Upamecano and Haidara combine down the right with Spurs light at the back. Werner\u2019s in the middle, and really should be found, but his team-mates over-elborate on the flank and the chance is gone. 64 min: Lamela goes in clumsily on Sabitzer. He stands on one of his ankles. Lightly? Certainly. Deliberately? It\u2019s not clear, so the referee takes no action other than to award a free kick. 63 min: Lo Celso fires a fine pass down the left, releasing Sessegnon into space. But there\u2019s nobody in the centre. The resulting cross, however, is put in a dangerous enough position to force Halstenberg into the panicked concession of a corner. Sadly, Lo Celso\u2019s delivery is not all that. But there have been some recent signs of Tottenham belatedly sparking into life. 62 min: Laimer works his way down the left but can\u2019t quite find Werner in the middle with his low cross. Spurs are able to clear. 61 min: Moura is illegally blocked by Halstenberg out on the Spurs left. Lo Celso swings a free kick into the mixer, but it\u2019s not all that, and easily cleared by Leipzig. One first-half Lo Celso shot apart, Spurs have failed utterly in their attempts to work Gulacsi in the Leipzig goal. 60 min: A second change for Leipzig, as Amadou Haidara replaces Nkunku. The game restarts, and Werner glides in from the left before rasping a rising shot inches over the crossbar. 58 min: Moura tries to give Spurs some momentum, shooting ambitiously from distance. The shot just about stays in the arena. \u201cNow that your good self and others have cited the Ajax comeback, if Spurs don\u2019t do that now it means Liverpool won\u2019t repeat their Barcelona trick tomorrow,\u201d argues Perspective\u2019s Ian Copestake, who may or may not be losing his mind with worry. \u201cCome on Spurs!\u201d 57 min: Werner slips a pass down the inside left for Schick, who balloons a wild effort yards over the bar from the left of the D. A decent chance, that, and Spurs are still clinging onto hope by their fingernails. But they need something to happen soon. 56 min: Mukiele can\u2019t continue, he\u2019s in some pain and distress. He lies back on the stretcher and is carted off, holding his head. God speed young man. Meanwhile on comes 21-year-old US midfielder Tyler Adams in the big Frenchman\u2019s stead. 54 min: Worrying scenes here as the stretcher comes on for Mukiele. It\u2019s not clear what\u2019s happened to the big man. Thankfully he\u2019s soon sitting up, but he looks pretty groggy. He might have taken a whack in the face from the ball. 52 min: Lamela plays a long pass down the middle for Moura, who can\u2019t quite get the better of Klostermann in a footrace. For a split second there, Leipzig were in trouble, but that\u2019s staunch defending. 50 min: Laimer is booked for a check on Lamela. Replays suggest it was the nearby Upamecano who put in most of the physical work, but it\u2019s his team-mate who cops the flak. 49 min: Moura turns neatly in the midfield. There\u2019s acres in front of him ... and options ... but he overruns it, allowing Leipzig to counter. Werner sashays in from the left and takes far too long to get a shot away. Spurs regain possession, thankful Werner was so uncharacteristically ponderous. 47 min: Spurs start the second half on the front foot, probing down both flanks. They annoy the hosts enough for Werner to clip Tanganga to the floor. Leipzig\u2019s star striker escapes with a ticking-off. Leipzig get the second half underway. Spurs had been sent out early, presumably in disgrace, by man-management guru Mourinho. They were waiting alone for a good couple of minutes. Let\u2019s see how they respond to this motivational technique. Half-time catharsis. It\u2019s fair to say the Tottenham faithful aren\u2019t in the best of moods. The floor\u2019s yours, folks. Better out than in ... and who knows, you might even tempt fate into serving up another Ajax-style miracle. \u201cSurely this is the end for Mourinho at Spurs?\u201d asks Niall Sheerin. \u201cThere is nothing there. No structure or shape; no discernible tactics or style; no spirit or spunk. In ditching Poch for Mou, Levy implicitly acknowledged that he failed in his mission to ship out the deadwood and refresh the squad in the summer. Surely it\u2019s now time for him to acknowledge the error and #bringbackPoch.\u201d \u201cMourinho is already working on his post match interview where he contrives to blame tonight\u2019s performance on Ndombele, Luke Shaw and Eva Carneiro,\u201d zings Stephen Carr. Finally here\u2019s Adam Levine: \u201cThis is the third time in recent memory where Spurs have brought in a manager who had previously managed bitter London rivals. After the unmitigated disasters that with were the reigns of George Graham and AVB who ever believed this would be a good idea? I am a Spurs fan and season ticket holder and am now willing us to lose every game between now and the end of the season so that we don\u2019t have to suffer the indignity of Mourinho at the helm any further. In the words of Charlie Brown, good grief!\u201d And that\u2019s the end of a miserable first 45 for Spurs. On the touchline, as his troops trudge back to the dressing room, Mourinho engages the fourth official in some heated debate. Not sure what he\u2019s unhappy about. Not sure what he\u2019s unhappy about in particular, that is. Spurs need something approaching an Ajax-style miracle. They\u2019ve done it before. 45 min +1: Winks is booked for cynically clipping Laimer, who was looking to break from a nondescript Spurs attack. He doesn\u2019t bother complaining. He had to take one for the team. 45 min: Spurs nearly concede a farcical third. Some slapstick shenanigans in their area. Dier tries to punt clear. The ball twangs off Schick\u2019s standing leg and slowly rolls towards the bottom right. It should never go in, though Lloris nearly lets it. The keeper scoops away just in time. 44 min: Aurier bustles down the right. He thinks he\u2019s run the ball out for a goal kick, but the ball clipped Angelino and the officials give Aurier a pleasant surprise. Lo Celso takes the corner. A chance to change the picture just before the break? Nope. Gulacsi claims with ease. 43 min: There won\u2019t be much hope if Spurs concede another. Werner and Schick advance on the Spurs box. The visitors are fortunate that the pair get in each other\u2019s way, allowing Tanganga to clip the ball away from danger. 41 min: This is better from Spurs! Sessegnon dinks into the box from the left. Leipzig half clear. Lo Celso cuts in from the right and curls a splendid low shot towards the bottom left. It\u2019s heading in, but Gulacsi sticks out a strong hand to parry and Upamecano mops up without panic. So close to a precious away goal, so close to some precious hope. 40 min: Upamecano tries to release Mukiele down the inside-right channel with a glorious Beckenbaueresque rake. Just a bit too much on the long-distance pass, and it\u2019s a goal kick. Mukiele applauds his team-mate\u2019s ambition nonetheless. 38 min: Upamecano carelessly gives the ball away to Lamela, but then, with Moura hoping to advance towards the box, charges it down and regains possession for Leipzig. Wonderful defending. At the moment, Leipzig are in that sweet spot where they end up impressing even when they make the odd mistake. 36 min: The free kick leads to a corner. The corner leads to a throw. The throw leads to an extended passing sequence. Spurs can\u2019t get hold of the ball at all. This is painful viewing from a Tottenham perspective. 34 min: Sessegnon is correctly booked after overrunning the ball and raking his shoe down the back of Mukiele\u2019s leg. 33 min: Angelino is getting a ruinous amount of space down the left. He sets in motion a move which ends in Lloris punching clear under pressure from Schick and Mukiele. \u201cRed Bull look like they\u2019ve had their Red Bull tonight, while Mourinho\u2019s men have had an early Horlicks,\u201d quips Justin Kavanagh, because somebody had to. 31 min: Leipzig look uber-relaxed at the moment, much as you\u2019d expect them to, the state of the tie. Werner glides in from the left and tries to curl one into the top right. Too high and wide, but a decent effort nonetheless. \u201cIt seems some substitutions could do Spurs good here. I suggest Wanyama in the middle, Llorente in attack.\u201d Sports satirist Eivind Krohg, ladies and gentlemen. 29 min: Alli bursts down the left and is clipped from behind by Upamecano, who really should be booked. But it\u2019s just a free kick. Spurs waste their set piece in short order, and suddenly Leipzig are breaking at speed, yet again. Werner is found just inside the box to the right. He takes a touch and lashes a shot straight at Lloris, presumably having decided that anything might happen. This time Lloris parries with strong hands. 27 min: Werner crosses from the right, but his ball is too high for Schick in the middle. Spurs are hanging on. 26 min: The hosts do very little with their corner. This is such an open game, though. The chances of it ending 2-0 tonight look extremely slim. 25 min: But it\u2019s Leipzig who look most likely to score the next goal. Angelino is afforded yet more space down the left, and he wins a corner off Aurier. Tottenham were ludicrously light at the back there, with Werner in the middle lurking. Spurs clear the corner and try to break through Alli and Lamela, but Mukiele wins the ball back, Leipzig spring back upfield, and win another corner. 23 min: Spurs are really up against it now. But again, let us remember: this is exactly where they were in Amsterdam last season, and look what happened there. It\u2019s a straw-clutching exercise, of course it is, but this is all Tottenham have got right now. An away goal before half-time could change everything. What a stunning goal this is! From the centre circle, Laimer sprays a ball down the right for Angelino, who crosses towards Sabitzer at the near post. Sabitzer powers a header down towards the bottom-left corner and in! There were a couple of Spurs mistakes - Aurier missed a header from Laimer\u2019s pass, while Lloris was again weak of wrist - but take nothing away from the wonderful sweep of the move. 19 min: Leipzig have the ball in the net again. Some space for Angelino down the left. His low cross flies across the face of goal, and is tapped in with great ease by Werner. But Werner had needlessly gone early, and it\u2019s clearly offside. Werner, overly eager, let Spurs off the hook there. 18 min: Moura works some space down the right and forces Upamecano into conceding a corner with a low cross. Nothing comes from the set piece. 17 min: Dier and Tanganga hesitate, nearly allowing Werner to nip between them and race goalwards with the ball. Dier makes a last-ditch tackle to save the situation, before rollocking his young team-mate in the trenchant style. Spurs need to gather themselves, and quick. 16 min: A shot of Mourinho responding to the goal pictures him gesticulating with one outstretched arm before turning away in disgust. It\u2019s a textbook performance of the internationally recognised mime for See What I Have To Work With?! He\u2019s not a happy man. 14 min: But that goal has understandably deflated Spurs, while putting a fresh blast of wind in Leipzig\u2019s sail. Momentum\u2019s shifted. Mukiele ripples the side netting from a tight angle, though the flag belatedly goes up for offside. 12 min: Spurs fans shouldn\u2019t get too disheartened yet. Their team started well. And the narrative arc of this tie is following last year\u2019s semi-final against Ajax. If history is to repeat, another goal for Leipzig before half-time and it really is on! Laimer scampers down the right and cuts back for Werner, whose shot from just inside the box is blocked. Werner recycles possession and tees up his captain Sabitzer, who arrows a low shot towards the bottom left. It\u2019s a decent effort, though Lloris should tip it round the post. A weak hand and it\u2019s in. A tale of two captains, and now Spurs are really up against it. 8 min: During that last attack, Alderweireld had his arms wrapped around Schick, who made a half-arsed plea for a penalty kick. There wasn\u2019t enough in it, though the Spurs defender will need to stop that if he doesn\u2019t want to risk needless bother. 6 min: Leipzig respond with their first serious attack of the evening. Werner presses down the right. Spurs are on the back foot. The ball\u2019s worked towards Angelino, just inside the box, on the left. Leaning back, Angelino tries to whip a diagonal shot towards the bottom right, but gets it all wrong. It\u2019s open. 5 min: Some space for Alli out on the right. He swings a low cross into the box, hoping to find Lamela. Klostermann is on point and able to clear. Beforehand, Moura nearly got on the end of a long ball, only to be denied by Upamecano. This is a lively start by the visitors. 4 min: Sessegnon makes himself known down the left, and looks to have won a corner, but the flag goes up for offside. For a split second there, the home team looked exposed. An encouraging moment for Spurs. 3 min: Not that Leipzig have started much better themselves. Angelino takes a throw that sails infield and curls straight back out of play. Werner, hoping he\u2019d be found on the half-way line, out on the left, gives the it-doesn\u2019t-matter thumbs-up. 2 min: And on that very subject, Dier overhits a simple backpass and concedes a ridiculous corner. Angelino to take from the right. Moura clears at the near post. In the dugout, Jose doesn\u2019t look particularly impressed at what he\u2019s just witnessed, but he soon gathers himself and reaches the touchline for an encouraging clap. And we\u2019re off! The visitors get this second leg underway. It\u2019s the very first Champions League knockout game at the RB Arena, and the home crowd aren\u2019t disappointing. A fine noise .. and a hectic, pinball start. A few nerves on display, but not much control. The teams are out! Leipzig line up in their white shirts with red trim, while Spurs are resplendent in second-choice navy blue. A cracking atmosphere at a packed, Coronavirus-defying RB Arena, the 2,300 travelling Spurs fans making themselves heard as best they can. It\u2019s time for the official Uefa remix of Zadok the Priest, the coin toss, and some pre-match pleasantries. It won\u2019t be long before the game is underway! Jose Mourinho speaks. \u201cWe have nothing to lose. We are already losing. I believe we are going to do it. We go with everything. It is not much that we have. But we go with everything.\u201d That\u2019s from a pre-record from yesterday with BT Sport. No word from him this evening, though he has been spotted exchanging elbow-taps (damn this virus) with his opposite number Julian Nagelsmann. Pre-match presents. At first glance, you could be forgiven for thinking little or no effort had gone into the bland pennant Marcel Sabitzer will hand over before kick-off. But squint a little harder: it\u2019s been designed to look like a polo shirt. Full marks for busting tapered-flag convention wide open, if nothing else. By way of contrast, Hugo Lloris will be gifting this far more classical bit of official tat. Spurs will be playing in dark blue, incidentally, forced into the change because Leipzig\u2019s first-choice colours are also white. Leipzig make one change to the side sent out at the all-new Spurs stadium three weeks ago. The 21-year-old French defender Dayot Upamecano replaces Ethan Ampadu, the 19-year-old Welsh loanee from Chelsea, at the back. Tottenham make four changes to the side defeated in the first leg. Davinson Sanchez, Ben Davies, Gedson Fernandes and Steven Bergwijn make way for Japhet Tanganga, Ryan Sessegnon, Eric Dier and Erik Lamela. Of those dropped, only Fernandes is named as a sub. Sanchez meanwhile failed a fitness test; youth-team defender Malachi Fagan-Walcott, 18 tomorrow, gets a surprise call-up to the bench as a result. RB Leipzig: Gulacsi, Klostermann, Upamecano, Halstenberg, Mukiele, Sabitzer, Laimer, Angelino, Nkunku, Schick, Werner. Subs: Haidara, Poulsen, Forsberg, Adams, Lookman, Olmo, Mvogo. Tottenham Hotspur: Lloris, Alderweireld, Dier, Tanganga, Aurier, Winks, Lo Celso, Sessegnon, Lamela, Lucas Moura, Alli. Subs: Vertonghen, Gazzaniga, Ndombele, Skipp, Fernandes, Parrott, Fagan-Walcott. Referee: Carlos Del Cerro (Spain). This looks like an uphill battle for Spurs, who at the halfway point of this Champions League round-of-16 tie, are trailing to knockout new boys RB Leipzig after a 0-1 loss at home. Jose Mourinho\u2019s men have lost four of their last five fixtures in all competitions, drawing the other slightly fortuitously at Burnley on Saturday. They need to snap that run with victory tonight, though their record this season of four wins in 21 away matches in all competitions won\u2019t fill them with too much confidence. Nor will the fact they\u2019ve lost all three of their matches against Bundesliga opposition in this campaign: the first leg of this tie, plus 3-1 and 7-2 defeats to Bayern Munich in the groups. But all is not lost. In-form Leipzig may have won three and drawn two of their last five games, but they\u2019ve already lost at home in the Champions League this season, to Lyon. The 0-2 scoreline that evening is exactly the one Spurs require to get through. Additionally, while Tottenham\u2019s 2019-20 record against German teams is abysmal, they brushed aside Borussia Dortmund at this stage last season. And it\u2019s impossible to forget their last knockout tie in which they lost the first leg 0-1 at home. Spurs may not have won the competition last season, but they\u2019ll always have Amsterdam. So this is balanced nicely. In Leipzig\u2019s favour, yes, but Spurs are far from out of it. And while Jose Mourinho has his critics - whisper it, more than one or two, we\u2019ve heard - he knows a thing or two about inspiring Champions League wins that looked almost impossible on paper. Just ask Manchester United (279 European Cup matches, seen off by Porto in 2004) or Barcelona (317, worked over by Inter in 2010). In that respect, Leipzig (13) will hold him no fears. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm GMT, 9pm local in Saxony.",

The RBA\u2019s deputy governor, Guy Debelle, told the Australian Financial Review business summit on Wednesday that it was \u201ctoo uncertain\u201d to assess the virus\u2019s impact beyond March, with supply chain disruption set to hit the construction and retail sectors in particular. Debelle argued that low interest rates would help boost the Australian economy and said the anticipated stimulus package \u201cwill provide welcome support\u201d, noting the government\u2019s \u201cintention to support jobs, incomes, small business and investment\u201d. The RBA called for federal stimulus as early as last July, well before the coronavirus and bushfire season that Treasury estimates are set to wipe 0.5% and 0.2% from gross domestic product. For months the government resisted the call for extra stimulus before providing an additional $3.8bn for infrastructure in November. This week it is expected to announce a package based on a new business investment allowance, a financial boost for pensioners through changes to deeming rates, and support for small and medium-sized businesses and a tax break for some households. On Wednesday Debelle highlighted the government\u2019s anticipated stimulus package, suggesting that after it was implemented \u201cthe combined effect of fiscal and monetary policy will help us navigate a difficult period for the Australian economy\u201d. \u201cThey will also help ensure the Australian economy is well placed to bounce back quickly once the virus is contained.\u201d In his speech Debelle said the Australian economy\u2019s growth of 2.25% in the year to the December quarter confirmed the RBA\u2019s assessment the year would end with \u201ca gradual pick-up\u201d.

They too are beginning to suffer significant disruptions, the extent and duration of which is unknown at this time. \u201cThe conclusion is that the global economy will be materially weaker in the first quarter of 2020 and in the period ahead.\u201d Debelle noted a 90% reduction in incoming visitors from China, causing an estimated 10% reduction in Australia\u2019s services exports, split equally between the tourism and education sectors. \u201cAs service exports account for 5% of GDP, this translates into a subtraction from growth of o.5% per cent of GDP in the March quarter from these two sources,\u201d he said. Debelle noted that share prices have fallen by \u201cas much as 20% since their all-time peak of less than a month ago, although the Australian market rebounded on Tuesday\u201d. Exchange rate volatility had increased but \u201cremains considerably lower than volatility in other financial markets\u201d, he said. Debelle said Australian banks were \u201cwell capitalised and is in a strong liquidity position\u201d and the RBA had \u201cnot seen any particular sign of pressure in our daily market operations to date\u201d. He said the RBA had cut interest rates to a record low of 0.5% last week \u201cto support the economy by boosting demand and to offset the tightening in financial conditions that otherwise was occurring\u201d. \u201cThe virus is a shock to both demand and supply.

In addition to interest rate cuts, Debelle confirmed the RBA may use unconventional monetary policy such as quantitative easing, suggesting the bank would \u201cact in the government bond market as necessary\u201d. \u201cThere are scenarios in which we are certainly going to have to consider that \u2013 absolutely,\u201d he said in answer to a question. Earlier, Anthony Albanese noted that Labor had been calling for the government to provide fiscal stimulus through measures including accelerated tax cuts, business investment and a boost to Newstart. The opposition leader told the AFR conference that the Rudd government\u2019s stimulus package was \u201crevered\u201d internationally but the Coalition was \u201cdismissive\u201d of the fact that Labor helped avert a recession in Australia during the global financial crisis: \u201cNever forget they voted against the stimulus plan in the parliament.\u201d Albanese promised Labor would \u201ccontinue to be constructive and provide expedited support through the parliament for any reasonable measure that restores confidence, increases economic activity and keeps people in jobs\u201d.

      "body": "<p>History was made by Atalanta, a team who make football fun, but there was virtually no one there to see it. Four more goals were scored by Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s side as they progressed to the quarter-finals in their first season in the Champions League having defeated Valencia 8-4 on aggregate, a 4-3 victory in Spain following the 4-1 win at San Siro.</p> <p>At the final whistle they gathered, posed for a photo with a T-shirt telling their virus-hit city: \u201cBergamo, this is for you: never give up\u201d, and celebrated, every word of it audible. Meanwhile their opponents headed swiftly down the tunnel and out of Europe.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/10/rb-leipzig-tottenham-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report\">RB Leipzig leave Lloris squirming and hurry Mourinho's stale Spurs to the exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Atalanta broke, Josip Ilicic signalled for the ball he so thoroughly deserved. He, too, had made history, becoming the first player to score four goals away from home in this competition. At the end of the night, there should have been applause, a standing ovation for him. There should have been for his teammates too, a side who care nothing for orthodoxy, preferring always to attack, and one that had brought joy to a region where there is too little right now. And maybe even for Valencia who had at least made this enjoyable. Instead, there was silence.</p> <p>It had all played out before an empty stadium, closed because of the coronavirus. It was to their credit that these two teams had made it this good, but there was something missing \u2013 and you could not help wondering how much better it might have been with people there. Four goals from Ilicic, two from Kevin Gameiro and one from Ferran Torres deserved an audience, even if deep down Valencia always knew progressing was beyond them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/atalanta-produce-a-night-to-remember-in-defeat-of-valencia\">A 4-1 deficit</a> would have been hard enough to overturn anyway; without their fans it was always likely to be impossible.</p> <p>When Valencia\u2019s bus arrived at the Mestalla it was greeted by hundreds of supporters, singing and swirling scarves. The aim was to create a communion, the culture needed for a comeback, which they knew could not last. None of them could get in the ground but, while most then made their way home, some chose instead to stay and watch the game from the cluster of bars just outside \u2013 highlighting one potential flaw in playing behind closed doors.</p> <p>From there, it seemed, the players could hear them singing. But the quality of the sound soon suggested that some of these chants were pre-recorded and played out over the PA system. First, though, it breathlessly announced the lineups to \u2026 who exactly? Then they blasted out the Champions League anthem while in the centre circle that ball-shaped tarpaulin was waggled about as always. It had barely been packed away when Valencia\u2019s hopes had been, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e678227474624871c078fbda3b5229afa924a90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e678227474624871c078fbda3b5229afa924a90/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Valencia supporters congregate to greet their team outside the Estadio Mestalla before kick off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Valencia supporters congregate to greet their team outside the Estadio Mestalla before kick off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UEFA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mouctar Diakhaby gave away two penalties, both unnecessary, and any belief Valencia had that they could turn this around had gone in little more than 60 seconds: 1.25 the clock said when Diakhaby brought down Ilicic, the night\u2019s outstanding player. The Slovenian got up and scored the penalty to make it 1-0, 5-2 on aggregate, watched by the only fan inside Mestalla: Vicente Navarro, a blind supporter, who passed away a few years ago but a statute of him occupies his seat and it sat, alone, in the stand.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/10/klopp-liverpool-shackles-bravery-atletico-madrid-champions-league\">Klopp casts off Liverpool shackles and demands bravery in \u2018fight to the end\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Otherwise there were a few directors, players and coaching staff, some officials, a handful of ball boys and a solitary steward at each end, and that was it. In one stand a banner said: \u201cour hearts and our support, always in Mestalla\u201d.

      "bodyText": "History was made by Atalanta, a team who make football fun, but there was virtually no one there to see it. Four more goals were scored by Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s side as they progressed to the quarter-finals in their first season in the Champions League having defeated Valencia 8-4 on aggregate, a 4-3 victory in Spain following the 4-1 win at San Siro. At the final whistle they gathered, posed for a photo with a T-shirt telling their virus-hit city: \u201cBergamo, this is for you: never give up\u201d, and celebrated, every word of it audible. Meanwhile their opponents headed swiftly down the tunnel and out of Europe. As Atalanta broke, Josip Ilicic signalled for the ball he so thoroughly deserved. He, too, had made history, becoming the first player to score four goals away from home in this competition. At the end of the night, there should have been applause, a standing ovation for him. There should have been for his teammates too, a side who care nothing for orthodoxy, preferring always to attack, and one that had brought joy to a region where there is too little right now. And maybe even for Valencia who had at least made this enjoyable. Instead, there was silence. It had all played out before an empty stadium, closed because of the coronavirus. It was to their credit that these two teams had made it this good, but there was something missing \u2013 and you could not help wondering how much better it might have been with people there. Four goals from Ilicic, two from Kevin Gameiro and one from Ferran Torres deserved an audience, even if deep down Valencia always knew progressing was beyond them. A 4-1 deficit would have been hard enough to overturn anyway; without their fans it was always likely to be impossible. When Valencia\u2019s bus arrived at the Mestalla it was greeted by hundreds of supporters, singing and swirling scarves. The aim was to create a communion, the culture needed for a comeback, which they knew could not last. None of them could get in the ground but, while most then made their way home, some chose instead to stay and watch the game from the cluster of bars just outside \u2013 highlighting one potential flaw in playing behind closed doors. From there, it seemed, the players could hear them singing. But the quality of the sound soon suggested that some of these chants were pre-recorded and played out over the PA system. First, though, it breathlessly announced the lineups to \u2026 who exactly? Then they blasted out the Champions League anthem while in the centre circle that ball-shaped tarpaulin was waggled about as always. It had barely been packed away when Valencia\u2019s hopes had been, too. Mouctar Diakhaby gave away two penalties, both unnecessary, and any belief Valencia had that they could turn this around had gone in little more than 60 seconds: 1.25 the clock said when Diakhaby brought down Ilicic, the night\u2019s outstanding player. The Slovenian got up and scored the penalty to make it 1-0, 5-2 on aggregate, watched by the only fan inside Mestalla: Vicente Navarro, a blind supporter, who passed away a few years ago but a statute of him occupies his seat and it sat, alone, in the stand. Otherwise there were a few directors, players and coaching staff, some officials, a handful of ball boys and a solitary steward at each end, and that was it. In one stand a banner said: \u201cour hearts and our support, always in Mestalla\u201d. If the fans could be heard from outside and from loud speakers, on the television sets upon which everyone everywhere had to watch, you could hear the players: every kick, every word. When Ilicic prepared to take the first penalty the referee, Ovidiu Hategan, could clearly be heard telling Jasper Cillessen to stay on his line. \u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he replied, but he wasnot and nor was this. It is not just the stadium that is empty, it is the whole thing. However good a match is \u2013 and this really was very good indeed \u2013 it is not really a match in these conditions. Attempts to palliate the absence of fans with piped-in chants and paraphernalia made it more pathetic somehow, oddly surreal. That said, as an exhibition it was very enjoyable.

Rodrigo Moreno had drawn an early save and Valencia drew level on twenty minutes when Gameiro went around the goalkeeper and scored. Outside, there was a delayed cheer.

      "bodyText": "The health minister Nadine Dorries has become the first MP to be diagnosed with coronavirus, prompting concerns about the potential spread of the illness at Westminster and even at Downing Street, where she attended a reception last week. The Department of Health and Social Care DHSC confirmed that Dorries, the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire since 2005 and a bestselling author of fiction, had tested positive for the infection. The identity of the individual who infected her is unknown. Focus will now fall on tracking down and testing the potentially hundreds of people Dorries will have been in contact with in the past week, both in parliament and at the health department. She also attended a Downing Street reception last week for International Women\u2019s Day where the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, were among guests present. A DHSC spokeswoman said Dorries, who began her career as a nurse, has been self-isolating at home since Friday. She is understood to be recovering. In a statement released by the department, she said: \u201cI can confirm I have tested positive for coronavirus. As soon as I was informed I took all the advised precautions and have been self-isolating at home. \u201cPublic Health England has started detailed contact tracing and the department and my parliamentary office are closely following their advice. I would like to thank PHE and the wonderful NHS staff who have provided me with advice and support.\u201d After the news was announced she tweeted: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, tweeted: \u201cReally sorry to hear Nadine has tested positive for coronavirus. She has done the right thing by self isolating at home, and both NHS and PHE staff have been brilliant. We all wish her well as she recovers.\u201d There has been speculation that parliament could be suspended to limit the spread of coronavirus among MPs, peers and staff, but Downing Street has as yet played down this idea. A spokesman said there were still no plans to suspend parliament to prevent the spread of the virus. \u201cWe are closely following guidance from Public Health England (PHE) in response to the situation and have been reassured that the measures we are taking are proportionate and appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cAt present there are no plans to suspend parliament. Changes to the way parliament functions would be a matter for consultation between the Speakers, the government and the parliamentary authorities.\u201d A government source told PA Media that officials and MPs should continue to go to work in Whitehall and parliament unless told otherwise, saying chief medical officer advice was that \u201cno one needs to self-isolate or be tested unless asked to by the PHE contact tracers who are working round the clock\u201d. There was no immediate response to Dorries\u2019 diagnosis from No 10.",

As the democrats take to the polls for the state\u2019s primary today, many analysts might overlook this long-ago swing state as an automatic win for former vice-president Joe Biden.</p> \n  <p>But Missouri is a bastion of Democratic voting blocs that can rally behind either Biden or Vermont senator Bernie Sanders: farmers, factory workers, elder black moderates, young progressive activists, conservative evangelicals ... take your pick.</p> \n  <p>While those distinctions typically only play into the <em>general</em> election, an increasingly tense showdown between supporters of moderate Biden and progressive Sanders could make Missouri more competitive than most analysts predict.</p> \n  <p>The one debate even more tense: whether it\u2019s pronounced Missour<em>ee </em>or Missour<em>ah</em>. Ask that and be prepared for a completely different type of fight. Here are two ways Missouri is a unique primary to watch.</p> \n  <p><strong>Region</strong>:<br><em>\u201cIs it the midwest, or south?\u201d </em>Both! Or neither, depending on who you ask. Located nearly dead center of the continental US, Missouri boasts a unique state culture that, at times, can reflect deep conservative attitudes of the south, while in other areas more reminiscent of the industrial rust belt.</p> \n  <p>For the 2016 general election, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/missouri-could-be-a-swing-state-again/\">broke down</a> why the \u2018show me\u2019 state is such an important political outlier:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Missouri was a key swing state for much of the 20th century. In a country where political divisions have historically been sewn along geographic lines, Missouri includes a bit of a few regions. And political nerds might remember that it voted for the winner in every presidential election from 1904 through 2004, with the exception of 1956, when it voted for Adlai Stevenson.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Race Matters:</strong><br></p> \n  <p>Six years ago the state was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/ferguson-five-years-on-from-the-police-shooting-of-michael-brown\">rocked by the shooting death</a> of 18 year-old Mike Brown in Ferguson, igniting a firestorm of protests the lead to the founding of Black Lives Matter, and countless subsequent social justice movements.</p> \n  <p>Neighboring St Louis is currently embroiled in a racial scandal of its own. In January, a top prosecutor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/15/st-louis-top-prosecutor-sues-city-under-kkk-law\">filed a federal lawsuit</a> against the city and its police union for conspiracy to thwart her racial justice reforms, citing a nearly 150-year-old law used to combat the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group.</p> \n  <p>Missouri, along with Mississippi, are two states voting today that have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/05/super-tuesday-black-voters-analysis-recap\">significant black populations</a>, representing nearly one-fifth and three-fourths of the Democratic electorate, respectively. </p> \n  <p>As most pundits predict, whoever wins the black vote, a near demographic split between older moderates and young progressives, may that momentum into the convention in July.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T18:59:42.189Z\">at 6.59pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e67c9c18f087df56e4c5e1d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tom-perkins\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T17:10:21.047Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Traffic was light at a polling station on Detroit\u2019s east side where no one showed up for at least 10 minutes. The station is in one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods and is likely near 100% African American. That doesn\u2019t bode well for Democrats. The low turnout among black voters in Detroit was a big part of why Hillary Clinton lost in the primary and general. </p> \n  <p>However, several miles away, still on Detroit\u2019s east side, a steady number of voters stopped in a precinct in another economically struggling neighborhood. The station is within sight of about 10 vacant homes. Charles, a young African American voter, said he cast his ballot for Bernie Sanders. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president that\u2019s going to do the things he\u2019s going to do \u2013 he\u2019s something different,\u201d Charles said. \u201cJoe Biden just seems like the Democratic version of Donald Trump. You know, what do we have to lose?\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>Charles said he sees the vote in Detroit breaking down along generational lines. His older friends and family support Biden because he was Obama\u2019s vice-president and they know and trust him. His younger friends and family support Sanders. Several other older voters who stopped in the station ahead of Charles said they planned to vote for Biden, but declined to discuss why. <br></p> \n  <p>Though he cast his ballot for Sanders, Charles doesn\u2019t believe the progressive candidate is better suited than Biden to beat Trump. He said he isn\u2019t sure about who would win in a match up between Trump and Sanders, but added: \u201cI\u2019m going to do my part. Anything can happen.\u201d Are there enough Sanders supporters in Detroit doing their part for the Vermont senator to repeat his 2016 upset of Clinton? Charles said he believes there are. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe won it the last time, so I think he\u2019s going to get a good turnout this time around,\u201d he said. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T19:00:33.423Z\">at 7.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e67a5b88f085f0b8d945adc\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T16:08:03.675Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Lunchtime!

Retweeting Keane\u2019s thoughts on the ceremony, Trump said the honour was \u201cwell deserved\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Keane and Trump go back a long way, the four-star general and Fox News analyst, another New Yorker, having twice turned down offers to be Trump\u2019s secretary of defense but having served as an informal adviser.</p> \n  <p>Keane is a named source for Trump and his Generals, a recent book by Peter Bergen, who writes that the general became \u201calmost a shadow national security adviser\u201d to Trump at a time when the president was notably failing to get on with HR McMaster, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/24/trump-hr-mcmaster-book-national-security-adviser\">the general who officially filled that role</a>.</p> \n  <p>Bergen, a CNN analyst, recounts Keane telling Trump one way to signal to North Korea he was serious about possible military action over its nuclear weapons programme would be \u201cto stop sending military families to South Korea\u201d. Trump, Bergen writes, subsequently ordered an evacuation of US civilians, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/trump-seoul-evacuation-north-korea-book\">sending official aides into a panic</a>.</p> \n  <p>The order never went through.</p> \n  <p>Bergen also writes that Keane has not only offered Trump only positive advice. Keane blasted Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/17/putins-poodle-newspapers-declare-trump-a-traitor-after-helsinki-summit\">infamous summit with Vladimir Putin</a> in Helsinki in July 2018 as \u201cstunning and disapponting\u201d; supported the maintenance of a small US force in Afghanistan, against the president\u2019s wishes; and stood against Trump\u2019s urge to pull US troops out of Syria.</p> \n  <p>Keane seems to have been of more use to Trump than another retired general the president has liked to have around. Keith Kellogg joined the national security council but, according to Bergen, was found to be \u201clazy, uninformed and not smart\u201d, more likely to be found taking a nap or watching Fox News than doing any foreign policy work.</p> \n  <p>Should Trump read Bergen\u2019s book, which would admittedly seem unlikely, he might not like one paragraph in particular:</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn the end,\u201d Bergen writes, \u201cthe real \u2018Deep State\u2019 \u2013 retired senior generals such as Keane and officials at the Pentagon and state department \u2013 managed to keep many hundreds of American soldiers in Syria.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Deep State theory holds that unelected officials are working in concert to thwart Trump\u2019s agenda.

Think of each district as holding a bucket of delegates. There are also two buckets of delegates in each state awarded based on the overall statewide vote.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday, that makes for 51 buckets of delegates across the six states. Party rules say each viable candidate wins a proportion of the delegates in each bucket based on their share of the votes cast for the viable candidates in that bucket. Viable means they have past a 15% support threshold - almost certainly completely putting Tulsi Gabbard out of the equation.</p> \n  <p>Buckets that have an odd number of delegates are impossible to split evenly, meaning either Sanders or Biden is guaranteed to win at least one more than the other.</p> \n  <p>Say, for example, there are seven delegates in a bucket, and Sanders gets 51% and Biden gets 49% of the viable votes. In delegates, that\u2019s 3.57 to 3.43 a difference of just 0.14 delegates. But thanks to rounding, Sanders gets four and Biden gets three. If it was an even bucket with six delegates at play, they\u2019d get three each.<br></p> \n  <p>Nearly two-thirds of the 352 delegates at stake on Tuesday are in buckets with an odd number of delegates more than on any other night with more than one primary. Getting narrowly ahead in a tight race in those odd buckets is much more rewarding in terms of delegates.</p> \n  <p>Easy, eh?</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T13:03:49.325Z\">at 1.03pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e676ba38f08c2df6d276969\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-10T10:30:33.763Z\">10.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Is it all over for Bernie Sanders if Joe Biden wins in Michigan?

The two frontrunners in the Democratic presidential primaries are facing off in Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho, North Dakota and Washington state today. Election officials are rushing to address coronavirus concerns. The Trump administration has announced that it has made 4m additional tests for the coronavirus available, as it announces plans for a payroll tax cut and other measures to address the economic fallout from the public health crisis. The US justice department has been ordered to turn over secret Mueller grand jury evidence. The Guardian\u2019s Joan E Greve will be liveblogging the election results as they roll in. Follow along: Virginia representative Don Beyer said he and his wife will \u201cself-quarantine\u201d after interacting with a friend who tested positive for the coronavirus. Beyer, a Democrat, will join seven representatives who have already taken precautions after potential exposure to the virus. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which had backed Elizabeth Warren before she dropped out and encouraged voters to support Bernie Sanders, said that Sanders should stay in the race \u201cuntil the March 15th debate at the earliest\u201d. Regardless of how Sanders tonight, the group indicated it doesn\u2019t want a \u201cquick Biden coronation\u201d. Sanders and Biden are scheduled to face off during a televised debate in Phoenix on Saturday. The event, which will take place before a live audience, will continue as planned despite speculation that it would be derailed by efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus. Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho, North Dakota and Washington state all hosting primaries today. Here\u2019s what you need to know as voters cast their ballots: Asked whether Trump \u2014 a self-described germaphobe \u2014 would continue to shake hands with people amidst the spread of coronavirus, the vice president said he expects so. \u201cWell, look as the president has said, in our line of work, you shake hands when someone wants to shake your hand,\u201d Pence told reporters. \u201cI expect the president will continue to do that\u201d Where will Trump get $1tn to cover a payroll tax cut? The White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow was short on details. Speaking to press at the White House, he said, \u201cLet us put the proposal out and flush that out in concrete details.\u201d Kudlow said the tax relief package under consideration includes a payroll tax \u201choliday\u201d. Asked about whether Trump wants the tax eliminated completely, Kudlow responded that Trump makes \u201cbold\u201d moves. It\u2019s unclear how the administration would make up the revenue from the elimination of the 12.4% payroll tax, which is split evenly by workers and their employers and used to fund Medicare and Social Security. Speaking at the White House, Pence said the question of whether Donald Trump will cancel rallies will \u201cbe a decision that\u2019s made literally on a day-to-day basis.\u201d He said he\u2019s \u201cvery confident\u201d the Trump campaign will make the \u201cbest decisions\u201d. Mike Pence said there will be 4m more coronavirus tests made available by the end of the week. Top health insurance companies have joined Medicare and Medicaid and agreed \u201cto waive all copays, cover the cost of all treatment for those who contract the coronavirus,\u201d Pence said. Tony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the number of cases is \u201cguaranteed\u201d go up. Although both Sanders and Biden\u2019s have canceled campaign events, they are still planning to attend the debate on Sunday in Phoenix, Arizona. The network still plans to hold the debate, as planned, in front of a live audience despite speculation that the coronavirus threat would derail the event. The debate, which will begin at 8 p.m. Eastern will resemble a town hall, with each candidate answering questions from voters. Sanders and Biden will face off one-on-one before the votes are cast in Arizona, as well as Florida, Illinois and Ohio. The Michigan secretary of state has said that election results won\u2019t be available until Wednesday, due to high voter turnout. \u201cMichigan clerks and their teams will have significantly more work to do today than on previous election days, and that the results of today\u2019s elections may not be known until well into Wednesday,\u201d Jocelyn Benson wrote in an op-ed for USA Today. Since the 2018 elections, the state has made it easier for more people to vote, expanding vote by mail and allowing voters to register up to and on Election Day. \u201cIt is a new day for democracy in our state, with new rights for voters and greater security measures in place than ever before,\u201d Benson wrote. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh taking over from the West Coast. Whereas Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders\u2019 cancellation of events in Ohio is the first major sign of campaigns adjusting amidst the coronavirus threat, the disease has also affected how and where people will be able to vote. The Guardian\u2019s voting rights reporter Sam Levine writes: Election officials around the country are rushing to make last-minute changes to address coronavirus concerns \u2013 seeking to avoid panic, staff shortages and delays that could impose additional hurdles for primary voters on election day. Many of the changes have to do with protecting older people, the demographic most at risk for having serious complications from the virus. In Ohio Frank LaRose, the secretary of state, ordered all polling stations located in senior centers and nursing homes to be moved. The change is expected to affect 128 of the state\u2019s polling locations for its 17 March primary, and local officials are identifying alternative sites. Election officials in Chicago, also holding its primary next week, announced the city was relocating polling stations out of nursing homes. It\u2019s not just voters, however, who are at risk. In 2016, about 56% of poll workers across the country were over 61 years old, according to the US Election Assistance Commission, which collected data from about half of the workers that year. Tammy Patrick, a former election official in Arizona, said administrators should consider hiring youth poll workers and overstaff to prepare for cancellations. The county clerk in Travis county, Texas, said election day last week got off to a \u201crocky start\u201d with long lines at the polls, in part because poll workers didn\u2019t show up for work in an attempt to avoid exposure to coronavirus. Reductions in public transit and dial-a-ride services could also create additional obstacles to people getting to the polls, said Patrick. Trump insisted he doesn\u2019t need a coronavirus test.

Enjoy your evening and be sure to keep up-to-date with the latest from caucuses and primaries in Mississippi, Missouri, Washington, North Dakota, Idaho, and Michigan as results trickle in throughout the night. Happy Not-Quite-Super Tuesday! Shortly after the Bernie Sanders campaign announced they are cancelling tonight\u2019s planned rally due to the coronavirus, staffers for Joe Biden have followed suit: The Bernie Sanders campaign announced they are \u201cheeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials\u201d and are not holding their scheduled rally Tuesday night. The cancellation came via a statement shared online. \u201cOut of concern for public health and safety, we are canceling tonight\u2019s rally in Cleveland,\u201d the statement read. \u201cSen. Sanders would like to express his regret to the thousands of Ohioans who had planned to attend the event tonight.\u201d From The Guardian reporter Lauren Gambino: The announcement comes are more states implement emergency measures to combat the deadly coronavirus. The rally marks the first time a presidential campaign has canceled an event because of the outbreak. It comes hours after Ohio governor MIke DeWine recommended people stay away from large gatherings, including large campaign events. Joe Biden is also due to hold an election night rally in Cleveland, which has yet to be canceled. On Monday, Sanders convened a roundtable discussion with public health experts in Detroit about the coronavirus. A reporter asked Sanders then whether he planned to scale back any of his events due to the size of his rallies. The reporter noted that he often holds rallies with \u201cmore than 10,000 people.\u201d \u201c15,000,\u201d Sanders corrected him. Realizing his boast, he quickly added: \u201cWe do not go forward without consultation with local health officials.\u201d As the LA Times national correspondent Matt Pearce explained, this isn\u2019t the first time. So far, the Trump campaign has not moved forward with a planned Tuesday announcement of an upcoming campaign rally. Tom Perkins checks in with us again from Michigan: Though traffic at Michigan polling stations generally seems to be light, local outlets are reporting long lines for same day registration at city clerks\u2019 offices, especially in college towns across the state. Michigan voters in 2018 approved a voting reform package that made it easier to vote. Among the changes is same day registration, and this is the first election in which it has been in place. Apparently some city clerks didn\u2019t anticipate this level of interest. It largely seems to be young people who are showing up to register last minute, and that\u2019s a clear advantage for Sanders. He won voters under 40 years old by a wide margin in 2016 in Michigan, and he focused heavily on the same group during his get out the vote campaign in the days leading up to the election. However, Biden appears to have the advantage heading into Tuesday \u2014 one state pollster estimated the former vice president tallied a 150,000-vote cushion in absentee and early voting ballots. A federal appeals court ruled the US department of justice must turn over secret grand jury evidence to Democratic lawmakers investigating President Donald Trump. From the Washington Post: The US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit upheld a lower court order that gives Congress access to certain secret material from Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Post added, however, that the ruling is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. That means there\u2019s no legal demand for the justice department to turn over the report to Congress right away. In a press conference this morning, New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced he has authorized a containment zone around the city of New Rochelle. Via ABC News: Cuomo added that the National Guard will be deployed to assist in food delivery, cleaning until March 25. To stay up-to-date on all things coronavirus, follow our continued live coverage. President Donald Trump continued to downplay the deadly coronavirus virus and its pervasive spread throughout the US. Responding to reporters Tuesday after a meeting with members of the coronavirus task force, Trump told reporters the virus \u201cwill go away.\u201d \u201cJust stay calm,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s really working out. And a lot of good things are going to happen.\u201d What those \u201cthings\u201d are remains to be seen. When asked about getting tested himself, Trump insisted there\u2019s no need, despite multiple interactions for those who may have been exposed to the virus. From CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale: Meanwhile, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has confirmed he tested negative for the virus. Gaetz previously self-quarantined over concerns that he was in close contact in the same period with a known carrier. He had close contact with Donald Trump shortly after. Reporting from Michigan, here\u2019s another update as voters take to the polls: In Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit with the world\u2019s largest Lebanese population outside of Lebanon, Hussein, a Lebanese immigrant, said he voted for Sanders. \u201cHe\u2019s more for the people, especially the poor people and the middle class people,\u201d Hussein said. \u201cAnd the way that he explains himself to the public \u2013 I like his explanations.\u201d Biden, by contrast, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have it together\u201d, Hussein said, noting the former vice president\u2019s regular gaffes and alleged cognitive decline. Four years ago, Hussein didn\u2019t vote for Sanders. What changed since 2016? \u201cTrump,\u201d Hussein said, adding that he believes Sanders is more likely to beat the president than Biden. Sanders has wide support among Dearborn\u2019s Muslim population, which has built a thriving middle class community here. Hussein said he thinks Sanders can pull it off despite the polling if those in his base \u2013 like Dearborn\u2019s Muslim residents \u2013 turn out en force. While there weren\u2019t any lines at a Dearborn polling station early Tuesday afternoon, a steady stream of voters stopped in to cast ballots. Missouri: why the \u2018show me\u2019 state matters for the Democratic primary race Don\u2019t sleep on Missouri! As the democrats take to the polls for the state\u2019s primary today, many analysts might overlook this long-ago swing state as an automatic win for former vice-president Joe Biden. But Missouri is a bastion of Democratic voting blocs that can rally behind either Biden or Vermont senator Bernie Sanders: farmers, factory workers, elder black moderates, young progressive activists, conservative evangelicals ... take your pick. While those distinctions typically only play into the general election, an increasingly tense showdown between supporters of moderate Biden and progressive Sanders could make Missouri more competitive than most analysts predict. The one debate even more tense: whether it\u2019s pronounced Missouree or Missourah. Ask that and be prepared for a completely different type of fight. Here are two ways Missouri is a unique primary to watch. Region: \u201cIs it the midwest, or south?\u201d Both! Or neither, depending on who you ask. Located nearly dead center of the continental US, Missouri boasts a unique state culture that, at times, can reflect deep conservative attitudes of the south, while in other areas more reminiscent of the industrial rust belt. For the 2016 general election, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten broke down why the \u2018show me\u2019 state is such an important political outlier: Missouri was a key swing state for much of the 20th century. In a country where political divisions have historically been sewn along geographic lines, Missouri includes a bit of a few regions. And political nerds might remember that it voted for the winner in every presidential election from 1904 through 2004, with the exception of 1956, when it voted for Adlai Stevenson. Race Matters: Six years ago the state was rocked by the shooting death of 18 year-old Mike Brown in Ferguson, igniting a firestorm of protests the lead to the founding of Black Lives Matter, and countless subsequent social justice movements. Neighboring St Louis is currently embroiled in a racial scandal of its own. In January, a top prosecutor filed a federal lawsuit against the city and its police union for conspiracy to thwart her racial justice reforms, citing a nearly 150-year-old law used to combat the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group. Missouri, along with Mississippi, are two states voting today that have significant black populations, representing nearly one-fifth and three-fourths of the Democratic electorate, respectively. As most pundits predict, whoever wins the black vote, a near demographic split between older moderates and young progressives, may that momentum into the convention in July. Traffic was light at a polling station on Detroit\u2019s east side where no one showed up for at least 10 minutes. The station is in one of the city\u2019s poorest neighborhoods and is likely near 100% African American. That doesn\u2019t bode well for Democrats. The low turnout among black voters in Detroit was a big part of why Hillary Clinton lost in the primary and general. However, several miles away, still on Detroit\u2019s east side, a steady number of voters stopped in a precinct in another economically struggling neighborhood. The station is within sight of about 10 vacant homes. Charles, a young African American voter, said he cast his ballot for Bernie Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a president that\u2019s going to do the things he\u2019s going to do \u2013 he\u2019s something different,\u201d Charles said. \u201cJoe Biden just seems like the Democratic version of Donald Trump. You know, what do we have to lose?\u201d Charles said he sees the vote in Detroit breaking down along generational lines. His older friends and family support Biden because he was Obama\u2019s vice-president and they know and trust him. His younger friends and family support Sanders. Several other older voters who stopped in the station ahead of Charles said they planned to vote for Biden, but declined to discuss why. Though he cast his ballot for Sanders, Charles doesn\u2019t believe the progressive candidate is better suited than Biden to beat Trump. He said he isn\u2019t sure about who would win in a match up between Trump and Sanders, but added: \u201cI\u2019m going to do my part. Anything can happen.\u201d Are there enough Sanders supporters in Detroit doing their part for the Vermont senator to repeat his 2016 upset of Clinton? Charles said he believes there are. \u201cHe won it the last time, so I think he\u2019s going to get a good turnout this time around,\u201d he said. Donald Trump retweeted a false claim blaming Barack Obama for delays during the swine flu epidemic Mark Meadows joined the growing list of CPAC attendees in self-quarantine A coronavirus scare temporarily closed Washington HQ of Securities and Exchange Commission Joe Biden told a Detroit autoworker that he\u2019s \u201cfull of shit.\u201d Donald Trump awarded another closed friend with a presidential honor Enjoy the midday reprieve. We\u2019ll have updates from primaries and caucuses across the country and more news after the break. Stay tuned. Donald Trump has paid tribute to Jack Keane, the retired general whom he will today award the presidential medal of freedom \u2013 the highest US honour which Trump recently gave to the rightwing shock jock Rush Limbaugh and will soon bestow upon two leading golfers. Retweeting Keane\u2019s thoughts on the ceremony, Trump said the honour was \u201cwell deserved\u201d. Keane and Trump go back a long way, the four-star general and Fox News analyst, another New Yorker, having twice turned down offers to be Trump\u2019s secretary of defense but having served as an informal adviser. Keane is a named source for Trump and his Generals, a recent book by Peter Bergen, who writes that the general became \u201calmost a shadow national security adviser\u201d to Trump at a time when the president was notably failing to get on with HR McMaster, the general who officially filled that role. Bergen, a CNN analyst, recounts Keane telling Trump one way to signal to North Korea he was serious about possible military action over its nuclear weapons programme would be \u201cto stop sending military families to South Korea\u201d. Trump, Bergen writes, subsequently ordered an evacuation of US civilians, sending official aides into a panic. The order never went through. Bergen also writes that Keane has not only offered Trump only positive advice. Keane blasted Trump\u2019s infamous summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July 2018 as \u201cstunning and disapponting\u201d; supported the maintenance of a small US force in Afghanistan, against the president\u2019s wishes; and stood against Trump\u2019s urge to pull US troops out of Syria. Keane seems to have been of more use to Trump than another retired general the president has liked to have around. Keith Kellogg joined the national security council but, according to Bergen, was found to be \u201clazy, uninformed and not smart\u201d, more likely to be found taking a nap or watching Fox News than doing any foreign policy work. Should Trump read Bergen\u2019s book, which would admittedly seem unlikely, he might not like one paragraph in particular: \u201cIn the end,\u201d Bergen writes, \u201cthe real \u2018Deep State\u2019 \u2013 retired senior generals such as Keane and officials at the Pentagon and state department \u2013 managed to keep many hundreds of American soldiers in Syria.\u201d The Deep State theory holds that unelected officials are working in concert to thwart Trump\u2019s agenda. Aides to the president and supporters in the media regularly refer to it and it is reportedly one motivation for an attempted political purgeof the federal government. As another author, James B Stewart, recently wrote, former White House counsellor and Trump campaign chief Steve Bannon, a prime mover in the invention and propagation of the Deep State line, says it is \u201ca conspiracy theory for nut cases\u201d. During a visit to an auto plant, currently under construction in Detroit, Joe Biden rejected a worker\u2019s claim that the Democratic presidential hopeful is \u201cactively trying to end [the country\u2019s] second amendment right\u201d. In a sharp retort, Biden told the worker: \u201cYou\u2019re full of shit.\u201d \u201cI support the second amendment,\u201d Biden added. After a bit of back and forth, the plant worker was then jeered and dismissed by colleagues, who told him let it go. Not before the vice president could tell the man not to \u201cbe such a horse\u2019s ass\u201d, of course. \u201c#BidensCognitiveDecline\u201d: opponents take aim at Biden\u2019s vitality It the latest (perhaps ageist/ableist) attempt to thwart Joe Biden\u2019s surging poll numbers and mounting endorsements, both progressives and Republicans are ramping up their criticism of the democratic frontrunner\u2019s cognition. On Twitter, some progressives, including former 2016 third-party candidate Jill Stein took aim at the former vice-president\u2019s many gaffes. Stein went as far as to question why Biden\u2019s team limits his availability and scheduling. The attacks come from all sides as the Trump campaign and RNC ramped up their own mockery of Biden. From Politico: Trump walked the donors through a list of Biden\u2019s recent verbal stumbles, such as his recent declaration that he was running for Senate and his assertion that 150 million Americans had been killed by gun violence since 2007. Trump questioned whether the former vice president had the mental stamina to sustain the rigors of a general election campaign. The president\u2019s son, Donald Trump, Jr. later joined in the ridicule with an offensive* tweet alluding to Biden possibly having Alzheimers or dementia. *Side note: As someone whose parent-in-law just passed away from a 10-year-battle, it\u2019s fair to assume that Biden likely doesn\u2019t have the disease. At 77, a person with dementia/Alzheimers would most likely have already begun losing motor functions. Supporters don\u2019t appear concerned, however. Biden continues to do well among early caucuses and primaries and is expected to increase his delegate lead after tonight\u2019s races. Andrew Cuomo criticized by justice groups for sanitizers made with prison labor New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, is getting pushback for the state\u2019s plan to produce more than 100,000 hand sanitizers in response the coronavirus update. Organizations including Citizen Action of New York, Release Ageing People in Prison Campaign, and the Parole Preparation Project excoriated the governor for what they called a treatment of \u201cincarcerated people with complete disdain\u201d. \u201cWe are disgusted at Governor Cuomo\u2019s decision to exploit prison labor to push back the imminent public health crisis presented by Covid-19 while doing absolutely nothing for incarcerated people across the state,\u201d the groups said in a joint statement released late Monday. The governor announced in a press conference Monday that the production of the hand sanitizer is in response to price gauging from major producers. New York state is the country\u2019s current center of the novel coronavirus, with more than 100 confirmed cases and 4,000 people under strict quarantine. The groups also noted that while prisoners will manufacture the hand sanitizer, it would likely be considered contraband for incarcerated people to use. Election officials across Washington are instructing staff to wash their hands frequently and cough into tissues as they work to limit the spread of coronavirus in the state at the epicenter of the US outbreak, Hallie Golden reports from Seattle. Anyone handling ballots is being told to wear gloves and masks too, and voters have been warned not to lick the envelopes on their postal ballots. The state is holding its primary elections on Tuesday, and is the second most delegate-rich state at stake. Washington now votes by mail for the Democratic primary instead of holding a caucus, which Tina Podlodowski, the chair of the Washington state Democrats, said is extremely positive given the outbreak, and should help prevent disruption. \u201cFolks don\u2019t have to worry,\u201d she said. \u201cFolks who are older don\u2019t have to worry, they don\u2019t have to be waiting in line for hours and hours.\u201d She said they have already seen good voter turnout. As of Monday, 1.5 million people had voted, which is already higher than the 2016 Republican primary. For Republicans, Donald Trump, who does not face any serious challengers, is the only candidate to appear on the party\u2019s primary ballot. For Democrats, however, the primary is a crucial test of support for the two frontrunners, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, though other candidates who have dropped out in recent days, such as the progressive senator Elizabeth Warren, still remain on the ballot. Kim Wyman, secretary of state of Washington, told the Guardian that if the outbreak does suddenly take a turn on Tuesday and post offices have to close or huge numbers of election staff get sick, officials are ready to respond accordingly by working together. For example, she said, if a county auditor\u2019s office were to get shut down because an employee is diagnosed with coronavirus, that would impact voting and results being released. In response, officials may need to contact the national guard to have a temporary facility set up or have everyone move to a satellite space at a separate office. Wyman said it\u2019s important to remember that ballot processing and other work will continue for the next 10 days. So staff will need to be prepared to respond to any potential impacts of coronavirus on counting long after Tuesday. Good morning! Kenya Evelyn here taking over the live blog and right at the top: it\u2019s all about primaries and caucuses in Mississippi, Missouri, Idaho, Michigan and Washington as former US vice-president Joe Biden looks to repeat his strong showing Super Tuesday. We\u2019re also covering the latest in Washington as the Trump administration faces increasing backlash for its response to the coronavirus. Stay tuned as we update you throughout the day. AP are reporting that Securities and Exchange Commission employees have been told to work remotely for the foreseeable future after a coronavirus scare at the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters. The agency, which oversees the financial markets, said it was informed Monday afternoon that a headquarters employee had received medical treatment for respiratory symptoms earlier in the day. The employee, who was not identified, was informed by a doctor that they may have been infected with the coronavirus and was referred for testing, the SEC said in a statement. Among other precautions, the agency \u201cis encouraging headquarters employees to telework until further guidance,\u201d it said. The SEC is the first major federal agency to employ teleworking in an effort to contain the virus\u2019 spread. It said the scattering of headquarters employees to work from their homes or other remote locations will not affect operations. \u201cEven with increased telework, the SEC remains able and committed to fully executing its mission on behalf of investors, including monitoring market function and working closely with other regulators and market participants,\u201d said the agency. Appealing to individual demographics of voters has been an increasingly important part of election strategy over the last couple of decades as black and Latino voters begin to make up larger proportions of the voter base in key battleground areas. Holly Otterbein and Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez have been looking at what is described as a Sanders\u2019 \u201cblind spot\u201d for Politico: No Democrat has won the party\u2019s presidential nomination in the last 30 years without the support of a majority of black voters. And Bernie Sanders won\u2019t either unless he figures out how to win over voters like Travis Gilbert\u2019s mom, Elaine. They conclude that \u201cJust as in 2016, Sanders\u2019 inability to secure the backing of most African-American voters \u2014 particularly those who are middle-aged and older \u2014 is suffocating his campaign.\u201d Read it here - Politico: \u2018There\u2019s a blind spot\u2019: Sanders reboots black voter outreach For another view of how the Democrats are - or aren\u2019t - reaching out to the Elaines of 2020, and how Donald Trump is taking advantage of that, here\u2019s Steve Phillips: It may be tempting to dismiss Trump\u2019s efforts to make inroads into a community that regularly, overwhelmingly rejects Republicans; that, however, misses the real goal of Trump\u2019s strategy. Its objective is not to win majority support, but rather to bring down the amount of black support for Democrats just enough to tip a close contest. Phillips, the host of the Democracy in Color podcast, has written for us about how Trump works harder than the Democrats to reach black voters. A chorus of hate being leveled at the president is nearing a crescendo as Democrats blame him and only him for a virus that originated halfway around the world. This is yet another attempt to impeach the president and sadly it seems they care very little for any of the destruction they are leaving in their wake. Losses in the stock market, all of this, unfortunately just part of the political casualties for them. Strong words from Fox Business host Trish Regan last night, as my colleague Martin Pengelly in New York reports. Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley has written for us about what the G7 and G20 economies needs to do to combat economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak. We are expecting to hear details on Donald Trump\u2019s plans today. Eichengreen says: Fed chair Jerome Powell can\u2019t reopen factories shuttered by quarantine, whatever Donald Trump may think. Likewise, monetary policy will not get shoppers back to the malls or travelers back onto airplanes, insofar as their concerns centre on safety, not cost. Rate cuts can\u2019t hurt, given that inflation, already subdued, is headed downward; but not much real economic stimulus should be expected of them. Yesterday Trump said his administration and Congress would be \u201cdiscussing a possible payroll tax cut or relief, substantial relief, very substantial relief, thats big, thats a big number. We\u2019re also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so that they can be in a position where they\u2019re not going to ever miss a paycheck.\u201d Read Eichengreen\u2019s argument here - Fighting coronavirus\u2019s economic effects will take more than interest rate cuts Incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is among six US lawmakers now in self-quarantine after contact with people carrying the coronavirus. Republicans Meadows, Ted Cruz, Paul Gosar, Doug Collins and Matt Gaetz are all believed to have come into contact with an infected person while attending CPAC last week. Trump named Meadows his new chief of staff on Friday evening, replacing Mick Mulvaney. Last night Ben Schreckinger wrote for Politico about the criticism CPAC\u2019s organisers have been receiving for the way they have handled the situation. VIPs have been notified directly even to be told they did not interact with the infected man, while ordinary rank-and-file attendees have by and large been left to wonder, receiving only vaguer information in mass emails. Meanwhile, critics have noted the irony of prominent officials downplaying the outbreak even as the disease may silently have been spreading among the Trump administration\u2019s own members and supporters. One of those affected, Gaetz, was pictured last week wearing a gas mark in what was widely perceived to be a dig at the way media were reporting the extent of the threat of the virus. Gaetz was also on a flight yesterday with the president. Separately, Democrat Julia Brownley of California is said to have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, and has accordingly closed her Washington office. The mechanics of voting in November always get a lot of attention \u2013 long lines can make it seem like more of a chore than a democratic opportunity. A new campaign is launching, USA Today reports, to make Vote Early Day on 24 October an event that can increase voter participation, especially among young people. Vote Early Day was started by MTV, and has more than 60 partners on board to help promote it. Chris McCarthy, president of ViacomCBS\u2019 Entertainment &amp; Youth Brands, told USA Today that young voters are often ignored by politicians. \u201cIt was really important for us to begin to build something that ritualizes this around their existing habits and takes advantage of social media so that they feel they can have a moment celebrated with their friends,\u201d he said. Figures suggest that in the 2016 election nearly 40% of people either voted early, absentee voted or voted by mail. Sanders is expected to do well in Idaho and North Dakota, both states with largely white and rural populations, and both states he won in 2016 against Clinton. He is also polling high in Washington state, the last primary to close on Tuesday. But like California, most of Washington votes by mail, so the results may not be known for some time. So writes Caitlin Conant for CBS News, in an overview of what is at stake today in the six primary contests between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Technically Tulsi Gabbard is also still running, but she is unlikely to secure enough votes anywhere to claim delegates. It is Michigan that offers the most delegates today - 125 - and it is the state that many people feel Sanders has to win in order to continue to have a serious path to winning the nomination. It could be a tough ask. Conant reports that \u201cA new poll from Monmouth University released on Monday showed Biden with a commanding lead over Sanders. Fifty-one percent of likely Democratic primary voters said they planned to support Biden compared to 36% for Sanders.\u201d Read it here - CBS News: What to know about Tuesday\u2019s primaries in 6 states And Donald Trump is up and tweeting, and its a familiar refrain. He\u2019s just retweeted Charlie Kirk comparing the current president\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak with how president Barack Obama responded to swine flu in 2009. This is a claim that has already been rated as false by Politifact. Their verdict: \u201cIn October 2009, after more than 1,000 people in the United States had died of swine flu, also known as H1N1, Obama declared a national emergency. But six months earlier, his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. At that point, no deaths in the United States had occurred.\u201d With the Democratic nomination down to a two-horse race between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, it has become easier for pollsters to try and tease out what that might mean for November. Newsweek have had a look at what the latest polling figures say about the potential match-ups. This paragraph gets to the nub of the tactical battle currently going on for the nomination: Biden and many moderate, vulnerable members of Congress say Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, would hurt down-ballot Democrats. Sanders and his supporters have suggested gaffs and inaccurate claims by the former vice president call into question his mental fitness and makes him susceptible to attacks from Trump and Republicans. What the polling numbers show overall though, is that although Biden might have a slight edge over Sanders in the head-to-head against Trump, November currently looks like it is going to be a close call. Read it here - Newsweek: What the polls say about a Donald Trump vs Bernie Sanders election \u201cRight now we\u2019re in the spaghetti-on-the-wall phase of this conversation\u201d is a colourful way to put, but that\u2019s what David French, senior vice president of government relations at the National Retail Federation has told Bloomberg about the kind of help businesses are looking for from the federal government. There\u2019s a good breakdown here of some of the measures that industry sectors are looking at, whether it is tax breaks, credit leniency for small and medium-size businesses, or grants to states and municipalities to support tourism. Read it here - Bloomberg: Business groups to press Trump for virus response to curb damage We are expecting more today from the Trump administration on their economic package to help the country cope with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Tax breaks and small loans might be part of the measures. They aren\u2019t going to any help for some people though. Sam Levin has been out for us in Los Angeles looking at the impact the outbreak could have on homeless communities. Eve Garrow, the homelessness policy analyst with the ACLU of Southern California, told him: You can tell people to stay home, but the shelters are people\u2019s homes and it\u2019s a dangerous place to be. We have many older adults with compromised immune systems living in the shelters, sharing living spaces, restrooms, showers and eating areas. It\u2019s almost impossible to think this wouldn\u2019t create a reservoir for the transmission of highly infectious viruses. Read it here - \u2018We\u2019re not prepared\u2019: coronavirus could devastate homeless communities The Associated Press have been having a look at what they describe as the \u201cquirk\u201d of the math in today\u2019s races that make this Tuesday more of a chance to catch up or pull away than any other day of primary and caucus battles. As the AP explains it, most delegates awarded on Tuesday will be won based on how the candidates perform in individual congressional districts. Think of each district as holding a bucket of delegates. There are also two buckets of delegates in each state awarded based on the overall statewide vote. On Tuesday, that makes for 51 buckets of delegates across the six states. Party rules say each viable candidate wins a proportion of the delegates in each bucket based on their share of the votes cast for the viable candidates in that bucket. Viable means they have past a 15% support threshold - almost certainly completely putting Tulsi Gabbard out of the equation. Buckets that have an odd number of delegates are impossible to split evenly, meaning either Sanders or Biden is guaranteed to win at least one more than the other. Say, for example, there are seven delegates in a bucket, and Sanders gets 51% and Biden gets 49% of the viable votes. In delegates, that\u2019s 3.57 to 3.43 a difference of just 0.14 delegates. But thanks to rounding, Sanders gets four and Biden gets three. If it was an even bucket with six delegates at play, they\u2019d get three each. Nearly two-thirds of the 352 delegates at stake on Tuesday are in buckets with an odd number of delegates more than on any other night with more than one primary. Getting narrowly ahead in a tight race in those odd buckets is much more rewarding in terms of delegates. Easy, eh? Is it all over for Bernie Sanders if Joe Biden wins in Michigan? That\u2019s the key question that Chris Cillizza, CNN editor-at-large, has been asking this morning. His reasoning: Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Michigan primary. The electorate - 70%+ white and more than one-third white non-college-educated - should favor Sanders\u2019 demonstrated base of support. If he can\u2019t get enough of them out to beat Biden today, Cillizza says: \u201cSanders\u2019 fundraising ability and the loyalty of his core supporters mean he can stay in the race as long as he wants. But hanging on is very different from having a chance to win.\u201d Read it here - CNN: If Biden wins Michigan, is it all over? Good morning, it\u2019s not Super Tuesday, but it could be a super important Tuesday, as six states \u2013 including Michigan \u2013 hold their primaries. Millions get to vote, and we are set to discover whether Bernie Sanders can haul himself closer to Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination. It is the first time it has been a straight two-horse race between them. Sanders needs to win Michigan, which he did sensationally in 2016, but recent polling suggests Biden is firmly ahead. Washington, Missouri, Mississippi, Idaho and North Dakota are also going to the polls. Here\u2019s our scene-setter for the day from Daniel Strauss in Washington DC: Both Sanders \u2013 fresh from being endorsed by rocker Neil Young \u2013 and Biden will be out campaigning in Ohio, which votes next Tuesday. It\u2019s going to be a super important day for the administration on the coronavirus too. After the turmoil of yesterday, world markets seem to have rallied. Yesterday the White House promised that testing for the virus would ramp up quickly, and Trump said his administration would ask Congress to pass payroll tax relief and other quick measures to mitigate the economic fall-out. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) director, Dr Robert Redfield, testifies to Congress this morning. Federal health officials testify on the coronavirus before the House oversight committee this afternoon, and members of the coronavirus taskforce will hold a press briefing at the White House at 5.30pm. One thing is for sure, Trump probably won\u2019t want to rewatch this clip of Bernie Sanders provoking laughter about the president\u2019s supposed natural ability to understand the coronavirus.",
