      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has fired a shot across the bows of \u201cbig tech\u201d companies by signing an executive order that aims to narrow their protections from liability over the content posted on their services. The move came as the US president stepped up his attacks against social media giants after Twitter factchecked him for the first time over a false assertion that mail-in voting leads to widespread voter fraud. However, critics said it was the president\u2019s latest effort to spur controversy and create a distraction as the country passed the grim milestone of 101,000 deaths from Covid-19. The Trump administration has faced widespread accusations that it has mishandled the crisis. \u201cCurrently, social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they are a neutral platform, which they are not,\u201d the US president said in the Oval Office on Thursday. \u201cWe are fed up with it. It is unfair, and it\u2019s been very unfair.\u201d Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies currently enjoy broad immunity from civil lawsuits stemming from what users post because they are treated as \u201cplatforms\u201d rather than \u201cpublishers\u201d. Trump\u2019s executive order is designed to pressure regulators, including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, to come up with new rules that would curtail that immunity. It is likely to face legal challenges. As he prepared to sign the order, the president added: \u201cThey\u2019ve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences. \u201cThere is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction.\u201d Twitter responded by calling the executive order a \u201creactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law\u201d . \u201c#Section230 protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it\u2019s underpinned by democratic values,\u201d the company said in a tweet. \u201cAttempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and internet freedoms. The move was welcomed by observers who argue that Facebook and Twitter should be held responsible for their content and subject to the same laws as the New York Times and other mainstream outlets. But many in the business and technology sectors argue the order could curb freedom of speech on the internet and it conflicts with existing law \u2013 which only Congress, not the president \u2013 can change. Matt Schruers, the president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, told the Associated Press: \u201cThe irony that is lost here is that if these protections were to go away social media services would be far more aggressive in moderating content and terminating accounts.

According to doctors and officials, the peak began on 6 May, but the curve is showing no signs of flattening, and cases are still doubling every week.</p> <p>With state-run hospitals quickly running out of beds and keeping symptomatic patients waiting, the Mumbai municipal corporation has raced to convert a series of stadiums and office complexes into coronavirus wards and quarantine centres.</p> <p>A makeshift hospital with 1,000 beds, including intensive care facilities, was built in the city\u2019s business district, the Bandra Kurla Complex. The National Sports Club of India stadium is being converted into a 600-bed quarantine and ICU facility, while the Mumbai planetarium will house 300 beds and the Nehru science centre will be made into a quarantine facility for those living in slums. Private hospitals have also been ordered to give over dozens of their beds for Covid-19 patients.</p> <p>A Mumbai municipal corporation spokesperson, Vijay Khabale, denied that coronavirus patients were being denied beds. \u201cThere are enough beds but there is a lack of coordination with other agencies, which is why there are these reports. The present situation is that we have more than enough beds and quarantine facilities.\u201d</p> <p>Khabale said that all the new facilities would be completed within the week, but he was optimistic they would not need to be used at full capacity. \u201cWe are expecting that within a day or two that the cases will begin to flatten and then begin to decrease,\u201d he insisted, adding: \u201cWe have it under control.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a849c71933dc1588b71109bf18bb5d558ad57f0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a849c71933dc1588b71109bf18bb5d558ad57f0a/0_0_4160_2496/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurses light candles at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Kochi to mark international nurses day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurses light candles at Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Kochi to mark international nurses day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arun Sankar/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, many doctors fear that the worse is still to come. India has been under one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns since 24 March, but it has only slowed down the spread of the virus, rather than flattening the curve of cases. India ranks 4th in the world for new cases recorded each day, and with lockdown due to be loosened at the end of this week there are fears it will prompt a spike in infection rates, for which the hospitals are not prepared. India has had 158,000 reported cases.</p> <p>To complicate matters further, the beginning of June will bring the monsoon and the outbreaks of dengue fever, malaria and leptospirosis, which already inundate hospitals on an annual basis. Last year India officially reported more than 67,000 cases of dengue, though the real figure is thought to be much higher.</p> <p>According to the human rights activist Abraham Mathai, who runs the All India Nurses Association, dozens of patients with non-Covid related diseases are dying because they are being denied access to treatment, with some Mumbai hospitals ordered to only take in Covid-19 patients. Last week, 15-year-old Pawan Maddibona died after six hospitals refused to give him dialysis treatment for his kidneys.</p> <p>\u201cNon-Covid patients have a right to live, they have a right to get their treatments,\u201d said Mathai. \u201cThere has to be some kind of balanced policies so non-Covid patients don\u2019t suffer.\u201d</p> <p>Shetty from Guru Nanak hospital said his main fear was the as-yet unknown combination of coronavirus with the monsoon diseases, something other countries further through the pandemic had not been forced to face. \u201cIt will be a whole worrying new realm,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is we will need a lot of beds to cope.\u201d</p>",

According to doctors and officials, the peak began on 6 May, but the curve is showing no signs of flattening, and cases are still doubling every week. With state-run hospitals quickly running out of beds and keeping symptomatic patients waiting, the Mumbai municipal corporation has raced to convert a series of stadiums and office complexes into coronavirus wards and quarantine centres. A makeshift hospital with 1,000 beds, including intensive care facilities, was built in the city\u2019s business district, the Bandra Kurla Complex. The National Sports Club of India stadium is being converted into a 600-bed quarantine and ICU facility, while the Mumbai planetarium will house 300 beds and the Nehru science centre will be made into a quarantine facility for those living in slums. Private hospitals have also been ordered to give over dozens of their beds for Covid-19 patients. A Mumbai municipal corporation spokesperson, Vijay Khabale, denied that coronavirus patients were being denied beds. \u201cThere are enough beds but there is a lack of coordination with other agencies, which is why there are these reports. The present situation is that we have more than enough beds and quarantine facilities.\u201d Khabale said that all the new facilities would be completed within the week, but he was optimistic they would not need to be used at full capacity. \u201cWe are expecting that within a day or two that the cases will begin to flatten and then begin to decrease,\u201d he insisted, adding: \u201cWe have it under control.\u201d However, many doctors fear that the worse is still to come. India has been under one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns since 24 March, but it has only slowed down the spread of the virus, rather than flattening the curve of cases. India ranks 4th in the world for new cases recorded each day, and with lockdown due to be loosened at the end of this week there are fears it will prompt a spike in infection rates, for which the hospitals are not prepared. India has had 158,000 reported cases. To complicate matters further, the beginning of June will bring the monsoon and the outbreaks of dengue fever, malaria and leptospirosis, which already inundate hospitals on an annual basis. Last year India officially reported more than 67,000 cases of dengue, though the real figure is thought to be much higher. According to the human rights activist Abraham Mathai, who runs the All India Nurses Association, dozens of patients with non-Covid related diseases are dying because they are being denied access to treatment, with some Mumbai hospitals ordered to only take in Covid-19 patients. Last week, 15-year-old Pawan Maddibona died after six hospitals refused to give him dialysis treatment for his kidneys. \u201cNon-Covid patients have a right to live, they have a right to get their treatments,\u201d said Mathai. \u201cThere has to be some kind of balanced policies so non-Covid patients don\u2019t suffer.\u201d Shetty from Guru Nanak hospital said his main fear was the as-yet unknown combination of coronavirus with the monsoon diseases, something other countries further through the pandemic had not been forced to face. \u201cIt will be a whole worrying new realm,\u201d he said. \u201cMy guess is we will need a lot of beds to cope.\u201d",

An investigation by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) into how the coronavirus crisis impacts daily life with the concentration of work, school and leisure in people\u2019s homes, concluded that while all family members had generally benefited from less time pressures, the main responsibility for organising everything from routines to social contacts had fallen to women. \u201cWomen seem to be doing much more than men to manage the amalgamation of the different areas of life at home,\u201d said Theun Pieter van Tienoven, a sociologist at the VUB, summarising the findings of the study drawing on the daily diaries kept by 661 Belgians. \u201cThe lockdown therefore reinforces gender inequality in relative terms,\u201d he added. As lockdowns ease across Europe, new pressures on mothers are now emerging as employers start demanding that their workers return to their office desks, even though schools and nurseries have returned only in part or often not at all. \u201cThe messages I\u2019m getting are desperate,\u201d Baena, the Spanish campaigner, said. \u201cThe objective right now is survival.\u201d Some women, she said, have guiltily resorted to asking elderly parents to resume their childcare duties, despite the health risks involved, while others have been forced to leave children on their own at home. Many women had been left with little option but to quit their jobs or take leave without pay. \u201cAll the advances we made in terms of equality and now so many women are going to end up back in their homes,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be the big losers in this crisis.\u201d Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels",

      "body": "<p>On 20 January, a 64-year-old woman visited Irven Mussi, a GP in Milan, suffering from flu-like symptoms that wouldn\u2019t let up.

By comparison, just next door in Piedmont and Veneto, the disease has killed 3,838 and 1,898 people, respectively, as of Thursday. Even as the number of deaths and infections subside, Lombardy still glaringly stands out from the other 19 Italian regions in the daily figures. For this reason, it will probably have to keep its borders closed as the rest of the country opens up for inter-regional travel from 3 June.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/italy_cases_by_region/giv-390271Mhd0Cbq3IW/\" data-alt=\"Italy covid cases by region\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/italy_cases_by_region/giv-390271Mhd0Cbq3IW/\">Italy covid cases by region</a> \n</figure> \n<p>But the question of why the virus has been so lethal in Italy\u2019s richest region while leaving others relatively unscathed is yet to yield any concrete answers. Other theories include Lombardy\u2019s close trade ties with China and the rest of the world, population density (the region has the largest number of residents in Italy), and high levels of pollution.</p> \n<p>However, Michele Usuelli, a doctor and regional councillor for the small, leftwing party, Pi\u00f9 Europa, pins much of the blame on politics and healthcare mismanagement. He said Lombardy\u2019s fate began to be charted out in the late 1990s when the Italian government decentralised healthcare, giving regions more autonomy.</p> \n<p>At the same time, the privatisation of healthcare became more prevalent. Although other regions continued to mostly maintain the public health system, a succession of Lombardy governors, including Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia between 1995 and 2013, and Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League since then, allowed the private and public systems to compete for funds based on efficiency.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Italy\" data-alt=\"Johns Hopkins Italy coronavirus deaths graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Italy\">Johns Hopkins Italy coronavirus deaths graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Even though Lombardy developed one of the most enviable healthcare systems in Italy, the strategy left private firms free to invest in areas of care that made more money, inevitably leading to a reduction of beds in the public system and leaving the region less equipped to meet all types of health needs.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor example, over the last 25 years there has been a reduction in the number of hospital departments dealing with infectious diseases,\u201d said Usuelli. \u201cThere has also been a fall in the number of doctors entering specialist schools for infectious diseases.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With the enormity of what the region has endured in recent months starting to sink in, anger has been mounting towards the League\u2019s regional president, Attilio Fontana, so much so he said he now needed a police escort. Fontana and Giulio Gallera, Lombardy\u2019s health councillor, are to be questioned by prosecutors in Bergamo, the Italian province worst affected by the virus, amid an investigation into criminal negligence that focuses in particular on the failure to immediately close a hospital where an outbreak occurred and care home deaths.</p> \n<p>A commission led by Patrizia Baffi, a councillor with an opposition party, Italia Viva, has been established to scrutinise what went wrong in Lombardy. Usuelli said a crucial area that the commission must consider is failure to pick up on early warnings from GPs.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor sure, some GPs tried to signal this strange pneumonia to the relevant authorities, so either there was an interruption in communication or nobody cared,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/italy-lockdown-mental-health-psychologists-coronavirus\">Italy's lockdown has taken heavy toll on mental health, say psychologists</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The region\u2019s response to the outbreak offers some additional insight. Codogno was immediately quarantined along with nine other nearby towns after the sudden outbreak. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo\">V\u00f2 Euganeo</a>, a town in Veneto where the first person in Italy died of Covid-19, was also quarantined. But unlike Lombardy, Veneto quickly controlled the contagion by mass testing its population.</p> \n<p>Lombardy authorities also delayed closing Bergamo, partly because they were under pressure by business associations to keep things going. \u201cAcross Lombardy, production never completely stopped,\u201d said Arnaldo Caruso, a professor at Brescia University and president of the Italian Society for Virology. \u201cPeople continued to work during the lockdown and without all the precautions that came later.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Champions League football match in Milan on 19 February attended by 40,000 Atalanta fans from Bergamo and the transfer of hospital patients to care homes in order to alleviate the pressure on wards were also believed to have contributed to the high death and contagion rate.</p> \n<p>Some studies have pointed to Lombardy\u2019s high pollution. However, research comparing pollution levels in Bergamo and Brescia, another badly hit Lombardy province, with the closely located Verona, a city in Veneto, between the beginning of December and end of February, paints a different picture.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were surprised to find that PM10 was more or less the same in Brescia and Verona, yet Verona got off lightly,\u201d said Gianenrico Senna, the president of the Italian Society of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC), who led the research. \u201cLevels in Bergamo were also lower than in Verona.\u201d</p> \n<p>Senna\u2019s team identified population density as a more plausible explanation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn Bergamo there are more or less 300 people for every square kilometre, for Brescia it\u2019s 200 and for Verona it\u2019s 100,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seemed to make the difference between areas that are closely located.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022&nbsp;The sub-heading of this article was amended on 31 May 2020 because an earlier version referred to Lombardy as a \u201cprovince\u201d of Italy whereas it is a region.</p>",

Coronavirus has killed almost 16,000 people in Lombardy and infected more than 87,000 \u2013 the highest number per capita in Italy. By comparison, just next door in Piedmont and Veneto, the disease has killed 3,838 and 1,898 people, respectively, as of Thursday. Even as the number of deaths and infections subside, Lombardy still glaringly stands out from the other 19 Italian regions in the daily figures. For this reason, it will probably have to keep its borders closed as the rest of the country opens up for inter-regional travel from 3 June. But the question of why the virus has been so lethal in Italy\u2019s richest region while leaving others relatively unscathed is yet to yield any concrete answers. Other theories include Lombardy\u2019s close trade ties with China and the rest of the world, population density (the region has the largest number of residents in Italy), and high levels of pollution. However, Michele Usuelli, a doctor and regional councillor for the small, leftwing party, Pi\u00f9 Europa, pins much of the blame on politics and healthcare mismanagement. He said Lombardy\u2019s fate began to be charted out in the late 1990s when the Italian government decentralised healthcare, giving regions more autonomy. At the same time, the privatisation of healthcare became more prevalent. Although other regions continued to mostly maintain the public health system, a succession of Lombardy governors, including Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s Forza Italia between 1995 and 2013, and Matteo Salvini\u2019s far-right League since then, allowed the private and public systems to compete for funds based on efficiency. Even though Lombardy developed one of the most enviable healthcare systems in Italy, the strategy left private firms free to invest in areas of care that made more money, inevitably leading to a reduction of beds in the public system and leaving the region less equipped to meet all types of health needs. \u201cFor example, over the last 25 years there has been a reduction in the number of hospital departments dealing with infectious diseases,\u201d said Usuelli. \u201cThere has also been a fall in the number of doctors entering specialist schools for infectious diseases.\u201d With the enormity of what the region has endured in recent months starting to sink in, anger has been mounting towards the League\u2019s regional president, Attilio Fontana, so much so he said he now needed a police escort. Fontana and Giulio Gallera, Lombardy\u2019s health councillor, are to be questioned by prosecutors in Bergamo, the Italian province worst affected by the virus, amid an investigation into criminal negligence that focuses in particular on the failure to immediately close a hospital where an outbreak occurred and care home deaths. A commission led by Patrizia Baffi, a councillor with an opposition party, Italia Viva, has been established to scrutinise what went wrong in Lombardy. Usuelli said a crucial area that the commission must consider is failure to pick up on early warnings from GPs. \u201cFor sure, some GPs tried to signal this strange pneumonia to the relevant authorities, so either there was an interruption in communication or nobody cared,\u201d he said. The region\u2019s response to the outbreak offers some additional insight. Codogno was immediately quarantined along with nine other nearby towns after the sudden outbreak. V\u00f2 Euganeo, a town in Veneto where the first person in Italy died of Covid-19, was also quarantined. But unlike Lombardy, Veneto quickly controlled the contagion by mass testing its population. Lombardy authorities also delayed closing Bergamo, partly because they were under pressure by business associations to keep things going. \u201cAcross Lombardy, production never completely stopped,\u201d said Arnaldo Caruso, a professor at Brescia University and president of the Italian Society for Virology. \u201cPeople continued to work during the lockdown and without all the precautions that came later.\u201d A Champions League football match in Milan on 19 February attended by 40,000 Atalanta fans from Bergamo and the transfer of hospital patients to care homes in order to alleviate the pressure on wards were also believed to have contributed to the high death and contagion rate. Some studies have pointed to Lombardy\u2019s high pollution. However, research comparing pollution levels in Bergamo and Brescia, another badly hit Lombardy province, with the closely located Verona, a city in Veneto, between the beginning of December and end of February, paints a different picture. \u201cWe were surprised to find that PM10 was more or less the same in Brescia and Verona, yet Verona got off lightly,\u201d said Gianenrico Senna, the president of the Italian Society of Allergy, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC), who led the research. \u201cLevels in Bergamo were also lower than in Verona.\u201d Senna\u2019s team identified population density as a more plausible explanation. \u201cIn Bergamo there are more or less 300 people for every square kilometre, for Brescia it\u2019s 200 and for Verona it\u2019s 100,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seemed to make the difference between areas that are closely located.\u201d \u2022 The sub-heading of this article was amended on 31 May 2020 because an earlier version referred to Lombardy as a \u201cprovince\u201d of Italy whereas it is a region.",

On Thursday Guardian Australia revealed that the Australian data in the study, published last week, did not reconcile with health department records or databases. The study found Covid-19 patients who received the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients. The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug. Questions about the paper\u2019s statistical modelling were also raised by the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit and published on a Columbia University blog in the US, prompting Surgisphere, the company that manages the database of patients used to inform the study, to issue a public statement defending the integrity of the study. But now further questions have been raised about the Surgisphere database and the study methodology. The signatories to the open letter, directed to the Lancet and the study authors, include prominent sceptics of the value of using hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19. The letter lists 10 major concerns about the statistical analysis and data integrity of the study. \u201cThe authors have not adhered to standard practices in the machine learning and statistics community,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThey have not released their code or data.\u201d The Lancet is among the many signatories to a statement on data sharing for Covid-19 studies. \u201cThere was no ethics review,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cThere was no mention of the countries or hospitals that contributed to the data source and no acknowledgments to their contributions.

The letter also expressed concern about unusually small reported variances in baseline variables, interventions and outcomes between continents, despite significant differences in demographics. There is currently no strong, replicated evidence that any drug is effective for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19. This includes hydroxychloroquine, which has long been used for malaria and autoimmune diseases, but its safety and harm profile for treating those illnesses is understood. It is not well understood for Covid-19. Governments around the world have warned against using hydroxychloroquine for treating or preventing the virus, highlighting the drug\u2019s potentially toxic side effects and potential to cause heart abnormalities. There have been serious reports of harm due to people self-medicating with hydroxychloroquine and related drugs during the pandemic. Researchers are not calling for clinical trials to be halted in the light of the Lancet study. There is a consensus that more strong studies are needed exploring treatments including antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials. \u201cThere is uniform agreement that well conducted RCTs [randomised control trials] are needed to inform policies and practices,\u201d the signatories to the Lancet letter said. Guardian Australia has contacted the Lancet, Surgisphere and the authors of the study for a response to the concerns outlined in the letter. Surgisphere founder Dr Sapan Desai, also an author on the Lancet paper, said before the release of the letter he appreciated the \u201centhusiasm and lively discussion with respect to our important multi-national observational registry study published in the Lancet medical journal\u201d. \u201cWe appreciate the highly complimentary responses that we have received and the requests for data-driven partnerships as well as clarifications,\u201d he said. \u201cThe analyses were carefully performed, and the interpretations provided were intentionally measured. We studied a very specific group of hospitalised patients with Covid-19 and have clearly stated that the results of our analyses should not be over-interpreted to those that have yet to develop such disease or those that have not been hospitalised. We also clearly outlined the limitations of an observational study that cannot fully control for unobservable confounding measures and concluded that off label use of the drug regimens outside of the context of a clinical trial should not be recommended.\u201d Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",

But, at this point, there is really only one thing to discuss \u2013 and he knows it. \u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he tells me down the phone from his home in (of course) Manhattan. So, even though our interview is supposed to be about his latest film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office\">A Rainy Day in New York</a>, we spend the hour talking about the scandal that has overshadowed his career for the past 25 years and, for many, obscured it. \u201cI assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator,\u201d he says in his still distinctive Brooklyn accent (\u201cpred-ah-tah\u201d).</p> <p>He also knows there is nothing he can do about it: \u201cAnything I say sounds self-serving and defensive, so it\u2019s best if I just go my way and work,\u201d he says. He is 84 and Rainy Day is his 48th film. He has already finished his 49th and, if it were not for the coronavirus, he would be making his 50th this summer.</p> <p>The broad outlines of the scandal are now better known than most of his films. In 1992, it emerged that, aged 57, he was having an affair with Soon-Yi Previn, then 21, the adopted daughter of his long-term partner, Mia Farrow. During the inevitably acrimonious breakup, Farrow accused him of sexually assaulting their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan. (Allen and Farrow also have an adopted son, Moses, then 14, and a biological son, Satchel, then four, now known as Ronan, the journalist. At this point, Farrow also had six older children of her own, including Soon-Yi.) According to contemporaneous news reports, as well as accusing Allen of molesting Dylan, <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/25/Mia-I-worried-about-Woody-being-a-homosexual/8544733035600/\">Farrow testified that she thought Allen might be gay and abuse Satchel</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61ce1b9664128582b964d22dc858ec07820864b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61ce1b9664128582b964d22dc858ec07820864b6/0_0_1500_2322/646.jpg\" alt=\"Allen with Soon-Yi Previn around the time their relationship became public.\" width=\"646\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen with Soon-Yi Previn around the time their relationship became public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI thought people would see it as laughable rubbish right away and from day one I never really took it seriously,\u201d says Allen. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like being confronted with a story that I murdered six people with a machine gun.\u201d (A source close to the Farrow family now denies Farrow feared Allen was gay or would molest Satchel, adding: \u201cWe will not be responding to ad hominem attacks on Ms Farrow or her children to support Mr Allen\u2019s book sales or attempts to rewrite history.\u201d)</p> <p>Back in the 90s, it was Allen\u2019s affair with Soon-Yi that was considered the big scandal. But, in the past decade, since <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/\">Dylan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/ronan-farrow-hachette-woody-allen-memoir\">Ronan</a> have spoken out publicly against their father, and <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\">Soon-Yi</a> and <a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">Moses</a> have defended him, attention has focused on the molestation charge. In 2014, <a href=\"https://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/01/an-open-letter-from-dylan-farrow/\">Dylan wrote in the New York Times</a>: \u201cWoody Allen is a living testament to the way society fails the survivors of sexual abuse and assault.\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">In a 2016 article in </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Ronan castigated the media for giving a free pass to Allen, just because he had never been convicted: \u201cIt is not an excuse for the press to silence victims, to never interrogate allegations.\u201d (He did not reply to a request for comment.)</p> <p>There is a much greater awareness today of the prevalence of sexual abuse than there was in 1992 and the public is increasingly fearful of being on the wrong side of history; to question any woman\u2019s story is, in the eyes of many, to be a rape apologist.</p> <p>So the old allegation against Allen has been accorded more power than it ever had, especially among a generation that was barely born in the 90s. He is now routinely named \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/sunday/michael-jackson-leaving-neverland.html\">by journalists</a>, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-father-woody-allen-danger-892572\">the Farrows</a> and the public \u2013 alongside Harvey Weinstein and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/13/woody-allen-polanski-cosby-dangerous-cannes-ronan-farrow\">Bill Cosby</a>, both of whom are convicted of multiple offences, their crimes going back decades. I covered the Weinstein and Cosby cases, as well as many other stories about high-profile men either convicted or accused of sexual offences: Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar. All of them were accused of attacking multiple victims; their pattern of predatory behaviour spanned their lifetime.&nbsp;Allen was accused of one instance of molestation and not only was he not convicted, but he was never even charged; photos of him in court with Farrow are from their custody battle over their children, not from a criminal trial.<strong> </strong>Why doesn\u2019t he sue when the New York Times calls him a \u201cmonster\u201d alongside Epstein and Weinstein?</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay to sue. Do I really want to be tabloid fodder for two years and go to court? And do I really care?\u201d he says. Given that he lays out the allegation and ensuing drama in searing detail in his memoir, I would wager he cares quite a lot these days.</p> <p>The book is one heck of a read.<strong> </strong>With its funny remembrances of his past jostling up against his palpably furious recollections of the fallout from his breakup with Farrow, it is like watching a double bill of Radio Days and Kramer vs Kramer. He insists the allegation is just \u201ca small part of the story\u201d, but it cuts across it like an angry wound: when he describes the events of 1992, you can feel his shock; when he describes the allegation\u2019s recent resurgence, his frustration burns off the page. He writes about \u201cwell-meaning citizens, brimming with moral indignation, only too happy to nobly take a stand on an issue they had absolutely no knowledge of\u201d while other outsiders \u201crushed to outdo one another in profiles of courage. By God, they were against child molestation and were not afraid to say it.\u201d </p> <p>In March, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/ronan-farrow-hachette-woody-allen-memoir\">Ronan objected to Hachette</a> \u2013 which published his book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/oct/20/catch-and-kill-ronan-farrow-review\">Catch and Kill</a> \u2013 publishing Allen\u2019s memoir, Hachette caved in. Actors who worked with Allen after the original scandal but before the change in public mood \u2013 including Mira Sorvino, Greta Gerwig, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/colin-firth-woody-allen-accusations-film\">Colin Firth</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/12/rebecca-hall-woody-allen-dylan-farrow\">Rebecca Hall</a> \u2013 expressed their deepest remorse. Those who refuse to do so \u2013 such as Larry David, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/diane-keaton-woody-allen-dylan-farrow\">Diane Keaton</a>, Alec Baldwin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/14/alan-alda-its-amazing-that-most-of-us-live-as-if-were-not-gonna-die\">Alan Alda</a> and Scarlett Johansson \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-most-ridiculous-reasons-celebrities-have-had-for-actually-defending-woody-allen.html/\">are publicly shamed</a>. In his memoir, Allen thanks those who defend him, writing: \u201cI assure them it\u2019s not something they will ever be embarrassed having done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b8724058cb076a183a4c423b4fc1bf7f2462cf6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b8724058cb076a183a4c423b4fc1bf7f2462cf6/0_0_3153_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"(From left) Mia Farrow, Satchel (now Ronan) Farrow, Allen and Dylan Farrow in 1988\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><em>(From left) </em>Mia Farrow, Satchel (now Ronan) Farrow, Allen and Dylan Farrow in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McGough/The Life Picture Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I ask how he feels about the actors who denounce him. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. The actors have no idea of the facts and they latch on to some self-serving, public, safe position. Who in the world is not against child molestation?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how actors and actresses are, and [denouncing me] became the fashionable thing to do, like everybody suddenly eating kale.\u201d External opinion is meaningless.</p> <p>That said, Allen makes sure to include in his book an amusingly pointed story about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who stars in Rainy Day: \u201cTimoth\u00e9e afterward publicly stated he regretted working with me and was giving the money to charity. But he swore to my sister he needed to do that as he was up for an Oscar for Call Me By Your Name, and he and his agent felt he had a better chance of winning if he denounced me, so he did.\u201d (Chalamet\u2019s people did not return requests for a comment.)</p> <p>\u201cYou can give people the testimony by those who worked in the house,\u201d Allen says, referring to the Farrow children\u2019s nanny, Monica Thompson, who gave<a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/02/01/Nanny-Mia-wanted-me-to-back-her-story/8228728542800/\">&nbsp;two sworn affidavits</a>&nbsp;saying Mia had tried to coax her into backing the molestation charge, then said Allen \u201cwas always the better parent and all the things Farrow is saying about him are not true\u201d.</p> <p>Allen continues: \u201cYou can give them the facts over and over. But the facts don\u2019t matter. For some reason, emotionally, it\u2019s important for them to buy into the story.\u201d</p> <p>These are the facts: after Farrow alleged that Allen \u2013 never accused of any impropriety before or since \u2013 molested Dylan in her house in Connecticut, doctors examined her and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">found no physical evidence of abuse</a>. Allen was then investigated by the Yale New Haven hospital\u2019s sexual abuse clinic and New York City\u2019s Child Welfare Administration. The former concluded: \u201cIt is our expert opinion that Dylan was not sexually molested by Mr Allen.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html\">The latter, after a 14-month</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/26/nyregion/agency-drops-abuse-inquiry-in-allen-case.html\"> investigation, wrote</a>: \u201cNo credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dr John Leventhal, who headed the Yale New Haven report, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html\">testified that Dylan</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/04/nyregion/doctor-cites-inconsistencies-in-dylan-farrow-s-statements.html\">\u2019s statements had \u201ca rehearsed quality\u201d</a> and hypothesised that \u201cshe was coached or influenced by her mother\u201d. The judge in the custody trial, Justice Elliott Wilk, dismissed this, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866\">saying in his court ruling</a> that \u201cthere is no credible evidence to support Mr Allen\u2019s contention that Ms Farrow coached Dylan\u201d, while, in a 2018 TV interview, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/dylan-farrow-denies-being-brainwashed-in-cbs-tv-interview-woody-allen-allegations\">Dylan </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/dylan-farrow-denies-being-brainwashed-in-cbs-tv-interview-woody-allen-allegations\">firmly denied it</a>, saying: \u201cMy mother has only encouraged me to tell the truth.\u201d</p> <p>But Leventhal\u2019s theory was corroborated by Moses, also in 2018, <a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">when he wrote </a><a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">that </a><a href=\"http://mosesfarrow.blogspot.com/2018/05/a-son-speaks-out-by-moses-farrow.html\">Farrow \u201cbrainwashed\u201d the children</a>, adding: \u201cI was forced to follow my mother\u2019s script to prove my loyalty.\u201d</p> <p>Some, including sources close to the Farrows, have <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2013/11/mia-farrow-frank-sinatra-ronan-farrow]\">alleged that Leventhal never actually interviewed Dylan</a> and suggested that Yale New Haven\u2019s panel \u2013 which had handled <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-05-05-mn-31539-story.html\">more than 1,700 cases by 1992</a> \u2013 and their findings should not be relied on. But, <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/02/woody-allen-and-dylan-farrow-digging-deeper-into-misleading-coverage.html\">according to reports</a>, Dylan was interviewed nine times over six months by two social workers, Jennifer Sawyer and Julia Hamilton, who were part of the team. It is possible they were given this delicate job at least partly because they, unlike Leventhal, were female and Dylan was a seven-year-old girl. For discretionary reasons, Leventhal could not comment on the case. </p> <p>Many will argue that, as a wealthy white man, Allen was protected by authorities (although Allen writes in his memoir that one doctor involved in the case believed the Connecticut police were antisemitic). But assuming guilt in a person who was never charged is a morally precarious position \u2013 and to do so about a case that has long been mired in misinformation and misunderstanding bulldozes through any concept of due process.</p> <p>It is almost 30 years since Allen was first accused of molestation; by this point, almost everything people think they know about the case is wrong. One popular belief is that Allen had been in therapy for \u201cinappropriate\u201d feelings towards Dylan since she was a baby and it has been <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2014/02/woody-allen-sex-abuse-10-facts\">strongly implied that these feelings were sexual</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s a complete and total fabrication, like a space craft landing in New York,\u201d says Allen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e0aeb933518caa711bdb365ab5b58530b70523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e0aeb933518caa711bdb365ab5b58530b70523/0_0_1600_1067/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woody Allen on the Rainy Day set with Selena Gomez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Allen on the set of Rainy Day with Selena Gomez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Miglio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/205403621/Allen-v-Farrow-Custody-Ruling-June-7-1993\">Transcripts from the custody trial</a> back him up. Dr Susan Coates, a child psychologist who treated Satchel and evaluated Dylan, described Allen and Dylan\u2019s relationship as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/02/nyregion/psychologist-testifies-about-visitation-rights-for-allen.html\">\u201cinappropriately intense\u201d</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/30/Psychiatrist-Woody-was-committed-to-being-a-good-father/1405733467600/\">denied it was in any way \u201cromantic\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI did not see it as sexual, but I saw it as inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else,\u201d Coates said. In other words, Allen was not emotionally involved with Farrow\u2019s older children, but instead focused on Dylan, who was the first child he had raised since she was a baby, because Farrow adopted her during their relationship. Dylan\u2019s therapist, Dr Nancy Schultz, also <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-shocking-custody-case-court-documents-that-shed-light-on-the-dylan-farrow-woody-allen-saga\">said she believed that Allen did not sexually abuse Dylan</a>, while Allen\u2019s therapist of 21 years, Dr Kathryn Prescott, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5u0qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT176&amp;lpg=PT176&amp;dq=kathryn+prescott+woody+allen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qOgojnIjwx&amp;sig=ACfU3U286_jzdS73F71KOErhe6Hry2R3IA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-kPv278bpAhVMRBUIHUygAN8Q6AEwEnoECBMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kathryn%20prescott%20woody%20allen&amp;f=false\">testified</a>: \u201cThere has never been any suggestion that Mr Allen was suffering from a sexual perversion/deviant sexual behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>The only person who described Allen\u2019s behaviour towards Dylan as \u201csexual\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">was </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/26/nyregion/farrow-testifies-that-daughter-accused-allen-of-molestation.html\">Farrow</a>, although even she said <a href=\"https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/03/25/Mia-I-worried-about-Woody-being-a-homosexual/8544733035600/\">in the custody hearing</a>: \u201cSexual is not the name I used at the time \u2026 It was relentless and overpowering.\u201d Yet just a few months before the scandal broke, <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/society/woody-and-mia-modern-family-timeline/\">she endorsed Allen\u2019s bid to co-adopt Dylan</a>.</p> <p>The other argument often cited against Allen is that the state prosecutor Frank Maco stated he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to charge Allen for child molestation, but would not do so because it would be too traumatic for Dylan. Less well remembered is <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/suffer-children-191082\">Maco\u2019s other public comment on the case</a>: \u201cTo risk the wellbeing of a child where there is evidence which points to the existence of a reasonable doubt is nothing less than to sacrifice the child on an altar of public spectacle,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I called Maco this week to ask what he meant: \u201cI would have had to put the child on the stand and the child would have had to relate what happened, and that child could not do that in any setting \u2013 an open court, a closed court \u2013 at that point. She just couldn\u2019t,\u201d he told me. Yet \u201cprobable cause\u201d has stuck to Allen in a way \u201creasonable doubt\u201d has not.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m angry at what\u2019s been done to Dylan and Ronan ... they\u2019ve been raised to think the worst of me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many cite Wilk\u2019s custody ruling as proof that Allen did something wrong, even though it was not a criminal trial. There is no question <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/heres-the-1993-woody-alle_b_4746866\">the ruling is extremely personally damning about Allen</a> (\u201cWilk hated me from the moment he set eyes on me,\u201d Allen writes in his memoir). But Wilk\u2019s main criticism was not Allen\u2019s relationship with Dylan<strong> </strong>\u2013 which he described as \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d, but added: \u201cThe evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely he could be prosecuted for sexual abuse\u201d \u2013 but with Soon-Yi.</p> <p>In my many years of debating the Allen case with friends and colleagues, it is usually at this point, when the issues around the original accusation become too byzantine to follow, that people pivot to Soon-Yi. A relationship with a 21-year-old woman is not the same as molesting a seven-year-old girl, but the conflation of the two scandals is understandable: this saga around Allen assumed biblical proportions and his affair with Soon-Yi was the original sin.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are very confused about this. They think Soon-Yi was my adopted daughter, that I lived with Mia [in the same apartment as Soon-Yi], that I was married to Mia \u2013 they have all kinds of crazy thoughts,\u201d says Allen. Yet she was, undeniably, Allen\u2019s partner\u2019s daughter and he had known her since she was a child (although Wilk confirmed that Allen had almost no contact with her until 1990, when she was 20). Their affair was not a legal crime, but in the eyes of many it was \u2013 and is \u2013 a moral one. <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">A</a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">s Ronan </a><a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/woody-allen-mia-farrow-son-338694\">pointed out on Twitter in 2012</a>, when Allen married Soon-Yi, he turned his own children into his siblings-in-law.</p> <p>At the time, Soon-Yi was treated as both the predator (\u201cSoon-Yi does not exist,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47408185\">said</a> her adoptive father, Andr\u00e9 Previn) and the victim: in Wilk\u2019s custody ruling, he says that Farrow called Allen \u201ca child molester\u201d in July 1992 \u2013 a month before the alleged incident with Dylan \u2013 with regard to his relationship with Soon-Yi, while also \u201cdefacing\u201d photos of her daughter. <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\">Soon-Yi</a><a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/soon-yi-previn-speaks.html\"> has long insisted that she was far from either</a>. She is now 49 and has been with Allen for 28 years, married for 23, and raised two daughters, Bechet, 23, and Manzie, 20. Yet the longevity of their relationship, instead of proving its validity, has acted for many as a reminder of Allen\u2019s original transgression.

But no one still holds that against Seinfeld, because Lonstein is no longer his girlfriend and therefore has largely been forgotten.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPs5TAO8Hj4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KPs5TAO8Hj4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Woody Allen on 60 Minutes in 1992.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Allen has long since tired of justifying what he sees as a normal long-term relationship \u2013 and this weariness has not helped him, as proved by his infamous response: \u201cThe heart wants what it wants,\u201d in a 1997 interview. (\u201cFew if anyone realised I was simply quoting Saul Bellow quoting Emily Dickinson, not actually describing a philosophy of my own,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing. And he is right: few realised that.) But, in 1992, he had more sympathy with people\u2019s criticisms: \u201cThe first days [after the accusation of molestation], I thought: this is completely justifiable. I\u2019ve turned up in an affair with another woman and that other woman is her daughter,\u201d he said in an interview with the US news programme 60 Minutes.</p> <p>Is there any part of him that thinks he brought all this on himself?</p> <p>\u201cNo, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d he replies, without hesitation. \u201cI realised [the relationship with Soon-Yi] had dramatic impact and was not usual: one could make criticisms about the rectitude of it, the appropriateness of it; I understood all of that. But these false accusations that have hurt the psychological life of Ronan and Dylan; I don\u2019t feel for one second that I brought that on myself.\u201d</p> <p>Allen can be, at best, naive and, at worst, obtuse. Reviewers of the memoir have gleefully pulled out the comments he makes about Scarlett Johansson and L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s attractiveness, while ignoring his long paeans on the talents of Diane Keaton, Dianne Wiest, Judy Davis and many more. He writes that he has \u201ca reputation as someone obsessed with young women. I have used the May-December ploy as a comic and romantic theme a few times, just as I have used psychoanalysis or murder or Jewish jokes, but only as good material for plots and laughs.\u201d</p> <p>This is true, but you will never guess which of these plots features in Rainy Day (clue: it is not psychoanalysis or murder). So I ask, given that he knows what people think about him, did he not consider ditching the plotline about the middle-aged director (Liev Schreiber) lusting after a college student (Elle Fanning), or declining to make a joke in his memoir about Johansson\u2019s pheromones?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The facts don\u2019t matter. For some reason, emotionally, it\u2019s important for them to buy into the story</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cNo, I never think about that for a second,\u201d he says. \u201c It\u2019s hard enough to get a good joke for the situation. That\u2019s what you concern yourself with. The rest is of absolutely no importance.\u201d In other words: Allen does not think he needs to tread carefully, because he has done nothing wrong.</p> <p>In his memoir, Allen\u2019s recollections of the allegation and its fallout seethe with sadness and occasional fury. But, in conversation, he&nbsp;speaks about the effect that all this has had on his life and career&nbsp;with measured calmness.&nbsp;I remark on his lack of anger. \u201cFrom that perspective, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m angry that I was deprived of seeing my children grow up and I\u2019m angry at what\u2019s been done to Dylan and Ronan. I haven\u2019t spoken a word to the children in over 25 years and they\u2019ve been raised to think the worst of me. So sure, I was angry about that. But, professionally, I haven\u2019t suffered at all,\u201d he says.</p> <p>This is demonstrably untrue. Aside from the actors who won\u2019t work with him, Amazon Studios pulled out of a four-movie deal with him (one of those movies was Rainy Day) after Allen said in a 2018 interview: \u201cI should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one has ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all.\u201d This is true: Allen has an excellent record with female actors, always giving them equal pay. Despite being one of the most closely watched men in the business, there have never even been rumours of harassment. But Amazon claimed Allen\u2019s comment \u201csabotaged\u201d the project. Allen sued and he and Amazon settled last year, but, as a result, Rainy Day does not have a US distributor.</p> <p>\u201cThis plays into my poetic fantasies to be an artist whose work isn\u2019t seen in his own country and is forced, because of injustice, to have his public abroad. Henry Miller comes to mind. DH Lawrence. James Joyce. I see myself standing amongst them defiantly. It\u2019s about at that point my wife wakes me up and says, You\u2019re snoring,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing.</p> <p>In the past decade, he has been <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4151320/\">cut out of documentaries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/critics-notebook-why-i-will-never-watch-a-woody-allen-film-again-1063776\">boycotted by film reviewers</a>. He is considered too riddled with scandal even for the Clintons; Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign returned his and Soon-Yi\u2019s donation: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t help wondering if another fifty-four hundred would have enabled her to carry Pennsylvania, Michigan or Ohio,\u201d he writes in the book. External opinion, it turns out, does matter.</p> <p>Allen is innocent: this is according to the law and the agencies that investigated him. Dylan and Ronan believe he is guilty. It is the latter view that has led some to <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/26/uc-san-diego-academic-senate-rejects-student-led-push-cut-course-woody-allen\">lobby universities to drop him from film courses</a>, exclude his movies from film festivals and talk about him as if he were a criminal. But this attitude is immoral unless it is proved he committed a crime \u2013 and, 28 years later, no one has been able to pin so much as a parking fine on him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Omp-oI4PyY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4Omp-oI4PyY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Watch the trailer for A Rainy Day in New York.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Many point to his movies as evidence of wrongdoing, but it is the height of intellectual laziness to conflate film plots about older men and twentysomething women with child molestation. A 21-year-old woman is not \u2013 and this, apparently, cannot be said enough with regard to Allen \u2013 a seven-year-old girl. It is extraordinary how many people argue otherwise, claiming to do so in the name of feminism. You may not like Allen\u2019s movies \u2013 or his marriage \u2013 but people can be complicated, even unlikable, without being criminal.</p> <p>There are signs that <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2020/05/25/ronan-farrows-botched-journalism-is-troubling-the-response-to-it-has-been-worse/\">some people</a> are starting to realise this, and to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/business/media/ronan-farrow.html\">question some of the narratives around him</a>. Despite the pandemic, the lack of a US release and having been disowned by its star and other cast and crew members, Rainy Day is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/13/woody-allen-rainy-day-in-new-york-tops-global-box-office\">Allen\u2019s most successful film in years</a>. Perhaps the public simply wearied of a story that has not changed in decades. Perhaps some took the time to read the facts.</p> <p>Allen says several times during our conversation that he is completely fine: he can still make movies, even if they are not shown in his own country, and Bechet and Manzie are, he says, wholly untouched by the scandal, even though they are of the generation that thinks he is Satan. \u201cThey\u2019re great, because this has always been a total non-issue in their lives. This is because none of us here make a big deal out of it and it has not impacted them in any negative way whatsoever,\u201d he says, proudly. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/25/woody-allen-traumas-in-life-weaken-us-cafe-society-amazon\">Woody Allen: 'There are traumas in life that weaken us.

      "bodyText": "When Woody Allen was 20, the writer Danny Simon taught him a few rules about comedy, the most important of which was this: always trust your own judgment, because external opinion is meaningless. Allen recounts this tale in his recently published memoir, Apropos of Nothing. That this book exists at all is proof that he still adheres to that rule. These days, Allen\u2019s name is mud, a fact made clear by the critics, who wrote their reviews with one hand while holding their noses with the other. The New York Times\u2019 critic wrote: \u201cVolunteering to review [this book], in our moral climate, is akin to volunteering for the 2021 Olympic javelin-catching team.\u201d Another publication\u2019s headline was: \u201cI Read Woody Allen\u2019s Memoir So You Don\u2019t Have To.\u201d There are a thousand things one could discuss with Allen: his 70 years in comedy, his 55 years of making movies. But, at this point, there is really only one thing to discuss \u2013 and he knows it. \u201cYou can ask me anything,\u201d he tells me down the phone from his home in (of course) Manhattan. So, even though our interview is supposed to be about his latest film, A Rainy Day in New York, we spend the hour talking about the scandal that has overshadowed his career for the past 25 years and, for many, obscured it. \u201cI assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator,\u201d he says in his still distinctive Brooklyn accent (\u201cpred-ah-tah\u201d). He also knows there is nothing he can do about it: \u201cAnything I say sounds self-serving and defensive, so it\u2019s best if I just go my way and work,\u201d he says. He is 84 and Rainy Day is his 48th film. He has already finished his 49th and, if it were not for the coronavirus, he would be making his 50th this summer. The broad outlines of the scandal are now better known than most of his films. In 1992, it emerged that, aged 57, he was having an affair with Soon-Yi Previn, then 21, the adopted daughter of his long-term partner, Mia Farrow. During the inevitably acrimonious breakup, Farrow accused him of sexually assaulting their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan. (Allen and Farrow also have an adopted son, Moses, then 14, and a biological son, Satchel, then four, now known as Ronan, the journalist. At this point, Farrow also had six older children of her own, including Soon-Yi.) According to contemporaneous news reports, as well as accusing Allen of molesting Dylan, Farrow testified that she thought Allen might be gay and abuse Satchel. \u201cI thought people would see it as laughable rubbish right away and from day one I never really took it seriously,\u201d says Allen. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like being confronted with a story that I murdered six people with a machine gun.\u201d (A source close to the Farrow family now denies Farrow feared Allen was gay or would molest Satchel, adding: \u201cWe will not be responding to ad hominem attacks on Ms Farrow or her children to support Mr Allen\u2019s book sales or attempts to rewrite history.\u201d) Back in the 90s, it was Allen\u2019s affair with Soon-Yi that was considered the big scandal. But, in the past decade, since Dylan and Ronan have spoken out publicly against their father, and Soon-Yi and Moses have defended him, attention has focused on the molestation charge. In 2014, Dylan wrote in the New York Times: \u201cWoody Allen is a living testament to the way society fails the survivors of sexual abuse and assault.\u201d. In a 2016 article in the Hollywood Reporter, Ronan castigated the media for giving a free pass to Allen, just because he had never been convicted: \u201cIt is not an excuse for the press to silence victims, to never interrogate allegations.\u201d (He did not reply to a request for comment.) There is a much greater awareness today of the prevalence of sexual abuse than there was in 1992 and the public is increasingly fearful of being on the wrong side of history; to question any woman\u2019s story is, in the eyes of many, to be a rape apologist. So the old allegation against Allen has been accorded more power than it ever had, especially among a generation that was barely born in the 90s. He is now routinely named \u2013 by journalists, the Farrows and the public \u2013 alongside Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, both of whom are convicted of multiple offences, their crimes going back decades. I covered the Weinstein and Cosby cases, as well as many other stories about high-profile men either convicted or accused of sexual offences: Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein, Larry Nassar. All of them were accused of attacking multiple victims; their pattern of predatory behaviour spanned their lifetime. Allen was accused of one instance of molestation and not only was he not convicted, but he was never even charged; photos of him in court with Farrow are from their custody battle over their children, not from a criminal trial. Why doesn\u2019t he sue when the New York Times calls him a \u201cmonster\u201d alongside Epstein and Weinstein? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pay to sue. Do I really want to be tabloid fodder for two years and go to court? And do I really care?\u201d he says. Given that he lays out the allegation and ensuing drama in searing detail in his memoir, I would wager he cares quite a lot these days. The book is one heck of a read. With its funny remembrances of his past jostling up against his palpably furious recollections of the fallout from his breakup with Farrow, it is like watching a double bill of Radio Days and Kramer vs Kramer. He insists the allegation is just \u201ca small part of the story\u201d, but it cuts across it like an angry wound: when he describes the events of 1992, you can feel his shock; when he describes the allegation\u2019s recent resurgence, his frustration burns off the page. He writes about \u201cwell-meaning citizens, brimming with moral indignation, only too happy to nobly take a stand on an issue they had absolutely no knowledge of\u201d while other outsiders \u201crushed to outdo one another in profiles of courage. By God, they were against child molestation and were not afraid to say it.\u201d In March, when Ronan objected to Hachette \u2013 which published his book, Catch and Kill \u2013 publishing Allen\u2019s memoir, Hachette caved in. Actors who worked with Allen after the original scandal but before the change in public mood \u2013 including Mira Sorvino, Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Rebecca Hall \u2013 expressed their deepest remorse. Those who refuse to do so \u2013 such as Larry David, Diane Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda and Scarlett Johansson \u2013 are publicly shamed. In his memoir, Allen thanks those who defend him, writing: \u201cI assure them it\u2019s not something they will ever be embarrassed having done.\u201d I ask how he feels about the actors who denounce him. \u201cIt\u2019s silly. The actors have no idea of the facts and they latch on to some self-serving, public, safe position. Who in the world is not against child molestation?\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s how actors and actresses are, and [denouncing me] became the fashionable thing to do, like everybody suddenly eating kale.\u201d External opinion is meaningless. That said, Allen makes sure to include in his book an amusingly pointed story about Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who stars in Rainy Day: \u201cTimoth\u00e9e afterward publicly stated he regretted working with me and was giving the money to charity. But he swore to my sister he needed to do that as he was up for an Oscar for Call Me By Your Name, and he and his agent felt he had a better chance of winning if he denounced me, so he did.\u201d (Chalamet\u2019s people did not return requests for a comment.) \u201cYou can give people the testimony by those who worked in the house,\u201d Allen says, referring to the Farrow children\u2019s nanny, Monica Thompson, who gave two sworn affidavits saying Mia had tried to coax her into backing the molestation charge, then said Allen \u201cwas always the better parent and all the things Farrow is saying about him are not true\u201d. Allen continues: \u201cYou can give them the facts over and over. But the facts don\u2019t matter. For some reason, emotionally, it\u2019s important for them to buy into the story.\u201d These are the facts: after Farrow alleged that Allen \u2013 never accused of any impropriety before or since \u2013 molested Dylan in her house in Connecticut, doctors examined her and found no physical evidence of abuse. Allen was then investigated by the Yale New Haven hospital\u2019s sexual abuse clinic and New York City\u2019s Child Welfare Administration. The former concluded: \u201cIt is our expert opinion that Dylan was not sexually molested by Mr Allen.\u201d The latter, after a 14-month investigation, wrote: \u201cNo credible evidence was found that the child named in this report has been abused or maltreated.\u201d Dr John Leventhal, who headed the Yale New Haven report, testified that Dylan\u2019s statements had \u201ca rehearsed quality\u201d and hypothesised that \u201cshe was coached or influenced by her mother\u201d. The judge in the custody trial, Justice Elliott Wilk, dismissed this, saying in his court ruling that \u201cthere is no credible evidence to support Mr Allen\u2019s contention that Ms Farrow coached Dylan\u201d, while, in a 2018 TV interview, Dylan firmly denied it, saying: \u201cMy mother has only encouraged me to tell the truth.\u201d But Leventhal\u2019s theory was corroborated by Moses, also in 2018, when he wrote that Farrow \u201cbrainwashed\u201d the children, adding: \u201cI was forced to follow my mother\u2019s script to prove my loyalty.\u201d Some, including sources close to the Farrows, have alleged that Leventhal never actually interviewed Dylan and suggested that Yale New Haven\u2019s panel \u2013 which had handled more than 1,700 cases by 1992 \u2013 and their findings should not be relied on. But, according to reports, Dylan was interviewed nine times over six months by two social workers, Jennifer Sawyer and Julia Hamilton, who were part of the team. It is possible they were given this delicate job at least partly because they, unlike Leventhal, were female and Dylan was a seven-year-old girl. For discretionary reasons, Leventhal could not comment on the case. Many will argue that, as a wealthy white man, Allen was protected by authorities (although Allen writes in his memoir that one doctor involved in the case believed the Connecticut police were antisemitic). But assuming guilt in a person who was never charged is a morally precarious position \u2013 and to do so about a case that has long been mired in misinformation and misunderstanding bulldozes through any concept of due process. It is almost 30 years since Allen was first accused of molestation; by this point, almost everything people think they know about the case is wrong. One popular belief is that Allen had been in therapy for \u201cinappropriate\u201d feelings towards Dylan since she was a baby and it has been strongly implied that these feelings were sexual. \u201cThat\u2019s a complete and total fabrication, like a space craft landing in New York,\u201d says Allen. Transcripts from the custody trial back him up. Dr Susan Coates, a child psychologist who treated Satchel and evaluated Dylan, described Allen and Dylan\u2019s relationship as \u201cinappropriately intense\u201d, but denied it was in any way \u201cromantic\u201d. \u201cI did not see it as sexual, but I saw it as inappropriately intense because it excluded everybody else,\u201d Coates said. In other words, Allen was not emotionally involved with Farrow\u2019s older children, but instead focused on Dylan, who was the first child he had raised since she was a baby, because Farrow adopted her during their relationship. Dylan\u2019s therapist, Dr Nancy Schultz, also said she believed that Allen did not sexually abuse Dylan, while Allen\u2019s therapist of 21 years, Dr Kathryn Prescott, testified: \u201cThere has never been any suggestion that Mr Allen was suffering from a sexual perversion/deviant sexual behaviour.\u201d The only person who described Allen\u2019s behaviour towards Dylan as \u201csexual\u201d was Farrow, although even she said in the custody hearing: \u201cSexual is not the name I used at the time \u2026 It was relentless and overpowering.\u201d Yet just a few months before the scandal broke, she endorsed Allen\u2019s bid to co-adopt Dylan. The other argument often cited against Allen is that the state prosecutor Frank Maco stated he had \u201cprobable cause\u201d to charge Allen for child molestation, but would not do so because it would be too traumatic for Dylan. Less well remembered is Maco\u2019s other public comment on the case: \u201cTo risk the wellbeing of a child where there is evidence which points to the existence of a reasonable doubt is nothing less than to sacrifice the child on an altar of public spectacle,\u201d he said. I called Maco this week to ask what he meant: \u201cI would have had to put the child on the stand and the child would have had to relate what happened, and that child could not do that in any setting \u2013 an open court, a closed court \u2013 at that point. She just couldn\u2019t,\u201d he told me. Yet \u201cprobable cause\u201d has stuck to Allen in a way \u201creasonable doubt\u201d has not. Many cite Wilk\u2019s custody ruling as proof that Allen did something wrong, even though it was not a criminal trial. There is no question the ruling is extremely personally damning about Allen (\u201cWilk hated me from the moment he set eyes on me,\u201d Allen writes in his memoir). But Wilk\u2019s main criticism was not Allen\u2019s relationship with Dylan \u2013 which he described as \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d, but added: \u201cThe evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely he could be prosecuted for sexual abuse\u201d \u2013 but with Soon-Yi. In my many years of debating the Allen case with friends and colleagues, it is usually at this point, when the issues around the original accusation become too byzantine to follow, that people pivot to Soon-Yi. A relationship with a 21-year-old woman is not the same as molesting a seven-year-old girl, but the conflation of the two scandals is understandable: this saga around Allen assumed biblical proportions and his affair with Soon-Yi was the original sin. \u201cPeople are very confused about this. They think Soon-Yi was my adopted daughter, that I lived with Mia [in the same apartment as Soon-Yi], that I was married to Mia \u2013 they have all kinds of crazy thoughts,\u201d says Allen. Yet she was, undeniably, Allen\u2019s partner\u2019s daughter and he had known her since she was a child (although Wilk confirmed that Allen had almost no contact with her until 1990, when she was 20). Their affair was not a legal crime, but in the eyes of many it was \u2013 and is \u2013 a moral one. As Ronan pointed out on Twitter in 2012, when Allen married Soon-Yi, he turned his own children into his siblings-in-law. At the time, Soon-Yi was treated as both the predator (\u201cSoon-Yi does not exist,\u201d said her adoptive father, Andr\u00e9 Previn) and the victim: in Wilk\u2019s custody ruling, he says that Farrow called Allen \u201ca child molester\u201d in July 1992 \u2013 a month before the alleged incident with Dylan \u2013 with regard to his relationship with Soon-Yi, while also \u201cdefacing\u201d photos of her daughter. Soon-Yi has long insisted that she was far from either. She is now 49 and has been with Allen for 28 years, married for 23, and raised two daughters, Bechet, 23, and Manzie, 20. Yet the longevity of their relationship, instead of proving its validity, has acted for many as a reminder of Allen\u2019s original transgression. The same year Allen and Farrow were in court, Jerry Seinfeld, then 38, started seeing a 17-year-old, Shoshanna Lonstein. But no one still holds that against Seinfeld, because Lonstein is no longer his girlfriend and therefore has largely been forgotten. Allen has long since tired of justifying what he sees as a normal long-term relationship \u2013 and this weariness has not helped him, as proved by his infamous response: \u201cThe heart wants what it wants,\u201d in a 1997 interview. (\u201cFew if anyone realised I was simply quoting Saul Bellow quoting Emily Dickinson, not actually describing a philosophy of my own,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing. And he is right: few realised that.) But, in 1992, he had more sympathy with people\u2019s criticisms: \u201cThe first days [after the accusation of molestation], I thought: this is completely justifiable. I\u2019ve turned up in an affair with another woman and that other woman is her daughter,\u201d he said in an interview with the US news programme 60 Minutes. Is there any part of him that thinks he brought all this on himself? \u201cNo, and I\u2019ll tell you why,\u201d he replies, without hesitation. \u201cI realised [the relationship with Soon-Yi] had dramatic impact and was not usual: one could make criticisms about the rectitude of it, the appropriateness of it; I understood all of that. But these false accusations that have hurt the psychological life of Ronan and Dylan; I don\u2019t feel for one second that I brought that on myself.\u201d Allen can be, at best, naive and, at worst, obtuse. Reviewers of the memoir have gleefully pulled out the comments he makes about Scarlett Johansson and L\u00e9a Seydoux\u2019s attractiveness, while ignoring his long paeans on the talents of Diane Keaton, Dianne Wiest, Judy Davis and many more. He writes that he has \u201ca reputation as someone obsessed with young women. I have used the May-December ploy as a comic and romantic theme a few times, just as I have used psychoanalysis or murder or Jewish jokes, but only as good material for plots and laughs.\u201d This is true, but you will never guess which of these plots features in Rainy Day (clue: it is not psychoanalysis or murder). So I ask, given that he knows what people think about him, did he not consider ditching the plotline about the middle-aged director (Liev Schreiber) lusting after a college student (Elle Fanning), or declining to make a joke in his memoir about Johansson\u2019s pheromones? \u201cNo, I never think about that for a second,\u201d he says. \u201c It\u2019s hard enough to get a good joke for the situation. That\u2019s what you concern yourself with. The rest is of absolutely no importance.\u201d In other words: Allen does not think he needs to tread carefully, because he has done nothing wrong. In his memoir, Allen\u2019s recollections of the allegation and its fallout seethe with sadness and occasional fury. But, in conversation, he speaks about the effect that all this has had on his life and career with measured calmness. I remark on his lack of anger. \u201cFrom that perspective, I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m angry that I was deprived of seeing my children grow up and I\u2019m angry at what\u2019s been done to Dylan and Ronan. I haven\u2019t spoken a word to the children in over 25 years and they\u2019ve been raised to think the worst of me. So sure, I was angry about that. But, professionally, I haven\u2019t suffered at all,\u201d he says. This is demonstrably untrue. Aside from the actors who won\u2019t work with him, Amazon Studios pulled out of a four-movie deal with him (one of those movies was Rainy Day) after Allen said in a 2018 interview: \u201cI should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. I\u2019ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one has ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all.\u201d This is true: Allen has an excellent record with female actors, always giving them equal pay. Despite being one of the most closely watched men in the business, there have never even been rumours of harassment. But Amazon claimed Allen\u2019s comment \u201csabotaged\u201d the project. Allen sued and he and Amazon settled last year, but, as a result, Rainy Day does not have a US distributor. \u201cThis plays into my poetic fantasies to be an artist whose work isn\u2019t seen in his own country and is forced, because of injustice, to have his public abroad. Henry Miller comes to mind. DH Lawrence. James Joyce. I see myself standing amongst them defiantly. It\u2019s about at that point my wife wakes me up and says, You\u2019re snoring,\u201d he writes in Apropos of Nothing. In the past decade, he has been cut out of documentaries and boycotted by film reviewers. He is considered too riddled with scandal even for the Clintons; Hillary\u2019s presidential campaign returned his and Soon-Yi\u2019s donation: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t help wondering if another fifty-four hundred would have enabled her to carry Pennsylvania, Michigan or Ohio,\u201d he writes in the book. External opinion, it turns out, does matter. Allen is innocent: this is according to the law and the agencies that investigated him. Dylan and Ronan believe he is guilty. It is the latter view that has led some to lobby universities to drop him from film courses, exclude his movies from film festivals and talk about him as if he were a criminal. But this attitude is immoral unless it is proved he committed a crime \u2013 and, 28 years later, no one has been able to pin so much as a parking fine on him. Many point to his movies as evidence of wrongdoing, but it is the height of intellectual laziness to conflate film plots about older men and twentysomething women with child molestation. A 21-year-old woman is not \u2013 and this, apparently, cannot be said enough with regard to Allen \u2013 a seven-year-old girl. It is extraordinary how many people argue otherwise, claiming to do so in the name of feminism. You may not like Allen\u2019s movies \u2013 or his marriage \u2013 but people can be complicated, even unlikable, without being criminal. There are signs that some people are starting to realise this, and to question some of the narratives around him. Despite the pandemic, the lack of a US release and having been disowned by its star and other cast and crew members, Rainy Day is Allen\u2019s most successful film in years. Perhaps the public simply wearied of a story that has not changed in decades. Perhaps some took the time to read the facts. Allen says several times during our conversation that he is completely fine: he can still make movies, even if they are not shown in his own country, and Bechet and Manzie are, he says, wholly untouched by the scandal, even though they are of the generation that thinks he is Satan. \u201cThey\u2019re great, because this has always been a total non-issue in their lives. This is because none of us here make a big deal out of it and it has not impacted them in any negative way whatsoever,\u201d he says, proudly. This is in sharp contrast to how Moses has described his childhood in the Farrow household: \u201c[Allen\u2019s relationship with Soon-Yi] was not nearly as devastating to our family as my mother\u2019s insistence on making this betrayal the centre of all our lives from then on.\u201d And this, I suspect, is what lies behind Allen\u2019s outward insistence of fine-ness: he can\u2019t voice whatever rage he feels, because he knows all too well it would hurt those closest to him. He has already lost one set of children to this mess \u2013 he does not want to lose another. Once upon a time, he did think, he says, that everyone would eventually come to see the allegation as false. But he is beginning to accept that many probably won\u2019t. It will, without question, be mentioned in the first paragraph of his obituary. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is and all I can do is keep my nose to the grindstone and hope that people will come to their senses at some point. But if not, not,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are many injustices in the world far worse than this. So you live with it.\u201d A Rainy Day in New York is available on various streaming platforms in the UK from 5 June",

Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March.</p> \n<p>Unions representing immigration staff reacted to the figures with anger and criticised the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) provided to workers.</p> \n<p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, the biggest union representing Border Force staff, said: \u201cBorder Force management&nbsp;have at some airports actively told PCS members at passport&nbsp;control not to wear PPE because it gave the \u2018wrong impression\u2019 to travelling passengers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, the impression they&nbsp;have given is that they care&nbsp;more about image than the health and safety of Border Force staff. And these figures are a searing indictment of their approach.\u201d</p> \n<p>Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said: \u201cThe statistics clearly show the impact on staff prior to the lockdown and the immediate impact that had in limiting the spread of the virus amongst Border Force and UKVI staff.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cObtaining suitable PPE for staff, particularly staff at the border, is an ongoing struggle.&nbsp;Although sickness rates amongst border and immigration staff never reached the \u201ccritical\u201d 30% of absence which Home Office originally planned for, there is no excuse for the failures to protect key workers.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cStaff at the border see staff in supermarkets, delivery drivers etc \u2013 as much key workers as they themselves are \u2013 wearing masks, face shields [and encourage to adopt] social distancing measures.&nbsp;Yet they continue to attend work actively discouraged from complying with the government recommendations regarding face coverings and with masks issued as PPE only in very limited circumstances.\u201d</p> \n<p>The figures were provided to the Labour MP <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephen-doughty\">Stephen Doughty</a> in answer to a parliamentary question.</p> \n<p>There were 23.7m arrivals into the UK by air, land and sea in the first three months of the year, including 18.1m arrivals by air between 1 January and 23 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/patrick-vallance\">Sir Patrick Vallance</a>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, told MPs there was \u201ca big influx\u201d of coronavirus cases from Italy and Spain in early March.</p> \n<p>Doughty, a former member of the home affairs select committee, told the Guardian: \u201cThis shocking revelation in answer to my question shows one of the likely impacts of failing to introduce proper measures to protect staff at the border when they were most needed \u2013 in the first quarter of the year \u2013 when over 23 million British and other travellers entered the UK without proper health checks or formal quarantine.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile some of this illness will have undoubtedly been picked up outside of work, the fact Sir Patrick Vallance admitted that we had imported many, many cases, coupled with these figures, suggests that many frontline staff may have been exposed and infected in the course of their work.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government must urgently publish the scientific advice it used, and an explanation for their failure to act when it could have made a difference.\u201d</p> \n<p>At least two Border Force staff have contracted Covid-19 and died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Critics of the government\u2019s approach have questioned if more could have been done to screen arrivals earlier in the pandemic, particularly from hotspots, including Wuhan in China \u2013 the source of the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 and northern Italy.</p> \n<p>Of the 18.1 million arrivals between 1 January and 23 March, only 273 passengers on three flights from Wuhan and one flight from Japan were formally quarantined in government-supported isolation facilities.</p> \n<p>The government stopped issuing guidance at the border to arrivals from specific countries \u2013 including from Italy and China \u2013 to self-isolate on 13 March, 10 days before the lockdown was imposed. Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. There were more than 100,000 arrivals by air into the UK in April.</p> \n<p>Since then, the government has announced it is to enforce <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/22/uk-arrivals-8-june-quarantine-for-14-days-coronavirus\">a 14-day period of self isolation for all arrivals into the UK</a> from 8 June, prompting many to question why such a policy was not implemented earlier in the crisis.</p> \n<p>The figures also show that in the first four months of the year, there were a further 2,345 Border Force and UKVI staff recorded as beginning a period of isolation at home either because a member of their household had Covid-19 symptoms or because the employee themselves was vulnerable to infection. Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March.</p> \n<p>Combined with those that had fallen ill themselves, this totals 27% of the workforce for Border Force and UKVI.</p> \n<p>The most recent Home Office annual report, published in June last year, showed there were 8,127 permanent employees at Border Force and 7,422 workers at UK Visas &amp; Immigration, a total of 15,549.</p> \n<p>The answers were provided by the minister for immigration compliance, Chris Philp. </p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe figures show Border Force and UKVI absences due to coronavirus are consistent with those across the UK at the time.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe safety of the public and our staff is of paramount importance, which is why Border Force staff have been provided with the necessary personal protective equipment. Protective screens have been installed in ports, and we are ensuring social distancing is maintained in passenger arrivals areas.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nearly 2,000 immigration staff, including workers at the UK\u2019s ports and airports, were off sick with Covid-19 symptoms in the first four months of the year, with more than half absent before the lockdown was imposed, the Guardian can reveal. Between 1 January and 29 April there were 1,880 Border Force and UK Visas &amp; Immigration (UKVI) staff recorded as beginning a period of sickness absence due to Covid-19 symptoms, equal to 12% of the combined workforce for both agencies. Of these, 516 Border Force and 529 UKVI workers were off before 23 March, a total of 1,045 or 7% of the combined workforce. The absences peaked in the week to 22 March, just before lockdown, for both agencies. Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March. Unions representing immigration staff reacted to the figures with anger and criticised the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) provided to workers. Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, the biggest union representing Border Force staff, said: \u201cBorder Force management have at some airports actively told PCS members at passport control not to wear PPE because it gave the \u2018wrong impression\u2019 to travelling passengers. \u201cWell, the impression they have given is that they care more about image than the health and safety of Border Force staff. And these figures are a searing indictment of their approach.\u201d Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said: \u201cThe statistics clearly show the impact on staff prior to the lockdown and the immediate impact that had in limiting the spread of the virus amongst Border Force and UKVI staff. \u201cObtaining suitable PPE for staff, particularly staff at the border, is an ongoing struggle. Although sickness rates amongst border and immigration staff never reached the \u201ccritical\u201d 30% of absence which Home Office originally planned for, there is no excuse for the failures to protect key workers. \u201cStaff at the border see staff in supermarkets, delivery drivers etc \u2013 as much key workers as they themselves are \u2013 wearing masks, face shields [and encourage to adopt] social distancing measures. Yet they continue to attend work actively discouraged from complying with the government recommendations regarding face coverings and with masks issued as PPE only in very limited circumstances.\u201d The figures were provided to the Labour MP Stephen Doughty in answer to a parliamentary question. There were 23.7m arrivals into the UK by air, land and sea in the first three months of the year, including 18.1m arrivals by air between 1 January and 23 March. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, told MPs there was \u201ca big influx\u201d of coronavirus cases from Italy and Spain in early March. Doughty, a former member of the home affairs select committee, told the Guardian: \u201cThis shocking revelation in answer to my question shows one of the likely impacts of failing to introduce proper measures to protect staff at the border when they were most needed \u2013 in the first quarter of the year \u2013 when over 23 million British and other travellers entered the UK without proper health checks or formal quarantine. \u201cWhile some of this illness will have undoubtedly been picked up outside of work, the fact Sir Patrick Vallance admitted that we had imported many, many cases, coupled with these figures, suggests that many frontline staff may have been exposed and infected in the course of their work. \u201cThe government must urgently publish the scientific advice it used, and an explanation for their failure to act when it could have made a difference.\u201d At least two Border Force staff have contracted Covid-19 and died. Critics of the government\u2019s approach have questioned if more could have been done to screen arrivals earlier in the pandemic, particularly from hotspots, including Wuhan in China \u2013 the source of the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 and northern Italy. Of the 18.1 million arrivals between 1 January and 23 March, only 273 passengers on three flights from Wuhan and one flight from Japan were formally quarantined in government-supported isolation facilities. The government stopped issuing guidance at the border to arrivals from specific countries \u2013 including from Italy and China \u2013 to self-isolate on 13 March, 10 days before the lockdown was imposed. Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. There were more than 100,000 arrivals by air into the UK in April. Since then, the government has announced it is to enforce a 14-day period of self isolation for all arrivals into the UK from 8 June, prompting many to question why such a policy was not implemented earlier in the crisis. The figures also show that in the first four months of the year, there were a further 2,345 Border Force and UKVI staff recorded as beginning a period of isolation at home either because a member of their household had Covid-19 symptoms or because the employee themselves was vulnerable to infection. Only five of the cases were recorded between 1 January and 1 March. Combined with those that had fallen ill themselves, this totals 27% of the workforce for Border Force and UKVI. The most recent Home Office annual report, published in June last year, showed there were 8,127 permanent employees at Border Force and 7,422 workers at UK Visas &amp; Immigration, a total of 15,549. The answers were provided by the minister for immigration compliance, Chris Philp. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThe figures show Border Force and UKVI absences due to coronavirus are consistent with those across the UK at the time. \u201cThe safety of the public and our staff is of paramount importance, which is why Border Force staff have been provided with the necessary personal protective equipment. Protective screens have been installed in ports, and we are ensuring social distancing is maintained in passenger arrivals areas.\u201d",

After the competition resumed on Thursday night in a fan-less Suncorp stadium, the league on Friday confirmed plans for the Fan In The Stand initiative, which will enable a few hundred diehard fans to \u201cwatch\u201d their team play \u201clive, from inside the stadiums\u201d. \u201cFor just $22 plus GST, NRL members and rugby league fans can have their photo printed on a 100% recyclable cut-out and placed in their team\u2019s current home venue,\u201d a press release stated. A $1 donation will be made from every purchase towards the Gotcha4Life Foundation. Strict biosecurity measures introduced in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic exclude fans for now, although the NRL has set an ambitious target date of 1 July to welcome back at least a limited number. That idea has been met with some resistance, with state governments saying it is too soon to consider and the Australian Medical Association branding it \u201cabsurd and dangerous\u201d. In the absence of real fans on Thursday night, several cardboard cutout figures sporting black suits and XXXX boating hats were placed in the stands at Suncorp stadium, as the NRL became the first major Australian sport to get back under way after the coronavirus shutdown. More cardboard fans can be expected in the coming weeks, with the latest initiative to be rolled out in stadiums this weekend, before the concept ramps up with more fans able to take part in next week\u2019s round four. \u201cWe wanted to make sure the lifeblood of the NRL, our members and fans, had the chance to pull on their jerseys, don their club colours and support in a really fun way,\u201d the NRL\u2019s head of marketing, Peter Jarmain, said. \u201cI know the players and clubs will appreciate the support, even if the fans aren\u2019t able to shout, celebrate and jump around for the tries and hits as they usually would.\u201d The absence of fans has presented the NRL with a challenge to recreate an atmosphere inside stadiums akin to a normal match day experience. The league will continue to play music during breaks in play in an effort to do so, while a number of players have selected specific tracks to be played should they score a try over the weekend. Broadcasters have also attempted to address the void created by the lack of fans, and on Thursday they piped recorded crowd noise through to their coverage of the Broncos v Eels game. Controlled from an off-site location, both Channel Nine and Fox Sports \u2013 the NRL\u2019s broadcast partners \u2013 followed in the footsteps of Germany\u2019s Bundesliga by using augmented crowd noise to reflect fans\u2019 reaction to the flow of the game. \u201cNine has partnered with Australian company \u2018aFX\u2019 to deliver a live augmented crowd audio experience to bring the big game feel back to your TV,\u201d a Nine spokesperson said. \u201cIt will allow fans at home to hear the roar of genuine NRL fans from each venue as they ride the highs and lows from the comfort of their couch.\u201d With so little live sport back up and running, Thursday\u2019s resumption game, won 34-6 by the Eels, was a huge success.

Minnesota\u2019s governor called in the national guard as the city of Minneapolis faced a third night of protests. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on Monday after his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">neck was knelt on by a white police officer</a> for almost nine minutes despite his cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9c0ea818-293d-4321-bd1f-dc76202136fa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4CsifBYiOxU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Reports emerged last night of large fires breaking out in the city. Elsewhere in the US, dozens were arrested at a large demonstration in New York City, while at a protest which broke out in Denver, Colorado, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/colorado-george-floyd-protest-shots-fired\">shots were fired near the state Capitol</a>, though no injuries were reported.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Will not throw away gains\u2019 \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Boris Johnson has declared that the coronavirus peak has passed and revealed plans to ease England\u2019s lockdown from Monday, with socially distanced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">gatherings of up to six permitted</a>&nbsp;in parks and gardens, and dentistry permitted a week later. \u201cI cannot, and will not, throw away all the gains we have made together \u2013 and so the changes we have made are limited and cautious,\u201d he said. Nicola Sturgeon has announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/people-scotland-can-meet-groups-eight-lockdown-eased\">similar easing measures for Scotland</a>.</p> \n<p>Johnson has continued to brush aside a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-brushes-off-tory-revolt-over-dominic-cummings\">revolt by more than 100 MPs over Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown travel</a>. Police have concluded Cummings may have broken the rules but decided they will take no action against him. The government is also facing criticism for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/government-rejected-radical-lockdown-england-care-homes-coronavirus\">rejecting a radical plan to protect those in care homes</a>, the Guardian has learned. In England, Wales and Scotland 12,597 more people died in care homes during the pandemic than the five-year average.</p> \n<p>The Philippines president has announced plans to ease one of the longest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/global-report-philippines-opens-up-despite-record-cases-as-asia-struggles\">toughest coronavirus lockdowns in the world</a> despite the country reporting 539 infections on Thursday&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;its biggest daily spike in cases since the pandemic began. There have been 921 deaths. \u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d said President Rodrigo Duterte in a televised address. In&nbsp;India, Mumbai\u2019s hospitals are on the verge of collapse under the pressure of Covid-19 cases, with footage emerging of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/india-mumbai-hospitals-overwhelmed-coronavirus-cases\">patients sharing beds and oxygen tanks</a>.

They&nbsp;claim&nbsp;Raab did not have authority to allow&nbsp;Anne&nbsp;Sacoolas to return to the United States, and that he misled parliament&nbsp;about the case. Sacoolas was subsequently charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Interpol has issued a wanted notice and Raab has called for Sacoolas\u2019s extradition back to the UK.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump turns antisocial \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to strip social media companies of protection from liability over what their users post. It is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">retaliation after Twitter fact-checked the president</a> for tweeting falsehoods. Legal challenges are expected to what Trump characterised as a measure to fight censorship and safeguard free speech.

John Kerr, Australia\u2019s unelected governor, infamously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/palace-letters-high-court-rules-queen-secret-correspondence-whitlam-dismissal-are-commonwealth-records\">sacked the democratically elected Gough Whitlam on remembrance day</a> amid huge controversy. A historian, Jenny Hocking, has fought for years for Australia\u2019s national archive to release 211 letters between the Queen, her private secretary and Kerr leading up to the dismissal. Australia\u2019s most senior court has now ordered the archive to reconsider the request by Hocking, who says the letters are vital in understanding what role the Queen played in one of the most important episodes in Australia\u2019s history.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Butterflies back \u2013&nbsp;</strong>A type of large heath butterfly known as the \u201cManchester argus\u201d is being reintroduced to peatlands in greater Manchester <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/29/large-heath-butterflies-return-to-manchester-after-150-years\">150 years after going locally extinct</a>.

At least two border force staff have died with Covid-19. Critics of the government\u2019s approach have questioned if more could have been done to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/12-of-uk-immigration-staff-had-covid-19-symptoms-from-january-to-april\">screen arrivals earlier in the pandemic</a>.</p> \n<p>Life during the coronavirus lockdown has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/29/we-are-losers-in-this-crisis-research-finds-lockdowns-reinforcing-gender-inequality\">reinforced gender inequality across Europe</a> with research emphasising that the economic and social consequences of the crisis are far greater for women and threaten to push them back into traditional roles in the home which they will struggle to shake off once it is over.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Crisis for Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms</h2> \n<p>Protesters have take to the streets again, this time over a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/29/hong-kong-the-end-of-one-country-two-systems\">national security law&nbsp;that is set to be imposed by Beijing</a>.

Weak economic data from Japan also played a part, as the government reported industrial production fell more than 9% in April from the month before, while retail sales dropped nearly 10% month-on-month. That was the biggest fall since a sales tax hike in 1997.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Police knelt on black man\u2019s neck until he died Hello, welcome to Friday, Warren Murray here with news to start the day. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets for another night of mass demonstrations as anger over the death of George Floyd continues to sweep the US. Minnesota\u2019s governor called in the national guard as the city of Minneapolis faced a third night of protests. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on Monday after his neck was knelt on by a white police officer for almost nine minutes despite his cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. Reports emerged last night of large fires breaking out in the city. Elsewhere in the US, dozens were arrested at a large demonstration in New York City, while at a protest which broke out in Denver, Colorado, shots were fired near the state Capitol, though no injuries were reported. * * * \u2018Will not throw away gains\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson has declared that the coronavirus peak has passed and revealed plans to ease England\u2019s lockdown from Monday, with socially distanced gatherings of up to six permitted in parks and gardens, and dentistry permitted a week later. \u201cI cannot, and will not, throw away all the gains we have made together \u2013 and so the changes we have made are limited and cautious,\u201d he said. Nicola Sturgeon has announced similar easing measures for Scotland. Johnson has continued to brush aside a revolt by more than 100 MPs over Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown travel. Police have concluded Cummings may have broken the rules but decided they will take no action against him. The government is also facing criticism for rejecting a radical plan to protect those in care homes, the Guardian has learned. In England, Wales and Scotland 12,597 more people died in care homes during the pandemic than the five-year average. The Philippines president has announced plans to ease one of the longest and toughest coronavirus lockdowns in the world despite the country reporting 539 infections on Thursday \u2013 its biggest daily spike in cases since the pandemic began. There have been 921 deaths. \u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d said President Rodrigo Duterte in a televised address. In India, Mumbai\u2019s hospitals are on the verge of collapse under the pressure of Covid-19 cases, with footage emerging of patients sharing beds and oxygen tanks. Back in the UK, what is expected to be the last clap for carers was held last night. Stay alert to the latest developments at our global live blog and here are some key points at a glance. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Bid to prosecute Raab \u2013 The family of Harry Dunn, the 19-year-old hit and killed by a car driven by the wife of a US intelligence officer, intends to bring a private criminal prosecution against the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, the Guardian has learned. They claim Raab did not have authority to allow Anne Sacoolas to return to the United States, and that he misled parliament about the case. Sacoolas was subsequently charged with causing death by dangerous driving. Interpol has issued a wanted notice and Raab has called for Sacoolas\u2019s extradition back to the UK. * * * Trump turns antisocial \u2013 Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to strip social media companies of protection from liability over what their users post. It is a retaliation after Twitter fact-checked the president for tweeting falsehoods. Legal challenges are expected to what Trump characterised as a measure to fight censorship and safeguard free speech. Interesting, then, how a satirical cartoon that got under that thin orange skin was temporarily removed from sale online following a complaint from the Trump campaign. The executive action by Trump is seen as politically motivated ahead of the US elections \u2013 conservatives have long accused social media companies of liberal or pro-China bias, even while using them extensively to propagate their views. After previously promising to clean up disinformation on Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg has responded to Trump losing his temper by saying Facebook \u201cshouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth\u201d. Separately a UK inquiry has found that Facebook-owned apps were used in the majority of online child sex grooming crimes. * * * Palace letters victory \u2013 Letters between the Queen and her Australian viceroy leading up to the dismissal in 1975 of a prime minister are public record, the country\u2019s high court has ruled. John Kerr, Australia\u2019s unelected governor, infamously sacked the democratically elected Gough Whitlam on remembrance day amid huge controversy. A historian, Jenny Hocking, has fought for years for Australia\u2019s national archive to release 211 letters between the Queen, her private secretary and Kerr leading up to the dismissal. Australia\u2019s most senior court has now ordered the archive to reconsider the request by Hocking, who says the letters are vital in understanding what role the Queen played in one of the most important episodes in Australia\u2019s history. * * * Butterflies back \u2013 A type of large heath butterfly known as the \u201cManchester argus\u201d is being reintroduced to peatlands in greater Manchester 150 years after going locally extinct. Numbers plummeted as land was drained for agricultural land and peat extraction. Conservationists are looking to reverse the fortunes of the rare butterfly by restoring a 37-hectare area of peatland between Wigan and Salford and releasing 45 hand-reared pupae at a secret site where they will be kept in protected tents as they emerge. There are a few isolated populations of large heath butterflies remaining in England and Wales and larger populations in Scotland. Coronavirus Extra A 94-year-old woman living alone \u2013 who did not eat for five days because she was \u201ctoo scared\u201d to leave her house under lockdown and had no one to shop for her \u2013 has been rescued from acute hunger by charity volunteers who were doorknocking in Glasgow. Nearly 2,000 immigration staff, including workers at the UK\u2019s ports and airports, were off sick with Covid-19 symptoms in the first four months of the year, with more than half absent before the lockdown was imposed, the Guardian can reveal. At least two border force staff have died with Covid-19. Critics of the government\u2019s approach have questioned if more could have been done to screen arrivals earlier in the pandemic. Life during the coronavirus lockdown has reinforced gender inequality across Europe with research emphasising that the economic and social consequences of the crisis are far greater for women and threaten to push them back into traditional roles in the home which they will struggle to shake off once it is over. Today in Focus podcast: Crisis for Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms Protesters have take to the streets again, this time over a national security law that is set to be imposed by Beijing. Verna Yu and Lily Kuo look at how the standoff compares with those of Hong Kong\u2019s recent history. Lunchtime read: \u2018Do I really care?\u2019 Woody Allen comes out fighting The 1992 accusation that the film-maker sexually assaulted his young daughter has made him a pariah, yet he was never charged. In this exclusive interview, he explains why he is done with treading carefully. Sport The Premier League looks set to resume on 17 June, three months after it was forced into hiatus by the Covid\u201119 pandemic. Top-flight football in Italy has also been given the go-ahead to resume from 20 June. The British Grand Prix is expected to be confirmed for August as part of the Formula One calendar next week. Hopes for an English county season being staged this summer are on the rise despite the announcement that no domestic professional cricket will take place before 1 August because of the coronavirus pandemic. Dina Asher-Smith has described how running with deer has kept her fit during the Covid-19 lockdown, also admitting she felt relieved when the Olympics were postponed because of the near-impossibility of training sufficiently. Manchester City Women have appointed the former Wales international Gareth Taylor as manager on a three-year deal. And the Boston Marathon has been cancelled for the first time in its history, bowing to social distancing requirements and ending a 124-year run that had persisted through two world wars, a volcanic eruption and even another pandemic. Business Shares have been falling in Asia after Wall Street\u2019s rally petered out amid harsh exchanges between the Trump administration and China on everything from Hong Kong to coronavirus. Benchmarks have declined in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney but have risen in Shanghai. Weak economic data from Japan also played a part, as the government reported industrial production fell more than 9% in April from the month before, while retail sales dropped nearly 10% month-on-month. That was the biggest fall since a sales tax hike in 1997. The pound is trading at $1.232 and \u20ac1.111 while the FTSE at time of writing is trending around 60 points lower. The papers The working week ends as it began with Dominic Cummings on the front pages. \u201cPM stands by adviser after police say he may have breached rules\u201d, says the Guardian, while the Mirror has \u201cPolice: we would have turned back Cummings\u201d. The Mail claims that Boris Johnson\u2019s adviser is \u201cset to quit in six months\u201d according to sources (would it be cynical to view that as a ploy to help quieten things down?). Plenty of jubilation about the \u201cgroup of six\u201d rule that comes into effect on what the Mail calls \u201cHappy Monday\u201d. The Express enthuses \u201cCan\u2019t wait till we meet again\u201d. The Metro has some fun: \u201cForm an orderly barbecue \u2026 not till Monday, only six of you, avoid the loo\u201d. In the Telegraph it\u2019s \u201cFamily and friends can reunite at last, says PM\u201d \u2013 the Times\u2019 and the Mirror\u2019s treatments of the topic are similar. The i says \u201cSix of the best\u201d, presumably unaware of the origin of the phrase. \u201cBack of the net!\u201d That\u2019s the Sun welcoming the return of Premier League football. The FT gives prominence that is absent elsewhere to the crisis in Hong Kong and the UK response: \u201cBritain opens door to citizenship for 300,000 Hong Kong residents\u201d.

Government is difficult, especially in an old, quarrelsome country such as Britain, and being held to account for your inevitable mistakes can be lethal.</p> <p>But few British governments have worked as hard to avoid accountability as the Tories since 2010. From the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/18/what-is-the-fixed-term-parliaments-act\">Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011</a>, which prevented David Cameron\u2019s controversial coalition from being judged in an early election, to Theresa May\u2019s attempts to stop MPs debating her Brexit deal, to Boris Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\">illegal suspension</a> of parliament last year, the Conservatives have hidden from scrutiny ever more blatantly. Even the language Johnson uses \u2013 on the rare occasions he appears in public \u2013 seems designed to minimise accountability, with its clouds of vague adjectival phrases (\u201cvast progress\u201d, \u201cworld-beating\u201d) and as few verifiable facts as possible.&nbsp;</p> <p>This week, this contempt for accountability reached its logical conclusion, in a way, with Johnson\u2019s refusal to sack the unelected <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> for clearly breaking their own government\u2019s lockdown rules, or even to respond to many of the allegations against him. For anyone brought up on the idea that British politicians are scared of the press, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">Cummings\u2019 performance</a> in the Downing Street garden on Monday was quite an education. When a reporter from the Daily Mail \u2013 usually believed to be the most influential paper of all \u2013 asked Cummings whether he had offered to resign, he didn\u2019t even look up from the written statement he had just given. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1264951415606296577\">\u201cNo. I have not offered to resign,\u201d</a> he said flatly, continuing to scribble on his papers. \u201cI have not considered it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One obvious advantage of answering only to \u201cthe people\u201d is that \u2013 in theory, at least \u2013 it need happen only occasionally</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For Cummings and Johnson, like other populists, the only authority to whom politicians should be accountable is the usefully nebulous one of \u201cthe people\u201d. Defending Cummings\u2019 behaviour during lockdown, Johnson and his ministers have been saying all week: \u201cPeople will make up their own minds.\u201d Repeating stock answers, regardless of the question asked, is another way of avoiding accountability, and is the government\u2019s main communications strategy.</p> <p>One obvious advantage of answering only to \u201cthe people\u201d is that \u2013 in theory, at least \u2013 it need happen only occasionally, in general elections. And between such contests, a government with a strong majority, such as the current one, can do a great deal in a single term in centralised Britain, as radical prime ministers from Clement Attlee to Margaret Thatcher have demonstrated.</p> <p>Arguably, it was Thatcher\u2019s fall in 1990, and the 20 years of often anxious, closely scrutinised governments that followed, that established the model of accountability from which Johnson and Cummings are trying to escape. Thatcher was dumped as Tory leader and premier despite having handsomely won her third election in a row only three years earlier, largely because of an unproven suspicion in parts of her party and the media that she was no longer a winner. She was held to account by the Westminster establishment, and found wanting.</p> <p>Her successor, John Major, led a government that effectively imploded under the weight of hostile scrutiny. Scandals far smaller than the Cummings one led to a stream of ministerial resignations. Newspaper editors felt, sometimes correctly, that they could push the prime minister around. The then editor of the News of the World, Piers Morgan, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider:_The_Private_Diaries_of_a_Scandalous_Decade\">wrote in his diary</a>: \u201cMajor\u2019s brought all these exposes on himself, with that ludicrous \u2018Back to Basics\u2019 speech\u201d, which had called for a return to \u201ctraditional values.\u201d Half in jest, Morgan worried that if his paper kept exposing Tory \u201csexual shenanigans\u201d, \u201cthere will be literally nobody left to run the country\u201d. If only exposing Tory hypocrisy had a similar effect now.</p> <p>After Major came Tony Blair, with his crushing majorities. But even he governed as if he was perpetually on trial before the tabloids, big business, swing voters and other rightwing or centrist interest groups. New Labour was often too worried about being accountable to be radical.</p> <p>Since 2010, the Tories certainly haven\u2019t made that mistake. They\u2019ve reshaped the country and its relations with the outside world almost regardless of what anyone else thinks. And when they\u2019ve been too weak or short of ideas to enact many policies \u2013 as they were from the 2017 election to the Brexit stalemate last autumn \u2013 they\u2019ve just clung on, ignoring regular Commons humiliations and the declarations of commentators that they lacked the authority to govern.</p> <p>The stubborn, tunnel-vision quality of modern Conservative government can be disorientating for Westminster journalists, many of whom absorbed a lot of their assumptions about how politics works during the 90s and 00s. Towards the end of Cummings\u2019 long, repetitive press conference, a reporter asked almost desperately: \u201cHow can you not feel apologetic?\u201d</p> <p>Yet even the very limited accountability that populists do accept can be dangerous for governments in between elections, in some circumstances, such as during a national emergency. The polls show that a growing majority of people are outraged by Cummings\u2019 lockdown breaches \u2013 and this anger is fast eating into the government\u2019s popularity.</p> <p>Many voters may have been vaguely aware for years that a seam of hypocrisy has run through the Conservative governments since 2010, which behind their rhetoric of national sacrifice has indulged the rich and powerful. But the Cummings affair has brought this hypocrisy to the surface of public life, and crystallised it into a compelling, easily digestible anecdote.</p> <p>As Major discovered when his administration was characterised as \u201csleazy\u201d, once warning labels are attached to a government they are almost impossible to peel off. Whether Cummings eventually resigns, or is sacked, or not, what many voters think about the government may this week have shifted for good.

It may become a zombie government: stumbling on in office for years more, as Major did after his scandals, but widely discredited and mocked.</p> <p>However hard populists try to limit it, political accountability comes in many forms.

The Toronto Sars experience was similar to, but different from, Covid. One huge difference is that in 2003, the internet and smartphones were still in semi-infancy. There was a crazy deadly virus out there and like now, people wore masks and stayed inside. But importantly, they weren\u2019t spending all their waking hours terrifying themselves with dire forecasts, quack statistical modelling, blatant misinformation and political toxic waste \u2013 and the Sars experience was clearly, distinctly, far less scary than Covid-19.

My MacBook Pro was linked to a jumbo screen, and guests shouted out directions for where to surf next. It was a terrible idea. Going online remains an entirely solitary activity and everyone that evening left feeling unsatisfied. The nightclub had asked me to do posters advertising the event. I liked that idea, but I wanted them to have huge words so that people could read them while driving by in their cars, so I used the nightclub\u2019s house font, a bold sans serif called Knockout, which had originated on boxing posters. I created 10 slogan-like statements that made sense in 2011, but which would have been meaningless to someone 20 years ago. We then pasted them on to construction hoardings around Vancouver.

      "bodyText": "The cemeteries of El Fasher are now watched over by Sudanese police guards, posted to stop a surge in rushed burials. The town\u2019s elderly are reportedly dying at such an alarming rate that the government has now banned funerals without death certificates as it investigates the cause, and has placed the state of North Darfur on lockdown. Activist networks have been recording dozens of deaths every day over the past fortnight, prompting concerns that an outbreak of Covid-19 is killing older people in their homes. At least 150 deaths were confirmed by an investigation carried out by the University of El Fasher with the government and UN. Samples were taken from a third of the dead and while the results have not come through for the majority, 11 out of the 15 received had tested positive for Covid-19. The university\u2019s Dr Altaher Ahmed said the rate of death was following a strong trend, more than doubling week-on-week, from nine at the beginning of May to 94 in the third week. More than half died within a week of falling ill and their average age was 71. Isolated from the capital Khartoum and home to more than 200,000 people displaced by state-backed violence, many fear a health disaster in El Fasher. Suad Musa said activists in the town have been recording deaths among their own relatives, putting the numbers at more than 60 on some days, but there is no official record because most people are avoiding hospitals as they do not believe they will receive the necessary treatment. There have been more than 30 cases officially recorded in El Fasher and the joint UN and African Union peacekeeping force has reported seven suspected cases at its base in the town. Musa says now that there has been a sudden increase in illness among the population. \u201cThey have it just one week and they just die. Sometimes just three days.

The UN worker said investigations into the reported deaths have not yet clarified the scale or cause of the problem but it was possible the deaths were caused either by Covid-19 or by a lack of access to healthcare. They also pointed out that healthcare in general has suffered because of the pandemic, with many fearful of catching the coronavirus at hospitals and many key services suspended since the outbreak began. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen from other crises like Ebola that the collateral effects are massive, we saw that measles went up, that maternal mortality went up, but the Sudanese government in many areas decided to close services,\u201d they said.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturers are poised to make tens of thousands of workers redundant after a worse-than-expected slump in orders, prompted by the pandemic that has left many firms struggling to survive. A survey by the manufacturers\u2019 lobby group, Make UK, found that 25% of companies are already drawing up plans to cut jobs in the next six months. A further 45% say they are considering redundancies. Only 30% said they expect to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic with all their staff on the payroll. The worst-hit firms, which account for more than a quarter of those planning to make redundancies, expect to cut more than half their workforce while another 30% said they would need to lose a quarter of their staff over the next six months. Orders for cars, heavy machinery and manufactured equipment has declined sharply in recent weeks despite an easing of the lockdown to combat the Covid-19 outbreak in parts of Europe and the US. The Make UK chief executive, Stephen Phipson, said: \u201cThere is no disguising the fact these figures make for awful reading with the impact on jobs and livelihoods across the UK.\u201d Michael Saunders, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setting committee, warned that the outlook for British businesses looked bleaker than it did earlier this month when the central bank said growth could be restored by the end of next year. He said the \u201csearing experience\u201d of the coronavirus crisis would leave its mark long after the lockdown was lifted and the central bank should risk pumping too much stimulus into economy rather than too little to combat a severe downturn. Saunders, who was one of only two members of the nine-strong MPC this month to back an increase in the stimulus programme, said he expected an acceleration in the already high rate of unemployment and an increase in the number of companies going bust would leave long-term scars on badly affected industries. The Office for National Statistics said the hospitality, retail and leisure industries had already suffered a steep decline in job vacancies, with low-income workers the worst affected. The number of vacancies on offer had more than halved since severe restrictions were imposed in March, with even bigger drops in the retail and hospitality sectors. Official monthly figures for vacancies are only available up until April but the ONS said that by using data from the online job search engine Adzuna it was able to add the current state of employment opportunities to its list of Covid-19 tracking indicators. Adzuna said its breakdown of the vacancy data showed job vacancies in hospitality and catering had decreased by 86% since the start of the crisis, with retail down by 70%. While the gradual reopening of construction sites and non-essential shops had led to some industries stabilising, Adzuna said recovery was likely to be slow as employers re-entered the market cautiously. A decline in job vacancies across key sectors such as hospitality had disproportionately affected lower-income workers, with vacancies down by 64% for jobs paying between \u00a315,000 and \u00a324,999.",

The Falmouth Packet reported: \"First among the pictures comes a large and beautifully arranged group of roses by the veteran painter Sophie Anderson, whose famous picture The Choristers has been known and appreciated in every land. Daring and rich in colour and design, the hangers Messrs C Napier Hemy and W Ayerst Ingram have given it the post of honour in the line as number one. Image: Roses, Sophie Anderson, Falmouth Art Gallery, 2:B - This painting is an oil study for the finished painting that resides at Leeds Art Gallery. The first in the series, I Am Half-Sick of Shadows, can be seen at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto and the final work is with Tate Britain. Based on Lord Tennyson\u2019s poem, which is closely related to the story of Elaine \u2013 The Lily Maid of Astolat, it illustrates the moment when she breaks a curse forbidding her from looking through the window and down upon Camelot. She stops weaving the view reflected in the mirror and glances through the window to see Sir Lancelot. The Lady of Shalott (from the poem by Tennyson), 19th-20th century, John William Waterhouse, Falmouth Art Gallery, 3:B - The fishermen depicted are oyster dredging from a working sailboat off Falmouth. The town still has a fleet of working boats and a handful of people fish in the traditional manner. Today's oystermen are governed by the same ancient laws and they must use sail power and hand-pulled dredges \u2013 a scene identical to that depicted in Hemy's painting. Falmouth is the only oyster fishery in Europe, if not the world, where such traditional methods must be used. Image: Falmouth Natives, Charles Napier Hemy (1841-1917), Falmouth Art Gallery, 4:C - This work is one of four emotionally charged portraits of Sargent's artists friends produced in 1905. In January of that year his friend and neighbour, the painter Robert Brough, was fatally injured in a railway disaster. He was deeply moved by the loss of his friend and this prompted the four emotionally charged portraits of artist friends, each inscribed across the top: \"To my friend\". Sargent stayed at Hemy's Falmouth home for three days in 1905, during which time he painted this portrait. Image: Charles Napier Hemy, 1905, John Singer Sargent, Falmouth Art Gallery, 5:B - Henry Scott Tuke\u2019s father Daniel Hack Tuke (1827-95) came from a Quaker family known for their work in psychology. His great grandfather William Tuke and grandfather Henry Tuke co-founded the Retreat, which revolutionalised the treatment of people with mental health issues. Daniel Hack Tuke carried on this pioneering research visiting a number of asylums and publishing many influential books on lunacy. Image: Study of Bathing Boys, 1912, Henry Scott Tuke, Falmouth Art Gallery, 6:B - Sir Alfred Munnings was born in Mendham, Suffolk, son of a miller and merchant. He studied at Norwich School of Art and Acad\u00e9mie Julian, in Paris. When he was 20, he lost the sight in one eye as the result of an injury when lifting a dog over a briar hedge. Munnings was elected president of the Royal Academy in 1944 and was knighted in the same year. Image: The Caravan, 19th-20th century, Alfred James Munnings \u00a9 Estate of Sir Alfred Munnings, Dedham, Essex/DACS 2020, 7:A - John Opie was Cornwall's first famous painter, and the only Cornish artist to be honoured with a burial at St Paul's Cathedral, where he lies next to the tomb of Sir Joshua Reynolds. His pioneering understanding of light and shade had a profound influence on artists that followed him. As a young man, Opie burst on to the London art scene, where he was known as the Cornish Wonder. He so impressed Sir Joshua Reynolds that he considered him to be \"like Caravaggio and Vel\u00e1zquez in one\". Image: The Beggar Boy, 18th century, John Opie, Falmouth Art Gallery, 8:C - Poet John Dryden dedicated a poem to Anne in which he refers directly to this picture: \"Where nymphs of brightest form appear, and shaggy satyrs standing near.\" The poem was titled To the Pious Memory of the Accomplished Young Lady Mrs Anne Killigrew Excellent in the Two Sister-Arts of Poesy and Painting: An Ode. Anne\u2019s family name Killigrew, is strongly linked to the Killigrews of Arwenack, Falmouth, who acted as governors for Pendennis Castle.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has indicated that cabinet norms of solidarity and secrecy will be applied to future intergovernmental meetings aiming to boost job creation, announcing the Council of Australian Governments \u201cis no more\u201d. After the latest meeting of the national cabinet on Friday, Morrison said the governing body composed of federal, state and territory leaders will replace Coag by continuing fortnightly teleconference meetings during the Covid-19 pandemic and monthly meetings thereafter. Morrison also announced a new $131.4bn five-year hospital funding agreement with the states, including an extra $31.4bn for public hospitals and a guarantee no jurisdiction will be left worse off by Covid-19 spending. Under the new federal structure, the council of federal financial relations \u2013 the treasurers\u2019 meeting \u2013 will gain responsibility for all intergovernmental partnership funding agreements. Morrison claimed the national cabinet \u201cwill be driven by a singular agenda, and that is to create jobs\u201d before adding that other issues, including women\u2019s safety, domestic violence, Indigenous affairs and closing the gap, will remain on the national agenda. National cabinet will be composed of reform committees on seven topics: rural and regional, skills, energy, housing, transport and infrastructure, population and migration, and health. Morrison announced a \u201ccongestion-busting\u201d plan to scrap regular meetings of other ministerial reform and regulatory councils attached to Coag, largely replicating a Tony Abbott era initiative which cut the number from 22 to eight, only to see the list grow again under Coalition federal governments. Bodies set to be \u201cconsolidated and reset\u201d including ministerial forums on tourism, trade, consumer affairs, sport and recreation, the environment, vehicle emissions, the Great Barrier Reef; and regulatory councils on disability, infrastructure, energy, education, health, the Murray-Darling and gene technology. \u201cMinisters will consider the value of each of those and I suspect we\u2019ll see many of them no longer be required,\u201d Morrison said. He said bureaucrats and ministers will still talk \u201cbecause they find value not because of a bureaucratic process\u201d. Once a year, the national cabinet will meet with the treasurers and the Australian Local Government Association to discuss federation reform. Morrison argued that \u201cone of the reasons why the national cabinet has worked\u201d is that it operated as a cabinet with \u201ccandour and collegiality\u201d and the same rules on \u201csecurity of documents\u201d as federal cabinet \u2013 which will also apply to the seven new committees. Morrison said the off-the-record get together with state and territory leaders the evening before Coag is \u201cthe best conversation you ever have\u201d without the \u201ctheatre \u2026 that can \u2026 restrict the genuine reform discussions\u201d. Morrison said that state and federal cabinets work in the same way and produce \u201cgood decisions that support essential services\u201d, dismissing concerns the moves will decrease transparency in federal relations. \u201cThis is just the same process. I mean, it\u2019s not a spectator sport.\u201d Earlier, the national cabinet was told there are now fewer than 500 active cases of Covid-19 in Australia. With daily infection rates remaining low, many states now have plans to move from stage two to stage three of the three-step plan to easing restrictions. Morrison told reporters eradication or elimination are not national cabinet policy, however, so the emergence of new cases should not result in governments abandoning the three-stage process. Regional differences in the implementation of that phased removal of restrictions remain. On Friday, the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, boasted that his state had \u201cled the way\u201d in many areas of easing restrictions. From Monday, South Australia will allow up to 80 people in pubs, clubs, and restaurants. In Victoria, the premier, Daniel Andrews, announced that from Monday the government will no longer prescribe the list of reasons to leave home but employees will still be required to work from home where possible. On Friday morning, Josh Frydenberg gave further indications that the federal government will extend the $70bn jobkeeper wage subsidy program or look to provide other support packages to sectors that continue to need help, including tourism and the housing sector. The Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, has warned that he doesn\u2019t want the government to \u201cwithdraw the fiscal stimulus too early.\u201d Despite repeated warnings that fiscal stimulus is temporary, Morrison rejected claims of a contradiction, labelling it a \u201cfalse difference\u201d and pointing to government spending such as accelerated infrastructure projects. Morrison noted there are \u201cmany forms of support\u201d other than the jobkeeper package. \u201cAnd we will target the best measures to do the job that we need it to do and that is to support people, staying in jobs, and getting back into jobs.\u201d Asked about his reform process for industrial relations, Morrison again refused to guarantee workers would not be worse off and the Better Off Overall Test for workplace pay deals will be retained. \u201cMy concern is if we keep going down the path that we\u2019re going down and have a discussion that is constrained in a whole range of ways based on things that used to be the norms before, then people are going to lose their jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they won\u2019t be better off.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The French carmaker Renault plans to cut 14,600 jobs as it aims to save \u20ac2bn (\u00a31.8bn) in one of the deepest restructuring programmes prompted by the coronavirus pandemic across the global car industry. Renault will cut 4,600 jobs in its French operations, which will undergo a major reorganisation, and another 10,000 around the world. The cost-cutting is on a similar scale to Nissan, Renault\u2019s alliance partner, which on Thursday announced the closure of its Barcelona car plant as part of a restructuring plan. The two companies have rejected proposals to merge their operations fully but have committed to letting one of the carmakers \u201clead\u201d in each global region. Renault said it would cut its global production capacity from 4m vehicles in 2019 to 3.3m by 2024, a marked change in strategy from the expansion planned by the ousted former leader Carlos Ghosn, now a fugitive from Japanese justice in Lebanon. Closures could include a foundry in Brittany and either the Douai or Maubeuge plants. Major changes will also be considered at factories in Flins and Dieppe. The carmaker will also abandon producing combustion engine cars in China, with Dongfeng buying out its joint-venture partner. The renewal of the Renault-Nissan alliance has led to reports that the French carmaker would consider having Nissan\u2019s Sunderland plant build two Renault models currently made in Spanish factories. However, Renault\u2019s interim chief executive, Clotilde Delbos, said on Friday that nothing had been decided on model allocation and it is understood that more detailed production plans will not be drawn up until after the incoming boss Luca de Meo begins work on 1 July. Renault\u2019s job cuts are likely to have been agreed with the French government, which has been in discussions about providing an emergency \u20ac5bn loan guarantee for the carmaker to get through the pandemic. However, the cuts come after Renault reported its first annual loss in a decade in February, before the worst of the pandemic. The French state owns 15% of the carmaker. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, this week said that electric car production should be the priority for the country\u2019s car industry as he announced \u20ac8bn in aid for the sector, not including the Renault loan. Renault\u2019s restructuring will result in its core French operations focusing more on battery electric cars, as European carmakers seek to meet tightening emissions limits. Delbos said: \u201cIn a context of uncertainty and complexity, this project is vital to guarantee a solid and sustainable performance, with customer satisfaction as a priority. \u201cBy capitalising on our many assets such as the electric vehicle, by capitalising on the resources and technologies of Groupe Renault and the alliance, and by reducing the complexity of development and production of our vehicles, we want to generate economies of scale to restore our overall profitability and ensure our development in France and internationally.\u201d",

measures is also temporary, limited to the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years and is not baking material structural burdens into the budget bottom line beyond that period.</p> \n  <p>Nevertheless, the April monthly financial statements reflect both the impact of the current economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on both revenue and payments as well as the fiscal impact of the additional economic support measures we have put in place since MYEFO 2019-20.</p> \n  <p><strong>Total payments to the end of April 2020 were $12bn higher than assumed in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</strong></p> \n  <p>These include payments through a range of measures including:</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 Boosting cash flow for employers</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 Economic stimulus payments \u2013 a one-off $750 stimulus payment to pensioners, social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 National Medical Stockpile \u2013 Purchase of Masks, Other Personal Protective Equipment and Pharmaceuticals; </p> \n  <p> \u00b7 National partnership agreement on a joint Covid-19 public health response; and</p> \n  <p> \u00b7 Partnership with private health sector to ensure viability and capacity during the Covid-19 response.</p> \n  <p>The impact of the pandemic on government revenue as a result of related economic parameter variations also remains significant, with receipts nearly $20bn lower than the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</p> \n  <p>This is driven by below profile collections across both income and indirect taxes.</p> \n  <p><strong>The underlying cash balance for the financial year to 30 April 2020 is a deficit of $40bn instead of a deficit to that point of $7.6bn in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile.</strong></p> \n </div> \n <p

The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong\u2019s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people\u2019s liberties and, in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous. </p> \n   <p>China\u2019s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people \u2013 including those set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. </p> \n   <p><strong>We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; </strong>the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year.</p> \n   <p><strong>The world\u2019s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing\u2019s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect.</strong></p> \n   <p>As Hong Kong\u2019s stability and prosperity are jeopardised by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honour China\u2019s international obligations under the UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T22:00:08.635Z\">at 11.00pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed02b088f0898700351e311\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T21:23:38.239Z\">10.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Courier Mail reports <strong>Nathan Turner,</strong> who died at his Blackwater home on Tuesday, and then later tested positive for Covid-19 (he had not previously been tested) <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/world/coronavirus/australia/coronavirus-nathan-turner-held-party-days-before-dying-from-covid19/news-story/69f8e4fc9a6500f03c351e2bf548bf14\">and his partner held a party at their home four days earlier. <br></a></p> \n  <p>The 30-year-old had been showing respiratory illness symptoms for some time before his death.

Historian Jenny Hocking has won a landmark high court case in her bid to secure sensitive correspondence between the Queen and former Australian governor general Sir John Kerr about the dismissal of Gough Whitlam. Alan Jones has turned off his microphone for the last time after taking a final congratulatory call from Scott Morrison and welcoming two of his biggest fans, Tony Abbott and Mark Latham, into the studio. Israel wants to introduce direct flights to Australia and waive quarantine requirements for travellers by December, and become a transit gateway for Australians flying to \u201cfirst mover\u201d European countries. Australia is considering allowing Pacific labourers to travel to Australia to work where possible as part of a new foreign aid \u201cpolicy pivot\u201d that includes the redirection of $280m from Australia\u2019s existing aid budget. More than 120 researchers and medical professionals from around the world have written an open letter to the editor of the Lancet raising serious concerns about a large and widely publicised global study that prompted the World Health Organisation to halt several Covid-19 clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine use. From me, Elias Visontay, have a great evening and weekend. Gordon Legal, the law firm leading a class action on behalf of robodebt victims, has said the government\u2019s \u201c$721m capitulation\u201d on Friday is \u201cjust the first step\u201d. James Naughton, a partner at the firm, said in a statement: We welcome the government\u2019s announcement that it has now conceded that it has to pay back the money it is holding unlawfully. Our clients do not consider that it is reasonable for the government, having now conceded that it acted unlawfully should unilaterally decide that it can take its time to pay it back and not be responsible to those affected for the loss and damage its unlawful conduct has caused. Our clients will also want the government to explain to the court why it made this announcement without any consultation with them or the court and has chosen not to address their claims for damages for the distress and inconvenience or the interest they are entitled to receive because the government has had the benefit of their money unlawfully. In our view any process undertaken will need to be approved by the court to ensure that the rights of those affected, including their right to claim damages and interest are safeguarded. Many of the more than 100,000 people who have now contacted us, have understandably lost faith in Services Australia and the government, and deserve to know how their entitlement to receive their money back is being calculated and administered. The Community and Public Sector Union, which represents Centrelink workers, has welcomed the refund of $721m to welfare recipients, but criticised the government services minister for waiting for \u201cthe fear of a class action\u201d to act. The CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said: Our members are experts, they are on the frontline of this work every day, and had they been listened to in the first place they could have saved Stuart Robert $721m. The government have called this a refinement, let\u2019s be clear, this program was an illegal money grab from vulnerable Australians. The Morrison government needs to do more than announce this late on a Friday afternoon, they need to apologise to those hundreds of thousands of Australians affected by this. For more on the $721m in robodebt repayments, my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes, who has written extensively on the subject, has filed this report: Opposition government services spokesman Bill Shorten has slammed Stuart Robert not just over the robodebt scheme, but also his decision to announce the $721m error at a Friday afternoon press conference on the Gold Coast. He is also calling on Robert to apologise to \u201cthe Australians they ripped off\u201d. The Morrison government has for months been denying its pet scheme is illegal but today that house of make believe has been torn down. When he put the emergency brakes on the scheme he said it was only \u201ca refinement\u201d affecting a \u201csmall cohort\u201d. This sneaky Friday afternoon take-out-the-trash moment with the minister hiding out on the Gold Coast does not end the class action trial which is just weeks away. At $721m this is already the biggest class action settlement in Australian legal history \u2013 and it is not settled yet. They will still have to account to the families who lost adult children to suicide because of robodebt, and for the various other harms, stresses and inconveniences caused. For Stuart Robert, sorry seems to be the hardest word. He should immediately front the Australian public and apologise to the multitude of robodebt victims who have suffered so much because of this scandal. Government services minister Stuart Robert says Australians who are owed money by the government won\u2019t \u201cneed to do anything in terms of getting a refund\u201d. He defends his actions as minister, and the ongoing role of debt collecting: The use of debt collectors is a long standing practice for government over many, many, many years where debt is validly raised and details aren\u2019t available, or the Australian citizen is not engaging with government. It\u2019s a long standing practice of government. The reason why it\u2019s taken since November when I updated that we\u2019re refining the program and that we would be pausing all debts is it\u2019s taken a while to identify all of the 373,000 Australians. We wanted to get that right. We wanted to also build out the platforms needed to do a large scale refund, something that government has not generally done in the past. On the class action against the debt recovery program, Robert says: It\u2019s a longstanding practice of governments not to comment on anything before the courts...there is a class action before the courts on this matter, I think we\u2019ll leave it at that. He adds: This is a program that started five years ago based on the best information at the time. I\u2019ve been the responsible minister for 12 months. As soon as information came to light to show there was a lack of sufficiency I moved quickly to pause all debts and refine the program as you\u2019d expect. I promised I\u2019d come back to the Australian people with updated information, which I\u2019m doing openly and transparently today. I\u2019m confident I have the right numbers, and I\u2019m confident I\u2019ve got the right systems to do the refund. At a press conference on the Gold Coast about the $721m blunder, government services minister Stuart Robert is asked if he should apologise to those affected. The government started this program over half a decade ago based on the best information at the time ... we\u2019re moving forward with the best information we have. To give you a bit of an idea of how such an error occurred, income averaging used an individual\u2019s tax office data of their yearly income and spread it over fortnightly value. It used this figure to check against the income lodged by a Centrelink recipient in any given reporting period, which meant that those Centrelink recipients who changed jobs or did not earn the same amount of money each fortnight, were forced to pay money back to the government for the weeks where they may have had higher Centrelink payments. This process drew criticism from those asked to pay back money, with a Melbourne woman winning a federal court case against the government after she challenged her debt. Interest was also charged on some of the payments. In a press release sent out minutes after the post-national cabinet press conference, minister for government services Stuart Robert has said the government \u201ctakes its responsibility for upholding the integrity of Australia\u2019s welfare system seriously\u201d. Refunding of the $721m will begin in July, and comes from 470,000 debts raised using income averaging from ATO data. From July this year, Services Australia will refund all repayments made on debts raised wholly or partially using income averaging of ATO data. Refunds will also be made for any interest charges and/or recovery fees paid on related debts. Services Australia has identified 470,000 debts raised wholly or partially using income averaging of ATO data. Refunding of eligible debts will commence in July and will continue through the 2020-21 financial year. The total value of refunds including fees and charges is estimated at $721m. Services Australia will now put in place the mechanisms needed to start making refunds, including how affected customers are advised of next steps. Consultation will occur with stakeholders, including the commonwealth ombudsman, and clear communication is a priority, so people understand what it means for them. It is important to note all other income compliance debts will continue to be subject to recovery, ensuring the integrity of Australia\u2019s welfare system. Robert is holding a press conference at 3.45pm. And on that note, I will place the blog in the very capable hands of Elias Visontay. I\u2019ll be back Monday morning. Have a wonderful weekend, and as always \u2013 take care of you. The national secretary of the key union at Virgin Australia, the Transport Workers Union, has welcomed news big Canadian player Brookfield Asset Management is back in the race to buy the airline. \u201cHaving serious bidders like Brookfield in the mix is a good thing because they bring a serious approach to it,\u201d Michael Kaine told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe more we have in there the better the outcome for workers.\u201d Kaine also had something to say about a PR blitz mounted by rival bidder Bain and its former diver boss, Mike Murphy, who gave interviews to two national papers yesterday. Murphy was an Olympic diver who finished fourth at Barcelona in 1992, a performance that if repeated here would once again see him fail to mount the winners\u2019 podium. \u201cWhatever the bidder, it\u2019s not so much their spruiking that\u2019s important, it\u2019s what they put in place,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to hear their messaging but it\u2019s what they come up with that\u2019s important.\u201d Meanwhile, administrator Vaughan Strawbridge said he\u2019ll be spending the weekend whittling the bidders down to a final two. \u201cThe next step in the process is to consider the proposals we receive today over the weekend, with a view to settling on a final short-list of two preferred parties early next week,\u201d Strawbridge said. \u201cThis next phase, which will include further engagement with stakeholders and aircraft financiers as they seek agreements on future terms ahead of binding bids being received, will be just as intense and defined by an ongoing focus to deliver the best possible commercial outcome for creditors, and see Virgin Australia restructured and out of administration as a strong and sustainable airline.\u201d Mark McGowan is now doing up his own snazzy tweets. Daniel Andrews is rubbing off on everyone in that national cabinet. Mathias Cormann\u2019s now-regular financial statements update has a lot of Morrison government rah-rah-rah about jobs, so you KNOW things are getting back to what it considers normal. As for the accounts, well, it\u2019s not so rosy: The fiscal impact of our historically significant support measures is also temporary, limited to the 2019-20 and 2020-21 financial years and is not baking material structural burdens into the budget bottom line beyond that period. Nevertheless, the April monthly financial statements reflect both the impact of the current economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on both revenue and payments as well as the fiscal impact of the additional economic support measures we have put in place since MYEFO 2019-20. Total payments to the end of April 2020 were $12bn higher than assumed in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile. These include payments through a range of measures including: \u00b7 Boosting cash flow for employers \u00b7 Economic stimulus payments \u2013 a one-off $750 stimulus payment to pensioners, social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders \u00b7 National Medical Stockpile \u2013 Purchase of Masks, Other Personal Protective Equipment and Pharmaceuticals; \u00b7 National partnership agreement on a joint Covid-19 public health response; and \u00b7 Partnership with private health sector to ensure viability and capacity during the Covid-19 response. The impact of the pandemic on government revenue as a result of related economic parameter variations also remains significant, with receipts nearly $20bn lower than the 2019-20 MYEFO profile. This is driven by below profile collections across both income and indirect taxes. The underlying cash balance for the financial year to 30 April 2020 is a deficit of $40bn instead of a deficit to that point of $7.6bn in the 2019-20 MYEFO profile. So a little bit of new information in there: The national cabinet will replace the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). It will meet once a month in \u2018normal times\u2019 and continue meeting once a fortnight during the pandemic. Leaders will meet face to face twice a year. National partnerships will be nutted out by the treasurers, at their meeting, with input from portfolio ministers. The states and federal government have struck a new hospital agreement worth $131bn over five years. Border reopenings were to be part of stage three, which is not expected to be implemented until July. Scott Morrison on the contracting media industry: Anyone who loses a job, that\u2019s a bad day. And as a government we\u2019re focused on creating jobs, whether it is the media sector and the announcements made by News, I spoke with Michael Miller yesterday, and it is a hard day for those who work in the sector, particularly in rural and regional areas. Whether it is a tradie or anyone else\u2019s job, we want to make sure we can get our economy performing more strongly than it is now as soon as we can so we can create those jobs again. That response continues: But, I think there\u2019s been quite an error being made to think that jobkeeper is the only economic support that the government is providing. That\u2019s not true. There are many, many, many forms of support that the government is providing. And we will target the best measures to do the job that we need it to do and that is to support people, staying in jobs, and getting back into jobs. That\u2019s what\u2019s the most important thing and what we\u2019re focused on and our programs will support that. We have been doing, and will continue to do, the fiscal heavy lifting that the Reserve Bank governor first said when we were back in Parramatta in March at what was the last Coag meeting. And it\u2019s important that we do that. And states do it with us. And I think $150bn in six months is some pretty heavy fiscal lifting. The Reserve Bank may have run out of ammo when it comes, largely to what they can do on cash rates, but the commonwealth government in particular has certainly stepped into the breach. And we\u2019ve done so significantly. And we anticipate that we\u2019ll need to do that for some time. But that doesn\u2019t mean that that requires you to do it in every single measure that we currently have out there. We\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility. Scott Morrison gives a very long answer in response to the question on whether or not he will take up Phil Lowe\u2019s advice that the stimulus packages may need to be continued beyond September: We\u2019ve had lots of advice on these matters and I think it\u2019s important to contextualise all of this. The government has many measures of support. JobKeeper, Jobseeker, cash flow assistance, targeted to industry sector support. And we are planning to ensure that the economy and jobs get the support they need to get us through this crisis and to get us out the other side. Jobkeeper and Jobseeker, and how they\u2019re currently framed, have got their legislative timeframe heading out to the end of September. But it is important to ensure that we come out of this crisis strongly and we continue to create jobs in our economy. And so we\u2019ve always been flexible about how we manage this. But what is important to know is that time goes on, more of the economy gets stronger. And more of your economy is less in need of those specific supports than it was at first. But some sectors of your economy will need them for longer. Now, whether that\u2019s in the measures you\u2019re talking about or in other measures, well, that\u2019s an option for the government to consider. WA is bringing back arms day. And chest and back and leg day. In shorts, shredding is back (along with a bunch of other things). Do you even lift bro? Would the prime minister be open to NSW starting travel with New Zealand? Morrison: The short answer to your first question is, yes. And the states are aware of that. If we\u2019re in a position to introduce a travel-safe zone between Australia and New Zealand at an early stage and we\u2019re aware of the epidemiology in New Zealand, on the same basis as here in Australia. And there are health officials have met on that in the past week and Brendan and I discussed that, Prime Minister Ardern and I discuss it regularly and we are progressing it well and for the jobs that will be created in the aviation sector in particular don\u2019t be held up on the decisions Premiers wish to make. I made it clear today the jobs in Qantas and Virgin, particularly those two airlines but others, that trans-Tasman channel being open is going to mean jobs for the aviation sector and flight attendants and baggage handlers and fuel operators, in the industry that has taken the biggest beating of all. Jacinda Ardern and I agree, the net benefits for our countries opening up to each other again is a strong one and we have both put ourselves in a position to do it. I can\u2019t see it with other countries, it is still a way off but we are looking forward to that day being sooner or later but I hope in Sydney and Melbourne you can get to the states and territories and Auckland at the same time but we\u2019ll see what happens There have been 6.1 million downloads of the CovidSafe app Scott Morrison: Now, under the three-step plan, it wasn\u2019t until step three that it was envisaged that there would be interstate travel. Now, whether you have a border or you don\u2019t have a border, formally put in place, step three of the plan, which was expected to be in place in July, is when that was expected to be the case. Now, I note that all states and territories are working towards that, whether they have borders or not. But the truth is, and I\u2019m sure, and this was discussed today, that it\u2019s preferable to be able to be in a situation where you don\u2019t have borders as soon as possible because obviously, that means that the tourism industries in particular and particularly with school holidays coming up, might be able to benefit from that travel. So, I think we\u2019ve got to keep the issue in perspective. We don\u2019t agree on everything. No one does. It would be a bit weird if they did in a democracy. And we have to bear in mind that in the vast majority of cases the states and territories have worked very well with the commonwealth on these issues and I remain optimistic common sense will prevail on the time table national cabinet has set out. Scott Morrison, asked about the border closures, says freight and business travel has continued. When it comes to tourism, or interstate travel for personal reasons, he says it was never really meant to be an option until stage three, which is planned for July. Which is what most of the closed states have been saying. Politician who built career as a pure political animal, now hopes politics can stay out of it: Where we can focus on an agenda and a clear purpose to create jobs, and I would expect at some point we might be able to nominate, certainly the federal government has a jobs target, and that can be the clear purpose of why we\u2019re meeting together every month. That\u2019s why we have the broader issue of the federation reform council to once a year deal with those broader important issues like domestic violence and our progress on closing the gap. It\u2019s about managing the agenda. It\u2019s about managing ourselves and I think it is about valuing what we have been able to create in these aren\u2019t recent months. We have met more time in the last few months than premiers and chief ministers and the prime minister has met in 10 years. Amazingly, something good has come from that. Much good. And we recognise that and want to preserve it. On whether politics will mess up the beautiful friendship of the current national cabinet, Scott Morrison says: Politics still exists and the environment, the media environment we operate in, which is very interested in conflict, that also exists and that\u2019s just how it is. And we\u2019re all experienced and professional politicians and leaders and we understand that. It is very much up to each of us to value what we\u2019ve been able to establish, I think, in the national cabinet and seek to preserve it. So national cabinet will meet, face to face, twice a year. The rest of the 10 meetings will be over teleconference. \u201cIt is a much more flexible way of working,\u201d says Scott Morrison. Professor Brendan Murphy steps up: An interesting statistic, there are only two people left on ventilators in Australia, a long way short of the 7,000 potential that we catered for in the worse-case scenario. We are doing 30,000 tests a day with a very low positivity rate of 0.05% at the moment. We would still like to do more tests. We would like every person with an acute respiratory problem, cough, cold, to get tested. It is the way to track the virus. Today I presented to National Cabinet the national surveillance plan, which is a document that shows how we\u2019re going to track surveillance of this virus in the coming months and that will be published on the Department of Health website and give you full information on all the things we\u2019re monitoring. I also presented the first report back on the Pandemic Health Intelligence Plan. You\u2019ll recall that that was the plan that we used to convinceb National Cabinet that we were in a fit state to start easing restrictions and that was the basis before people moved to step one of the three-step plan. That first report really is only on two weeks\u2019 worth of data because most restrictions were relaxed two weeks ago. As the Prime Minister said, it is too early to draw definitive conclusions but we are on track. All the measures we thought should be stable and in good shape remain in good shape at the moment. But in two weeks, it\u2019s not possible to be absolutely sure - and we do need to watch the data over the next one to two weeks - to make sure that we\u2019re not getting more than the expected small outbreaks that we do expect to see as we relax restrictions. Left out of that is local government. And of course, any mention of whether or not we will ever have something resembling that terrible awkward press conference held after each Coag, ever again. So it\u2019s all about federation reform. Scott Morrison: Federation reform issues and responsibilities between states and territories and the Commonwealth will be considered at the National Cabinet because we think that gives Australians confidence. And this really is a job of rebuilding confidence, right across the country. And that includes confidence in our governance and making sure that all governments are works closely together and in particular that we\u2019re doing so to get Australians back into work. The final details of which ministerial groups are set in this area, as I said, the consolidation that takes place in the other areas, that will come in time. But we\u2019ve agreed on the new structure and we think that will ensure for Australians that get better government, more focused government at a state and federal level. Scott Morrison: It\u2019s important that ministers at state and federal level talk to each other but they don\u2019t have to do it in such a bureaucratic form with a whole bunch of paperwork attached to it. They need to talk to each other, share ideas, but the congestion busting process is simplifying that. That come together to solve issues and move on. They talk because they find value not because of a bureaucratic process. There are councils that are created under statutes, particularly the Disability Reform Council, the ministers have roles under legislation and there are a number of others but we will look to consolidate and reset those. We want to stream line those endless meetings so we can bring it back to one focus: Creating jobs out of the back of this crisis and ensuring the federation is focused on that job just like we have been focused as a National Cabinet on managing the country through our federation through this national crisis of COVID-19. So, that is an exciting new agenda for our federation. Canadian investment giant Brookfield Asset Management will re-enter the race for ownership of Virgin Australia, Guardian Australia has learned. The group, which was favoured by unions and parts of Virgin\u2019s management, dropped out of the race over uncertainty about issues including how the airline will bridge a four to six week gap between a sale and new ownership being approved by creditors during which it will have no cash. Indicative bids close today and administrators from Deloitte will then whittle the race down to two players. Bidders already in the race are American investment group Bain Capital, global investor Cyrus Capital, a consortium made up of investment group Oaktree Capital and specialist airline investor Indigo Partners and Australian private equity group BGH Capital. Scott Morrison on the new, permanent, national cabinet: The National Cabinet will be driven by a singular agenda, and that is to create jobs. It will have a job-making agenda. And the National Cabinet will drive the reform process between state and federal cooperation to drive jobs. It will drive a series of ministerial cabinet subcommittees, if you like, that will be working in each of the key areas, and in addition an initial list of areas and that will be further consulted on with the states. So in rural and regional Australia, on skills as I was talking to the National Press Club just this week on energy, housing, infrastructure, population migration and transportation and having a healthy workforce and a healthy community to support a strong economy. The National Cabinet will continue to work with a laser-like mission focus on creating jobs as we come out of the COVID crisis and we work into the years into the future. The National Cabinet will work together, with what is known as the council and federal financial relations, that is basically the meeting of treasurers. They met today. Those treasurers will take responsibility for all the funding agreements for the states and the Commonwealth. The treasurers will bring them together, consulting with the portfolio ministers but being responsible for all the agreements. Coag is dead. Long live the national cabinet. Scott Morrison says the leaders will continue to meet as they have been, every two weeks at the moment, and then, every month as life moves on from the pandemic crisis. A new hospital agreement has been struck, Scott Morrison says: Today, an agreement that will see an investment by the commonwealth of an estimated $131.4bn be made in a demand-driven public-hospital funding model to improve health outcomes for all Australians to ensure the sustainability of our health system now and into the future. The new 20-25 national health reform agreement provides an additional $34.4bn in funding to public hospitals from July 1 this year. This is in addition to the over $8 billion in investment made by the Commonwealth during the COVID-19 response. There is also as part of our agreement, a funding guarantee to all states and territories to ensure no jurisdiction is left worse off as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and guarantees the Commonwealth\u2019s funding contribution for public hospitals over the next five years. Now, this agreement, importantly, includes funding to provide life-saving immuno therapies to Australians suffering with conditions, in particular cancer, the carte cell therapies. These can cost half a million in treatment. That\u2019s what you can do when you can guarantee the essentials that Australians rely on and the economy is what enables us to provide that support. Scott Morrison is putting the brakes on any suggestion the pandemic is over in Australia: What are the expectations? Are our expectations of zero cases? No. That has never been our expectation, nor our goal. Eradication? Elimination? These are not the goals that we have. If it\u2019s achieved as a by-product then well and good. But the fact that a case or a group of cases may present is not something that should restrict moving ahead and getting progress on implementing the three-step plan and bringing Australia\u2019s economy back to a COVID-safe environment in which jobs can be restored and livelihoods can be restored. The second point I\u2019d make is this: that is the risk remains great and always has been. Australia\u2019s success can lead some to think that perhaps the risk was never there in the first place? But that is not true. We only need to look at countries as sophisticated as ours, as developed as ours, with health systems as strong as ours, who have death rates 100 times of what has occurred in Australia. So, we would be foolish to think that we were immune or that we are immune. And as a result, the three-step plan, keeping the balance between the health management of the crisis and the economic management of the crisis in balance, continues to be the balance that the National Cabinet seeks to achieve and I believe is achieving. But it is still too early to work out if life can continue as a \u2018new normal\u2019. Scott Morrison: I want to thank, again, all the premiers and chief ministers \u2013 sure, from time to time there are points of difference and frustrations and things I have no doubt that Australians would like to be moving faster than they are. But we outlined a plan and we\u2019re implementing that plan. The premiers are getting on with that plan and we still have an enormous amount of work to do in the months that are ahead. And that is to both manage, as always, and suppress, the virus, and to ensure that we can reopen our economy. And our economy is reopening. We continue to receive the information and the data that is showing an improvement and an economy that, while it has been severely impacted when compared to economies overseas, which have been subject to far more onerous restrictions than Australia, not just on the health front but on the economic front, is fairing much better. So, when we assessed where the plan was at today, we also took advice from the AHPPC, the expert medical panel and Prof Murphy, and the full health impacts of the first step of that plan, it is still too early to make a judgement what the health results of that are and it will be a week or two before we can see Australians move out of their homes, go back into work places and slowly go into playgrounds and schools are all these things they have been looking forward to doing for so long. Scott Morrison acknowledges it is the first national cabinet in a fortnight \u2013 and there are slides! He says Australia has made faster progress than anyone could have anticipated back in March. Those border closures were obviously a pretty big discussion point during the first national cabinet meeting in two weeks. Steven Marshall says South Australia will be keeping its borders closed for now: There was extensive discussion with regards to the borders, and it\u2019s probably no surprise to anybody that there was no agreement across this issue. But what we are doing at the national cabinet level is continuing to discuss this issue, and looking to provide greater certainty going forward. So, we know, in South Australia, that we have the transition committee, which has been established. And they are looking very carefully at the easing of the borders. It\u2019s likely to be done in an incremental way in South Australia. It\u2019s likely to be done with those jurisdictions with low or no numbers, and certainly those jurisdictions with no community transmission, before we would look to opening up our borders more broadly. In terms of international borders, there has been no decision taken whatsoever with regards to the easing of our national borders. Now, we\u2019ve said right from day one that we are interested in potentially the Australia-New Zealand bubble at some point in the future. That will ultimately be a federal decision rather than a national cabinet decision. But that\u2019s not something which we have arrived at a position on. South Australia, which still has closed borders, has decided to allow pubs and clubs to open up to up to 80 people from early next week. Steven Marshall: As we know South Australia has led the way in many areas. In fact, as of Monday, we will have up to 80 people in our pubs, clubs, restaurants here, and cafes here in South Australia. We\u2019ve led the way in terms of education. We\u2019ve led the way in terms of intrastate travel, lifting the bans on elective surgery, and on dentistry, and we have been trying to do what we can to safely open up our economy as quickly as possible. South Australian premier Steven Marshall says one of the issues discussed at national cabinet today, was the advice from the expert health committee on wearing masks: One of the issues which was discussed was the wearing of masks. It was decided that this would become something going forward that would be up to individual commuters, it would be a matter of choice. It\u2019s still not the strong advice of AHPPC to wear them or to not wear them, but people should be offered the choice of wearing them. Whether that be on an airline or whether it be on public transport. But the strong position of the AHPPC is that this cannot obfuscate people\u2019s responsibility to not get on to public transport if they are unwell. Many people put on a mask, they put it on incorrectly, and so we\u2019ve got to be very, very clear - if you are unwell, you must stay home. You must observe all of the hygiene matters. These are also not thrown out the window because you are wearing a mask. So, the position on that is very clear. The ACT has recorded no new cases. Again. In fact, it has reported no new cases for so long, ACT Health has decided to no longer put out daily updates, unless something changes. There have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 107. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 17,267 with 305 test results received in the past 24 hours. The nation\u2019s local government associations have come together (a tougher ask than you would know) to call on the federal and state governments to give councils a seat at the table, if national cabinet continues. Everyone from Scott Morrison down has expressed interest in continuing the national cabinet - which is just Coag, but non-political and competent - and local governments believe they need to be part of the conversation. Which, given they have to enact a lot of the decisions, makes sense. From the release: Local government leaders from across the country have united to call on prime minister Scott Morrison and first ministers to ensure they do not leave councils and their communities in the dark at a time when it has never been more important to ensure all three levels of government are working together. Councils are currently represented at COAG via the Australian Local Government Association under a long-standing agreement. Local Government Association of Queensland President, Sunshine Coast Mayor Mark Jamieson said this arrangement must transfer to National Cabinet should it replace COAG going forward. \u201cNational Cabinet is a powerful body making decisions that affect communities across the country. Councils, as the level of government closest to the community, must be in discussions when decisions are being made,\u201d Mayor Jamieson said. New South Wales Local Government President, City of Sydney Councillor Linda Scott urged State and Territory leaders to advocate on behalf of local government and their communities to ensure their representation is not diminished. Cr Scott said the Covid pandemic had shown just how important local leadership and the essential services local government provides, from the local main street to the local park and pool, are. \u201cLocal governments deliver - at the forefront of every disaster and as the backbone of every nation-building program,\u201d Cr Scott said. There we go - 1.45pm It\u2019s in the main committee room, which is the least fancy of the prime minister press conference locations, so it can\u2019t be a big one. We should hear from the prime minister very soon Treasurer Josh Frydenberg might think government support can be withdrawn from much of the economy in September, but outside the Canberra bubble businesses are still running into strife. Retailer PAS Group, which employs about 1,300 people and owns brands including Review, Fiorelli and Jets swimwear, has called in administrators from PwC to restructure the business. It said it would continue to trade while in administration, telling the ASX: While the board is of the view that the company is solvent, given the issues as a result of unfavourable financial market conditions, the Covid-19 crisis and the challenges of restructuring in that environment, it felt that administration was the best way to affect change while protecting all stakeholders. PAS Group enters voluntary administration with the strong desire to restructure the group and allow it to continue operating strongly and sustainably into the future. With the great lockdown gradually easing, a lot of people are finding the transition back to \u201cnormal\u201d life, whatever that looks like now, difficult. Just remember \u2013 you are not alone in that. It\u2019s a little overwhelming going from an environment you completely control, back into one with so many variables. Particularly if your brain chemistry already leaves you prone to experiencing increased anxiety. But what you are feeling is valid. And completely normal. AAP has had a look at some of those feelings: Mental health professionals are now looking to the post-isolation stage, which could cause as much anxiety for many, just as going into lockdown did. The Autism Awareness Australia chief executive officer, Nicole Rogerson, said while autism is different for everyone, there have been additional challenges to come with it during isolation. For school-aged children, the lockdown and subsequent school closures were very challenging for children who either didn\u2019t understand the change or who struggled with the indefinite nature of the timing of the lockdown. Some children might have liked the reduced demands of school and social situations but many also found great anxiety with the change of routine. Rogerson said for adults with autism, the social isolation was welcomed by some. The shared anxiety of Covid uncertainties has been difficult for many. The return to work, with the ongoing threat of an invisible virus, is very stressful for individuals with autism. The chief executive of national mental health charity SANE, Jack Heath, said as Australia went into lockdown their online forums spiked, with participant numbers doubling from 3,000 to 6,000 per week in March. Heath said many of the problems were around existing mental health issues being amplified and it was important to meet these long-term needs after isolation. As restrictions ease, Heath said it was understandable for people to be feeling anxious given how uncertain times are. Heath\u2019s advice is to reach out for help and take stock of any positives to have come from isolation. Do a list \u2013 two, three, four or five things that were positive and take that with you moving forward. The lead clinical advisor at Beyond Blue, Dr Grant Blashki, also expects many may find coming out of isolation overwhelming. When Beyond Blue launched it\u2019s coronavirus specific support service on 9 April, it received 6,300 emails and more than 180,000 visits to the website, Blashki said. The kinds of issues presented were around isolation, pressure-cooker households with lots of kids, unemployment and stress about infection \u2013 things that will not simply go away as lockdown ends. Blashki said as people begin to re-enter society, for anyone feeling anxious it is important to be gentle with yourself and set some ground rules when it comes to communication with others. Re-engage in small steps, catch up with people who aren\u2019t too full-on and in smaller groups \u2013 go out for a coffee, not to a party if it\u2019s too much. Autism Awareness Australia: 1300 900 681 SANE: 1800 187 263 Beyond Blue coronavirus hotline: 1800 512 348 Ken Wyatt has conceded that his hopes of a referendum on constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australia in this term of parliament (by 2022) are not likely to be realised. The minister for Indigenous affairs said: Our first priority is ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all Indigenous Australians throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. We have also been progressing work on the development of an Indigenous voice, and the refresh of the Closing the Gap agreement. Constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians is too important to rush, and too important to fail. I have always said that a referendum would be held when there was broad consensus on the wording, and when it had the best possible chance of success. The last time such a question was put to the Australian people was in 1999. We can\u2019t afford to have constitutional recognition defeated and off the agenda for another 20 years because we rush this process. Covid-19 has presented many challenges. Infortunately a referendum is unlikely in this term of government. This is too important to rush and too important to fail. And I don\u2019t want this to fail. Also from the ABS\u2019s latest Covid report: The survey also found that one in eight Australian adults (13%) provided unpaid care to a vulnerable person outside their household because of Covid-19. Around three in five people provided this care on at least a weekly basis (61%). Family members were the most common recipients of this unpaid care (80%) and shopping was the most common activity for which assistance was provided (80%). A further 23% of Australian adults said they needed to increase the level of unpaid care for a vulnerable person within their household because of Covid-19. Nature is healing, so cruise ships are returning. Naturally. Oceania cruises has unveiled its new advertising campaign to entice people back aboard \u2013 it\u2019s going with \u201cremember the future\u201d. This should also not come as a surprise: Schools closing was a bit of a chicken-and-an-egg situation. In the end, states closed the schools because parents weren\u2019t sending them. The ABS has the data on just how many kids were kept home: New Zealand has reported it has just one (known) active case of Covid in the whole country. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has this morning responded to Reserve Bank governor Phil Lowe\u2019s warning that he doesn\u2019t want the government to \u201cwithdraw the fiscal stimulus too early.\u201d Frydenberg had a different emphasis on that evidence, telling Channel Nine\u2019s Today show: Well, the governor yesterday had a number of important things to say. Firstly, he said it was very good news that the government will be spending $60bn less on jobkeeper as a result of the economy being stronger than we first thought. Secondly, he said is was very sensible that we are doing a review at the midway point of the jobkeeper program. And thirdly, he said that due to the economic uncertainty that we find ourselves in, it is really too early to say what additional support should be given. Frydenberg dropped some hints about the way forward in terms of economic stimulus: I can tell you that the jobkeeper program is estimated to have around 3.5 million people on it, it will cost around $70bn, so it\u2019s the biggest spending program of its kind Australia has ever seen. And it\u2019s legislated out to September. We know that there will be some sectors that will continue to need support, for example tourism, as the international borders remain closed. Also, construction in the housing sector will be important to give support and we are thinking through those options. But as for additional measures, it is right now too early to say. As a sidenote, our Pacific neighbours are more than capable of creating their own content, so we should probably be looking at funding that, rather than forcing them to endure repeats of propaganda like Border Force. Labor isn\u2019t too happy with the government\u2019s Pacific TV plan. Michelle Rowland and Pat Conroy say the lukewarm reception to the plan shows its failings: While the Morrison government has been cutting the ABC and diminishing Australia\u2019s soft power, China has been making significant investments in its global media footprint and growing its reach and influence in the region. The ABC is Australia\u2019s national and international broadcaster and is underutilised in the region as a result of successive Liberal National government budget cuts. These cuts forced the cessation of shortwave radio and cuts to ABC international media services that have seen China move in on. The recent ABC submission on strengthening Australia\u2019s relationship with countries in the Pacific region (April 2020) sets out a host of ways in which, with greater resourcing, the ABC\u2019s public diplomacy role could be strengthened. If Morrison wants to demonstrate his commitment to the Pacific, he must bolster the ABC \u2013 which is massively underfunded compared to its foreign counterparts \u2013 and he cannot ignore Pacific voices. Everybody needs good neighbours, and it is well past time that Australia stepped up its efforts in the Pacific. National cabinet should be finished in the early afternoon, so we\u2019ll bring you any decisions then. Over in the States, Trump is obviously focusing on the most important issues \u2013 Twitter factchecking his tweets. Shadow arts minister Tony Burke was on Radio National this morning renewing Labor\u2019s calls for a federal arts rescue package in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. There\u2019s a few different ways the government could cut a rescue package but they can\u2019t continue to do nothing in this area. Since the Covid-19 crisis hit Australia full throttle in early March, the federal government\u2019s emergency support for the arts sector has comprised a $27m support package targeted to regional arts funding and Indigenous arts organisations, and the Australia Council repurposing $5m of its existing funding for quick-release grants for artists. The federal offerings to support the industry pale in comparison to many of the states, particularly Victoria, where the Andrews government has committed a total of $51.1m in funding across major institutions, the small to medium sector, individual artists, festivals and music. Burke noted the complexity of arts infrastructure and the diversity of jobs within it, focusing particularly on contractors working show-to-show, receiving sporadic payments that would complicate jobkeeper and jobseeker arrangements. As Ben Eltham wrote for the Guardian this week: The flaws in jobkeeper\u2019s design are also acute in the cultural sector. Much of the employment in arts and culture is short-term and casual, and for these workers the 12-month eligibility rule for jobkeeper has been particularly cruel. Burke said he was \u201crelaxed\u201d about the actual mechanisms by which a federal rescue package could be administered, suggesting forward contracts, agent relationships and the duration of ongoing work in an industry could be structures used to help disperse a tailored package. It\u2019s not only the artists themselves, we also need to make sure the venues still exist on the other side of this. There\u2019s a complexity to this industry that means it does need a tailored approach. The fake crowd noise was a lot to deal with. But rugby league is back. Siri, show me Australia\u2019s leadership: You can read about that decision here: Some more good news: Letters between the Queen and the governor general who dismissed Gough Whitlam should be released, the High Court has ruled. The judgment handed down on Friday comes after a legal battle by historian Jenny Hocking, who says keeping them secret only fuels public distrust. The so-called palace letters between Buckingham Palace and Sir John Kerr about the time of the 1975 dismissal had been deemed personal communications by the National Archives of Australia and the federal court. (AAP) Angus Taylor has released the latest greenhouse gas data: Today the Morrison government released the December 2019 quarterly update of Australia\u2019s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. In 2019, emissions fell 0.9% or 5.0m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e) to 532.5 Mt CO2-e. Emissions are now 13.7% below 2005 levels (the baseline year for the Paris Agreement). Emissions for the December quarter 2019 also fell 0.5% or 0.6 Mt CO2-e on the previous quarter, on a seasonally adjusted, weather normalised basis. Scott Morrison phoned in for Alan Jones\u2019s last day on radio, where the Sydney radio 2GB shockjock allowed himself one last humblebrag with a prime minister: Morrison: How are you? Have you had a good morning? Jones: Oh well, it\u2019s a bit overwhelming, to be honest with you. It\u2019s a bit overwhelming, but I never imagined it was like this. But people are very kind, as you know, and I think they\u2019re very fair. Morrison: Well, they\u2019re very appreciative, mate, of the 35 years. I mean, people who are listening to you over the last few years or longer than that. It\u2019s an extraordinary career by any estimation. And beyond that, there\u2019s a broader contribution to public life on so many issues, which your program this morning is rehearsing all of those. But can I recall one on behalf of the grateful members of the Southern Districts Rugby Club. Back in 2007, I was running for parliament and that year the then-New South Wales rugby union was trying to boot Southern Districts out of the premiership, together with Penrith and who are sadly \u2026 sorry, not Penrith, Illawarra and Penrith. And you stood up with us and, I mean, you came out to the club and you\u2019ve been to the club many times since then. And Southern Districts has gone on from strength to strength since then and so I\u2019m sure all of them would want me to pass on to you, mate, our thanks for that. But there are so many stories like that everyone can tell. Some were at a big national global scale, but some of them are just saving a great footy club. So, mate, thanks very much, and Jenny and I want to wish you all the best for your future. The entire direction as sent out by the Victorian premier: If you have been working from home in Victoria, you have to continue working from home. It is no longer a request The nurse\u2019s trip to Malaysia in late March has also only recently been disclosed. The woman tested positive for Covid on 14 May, but made a sightseeing trip to Blackwater in the second week of May. She has told authorities she did not leave her car. Nathan Turner is believed to have been showing Covid symptoms before the nurse\u2019s trip to his town, but authorities are trying to work out how he contracted the virus. Dr Jeannette Young says contact tracers are going through all possibilities: I don\u2019t have any of the specifics because the story has changed so many times \u2013 I think it is best that we wait for the investigation and we sort it out. The most important thing here is that if anyone, anywhere in the state, has any symptoms \u2013 no matter how mild \u2013 that they come forward and get tested. That way, we will manage, no matter what information we get from different people. The testing is the most important thing we can do. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, says contact tracers are now trying to work out the exact movements of the nurse \u2013 who said she stopped in Blackwater but did not get out of her car \u2013 given the changing story: That\u2019s part of the investigation that\u2019s currently being finalised, and it\u2019s very, very important that we\u2019re able to do that and get some additional information from that individual, because her story has changed over the time frame. Q: What\u2019s changed? JY: That\u2019s all part of the investigation. What\u2019s changed? I can\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s part of the investigation. She gave us one story and then, subsequent to that, we\u2019ve found out additional information. So we need to try and untangle and sort that through. That\u2019s very, very important. But the good news is that no resident in the North Rockhampton Nursing Centre contracted the virus. That is very, very good news. Via AAP: A school in Melbourne\u2019s north-west has closed after a student tested positive to coronavirus, a week after a teacher was confirmed to be infected. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said on Friday that Keilor Downs Secondary College will be closed for cleaning after a student tested positive. The student probably was infectious on-site on the 26th of this month and was notified yesterday,\u201d he told reporters. The student was associated with a cluster of five members of a household who tested positive to the virus on Thursday. There is no evidence of a link between the student and the staff member who had tested positive last Friday, as the teacher had no exposure to the school site, authorities say. A St Albans Secondary College student and six students at Taylors Lakes Secondary College have been identified as close contacts of the infected student, who attended a VET class while infected. Those students, as well as any other known contacts, will also enter quarantine. There were seven new Covid-19 cases recorded in the state on Friday, with three discovered through routine testing, two in returned travellers in hotel quarantine and two cases under investigation. Steven Miles is holding Queensland\u2019s daily press conference with that state\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young. In light of the conflicting stories from the nurse who worked in Rockhampton while ill, including while waiting for her (eventually positive) Covid test to return, Miles says it is crucial people be honest during the contact tracing time: Today marks two weeks since the confirmed case at the North Rockhampton Nursing Centre. That two-week period is normally what we would consider the safe incubation period. In that time, we\u2019ve performed 1,500 tests on Rockhampton locals. All of them have come back negative. The investigation is underway, but it is great news that we can declare that that outbreak is over, with just that one case \u2013 quite an incredible outcome. It\u2019s also been a very good test for our rapid response capability. That capability will be handy to us in the future when we have future cases. I want to finally say that, when our public health officials contact you, no matter what it\u2019s about, it is incredibly important that you are honest, truthful and fulsome in what you tell them. Lives are literally at risk. Our public health officials are doing their best to keep Queenslanders safe and it is incredibly important that, if they contact you, you tell them the truth. The contact tracing in Blackwater, where 30-year-old Nathan Turner died on Tuesday, later testing positive for Covid-19, continues to be a nightmare. There have been no cases of Covid-19 in Blackwater, leaving authorities scrambling to work out how Nathan contracted the virus. AAP has more: A nurse who might have spread coronavirus to a Queensland town did not tell investigators she\u2019d recently been to Malaysia. Authorities are investigating how a man in the small town of Blackwater became infected with Covid-19 before his death on Tuesday. Nathan Turner, 30, had not left his central Queensland community since February. Anxiety in the town is high with three fever clinics now operating, and sewage to be tested, to determine if there is any local transmission. Authorities are investigating potential sources of Turner\u2019s infection. They include whether there are any links to an infected Rockhampton nurse who went on a sight-seeing road trip to Blackwater during the coronavirus lockdown. Queensland Health has said the nurse made the trip in the second week of May, before she tested positive for coronavirus on 14 May. The next day, chief health officer Jeannette Young said the woman had shown symptoms for the illness from 5 May and was believed to be infectious from 3 May. The same nurse had continued to go to work at a state-run Rockhampton aged care home while she had symptoms and was awaiting the test results. Heath minister Steven Miles has said the nurse was unlikely to have infected Turner in Blackwater. The minister said she\u2019d claimed not to have exited her car while in Blackwater. He also noted Turner had developed symptoms before the nurse\u2019s trip. But new details have emerged about her travel history, including an undisclosed trip to Kuala Lumpur in late March. A spokesman for the Nurses Professional Association of Queensland, which is representing the woman, has told the Australian the nurse wasn\u2019t required to offer up information about her Malaysia trip, and \u201cit was irrelevant\u201d. \u201cThe only questions she was asked was about her movements before she was diagnosed,\u201d the newspaper quoted the spokesman as saying. The spokesman also gave different dates for the nurse\u2019s visit to Blackwater. He said she went there on 11 April, before Turner fell ill in early May. The spokesman said the nurse had self-isolated for 14 days after returning from Kuala Lumpur. \u201cOur member finishes her self-isolation on April 10 and the next day she went to a lookout to see the sunrise, and then drove into Blackwater, took a picture and left,\u201d he told the newspaper. A Queensland Health spokesman has not commented on the discrepancy in the dates. The Australian War Memorial will re-open from 1 July: As the ACT moves to ease COVID-19 restrictions, the Memorial will reopen to the public in accordance with a COVID-safe business plan and ACT Government-recommended measures to prioritise staff and public safety. Visitors will need to book free, timed tickets to visit the Memorial to ensure social distancing can be maintained on site. Separate free, timed entry tickets to attend the Last Post Ceremony will also be made available. A little more from AAP on the changes to NSW\u2019s restrictions: NSW will ease coronavirus restrictions on religious services, weddings and funerals from Monday, when measures to increase pub and restaurant patronage come into effect. Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Friday said in a statement that from June 1, up to 20 people could attend weddings, 50 at funerals and 50 at places of worship. However, strict social distancing guidelines would continue to apply. \u201cWe know how important these services are to individuals and families but as we ease restrictions further, we must remember to keep one another safe,\u201d Ms Berejiklian said. \u201cIt is crucial that worshippers remember to follow health advice. This is particularly important for people with co-morbidities aged over 50 and people aged over 70.\u201d The government had been wary about adjusting the restrictions on places of worship after observing COVID-19 outbreaks in churches and church choirs overseas. But state religious leaders pushed for the relaxation after the government last week announced up to 50 people would be allowed to dine in restaurants, pubs and cafes from June 1. NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant outlined the risks requiring management. \u201cPlaces of worship will be asked to find alternatives to practices that might spread the virus, like singing, sharing books and even passing around the collection plate,\u201d Dr Chant said on Friday. \u201cCommunal singing and chanting should not occur because of the high risk of transmission.\u201d The government has been laying the breadcrumbs for extending jobkeeper for a week or two now. Here is Peter Dutton on the Nine network this morning: Well, ultimately that\u2019s a decision for the prime minister and for the treasurer. But I think clearly the government has shown we have been able to implement the jobkeeper, double the payment that was otherwise paid to people who are unemployed through the jobseeker payment and we want businesses to recover. We want jobs to be at the centre of every decision we make. So I think we are flexible and we will look at the way in which we could help businesses and people get back to a normal way of life. But there is a way to go yet as we know. This seems about right Marise Payne, Francois-Philippe Champagne, Dominic Raab and Mike Pompeo have come together to release a statement on Hong Kong. I cannot even begin to imagine how many hours went into each word. Probably one of the reasons it took so long. The foreign ministers (and equivalents) statement reads: Signatories to this statement reiterate our deep concern regarding Beijing\u2019s decision to impose a national security law in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has flourished as a bastion of freedom. The international community has a significant and long-standing stake in Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability. Direct imposition of national security legislation on Hong Kong by the Beijing authorities, rather than through Hong Kong\u2019s own institutions as provided for under Article 23 of the Basic Law, would curtail the Hong Kong people\u2019s liberties and, in doing so, dramatically erode Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and the system that made it so prosperous. China\u2019s decision to impose the new national security law on Hong Kong lies in direct conflict with its international obligations under the principles of the legally-binding, UN-registered Sino-British Joint Declaration. The proposed law would undermine the One Country, Two Systems framework. It also raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, and undermines existing commitments to protect the rights of Hong Kong people \u2013 including those set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We are also extremely concerned that this action will exacerbate the existing deep divisions in Hong Kong society; the law does nothing to build mutual understanding and foster reconciliation within Hong Kong. Rebuilding trust across Hong Kong society by allowing the people of Hong Kong to enjoy the rights and freedoms they were promised can be the only way back from the tensions and unrest that the territory has seen over the last year. The world\u2019s focus on a global pandemic requires enhanced trust in governments and international cooperation. Beijing\u2019s unprecedented move risks having the opposite effect. As Hong Kong\u2019s stability and prosperity are jeopardised by the new imposition, we call on the Government of China to work with the Hong Kong SAR Government and the people of Hong Kong to find a mutually acceptable accommodation that will honour China\u2019s international obligations under the UN-filed Sino-British Joint Declaration. The Courier Mail reports Nathan Turner, who died at his Blackwater home on Tuesday, and then later tested positive for Covid-19 (he had not previously been tested) and his partner held a party at their home four days earlier. The 30-year-old had been showing respiratory illness symptoms for some time before his death. He had what authorities describe as a \u201ccomplicated\u201d medical history. His partner has also been showing symptoms and is in isolation. Queensland Health authorities are now trying to test the 20 guests, to ensure a Covid outbreak has not hit central Queensland. Another day, another restriction relaxation. This time, up to 20 people will be able to gather at weddings and up to 50 people will be able to attend a funeral in New South Wales, from Monday. Queensland will announce its stage two on Sunday. The ACT will move to gatherings of up to 20 people (a room, depending on its size) from Saturday. Little freedoms people probably won\u2019t take for granted (for at least six months) are slowly returning. The national cabinet will meet again today for the first time in two weeks. Don\u2019t be fooled by the border barney the leaders have been engaged in \u2013 when it comes to national cabinet, they manage to get their shiz together. And it\u2019s Alan Jones\u2019s last day on radio. How can you be mad on a day like that? We\u2019ll bring you all the days events as they happen. You have Amy Remeikis at the blog helm until 3pm and the entire Guardian brains trust at your disposal. Ready?",

Kalvi Nadarajah\u2019s mother, 72, has become a \u201cscreen-sharing Zoom expert\u201d, conducting daily online learning sessions with Nadarajah\u2019s six-year-old daughter. This has helped Nadarajah work from home, and ensured her daughter has continued to progress with support as she works through the online resources provided by the school. It has also brought the family closer together and kept lockdown isolation at bay. \u201cIt\u2019s great for their relationship too as they are spending far more time together than pre-lockdown given the physical distance between us and keeping my mother who lives on her own occupied when she was really starting to feel the isolation,\u201d Nadarajah said. \u201cMy 20-year-old physics undergrad niece, Cara, is stuck at home in the Midlands \u2013 missing her mates, boyfriend, social life \u2013 and dedicates an hour a week to teach my reluctant eight-year-old maths,\u201d said Mary Rawlinson. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t especially interested when I suggested the idea, but when I mentioned it again, he agreed, and after his first session he came off absolutely buzzing.\u201d Rawlinson\u2019s son has gained newfound enthusiasm for studying maths, and is now learning material set for children two years his senior. \u201cShe has enthused him so much he was disappointed once when we forgot the lesson time and had to see if she could squeeze us in late,\u201d Rawlinson said. \u201cHe came away from the lesson thrilled and smiling after adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators \u2013 I\u2019m not sure many of us could do that.\u201d \u201cCara is without doubt a total genius and we are so grateful to her,\u201d she added.",

Australia considers Pacific labourers for \u2018travel bubble\u2019 Australia is considering allowing Pacific labourers to travel to Australia to work where possible as part of a new foreign aid \u201cpolicy pivot\u201d that includes the redirection of $280m from Australia\u2019s existing aid budget. The pivot, Partnerships for Recovery, detailing Australia\u2019s regional and development response to the Covid-19 pandemic, has been released by the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and the minister for international development and the Pacific, Alex Hawke. Covid-19 study on hydroxychloroquine under question More than 120 researchers and medical professionals from around the world have written an open letter to the editor of the Lancet raising serious concerns about a large and widely publicised global study that prompted the World Health Organization to halt several Covid-19 clinical trials. On Thursday Guardian Australia revealed that the Australian data in the study, published last week, did not reconcile with health department records or databases. Coronavirus job losses in Australia mapped by electorate An analysis by the Grattan Institute has revealed that the areas in Australia hit hardest by job losses related to Covid-19 are concentrated in regional and rural New South Wales and Queensland, with nine of the 10 hardest-hit seats held by the Coalition. This may be due to a larger proportion of jobs in these areas being in industries hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis \u2013 tourism and hospitality. The governor of the Reserve Bank has warned the government the jobkeeper program may need to be kept going beyond its current cut-off date in September to avoid the Australian economy falling off a cliff.

His name is Brendan Jackson and he teaches at New Lambton South public school in New Lambton, Newcastle, NSW, Australia. My daughter had only been in kindergarten for seven weeks when our school shut down. He sends his little videos like this every day. He really makes a huge difference in her life.&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Brenda Huggons bigs up some extracurricular activity:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>My daughter-in-law works in a primary school in a deprived area. Many of the children as old as year 6 were not able to ride bicycles, and she has taught them this life skill during lockdown.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another respondent is full of admiration for a primary school headteacher.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I really must nominate the primary school headmaster at my daughter\u2019s school (Royal Grammar School Newcastle). He\u2019s been an absolute breath of fresh air and gives our whole family a giggle every morning. He emails a video assembly out from a different location every day \u2013 up a tree, inside a wardrobe, in his son\u2019s playhouse, on the roof of the school, dressed as Spider-Man! \u2013 and always with a message about wellbeing, reminding the kids how able they are and how well they\u2019re doing, and about being strong, calm and kind and helping each other out.</p> <p>Not a single day has gone by without an enormous smile on his face \u2013 even though he has a new baby at home and has at times been isolating from his own family due to being at school a lot supervising key workers\u2019 children. He\u2019s also passed on this approach to all of the staff and it has been so refreshing and uplifting at difficult times. I can honestly say he has many times been responsible for lifting our whole family\u2019s mood for the whole day \u2013 I will always remember how wonderful he has been throughout this crisis. A real spreader of joy!</p> </blockquote> <h2>Where was the Upside?</h2> <p>In New Zealand, which discharged its last Covid-19 patient this week.</p> <p>Also with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/28/premier-league-restart-june-details-manchester-city-arsenal-aston-villa-sheffield-united\">slow, welcome return of sport</a>.</p> <h2>Thanks for reading.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s a mean old phrase out there about the relative skills of the teaching profession: \u201cThose who can, do; those who can\u2019t, teach.\u201d It needs updating for the coronavirus era. More than two months after our educators were ordered into confinement and told to instruct their charges using little more than unfamiliar software and bags of enthusiasm, we need a new epigram. How about: \u201cThose who teach, can.\u201d That is certainly the message from legions of readers who have been in touch with us full of praise and admiration, as Molly Blackall found out. Otherwise on the Upside, it was a good week for: Learning how to walk properly. Three-minute stroll. JK Rowling fans. One-minute read. The asylum seekers enjoying the relative reprieve of lockdown. Three-minute read. The workers who have reinvented themselves. Two-minute makeover. The green revolution in Europe. Two-minute read. The inventors getting creative during lockdown. Three-minute read. Lucky numbers There has been healthy demand for tickets for our Upside live event next Friday in which we are examining why Covid-19 generated such great community spirit. There are still a few left though, as it\u2019s happening on the internet. Get yours here. What we liked Half the universe used to be missing, which seems pretty careless. Now, apparently, we\u2019ve found it, though I\u2019m still not sure where exactly. This courtesy of the Conversation, a great source of intelligent information worth following. The world\u2019s most digital country \u2013 and why it aced lockdown as a result, by Nina Jankowicz in the Atlantic. And in a related article, Jason Wingard looked at the four new \u201cpillars of work\u201d that will underpin our future work patterns, in Quartz. What we heard More teacher lockdown praise: Belinda Daley wrote in from New South Wales: Here is a link to my daughter\u2019s kindergarten teacher. His name is Brendan Jackson and he teaches at New Lambton South public school in New Lambton, Newcastle, NSW, Australia. My daughter had only been in kindergarten for seven weeks when our school shut down. He sends his little videos like this every day. He really makes a huge difference in her life. Brenda Huggons bigs up some extracurricular activity: My daughter-in-law works in a primary school in a deprived area. Many of the children as old as year 6 were not able to ride bicycles, and she has taught them this life skill during lockdown. Another respondent is full of admiration for a primary school headteacher. I really must nominate the primary school headmaster at my daughter\u2019s school (Royal Grammar School Newcastle). He\u2019s been an absolute breath of fresh air and gives our whole family a giggle every morning. He emails a video assembly out from a different location every day \u2013 up a tree, inside a wardrobe, in his son\u2019s playhouse, on the roof of the school, dressed as Spider-Man! \u2013 and always with a message about wellbeing, reminding the kids how able they are and how well they\u2019re doing, and about being strong, calm and kind and helping each other out. Not a single day has gone by without an enormous smile on his face \u2013 even though he has a new baby at home and has at times been isolating from his own family due to being at school a lot supervising key workers\u2019 children. He\u2019s also passed on this approach to all of the staff and it has been so refreshing and uplifting at difficult times. I can honestly say he has many times been responsible for lifting our whole family\u2019s mood for the whole day \u2013 I will always remember how wonderful he has been throughout this crisis. A real spreader of joy! Where was the Upside? In New Zealand, which discharged its last Covid-19 patient this week. Also with the slow, welcome return of sport. Thanks for reading. Do get in touch with your nominations for other heroes of the pandemic. See you next Friday.",

      "bodyText": "Liverpool\u2019s deputy mayor has temporarily stepped down after video footage emerged of a gathering in her garden during the strictest phase of the coronavirus lockdown. The Labour councillor Lynnie Hinnigan told the Liverpool Echo that the event for her 50th birthday was not a party, and that she had stayed away from family and friends. Video clips, which appear to have been uploaded on to Instagram on 9 May, show 12 people gathered in Hinnigan\u2019s garden, where a large number of chairs are laid out and bunting and balloons adorn the fences. The Labour party said she had \u201cvoluntarily and temporarily\u201d stepped down from her duties while the event being investigated. Current lockdown measures, which were eased on 13 May, stipulate that only two people from different households can meet in outdoor settings \u2013 such as parks \u2013 as long as they stay more than 2 metres apart.

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>When I first heard that Dominic Cummings was giving a press conference about his midnight flit to Durham, I had to check with my better-informed colleagues on the politics desk that this wasn\u2019t a wind-up. After all, it\u2019s specifically against the special advisers\u2019 code of conduct for them to make public statements. Let alone one in the formal setting of the Downing Street rose garden that had previously been used as the setting for David Cameron and Nick Clegg\u2019s 2010 bromance party celebration. But the Cummings show was every bit as box office gold, from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">refusal to apologise for anything</a> \u2013 Classic Dom could pick a fight in an empty room. There was his admission that he went back to work after his wife fell ill, his belief that having to look after his own child constituted exceptional circumstances, his inability to explain how he and his wife led people to believe they had stayed in London in their Spectator articles, his complaint that the cottage on his father\u2019s farm had been rather basic for his liking. But the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/26/a-site-for-sore-eyes-how-dominic-cummings-put-barnard-castle-on-the-map\">trip to Barnard Castle</a> for his wife\u2019s Easter Sunday birthday treat was obviously the highlight. Imagine our finest political brains having had six weeks to come up with a cover story and not being able to do better than an eyesight test. I tweeted that back in the 1970s, I used to take the car for a test drive to see if I was too stoned for a longer journey. The tweet was read by an old friend who pointed out that at least my excuse had the virtue of being true. And that I hadn\u2019t conducted my driving experiments with a four-year-old child in the car. Rather there had been a 21-year-old child behind the wheel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-sacrifices-top-scientific-advisers-on-altar-of-classic-dom\">Boris Johnson sacrifices top scientists on altar of Classic Dom | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>History has a habit of repeating itself. For many years, the first that my wife and I remembered of our wedding anniversary was when a card from my mother arrived through the letterbox. Now it\u2019s me who has to remind my daughter of her wedding anniversary. We had been chatting over the weekend and she was insistent her anniversary was on the Monday. I was equally insistent that it was today, Tuesday. Obviously you can tell from the fact I am including this in the diary that I turned out to be right. Not something my daughter was happy to admit. Then she wasn\u2019t the one who had got a phone call 10 days before her wedding saying she was planning to get married in the kitchen of her parents-in-law in Minneapolis and that we were welcome to come if we wanted but she didn\u2019t mind if we didn\u2019t. Not being keen to miss out, my wife and I hastily booked a couple of days off work along with flights to the US. Having been told that the ceremony was due to take place at 10am, we dragged our jet-lagged bodies out of bed at about 9.15am and went upstairs to find that no one else in the house was awake. 10am came and went and still there was no sign of anyone. It wasn\u2019t until half an hour later that any of the in-laws \u2013 not to mention the bride and groom \u2013 put in an appearance. Still, when the wedding did eventually take place it was worth the wait and I cried throughout. That said, I have to confess that the main reason I was so certain my daughter hadn\u2019t got married on the Friday as she was claiming was that it had coincided with the Saturday of the Champions League final, which I had watched on my own as everyone else had a nap before going out in the evening.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>If, as many had previously said, Tory MPs were reserving their judgment on the prime minister\u2019s decision not to sack Dominic Cummings until after his appearance before the liaison committee \u2013 the supergroup of select committee chairs \u2013 then I can only assume they were watching a different session to me. For only a handful more came out to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/list-grows-of-tory-mps-calling-for-cummings-to-resign\">say Dom should go</a>. What I saw was a prime minister who was totally unprepared and out of his depth. Not just on the Cummings affair, about which his basic message was that he wasn\u2019t bothered if his key adviser had broken the rules or not, it was just time to move on \u2013 something that will have come as a huge relief to the families of the 60,000 people who have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/uk-coronavirus-deaths-weekly-covid-19\">likely died in the UK</a> as a result of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 but also on significant other areas of government policy, such as the benefits system. There again, it\u2019s not just me who is having problems understanding why so many Tory MPs are standing by Boris and Dom when it is clear they believe there is one rule for the elite and another for the rest of us. A friend who lives in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s constituency wrote to the former foreign secretary to ask how he reconciled his support. He replied that, as far he was concerned, Dom had broken the government guidelines on three separate occasions but he wasn\u2019t going to make too much of a fuss about it. Presumably because he had a career to worry about.

Obviously I\u2019m pleased, but not as pleased as I thought I would be and I can\u2019t work out if my lack of enthusiasm is because Spurs\u2019 season had in effect ended before the lockdown anyway or if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve got used to there being no live sport. Either way, it\u2019s likely to be a rather surreal experience with no supporters to create any atmosphere. Just before the lockdown I watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/12/olympiakos-v-wolves-europa-league-last-16-live\">Olympiakos v Wolves</a> game that was played in an empty stadium in Athens and I can\u2019t remember ever feeling so semi-detached during a football match. Even the players didn\u2019t look that interested and appeared to be just going through the motions. To mitigate the deadening effect of no noise, there are rumours the Premier League is planning on piping in fake chants through stadium PA systems. If so, I very much look forward to hearing \u201cthe referee\u2019s a wanker\u201d when a blatant foul is missed and, my own personal favourites \u2018Is there a fire drill?\u2019 and \u2018We can see you sneaking out\u2019 that always come towards the end of a game when one set of fans knows their team have lost and leave early to avoid both the queues and having to hear rival fans rubbing their noses in it.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Another sign of things returning to something like normality is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/28/the-proms-to-go-ahead-this-summer-but-not-as-we-know-them\">the Proms</a> are making hopeful noises about being able to put on some kind of much reduced programme. Assuming they are not just planning to broadcast highlights of previous years\u2019 concerts, I can\u2019t see quite how it\u2019s going to work as to observe proper physical distancing rules \u2013 wind and brass players can spread a lot of spit over a large area \u2013 it sounds as if the orchestra will have to spread out over the whole of the Albert Hall.

Rather more bizarrely, the Turner prize judges have already decided <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/26/turner-prize-cancelled-and-chosen-artists-to-get-10k-bursaries\">not to announce a winner this year</a> and to give bursaries to those who made the shortlist instead. This just seems bonkers, given the judges have already seen the works and that they don\u2019t need to be viewed by the public for a winner to be chosen. Still, there\u2019s much about the Turner prize that I\u2019ve never understood.

Britain is world famous for its studio potters and yet they consistently go unrecognised by the art world at home. It\u2019s as if ceramics is considered to be lower in the cultural hierarchy: a craft rather than an art form. Allow me to disagree. The pots that I own \u2013 and those that I don\u2019t \u2013 have brought me far more joy than any number of paintings and installations in Tate Britain and Tate Modern.

      "bodyText": "Monday When I first heard that Dominic Cummings was giving a press conference about his midnight flit to Durham, I had to check with my better-informed colleagues on the politics desk that this wasn\u2019t a wind-up. After all, it\u2019s specifically against the special advisers\u2019 code of conduct for them to make public statements. Let alone one in the formal setting of the Downing Street rose garden that had previously been used as the setting for David Cameron and Nick Clegg\u2019s 2010 bromance party celebration. But the Cummings show was every bit as box office gold, from his refusal to apologise for anything \u2013 Classic Dom could pick a fight in an empty room. There was his admission that he went back to work after his wife fell ill, his belief that having to look after his own child constituted exceptional circumstances, his inability to explain how he and his wife led people to believe they had stayed in London in their Spectator articles, his complaint that the cottage on his father\u2019s farm had been rather basic for his liking. But the trip to Barnard Castle for his wife\u2019s Easter Sunday birthday treat was obviously the highlight. Imagine our finest political brains having had six weeks to come up with a cover story and not being able to do better than an eyesight test. I tweeted that back in the 1970s, I used to take the car for a test drive to see if I was too stoned for a longer journey. The tweet was read by an old friend who pointed out that at least my excuse had the virtue of being true. And that I hadn\u2019t conducted my driving experiments with a four-year-old child in the car. Rather there had been a 21-year-old child behind the wheel. Tuesday History has a habit of repeating itself. For many years, the first that my wife and I remembered of our wedding anniversary was when a card from my mother arrived through the letterbox. Now it\u2019s me who has to remind my daughter of her wedding anniversary. We had been chatting over the weekend and she was insistent her anniversary was on the Monday. I was equally insistent that it was today, Tuesday. Obviously you can tell from the fact I am including this in the diary that I turned out to be right. Not something my daughter was happy to admit. Then she wasn\u2019t the one who had got a phone call 10 days before her wedding saying she was planning to get married in the kitchen of her parents-in-law in Minneapolis and that we were welcome to come if we wanted but she didn\u2019t mind if we didn\u2019t. Not being keen to miss out, my wife and I hastily booked a couple of days off work along with flights to the US. Having been told that the ceremony was due to take place at 10am, we dragged our jet-lagged bodies out of bed at about 9.15am and went upstairs to find that no one else in the house was awake. 10am came and went and still there was no sign of anyone. It wasn\u2019t until half an hour later that any of the in-laws \u2013 not to mention the bride and groom \u2013 put in an appearance. Still, when the wedding did eventually take place it was worth the wait and I cried throughout. That said, I have to confess that the main reason I was so certain my daughter hadn\u2019t got married on the Friday as she was claiming was that it had coincided with the Saturday of the Champions League final, which I had watched on my own as everyone else had a nap before going out in the evening. Wednesday If, as many had previously said, Tory MPs were reserving their judgment on the prime minister\u2019s decision not to sack Dominic Cummings until after his appearance before the liaison committee \u2013 the supergroup of select committee chairs \u2013 then I can only assume they were watching a different session to me. For only a handful more came out to say Dom should go. What I saw was a prime minister who was totally unprepared and out of his depth. Not just on the Cummings affair, about which his basic message was that he wasn\u2019t bothered if his key adviser had broken the rules or not, it was just time to move on \u2013 something that will have come as a huge relief to the families of the 60,000 people who have likely died in the UK as a result of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 but also on significant other areas of government policy, such as the benefits system. There again, it\u2019s not just me who is having problems understanding why so many Tory MPs are standing by Boris and Dom when it is clear they believe there is one rule for the elite and another for the rest of us. A friend who lives in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s constituency wrote to the former foreign secretary to ask how he reconciled his support. He replied that, as far he was concerned, Dom had broken the government guidelines on three separate occasions but he wasn\u2019t going to make too much of a fuss about it. Presumably because he had a career to worry about. My friend wrote back, pointing out that this was bigger than party loyalty: if Dom could be seen to be getting away with it, then thousands of others would follow suit and the death toll would get even larger. Hunt replied once more saying he had said all he was going to say and it was time to move on for the good of the country. So it seems the country is expected to act on conscience and moral principles that are absent within government.

      "bodyText": "A coronavirus vaccine may be a long way away, but there is already a threat on the horizon: anti-vaxxers. Once a fringe presence in America, vaccine opponents have become better organized in recent years, a development that has contributed to the worst US measles outbreak in a generation in 2019. Buoyed by their better organization anti-vaxxers have now taken aim at the very thing epidemiologists say can defeat the devastating coronavirus: an as yet undeveloped vaccine. Experts studying the movement warn anti-vaxxers influence and power could affect Americans\u2019 willingness to take a Covid-19 vaccine and recent studies suggest this is a real issue. In early May, a survey by two academics found that 23% of Americans would not be willing to get vaccinated against Covid-19. In a separate poll by Morning Consult, 14% said they wouldn\u2019t get vaccinated, and another 22% were unsure. And according to a new Associated Press-NORC poll, only about half of Americans say they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if available. With more than 1.6m coronavirus cases in the US, and a more than 100,000 deaths, a mass refusal could have dangerous consequences. Anti-vaxxers make up a small percentage of the US population, but just at the time when vaccines are most needed, they are thrusting themselves to the fore, especially on social media and in the growing movement to reopen an economy shutdown to fight the virus\u2019 spread. Opponents of vaccines have been ever-present at anti-stay at home protests in states across the country. They have pushed conspiracy theories ranging from the false idea that immunizations cause childhood illness, to the outrageous claim that Bill Gates is using vaccinations as a tool to microchip the world\u2019s population. Some of the apparent rise in anti-vaxx thinking can be attributed to Donald Trump\u2019s blurring of fact and fiction, and questioning of science and officials from his own government. Experts say social media has been a huge driving force too. Ideas that vaccines cause autism \u2013 a debunked theory still popular among anti-vaxxers \u2013 abound on Facebook, along with notions of governments and pharmaceutical companies collaborating to make money from duping regular people. Like the protests against stay-at-home orders that anti-vaxxers joined at state houses, however, the anti-vaccine movement isn\u2019t as organic and grassroots as it might seem. On Facebook, the opposition to vaccines has been fueled by advertising paid for by two well-funded organizations; the Stop Mandatory Vaccination organization and Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2013 led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, the son of Robert F Kennedy who has found a niche within the anti-vax movement. Joe Pierre, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles who writes on conspiracies and disinformation, said there are \u201cpsychological quirks\u201d associated with a belief in conspiracy theories. \u201cOne of those psychological quirks is a need for uniqueness,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cThis is the idea that people who are attracted to conspiracy theories often feel like they stumbled upon some secret reality that the rest of us sheep \u2013 or sheeple, as conspiracy theorists like to refer to us \u2013 don\u2019t know about.

Despite Wakefield\u2019s claims being disproven numerous times, he is seen as a reliable voice in the anti-vax movement, as is Judy Mikovits, a former scientific researcher popular among anti-vaccine supporters. Like Wakefield, Mikovits has been disowned by the scientific community, but has sprung to broader fame since coronavirus began, thanks to her appearance in Plandemic, a disinformation film which was watched by millions when it was released in early May. Mikovits, who claims \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that wearing face masks \u201cactivates\u201d the coronavirus, was invited to speak at the Freedom Health Summit by organizers Stephanie Lind and Alana Newman, who spoke to the Guardian as part of a film on the anti-vaccine movement.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the Minneapolis police and set the department\u2019s 3rd precinct station alight on the third night of protests over the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old black man. The demonstrations have spread to several other cities, including New York, Chicago, Oakland and Denver, where shots were reportedly fired outside the Colorado state capitol. Donald Trump attacked the Democratic mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, on Twitter as \u201cvery weak\u201d. He described the demonstrators as \u201cthugs\u201d and threatened that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. Twitter hid that tweet, accusing the president of glorifying violence. Frey responded fiercely, saying: Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else during a time of crisis. The Department of Justice says its investigation of Floyd\u2019s death is a top priority, with the FBI conducting a \u201crobust\u201d inquiry as it emerged that two of the officers involved in the incident had previously been reviewed for their use of force. Trump signs executive order targeting social media Trump\u2019s \u201cthugs\u201d tweet, his latest violation of Twitter rules, came hours after he signed an executive order intended to limit protections for social media companies from liability over the content users post on their platforms. The move was welcomed by those who argue that Twitter and Facebook should be held accountable for their content like other publishers, but the president\u2019s critics say the controversy is intended as a distraction from his administration\u2019s disastrous handling of the coronavirus crisis. Mark Zuckerberg seemed keen to appease Trump during a Fox News interview, in which the Facebook founder implicitly criticised Twitter\u2019s new policies, saying: \u201cFacebook shouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\u201d The Trump campaign tried to remove a satirical cartoon mocking the president from an online retailer by making a trademark infringement claim, apparently over illustrator Nick Anderson\u2019s depiction of Trump supporters wearing Maga hats. Hispanic Americans hit hardest by unemployment More than 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment in the 10 weeks since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, a number not seen since the Great Depression. Many are struggling to make ends meet, as Michael Sainato reports. Among the jaw-dropping statistics, one figure stands out. Hispanic Americans have suffered the highest unemployment rate of any racial group at 18.9%, more than 4% higher than the national rate. Homeless deaths in San Francisco have tripled this spring compared with the same period last year. Some of the 48 deaths were directly attributed to Covid-19, but advocates say many are a result of the city\u2019s shelter-in-place order forcing people onto the streets. Covid-19 patients forced to share beds in Mumbai Parts of India\u2019s healthcare system are reportedly close to collapse, and patients in the city of Mumbai have been forced to share beds and oxygen tanks as the coronavirus pandemic takes hold in the world\u2019s most populous democracy. \u201cThe magnitude of the cases is overwhelming us all,\u201d one Mumbai doctor said. The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has announced plans to ease one of the world\u2019s longest and strictest lockdowns, despite the country\u2019s biggest daily rise in infections on Thursday, when 539 new cases were recorded. Why Lombardy? Covid-19 has killed almost 16,000 people in Italy\u2019s richest province, a vast number compared with even its closest neighbours. Health experts and Italian politicians are still trying to work out why, as Angela Giuffrida reports. In other news \u2026 The Hong Kong government has told the US not to interfere in its affairs, after China\u2019s parliament approved a new security law seen by outside critics and local protesters as the death knell for Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from Beijing. The move has led many residents to look for an exit. An Armenian website spreading Covid-19 disinformation is funded by the US government. Medmedia.am was originally launched with the help of a Department of State grant meant to promote democracy. The \u201cmurder hornet\u201d is spreading through the Pacific north-west, scientists fear, after one of the aggressive Asian insects was found in British Columbia in western Canada. Great reads Woody Allen: \u2018Denouncing me became the fashionable thing\u2019 Woody Allen\u2019s long career was upended and the publication of his memoir disrupted by the continuing fallout from a 1992 accusation that he sexually assaulted his young daughter. \u201cAnything I say sounds self-serving and defensive, so it\u2019s best if I just go my way and work,\u201d he tells Hadley Freeman. How anti-vaxxers could hinder the battle against Covid-19 Once a fringe presence in the US, the message of the anti-vaccination movement appears to have infected the minds of millions of Americans, with 23% saying in a recent survey that they would refuse a vaccination for the coronavirus. Adam Gabbatt asks anti-vaxxers why they refuse to believe the evidence. What happens next for RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race winners With the finale of season 12 fast approaching, Michael Segalov spoke to several past winners of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race crown to ask them what happened after their victory. \u201cA crazy party train wreck,\u201d says the season five runner-up Alaska Thunderfuck. Opinion: will Trump dispute the 2020 election result? The president\u2019s repeated attacks on the reliability of mail-in voting raise an ominous possibility, writes Lawrence Douglas. If he loses narrowly in November, he may refuse to accept defeat. The president is defaming not an individual but the integrity of our electoral process, confidence in which is a key to a stable democratic order.

But nothing tests a partnership quite like a crisis.</p> <p>It\u2019s something that Chantelle Miller and her wife, Tara Miller, can attest to. The pair, who both serve in the military, have not seen each other for two months since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the UK \u2013 they are key workers at the forefront of the fight against the virus.</p> <p>Chantelle is currently working as a military planner in Wales with the Cardiff and Vale University health board, while her wife\u2019s roles include that of first responder with the South Central Ambulance Service on the south coast of England.

We made sure we had things in place, should the worst happen,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cWe made sure we had means of communication and we were prepared.\u201d</p> <p>Thankfully, a long history in the armed forces had taught them to be ready for anything. After studying law and criminology at university, and having initially wanted to join the police, Chantelle chose the military. \u201cI was attracted by the career, travel and essentially because no two days are ever the same,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Tara signed up aged 19, as she had family connections to the forces. \u201cI always wanted to join the military,\u201d she says. \u201cMy grandma was a nurse, and my grandad was<br>a medic in the Royal Marines. My great-great-great uncle was a bomb disposal expert in the second world war. I loved hearing all their stories as a child.\u201d</p> <p>Despite both working in the same sector, theirs wasn\u2019t an office romance. Instead, they bonded over a rugby match, having played \u2013 on opposite teams \u2013 in a game back in 2012. While they can\u2019t remember the result, they did have a post-game drink. \u201cWe\u2019re both big rugby fans,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cAnd we just got talking after the match. Soon after, Tara got deployed to Afghanistan, but we kept talking. Then eventually, after I\u2019d worked in Germany, we both got posted back to the UK, and that\u2019s when we got together.\u201d</p> <p>They were married in 2017 and say that being forced to spend much of their relationship apart has strengthened their bond \u2013 and unwittingly prepared them for the self-isolation they currently find themselves in.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming up to four years married, and for that time, I\u2019ve been deployed in different jobs that have taken me away from the family home for about one and a half years,\u201d says Chantelle.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely weird being deployed \u2013 it\u2019s challenging and dangerous but it\u2019s harder on the person who\u2019s been left at home, trying to keep on with normal life. The dog needs to be walked, the daily monotony continues while the other person is off<br>doing something that they\u2019re really passionate about. It can be difficult, it comes with a particular strain, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re both aware of and we always put our jobs first.

      "bodyText": "For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer; as we\u2019re told by countless officiants in ceremonies across the years, marriage is not to be entered into lightly. But nothing tests a partnership quite like a crisis. It\u2019s something that Chantelle Miller and her wife, Tara Miller, can attest to. The pair, who both serve in the military, have not seen each other for two months since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the UK \u2013 they are key workers at the forefront of the fight against the virus. Chantelle is currently working as a military planner in Wales with the Cardiff and Vale University health board, while her wife\u2019s roles include that of first responder with the South Central Ambulance Service on the south coast of England. Both were awaiting deployment when the pandemic struck, and having previously served in Afghanistan and Northern Ireland, they knew they were likely to be called up to work as part of the home emergency. They then had to have a difficult conversation about their impending new roles. \u201cWe sat down and we made sure our wills were in order. We made sure we had things in place, should the worst happen,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cWe made sure we had means of communication and we were prepared.\u201d Thankfully, a long history in the armed forces had taught them to be ready for anything. After studying law and criminology at university, and having initially wanted to join the police, Chantelle chose the military. \u201cI was attracted by the career, travel and essentially because no two days are ever the same,\u201d she says. Tara signed up aged 19, as she had family connections to the forces. \u201cI always wanted to join the military,\u201d she says. \u201cMy grandma was a nurse, and my grandad was a medic in the Royal Marines. My great-great-great uncle was a bomb disposal expert in the second world war. I loved hearing all their stories as a child.\u201d Despite both working in the same sector, theirs wasn\u2019t an office romance. Instead, they bonded over a rugby match, having played \u2013 on opposite teams \u2013 in a game back in 2012. While they can\u2019t remember the result, they did have a post-game drink. \u201cWe\u2019re both big rugby fans,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cAnd we just got talking after the match. Soon after, Tara got deployed to Afghanistan, but we kept talking. Then eventually, after I\u2019d worked in Germany, we both got posted back to the UK, and that\u2019s when we got together.\u201d They were married in 2017 and say that being forced to spend much of their relationship apart has strengthened their bond \u2013 and unwittingly prepared them for the self-isolation they currently find themselves in. \u201cWe\u2019re coming up to four years married, and for that time, I\u2019ve been deployed in different jobs that have taken me away from the family home for about one and a half years,\u201d says Chantelle. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely weird being deployed \u2013 it\u2019s challenging and dangerous but it\u2019s harder on the person who\u2019s been left at home, trying to keep on with normal life. The dog needs to be walked, the daily monotony continues while the other person is off doing something that they\u2019re really passionate about. It can be difficult, it comes with a particular strain, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re both aware of and we always put our jobs first. That might surprise a few people, and it might be an issue for some marriages, but not for us.

      "body": "<p>For David Abrahamovitch, founder of cult coffee brand Grind, the decision to close his London-based food, coffee and cocktail bars was a painful one \u2013 and the decision to reopen one branch as a takeaway outlet on 20 May took even more careful planning.</p> <p>Nearly a quarter of employees across Britain have been furloughed, with 6.3m jobs put on hold since the wage subsidy scheme was launched on 20 April. These workers have been receiving 80% of their salary, up to \u00a32,500 a month, to stay at home and keep safe. But now lockdown is beginning to ease, and some of us who can\u2019t work from home are returning, businesses such as Grind are working hard to keep staff and customers safe.</p> <p>Abrahamovitch\u2019s business journey started in 2011, when he inherited his father\u2019s company. \u201cI was 25 when I sadly lost my dad and inherited the family\u2019s mobile phone business,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to decide what to do next \u2013 are we going to continue, are we going to close? I\u2019d spent a lot of time in the shop as a teenager, helping out behind the counter, so it was very sentimental for me. I decided I wanted to keep the building and turn it into some kind of meeting place.\u201d</p> <p>Converting the Old Street premises into a coffee shop, Abrahamovitch set about growing his business based on the cafes he\u2019d visited on his travels. \u201cI\u2019d seen the independent cafe scene in other countries, and back then it just didn\u2019t feel like it had been fully translated to the UK,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to recreate that Australian-style flat-white culture, with high-quality coffee beans, the best equipment, and amazing baristas who serve cups of coffee somewhere fun, lively and energetic. And I wanted to mix that with what the coffee chains do so well: good hygiene, mobile ordering and payment options and, most importantly, speedy service. A year later, we added cocktails when we realised our coffee made amazing espresso martinis!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc99228d2776c4e444607283c863d0fc8a7ae3a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc99228d2776c4e444607283c863d0fc8a7ae3a1/0_179_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grind coffee jars\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Online, Grind sells compostable coffee pods in refillable tins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shot adhering to social distancing measures by Andy Donohoe/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the next nine years Abrahamovitch rolled his business out, spreading to 11 locations with 300 members of staff, serving sit-down breakfasts, lunch and dinner alongside coffee and cocktails. Grind also has an online business selling compostable coffee pods in refillable tins.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/29/its-an-emotional-rollercoaster-the-military-couple-swapping-duties-abroad-to-work-on-the-coronavirus-frontline\">'It's an emotional rollercoaster': the military couple swapping duties abroad to work on the coronavirus frontline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When coronavirus reached the UK, Abrahamovitch\u2019s business was sent into turmoil. \u201cI\u2019ve lived and bled this company for almost 10 years, and built it piece by piece, so finally getting to the point where we have tens of thousands of customers each week, then suddenly having to close was awful,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember the week of lockdown vividly. For a couple of weeks beforehand, we\u2019d already seen sales start to fall away. We monitor sales to the hour, so when things start to drop off, you really notice it.</p> <p>\u201cThen, when Boris Johnson told people they shouldn\u2019t visit restaurants and bars, it was clear to us it was time to close. We shut all our stores, keeping just three open for takeaway to serve the local community for a few more days. When full lockdown was announced, we decided to close completely to protect our staff.\u201d</p> <p>In the weeks since lockdown began, significantly more has been learned about the spread of Covid-19, and on 10 May the government announced certain businesses could reopen, with stringent safety rules in place. Guidance on how bosses can protect their workers, and how staff can safely travel into work, was drawn up. So now, companies such as Grind are taking tentative steps towards getting back to business, and on 20 May, its Greenwich outlet reopened its doors for grab-and-go coffees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b6890592a94c83a2836f4fc00a2398d10e9ab90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b6890592a94c83a2836f4fc00a2398d10e9ab90/0_0_3543_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plastic screens at the tills separate staff from customers, and while mask aren\u2019t mandatory they are available.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Plastic screens at the tills separate staff from customers, and while mask aren\u2019t mandatory they are available.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shot adhering to social distancing measures by Andy Donohoe/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go before we\u2019re fully open again, but it felt like the right time to start making some first steps,\u201d says Abrahamovitch. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve been on the same journey as everyone else, from not really understanding this thing to the fear peaking when Boris Johnson was admitted to intensive care, to the latest research showing us that we can operate in a safe way.

      "bodyText": "For David Abrahamovitch, founder of cult coffee brand Grind, the decision to close his London-based food, coffee and cocktail bars was a painful one \u2013 and the decision to reopen one branch as a takeaway outlet on 20 May took even more careful planning. Nearly a quarter of employees across Britain have been furloughed, with 6.3m jobs put on hold since the wage subsidy scheme was launched on 20 April. These workers have been receiving 80% of their salary, up to \u00a32,500 a month, to stay at home and keep safe. But now lockdown is beginning to ease, and some of us who can\u2019t work from home are returning, businesses such as Grind are working hard to keep staff and customers safe. Abrahamovitch\u2019s business journey started in 2011, when he inherited his father\u2019s company. \u201cI was 25 when I sadly lost my dad and inherited the family\u2019s mobile phone business,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to decide what to do next \u2013 are we going to continue, are we going to close? I\u2019d spent a lot of time in the shop as a teenager, helping out behind the counter, so it was very sentimental for me. I decided I wanted to keep the building and turn it into some kind of meeting place.\u201d Converting the Old Street premises into a coffee shop, Abrahamovitch set about growing his business based on the cafes he\u2019d visited on his travels. \u201cI\u2019d seen the independent cafe scene in other countries, and back then it just didn\u2019t feel like it had been fully translated to the UK,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to recreate that Australian-style flat-white culture, with high-quality coffee beans, the best equipment, and amazing baristas who serve cups of coffee somewhere fun, lively and energetic. And I wanted to mix that with what the coffee chains do so well: good hygiene, mobile ordering and payment options and, most importantly, speedy service. A year later, we added cocktails when we realised our coffee made amazing espresso martinis!\u201d Over the next nine years Abrahamovitch rolled his business out, spreading to 11 locations with 300 members of staff, serving sit-down breakfasts, lunch and dinner alongside coffee and cocktails. Grind also has an online business selling compostable coffee pods in refillable tins. When coronavirus reached the UK, Abrahamovitch\u2019s business was sent into turmoil. \u201cI\u2019ve lived and bled this company for almost 10 years, and built it piece by piece, so finally getting to the point where we have tens of thousands of customers each week, then suddenly having to close was awful,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember the week of lockdown vividly. For a couple of weeks beforehand, we\u2019d already seen sales start to fall away. We monitor sales to the hour, so when things start to drop off, you really notice it. \u201cThen, when Boris Johnson told people they shouldn\u2019t visit restaurants and bars, it was clear to us it was time to close. We shut all our stores, keeping just three open for takeaway to serve the local community for a few more days. When full lockdown was announced, we decided to close completely to protect our staff.\u201d In the weeks since lockdown began, significantly more has been learned about the spread of Covid-19, and on 10 May the government announced certain businesses could reopen, with stringent safety rules in place. Guidance on how bosses can protect their workers, and how staff can safely travel into work, was drawn up. So now, companies such as Grind are taking tentative steps towards getting back to business, and on 20 May, its Greenwich outlet reopened its doors for grab-and-go coffees. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go before we\u2019re fully open again, but it felt like the right time to start making some first steps,\u201d says Abrahamovitch. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019ve been on the same journey as everyone else, from not really understanding this thing to the fear peaking when Boris Johnson was admitted to intensive care, to the latest research showing us that we can operate in a safe way. While the only way to completely eradicate [Covid-19] might be for us all to stay at home forever, that\u2019s just not practical. But you have to mitigate the risks at the maximum level you can.\u201d Since plans to reopen were made, the safety of both staff and customers has been paramount. Grind works with a food hygiene company that has helped Abrahamovitch stay on top of the new government guidelines on safety and hygiene. \u201cI think we\u2019re all in a testing phase and figuring this out at the moment, but we\u2019ve taken the steps we think are sensible without filling the place with yellow tape,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly a couple of people are allowed inside the shop at any one time.

      "body": "<p>Now that the dust has settled and we have time to reflect, what have we learned from the first peak of Covid-19? And how will we cope with another one?</p> <p>We now understand this illness a lot better than we did. We know what it does to people who are sick enough to need to stay in hospital. For a start, it kills almost 40% of them, more if they are elderly. Many of the survivors suffer horrible lung damage and \u201cstorms\u201d of inflammation, often needing weeks on a ventilator.</p> <p>It makes the blood unusually sticky and causes clots all over the body \u2013 particularly in the lungs \u2013 and may do so for weeks after even mild infections. It is a cruel disease.</p> <p>But we have adapted. Protocols have been written, pathways set up within the hospital to try to cohort patients. We now know which parts of the building have the best oxygen flow rates, something I never thought I\u2019d have to consider, and we have become adept at turning patients on to their fronts so they can get more oxygen into their damaged lungs.</p> <p>We are working out how to use blood thinning medications in the best way. The hospital has become more efficient; social care has improved greatly and the phenomenon of stable patients waiting weeks for discharge or placement seems to have been smoothed out. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/london-nhs-nightingale-hospital-placed-on-standby\">Nightingale hospitals</a> will be ready to step up again and hopefully faster this time. There is no question that we are better prepared now.</p> <p>However, while we may be more efficient at keeping people alive while the disease takes its natural course, we still do not have any effective and available treatments. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/remdesivir-drug-to-be-available-for-selected-nhs-covid-19-patients\">Clinical trials</a> are under way, but right now these studies are standing still, waiting for more patients to enrol since infection rates have dropped.</p> <p>And if any proof were needed of the importance of being guided by the evidence, just look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-surgisphere-hydroxychloroquine-study-lancet-coronavirus-who-questioned-by-researchers-medical-professionals\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, which may actually <em>increase</em> the risk of death. So while in many ways we are now better prepared for another peak, we still have no ways to actually treat the disease.</p> <p>Although I have little faith in the muddled thinking and confused messaging seeping down from the top, my personal guess is that we won\u2019t see as savage a peak again. I certainly hope not.</p> <p>It seems more likely that the virus will linger in the population, returning periodically to cause smaller, intermittent surges. Nonetheless, the NHS functions so close to maximum capacity even in normal times that this could still cause another crisis. And when? Have we just kicked the can down the road until winter, when we\u2019ll be at our busiest anyway?</p> <p>There are other problems that we did not face, or did not recognise, first time around. There are logistical, strategic and emotional obstacles that most likely mean our services will not return to normal for a long time, whether we have another peak or not.</p> <p>Firstly, we have our usual caseload of emergency and elective (planned) work. All clinics and planned operations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/25/huge-backlog-operations-building-due-to-lack-of-ppe-and-staff-testing\">were mothballed</a> as soon as the scale of the response needed became clear. Provisions were made only for the very unwell and those with cancer; everyone else would just have to wait it out.</p> <p>In addition, people were told to avoid hospitals unless it was absolutely essential. They listened; our non-Covid work during the first peak was a fraction of what it usually is. This was probably the only reason we coped at all.</p> <p>The problem is that we are already seeing the results of this. Patients are not doctors; they cannot reasonably be expected to reliably self-diagnose what is essential and what isn\u2019t. After two months of neglect their symptoms are becoming intolerable and, unable to seek help through the usual channels, they are coming in later in their disease course than we\u2019d expect and often in a terrible state.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t have to catch Covid-19 to die because of it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We have had people with undiagnosed cancer arriving only days from death, people with strokes and heart attacks presenting days after their symptoms started. This is reflected in the national figures for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/uk-coronavirus-deaths-weekly-covid-19\">excess deaths</a>; you don\u2019t have to catch Covid-19 to die because of it.</p> <p>Maybe we could get away with all this first time around, but for patients with life-threatening non-Covid disease these effects will be even more horrific after three months of standstill. We urgently need to provide for these people and there is no guarantee they will be able to stay away in the same way during a second peak.</p> <p>Furthermore, we don\u2019t really have answers yet as to how to keep Covid and non-Covid patients separated well enough to prevent cross-infection. It has become clear that during the first peak many patients acquired the infection <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/hospital-patients-england-coronavirus-covid-19\">while already hospitalised</a> for other causes, and so we are tying ourselves in knots to prevent this. The logistics become baffling, requiring two separate areas for all aspects of care: \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d X-ray departments, CT scanners, inpatient wards, A&amp;E departments.</p> <p>This is only made worse by the ongoing lack of rapid bedside testing for Covid-19 and the delay in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/healthcare-staff-to-get-coronavirus-antibody-tests-from-next-week\">antibody tests</a> to suggest whether people have previously had it.</p> <p>So for now we must quarantine them in a third area, in individual rooms, until we know whether they even have the disease. This is hugely inefficient and often delays patients getting the care they need in the correct area. I can only hope we get these tools urgently and before the next wave hits.</p> <p>The best approach would of course be to keep people with non-emergency or long-term medical problems away from the hospital in the first place. But for this we need our routine outpatient services running. Whilst we are honouring as many appointments as we can by telephone, without our usual diagnostic tests available all we can really do is work out who we need to see urgently and who can wait another few months.</p> <p>In respiratory medicine we also have the enormous new burden of follow-up for the many hundreds of Covid patients already discharged from hospital. All this represents a hugely increased workload and we need more support.</p> <p>This point brings me to my last key concern: we are exhausted. At the beginning, although there was the fear of the unknown, there was a purity of purpose that united us and drove us on. It was obvious what we needed to do; there were patients in front of us, gaps to plug, new skills to learn; fuelled by adrenaline, we got on with it. In many ways that was the easy bit.</p> <p>This new phase is difficult, uncertain, draining. There are endless planning meetings and constantly changing advice. Many of us still struggle with insomnia and then there\u2019s the toll on our our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-mental-health-storm-nhs-workers\">mental health</a>; just like everyone else in lockdown we struggle to turn off when away from work. Goodwill to our government and our employers is beginning to fray, and I fear for the resilience of our workforce \u2013 whether a second peak hits or not. Mentally, we are not the same as we were at the beginning.</p> <p>So I am guarded about our readiness for another peak. We know what to do and we will do it better next time. But this disease is causing massive collateral damage; this will only get worse the longer this goes on.</p> <ul> <li><p>The writer is an&nbsp;NHS&nbsp;respiratory consultant who works across a number of hospitals</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Now that the dust has settled and we have time to reflect, what have we learned from the first peak of Covid-19? And how will we cope with another one? We now understand this illness a lot better than we did. We know what it does to people who are sick enough to need to stay in hospital. For a start, it kills almost 40% of them, more if they are elderly. Many of the survivors suffer horrible lung damage and \u201cstorms\u201d of inflammation, often needing weeks on a ventilator. It makes the blood unusually sticky and causes clots all over the body \u2013 particularly in the lungs \u2013 and may do so for weeks after even mild infections. It is a cruel disease. But we have adapted. Protocols have been written, pathways set up within the hospital to try to cohort patients. We now know which parts of the building have the best oxygen flow rates, something I never thought I\u2019d have to consider, and we have become adept at turning patients on to their fronts so they can get more oxygen into their damaged lungs. We are working out how to use blood thinning medications in the best way. The hospital has become more efficient; social care has improved greatly and the phenomenon of stable patients waiting weeks for discharge or placement seems to have been smoothed out. The Nightingale hospitals will be ready to step up again and hopefully faster this time. There is no question that we are better prepared now. However, while we may be more efficient at keeping people alive while the disease takes its natural course, we still do not have any effective and available treatments. Clinical trials are under way, but right now these studies are standing still, waiting for more patients to enrol since infection rates have dropped. And if any proof were needed of the importance of being guided by the evidence, just look at hydroxychloroquine, which may actually increase the risk of death. So while in many ways we are now better prepared for another peak, we still have no ways to actually treat the disease. Although I have little faith in the muddled thinking and confused messaging seeping down from the top, my personal guess is that we won\u2019t see as savage a peak again. I certainly hope not. It seems more likely that the virus will linger in the population, returning periodically to cause smaller, intermittent surges. Nonetheless, the NHS functions so close to maximum capacity even in normal times that this could still cause another crisis. And when? Have we just kicked the can down the road until winter, when we\u2019ll be at our busiest anyway? There are other problems that we did not face, or did not recognise, first time around. There are logistical, strategic and emotional obstacles that most likely mean our services will not return to normal for a long time, whether we have another peak or not. Firstly, we have our usual caseload of emergency and elective (planned) work. All clinics and planned operations were mothballed as soon as the scale of the response needed became clear. Provisions were made only for the very unwell and those with cancer; everyone else would just have to wait it out. In addition, people were told to avoid hospitals unless it was absolutely essential. They listened; our non-Covid work during the first peak was a fraction of what it usually is. This was probably the only reason we coped at all. The problem is that we are already seeing the results of this. Patients are not doctors; they cannot reasonably be expected to reliably self-diagnose what is essential and what isn\u2019t. After two months of neglect their symptoms are becoming intolerable and, unable to seek help through the usual channels, they are coming in later in their disease course than we\u2019d expect and often in a terrible state. We have had people with undiagnosed cancer arriving only days from death, people with strokes and heart attacks presenting days after their symptoms started. This is reflected in the national figures for excess deaths; you don\u2019t have to catch Covid-19 to die because of it. Maybe we could get away with all this first time around, but for patients with life-threatening non-Covid disease these effects will be even more horrific after three months of standstill. We urgently need to provide for these people and there is no guarantee they will be able to stay away in the same way during a second peak. Furthermore, we don\u2019t really have answers yet as to how to keep Covid and non-Covid patients separated well enough to prevent cross-infection. It has become clear that during the first peak many patients acquired the infection while already hospitalised for other causes, and so we are tying ourselves in knots to prevent this. The logistics become baffling, requiring two separate areas for all aspects of care: \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d X-ray departments, CT scanners, inpatient wards, A&amp;E departments. This is only made worse by the ongoing lack of rapid bedside testing for Covid-19 and the delay in the antibody tests to suggest whether people have previously had it. So for now we must quarantine them in a third area, in individual rooms, until we know whether they even have the disease. This is hugely inefficient and often delays patients getting the care they need in the correct area. I can only hope we get these tools urgently and before the next wave hits. The best approach would of course be to keep people with non-emergency or long-term medical problems away from the hospital in the first place. But for this we need our routine outpatient services running. Whilst we are honouring as many appointments as we can by telephone, without our usual diagnostic tests available all we can really do is work out who we need to see urgently and who can wait another few months. In respiratory medicine we also have the enormous new burden of follow-up for the many hundreds of Covid patients already discharged from hospital. All this represents a hugely increased workload and we need more support. This point brings me to my last key concern: we are exhausted. At the beginning, although there was the fear of the unknown, there was a purity of purpose that united us and drove us on. It was obvious what we needed to do; there were patients in front of us, gaps to plug, new skills to learn; fuelled by adrenaline, we got on with it. In many ways that was the easy bit. This new phase is difficult, uncertain, draining. There are endless planning meetings and constantly changing advice. Many of us still struggle with insomnia and then there\u2019s the toll on our our mental health; just like everyone else in lockdown we struggle to turn off when away from work. Goodwill to our government and our employers is beginning to fray, and I fear for the resilience of our workforce \u2013 whether a second peak hits or not. Mentally, we are not the same as we were at the beginning. So I am guarded about our readiness for another peak. We know what to do and we will do it better next time. But this disease is causing massive collateral damage; this will only get worse the longer this goes on. The writer is an NHS respiratory consultant who works across a number of hospitals",

      "body": "<p>A Friday night in early January 1958 in Cumbria and Keith Burkinshaw of Workington Reds is meeting Duncan Edwards of Manchester United. Burkinshaw, who was in the army with Edwards in Wales, enjoys a catch-up with one of United\u2019s greatest footballers before tomorrow\u2019s FA Cup third-round tie, when he will play for fourth-tier Workington against Matt Busby\u2019s English champions of the past two seasons.</p> <p>The game takes place in front of a record home crowd of 21,500 at Borough Park and they see Workington stun a first-choice United XI featuring Harry Gregg, Roger Byrne, Bill Foulkes, Mark Jones, Eddie Colman, Edwards, Kenny Morgans, Albert Scanlon, Bobby Charlton, Dennis Viollet and Tommy Taylor, via a six-minute Clive Colbridge goal that gives them a deserved half-time lead. It was a moment to remember even if United did go on to win 3-1.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/lask-linz-win-will-help-manchester-united-play-with-no-fans-says-solskjr\">Lask Linz win will help Manchester United play with no fans, says Solskj\u00e6r</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The match is being relived on Saturday in a webcast that features a script written by John Walsh, who attended as an 11-year-old fan, plus a \u201cpitch-side reporter\u201d giving in-game updates, as well as player interviews. Organised by the chairman, Les Byers, to try to raise funds to ease Workington\u2019s financial problems caused by the coronavirus crisis, the hope is that fans of each club will pay a \u00a32 fee to watch the event. Burkinshaw, who after a 15-year playing career became Tottenham\u2019s second-most successful manager, has also contributed with his memories of a contest staged in freezing conditions.</p> <p>Of his meeting with Edwards, one of an 18-man United party who travelled by second-class rail, he tells the Guardian: \u201cMe and Duncan got together on the night ahead and went out and had a coffee and a piece of toast together. We\u2019d been in the army team in Wales, the Western Command.\u201d </p> <p>Saturday dawned particularly cold. \u201cThe weather wasn\u2019t the best,\u201d Burkinshaw remembers. \u201cThere had been some ice and if I remember rightly players were trying to keep their feet. It levelled things up a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>Walsh, who is now Radio Cumbria\u2019s Workington correspondent, says: \u201cI had watched the Reds since 1953. The crowd was massive. I\u2019d never been in one that big \u2013 21,500 on that ground, which was absolutely fantastic. United had about 5,000 and we made up the rest. When Workington came out the crescendo was overwhelming and then we scored \u2013 it was almost like deadly silence and then all of a sudden it changed. The shock had been scoring after six minutes against the champions of England.</p> <p>\u201cWe had only signed Clive Colbridge in September from York City \u2013 he was a left-winger, tricky, quick. For his goal, Harry Gregg came out and a Billy Robson shot was blocked by Gregg\u2019s leg, the ball went to Colbridge on the edge of the area and he hurled it into a vacant net. Of course he became a hero after that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"837ee83110fa4859e5cef3e04d1f5f80d1e4cee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/837ee83110fa4859e5cef3e04d1f5f80d1e4cee9/0_116_2013_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The matchday programme from an FA Cup tie that, at one stage, appeared set to become one of the greatest shocks in the competition\u2019s history\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The matchday programme from an FA Cup tie that, at one stage, appeared set to become one of the greatest shocks in the competition\u2019s history.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leslie Millman collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Colbridge had been signed by Joe Harvey, though some players remained from an 85-match Bill Shankly tenure three years before. \u201cNorman Mitchell, the right-winger, Bobby Brown, a right-back, Alex Rollo, and Matthew Newlands, the goalkeeper, were his,\u201d Walsh says of Shankly, who sent best wishes to Workington on the tie\u2019s eve.</p> <p>Harvey\u2019s full XI was a 2-3-5 that read: Newlands; Brown, Rollo; Jack Bertolini, George Aitken, Burkinshaw; Mitchell, Robson, Ted Purdon, Ken Chisholm, Colbridge. \u201cThe first half, Workington were the better side,\u201d Walsh remembers. \u201cI think Bobby Charlton has said as much in subsequent interviews. We were unlucky not to be at least two goals ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Burkinshaw was a wing-half, then a wide-midfield position. \u201cI was playing against Charlton,\u201d he says. \u201cUnited were a very big [successful] side in those days, and, of course, it was an FA Cup game. It didn\u2019t worry me at all. I was 22 and at that age you\u2019re not worried about anybody, really. You\u2019ve always got that belief in yourself and in the team.\u201d</p> <p>Workington had shocked United in the first half and the opposition manager was not best pleased. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it at the time but was told that Busby was absolutely raging at half-time,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cHe left the director\u2019s box to speak to his team.\u201d</p> <p>Busby\u2019s talk worked, though following the interval Workington walked out confident. \u201cWe were winning 1-0 and we thought we were in with a chance,\u201d Burkinshaw says. \u201cJoe Harvey wasn\u2019t afraid that we could have pulled off a shock because he\u2019d been captain of Newcastle when they were winning things. But in the second half they came back into it, and Dennis Viollet got three goals, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>He indeed did: on 54, 56, and 62 minutes. The dream was over but the occasion had lived up to its fevered anticipation. \u201cOnce the draw was made and you\u2019re playing against Man United there\u2019s only one topic of conversation,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cI was at grammar school and although it was rugby playing we had a crew of us who were football fanatics and there was plenty of conversation about the match. It was tremendous.\u201d </p> <p>Afterwards Burkinshaw travelled to Liverpool alongside Jimmy Murphy, Busby\u2019s assistant. \u201cI\u2019d got a girlfriend who became my wife and I was going back to Liverpool to see her. Jimmy was on the train and we went back down together,\u201d he says.</p> <p>That FA Cup tie lives on in Workington folklore and is given poignancy by the fact the Munich air tragedy occur only a month later, claiming 23 lives, including those of Edwards, Byrne, Taylor and Colman.</p> <p><em>For more information on the webcast </em><em>on Saturday</em><em>, including how to purchase tickets, click <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/workington-v-manchester-utd-recreating-the-famous-1958-fa-cup-game-tickets-102896173224\">here</a>.</em></p>",

The game takes place in front of a record home crowd of 21,500 at Borough Park and they see Workington stun a first-choice United XI featuring Harry Gregg, Roger Byrne, Bill Foulkes, Mark Jones, Eddie Colman, Edwards, Kenny Morgans, Albert Scanlon, Bobby Charlton, Dennis Viollet and Tommy Taylor, via a six-minute Clive Colbridge goal that gives them a deserved half-time lead. It was a moment to remember even if United did go on to win 3-1. The match is being relived on Saturday in a webcast that features a script written by John Walsh, who attended as an 11-year-old fan, plus a \u201cpitch-side reporter\u201d giving in-game updates, as well as player interviews. Organised by the chairman, Les Byers, to try to raise funds to ease Workington\u2019s financial problems caused by the coronavirus crisis, the hope is that fans of each club will pay a \u00a32 fee to watch the event. Burkinshaw, who after a 15-year playing career became Tottenham\u2019s second-most successful manager, has also contributed with his memories of a contest staged in freezing conditions. Of his meeting with Edwards, one of an 18-man United party who travelled by second-class rail, he tells the Guardian: \u201cMe and Duncan got together on the night ahead and went out and had a coffee and a piece of toast together. We\u2019d been in the army team in Wales, the Western Command.\u201d Saturday dawned particularly cold. \u201cThe weather wasn\u2019t the best,\u201d Burkinshaw remembers. \u201cThere had been some ice and if I remember rightly players were trying to keep their feet. It levelled things up a little bit.\u201d Walsh, who is now Radio Cumbria\u2019s Workington correspondent, says: \u201cI had watched the Reds since 1953. The crowd was massive. I\u2019d never been in one that big \u2013 21,500 on that ground, which was absolutely fantastic. United had about 5,000 and we made up the rest. When Workington came out the crescendo was overwhelming and then we scored \u2013 it was almost like deadly silence and then all of a sudden it changed. The shock had been scoring after six minutes against the champions of England. \u201cWe had only signed Clive Colbridge in September from York City \u2013 he was a left-winger, tricky, quick. For his goal, Harry Gregg came out and a Billy Robson shot was blocked by Gregg\u2019s leg, the ball went to Colbridge on the edge of the area and he hurled it into a vacant net. Of course he became a hero after that.\u201d Colbridge had been signed by Joe Harvey, though some players remained from an 85-match Bill Shankly tenure three years before. \u201cNorman Mitchell, the right-winger, Bobby Brown, a right-back, Alex Rollo, and Matthew Newlands, the goalkeeper, were his,\u201d Walsh says of Shankly, who sent best wishes to Workington on the tie\u2019s eve. Harvey\u2019s full XI was a 2-3-5 that read: Newlands; Brown, Rollo; Jack Bertolini, George Aitken, Burkinshaw; Mitchell, Robson, Ted Purdon, Ken Chisholm, Colbridge. \u201cThe first half, Workington were the better side,\u201d Walsh remembers. \u201cI think Bobby Charlton has said as much in subsequent interviews. We were unlucky not to be at least two goals ahead.\u201d Burkinshaw was a wing-half, then a wide-midfield position. \u201cI was playing against Charlton,\u201d he says. \u201cUnited were a very big [successful] side in those days, and, of course, it was an FA Cup game. It didn\u2019t worry me at all. I was 22 and at that age you\u2019re not worried about anybody, really. You\u2019ve always got that belief in yourself and in the team.\u201d Workington had shocked United in the first half and the opposition manager was not best pleased. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it at the time but was told that Busby was absolutely raging at half-time,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cHe left the director\u2019s box to speak to his team.\u201d Busby\u2019s talk worked, though following the interval Workington walked out confident. \u201cWe were winning 1-0 and we thought we were in with a chance,\u201d Burkinshaw says. \u201cJoe Harvey wasn\u2019t afraid that we could have pulled off a shock because he\u2019d been captain of Newcastle when they were winning things. But in the second half they came back into it, and Dennis Viollet got three goals, didn\u2019t he?\u201d He indeed did: on 54, 56, and 62 minutes. The dream was over but the occasion had lived up to its fevered anticipation. \u201cOnce the draw was made and you\u2019re playing against Man United there\u2019s only one topic of conversation,\u201d Walsh says. \u201cI was at grammar school and although it was rugby playing we had a crew of us who were football fanatics and there was plenty of conversation about the match. It was tremendous.\u201d Afterwards Burkinshaw travelled to Liverpool alongside Jimmy Murphy, Busby\u2019s assistant. \u201cI\u2019d got a girlfriend who became my wife and I was going back to Liverpool to see her. Jimmy was on the train and we went back down together,\u201d he says. That FA Cup tie lives on in Workington folklore and is given poignancy by the fact the Munich air tragedy occur only a month later, claiming 23 lives, including those of Edwards, Byrne, Taylor and Colman.

I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague <strong>Sarah Marsh</strong> in London. Here\u2019s the latest from the Minneapolis protests: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Protests against police brutality have continued in cities across the US, including Minneapolis, Denver, New York and Oakland following the killing of George Floyd. </strong>Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody after a white officer handcuffed hum kneeled on his neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe.</li> \n   <li><strong>In Minneapolis, police abandoned the 3rd precinct police station, which has been a major protest site.</strong> Crowds breached the station and set the entrance on fire. Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard.</strong> Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d</strong> The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Minnesota National Guard </strong><strong>sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor</strong><strong> declared a state of emergency. </strong>Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d</strong> into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:01:07.860Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0b0908f0898700351e5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:50:08.046Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets. He was pointedly asked by one reporter: \u201cwho is in charge?\u201d. He directed questions about the role of police to the city\u2019s commissioner, but called the protests \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Frey:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that, our entire city recognises that. What we have seen over the past several hours and past several nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. Our community cannot and will not tolerate it ... We are working with our officers right now of course, with resources provided by the state ... It was clear as of last night [that] we needed additional help and we got that, some form the state and we are expecting more as well.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0aee28f0898700351e5de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:44:43.759Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey, in that press conference just now, also addressed the decision to abandon the city\u2019s third precinct police station. He said he made the order for police to evacuate the building, which it appears has since been significantly damaged by fire, after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of the lives of our officers or the public.

Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong>, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, <strong>George Floyd</strong>, in Minneapolis police custody.</p> \n  <p><strong>Louisville Metro Police</strong> confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m.</p> \n  <p>Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. </p> \n  <p>Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor <strong>Greg Fischer</strong> tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. </p> \n  <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.</p> \n  <p>Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in a Georgia neighborhood in February. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09c758f084e882655acf5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:24:53.075Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the US grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">third night of protests</a> over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">George Floyd protests: what we know so far</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09aed8f087e3ca0f65835\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:22:38.991Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972/0_182_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a/0_322_4895_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed099698f084e882655acec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:11:54.922Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Minneapolis mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents.

Their physicians later suggested they may have had mild cases of coronavirus, and they were tested for antibodies.</p> \n  <p>The Virginia senator emphasized that he was not taking the antibody test result as a carte blanche to ignore health guidelines.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhile those antibodies could make us less likely to be re-infected or infect others, there is still too much uncertainty over what protection antibodies may actually provide,\u201d Kaine said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo we will keep following CDC guidelines\u2014hand-washing, mask wearing, social distancing. We encourage others to do so as well.

Protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the US over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck.

Jimenez, along with producer Bill Kirkos and photojournalist Leonel Mendez, were arrested earlier this morning live on air, while covering the protests.

Walz described the arrests as \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and said CNN\u2019s team clearly has the right to be there. He added that he wants the media to be in Minnesota to cover the protests. Hello. I am running the Guardian\u2019s live feed from London, bringing you the latest updates on the Minneapolis protests. Please do get in touch with me if you have any information to share. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The arrest of the CNN crew in Minneapolis \u201cdid not make any sense, according to a former police chief who now serves as a CNN law enforcement analyst. \u201cThe state police are going to have a lot to answer for with this arrest here,\u201d said Charles Ramsey. \u201cHe\u2019s standing there, he identified himself. You can see his credentials. Just move him to your want him to be.\u201d Ramsey added that the there was \u201cno way something like that should occur.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know where the person in command of that platoon is. But that\u2019s an individual who is definitely not taking charge,\u201d he added. CNN has criticized the arrest of one of its teams on the ground in Minneapolis in a tweet this morning, and called for their release. They tweeted: The Minnesota State Patrol arrested a CNN reporter reporting live on television early Friday morning while covering the Minneapolis protests, without giving any reason, and led him and three crew members away in handcuffs. Reporter Omar Jiminez had just shown a protester being arrested when about half a dozen white police officers surrounded him. \u201cWe can move back to where you like,\u201d he told the officers wearing gas masks and face shields, before explaining that he and his crew were members of the press. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of your way.\u201d A Mississippi mayor whose remarks about the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody is refusing calls to resign, including from his own town\u2019s board of aldermen. \u201cWhy in the world would anyone choose to become a police officer in our society today?\u201d Petal Mayor Hal Marx tweeted Tuesday, the day four Minneapolis police officers were fired. In a follow-up tweet, the Republican directly referenced the Floyd case, saying he didn\u2019t see anything unreasonable: \u201cIf you can say you can\u2019t breathe, you\u2019re breathing. Most likely that man died of overdose or heart attack. Video doesn\u2019t show his resistance that got him in that position. Police being crucified. Javon Patterson, an offensive lineman with the Indianapolis Colts, and Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Anthony Alford both criticized Marx on social media. \u201cHow could you watch this disturbing video and make such an idiotic comment. But this guy is supposed to be the leader of the friendly city,\u2019 Alford, a Petal High School alumnus, wrote on Facebook. This is why it\u2019s important to vote people. You don\u2019t want people like Mayor Hal Marx in charge. Marx\u2019s Twitter account no longer exists. Police nationwide, in unequivocal and unprecedented language, have condemned the actions of Minneapolis police in the custody death of a handcuffed black man who cried for help as an officer knelt on his neck, pinning him to the pavement for at least eight minutes. But some civil rights advocates say their denunciations are empty words without meaningful reform behind them. Authorities say George Floyd was detained Monday because he matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, and the 46-year-old resisted arrest. A disturbing video shows Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck, even as Floyd begs for air and slowly stops talking and moving. There is no need to see more video, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Police Chief David Roddy tweeted Wednesday. |There no need to wait to see how it plays out. There is no need to put a knee on someone\u2019s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you dont have an issue with this ... turn it in.\u201d Sheriffs and police chiefs have strongly criticized the Minneapolis officer on social media and praised the city\u2019s police chief for his quick dismissal of four officers at the scene. Some even called for them to be criminally charged. \u201cI am deeply disturbed by the video of Mr. Floyd being murdered in the street with other officers there letting it go on\u201d, Polk County, Georgia, Sheriff Johnny Moats wrote on Facebook. \u201cI can assure everyone, me or any of my deputies will never treat anyone like that as long as Im Sheriff. This kind of brutality is terrible and it needs to stop. All Officers involved need to be arrested and charged immediately. Praying for the family.\u201d Footage of CNN reporter and his crew being arrested live on air. Police and fire engines have arrived at the centre of the protests in Minneapolis. CNN crew on the site reported that they witnessed the authorities arriving to the scene just after 4:30 am ET. CNN has reported that one of their journalists, Omar Jimenez, was taken into police custody during a live broadcast at the site of the protests in Minneapolis. Jimenez\u2019s crew, including a producer and a camera operator, were also placed in handcuffs. More on Donald Trump\u2019s tweet that was flagged by Twitter for \u201cglorifying violence\u201d. Protesters angry over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody turned out for a demonstration in Columbus that began peacefully but turned violent, leaving smashed storefront windows along downtown streets around the statehouse. The crowd of around 400 people entered into a standoff with Columbus police Thursday night, blocking the intersection of key streets in the Ohio capital for hours, the Columbus Dispatch reported. The demonstration began as a peaceful protest, but news outlets reported protesters began throwing objects like water bottles at officers, who responded by using tear gas on the crowd. A scuffle between a protester and an officer broke out around 9:45 pm, WCMH-TV reported. Some protesters attempted to breach the Ohio Statehouse later Thursday, the TV station reported, sharing photographs of what appeared to be smashed windows at the statehouse. Calls and emails to Columbus police and the Ohio State Highway Patrol, which covers Capitol security, from The Associated Press weren\u2019t returned overnight. \u201cI understand why some residents are angry and taking to the streets. I have said many times that racism exists across the country, state and right here in Columbus. We are committed to addressing racism wherever we see it, Mayor Andrew Ginther tweeted before 9 p.m. I respect peaceful protests and ask residents to remain peaceful in their actions tonight and every night.\u201d Hello everyone.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The latest news story on the events in Minneapolis. Twitter accused President Donald Trump on Friday of \u201cglorifying violence\u201d, attaching a disclaimer to one of his tweets about unrest in Minneapolis that it said broke its rules. \u201c...These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won*t let that happen. Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet read. Trump\u2019s message can now be read only after clicking on a notice which says: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public\u2019s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\u201d In a thread, Twitter said it had taken the action \u201cin the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts\u201d. People will still \u201cbe able to retweet with comment, but will not be able to like, reply or retweet it.\u201d Twitter\u2019s action came just hours after Trump said he would introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook , in an extraordinary attempt to regulate social media platforms where he has been criticized. The proposed legislation is part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday afternoon. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts. Below are a selection of images on the events in Minneapolis as there was a third night of unrest in Minneapolis. Twitter said that it blocked a post by Donald Trump on Twitter for policy violation, \u201cregarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line\u201d. Below is some more context on the connections associated with it. Twitter has blocked a post by Donald Trump saying that it violates their policies \u201cregarding the glorification of violence based on the historical context of the last line\u201d. It said that the tweet\u2019s connection to violence meant there was a \u201crisk it could inspire similar actions today\u201d. The tweet from Trump said that \u201cthugs\u201d were dishonoring the memory of George Floyd. The last line said said that when \u201clooting starts, shooting starts\u201d. Protesters torched a Minneapolis police station that the department was forced to abandon as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the US over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck. A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd Precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, in the interest of the safety of our personnel\u201d shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set. Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket. The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal has been on the ground and said that there were still people \u201cmilling around\u201d. He said: \u201cEvery now and then someone shouts \u2018national guard is coming\u2019 and panic ensues and and groups run but mostly it is just people standing around watching buildings burn and occasionally groups of mostly young men targeting different buildings.\u201d He said there were half a dozen buildings still burning and thousands still around, although he noted the crowd had thinned out. \u201cIt\u2019s now 2am or so and there is still extensive looting going on, people continuing to break into businesses.\u201d However, he added that the \u201catmosphere has deteriorated\u201d, although earlier it became more aggressive with crowds leaving as they were getting fearful. There is still no sign of law enforcement. \u201cPeople are turning up in cars but most of the really big stores have been comprehensively looted by now ... I would expect people to be protesting for days to come and the big question is will they send the police out?,\u201d he added. Around the area is a residential neighbourhood and the fire brigade has turned up to put out fires on the edge of that area. But other areas have just been left to burn. \u201cIt is unusual [for the police to evacuate]. I was in Ferguson six years ago during the Michael Brown protest and looting and police did not pull out and it is unusual for them to just simply abandon an area,\u201d he said. Among those businesses looted it a medical clinic, as well as a Target store which was looted for fizzy drinks and snacks that were then piled up in a carpark by protestors and given to those who needed. \u201cIt became an unofficial market for protestors,\u201d McGreal said. Follow more from him here. Hello everyone. My name is Sarah Marsh and I am taking over the Guardian\u2019s live feed, bringing you the latest updates on the Minneapolis protests. Please do get in touch with me via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Here is the video of the Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey responding to those tweets from US president Donald Trump. That\u2019s all from me for now. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague Sarah Marsh in London. Here\u2019s the latest from the Minneapolis protests: Protests against police brutality have continued in cities across the US, including Minneapolis, Denver, New York and Oakland following the killing of George Floyd. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody after a white officer handcuffed hum kneeled on his neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe. In Minneapolis, police abandoned the 3rd precinct police station, which has been a major protest site. Crowds breached the station and set the entrance on fire. Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on. Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard. Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d. The Minnesota National Guard sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor declared a state of emergency. Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d. The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated. Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets. He was pointedly asked by one reporter: \u201cwho is in charge?\u201d. He directed questions about the role of police to the city\u2019s commissioner, but called the protests \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Frey: There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that, our entire city recognises that. What we have seen over the past several hours and past several nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. Our community cannot and will not tolerate it ... We are working with our officers right now of course, with resources provided by the state ... It was clear as of last night [that] we needed additional help and we got that, some form the state and we are expecting more as well.\u201d Frey, in that press conference just now, also addressed the decision to abandon the city\u2019s third precinct police station. He said he made the order for police to evacuate the building, which it appears has since been significantly damaged by fire, after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of the lives of our officers or the public. We could not risk serious injury to anyone and we will continue to parol the third precinct entirely. We will continue to do our jobs in that area. Brick and mortar is not as important as life.\u201d Protestors reportedly breaking glass windows of the state house in Columbus, Ohio. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey is holding a press conference as we speak, and has responded to US President Donald Trump\u2019s tweets earlier. Trump called Frey \u201cvery weak\u201d and described protestors as \u201cthugs\u201d. \u201c[W]hen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d Trump wrote. Frey\u2019s response: Well, let me say this, weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is Pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis. Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. Is this a difficult time period, yes, but you had better be damn sure we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d Reports that Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey will hold a press conference shortly. Here\u2019s our updated video on fires that have erupted in Minneapolis, and the protests sweeping across the US in wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. Chris McGreal, our reporter on the ground in Minneapolis, has just posted this footage to Twitter: Andrea Jenkins, the vice president of Minneapolis City Council, has told MSNBC that George Floyd had previously worked with one of the police officers fired after his death. AP reports that at least seven people were shot Thursday night in Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March. It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. Louisville Metro Police confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m. Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home. Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery in a Georgia neighborhood in February. As the US grapples with a third night of protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far: Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents. And right now working together means clearing the area.\u201d US president Donald Trump has tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard. St Paul police department reports over 170 businesses damaged or looted, and dozens of fires but no reports of serious injuries. The official city account has tweeted this. It is, however, important to note it is saying it is relying on unconfirmed reports. From AP, speaking to people around the protests: \u201cWe\u2019re burning our own neighborhood,\u201d said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. \u201cThis is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.\u201d No officers could be seen beyond the station. \u201cWhat that cop did was wrong, but I\u2019m scared now,\u201d Brown said. Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage. Protesters destroyed property \u201cbecause the system is broken,\u201d said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood. \u201cThey\u2019re making money off of us,\u201d he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. \u201cI didn\u2019t break anything.\u201d That\u2019s all from me today, handing over to my colleague Josh Taylor in Australia. Here\u2019s where we stand this evening: Protests against police brutality have continued in cities across the US, including Minneapolis, Denver, New York and Oakland following the killing of George Floyd. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody after a white officer handcuffed hum kneeled on his neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe. In Minneapolis, police abandoned the 3rd protest police station, which has been a major protest site. Crowds breached the station and set the entrance on fire. Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on. The governor of Minnesota activated the National Guard to respond to the protests and declared a state of emergency in Minneapolis, St. Paul and surrounding areas. Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d. In Denver, shots were heard outside the state capitol. Protestors were ushered inside by state patrol and no one appears to have been hurt. In New York, officers arrested at least 40 at the protests. Charges included civil disobedience. Officers pinned down several demonstrators and used tear gas and rubber bullets on the crowd. Martin Luther King III, a human rights leader and son of the late Martin Luther King, Jr. quoted his father, who said, \u201criot is the language of the unheard\u201d. King is one of many human rights advocates who have condemned the police\u2019s treatment of Floyd. UN Human Rights commissioner Michelle Bachelet said she was \u201cdismayed\u201d to add Floyd\u2019s name to a long list of Black Americans who have been killed by the police. From The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal: As darkness fell the mood soured further and protesters again began burning buildings. They hit a liquor store, where exploding bottles sent people scurrying in fear, and a pawn shop. But the primary target was the 3rd precinct police station, where a group of young men broke through the wire fence hastily erected before the police withdrew earlier in the day. As the fire grew they led chants of George Floyd\u2019s name and \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d until flames engulfed the building. Protesters cheered and celebrated with fireworks. Police officers watched from two blocks away but did not intervene. Fire crews attempted to put out other fires but did not go near the police station. As the fire spread, thousands more protesters poured into the area. Rumors were shouted amongst the crows that the national guard were on their way, and people began to run, but so far there is no evidence of any outside intervention by force. Local businesses, including a wine shop are on fire. Crowds have also lit fireworks. The Minnesota National Guard has sent 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas. The Minneapolis police have confirmed that at 10pm local time, officers evacuated the 3rd precinct station. \u201cProtestors forcibly entered the building and have ignited several fires,\u201d a spokesperson for the Minneapolis PD said in a statement. The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal is at the precinct. The 3rd precinct police station in Minneapolis, which as been a major site of the protests appears to have been breached, and set ablaze. The police seem to have evacuated the scene. The message on the police scanner: \u201cThe 3rd precinct has been compromised\u201d. In Minneapolis, it seems officers are being evacuated from the 3rd precinct police station, the main protest site, per the scanner. There is fire at the precinct, the crowd seems to have broken in. In Minneapolis, an officer in a squad car was captured on video pepper-spraying protesters and bystanders on the street. The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal reports from the Twin Cities: The battered police station for the Minneapolis 3rd Precinct, sealed off behind wire fencing, looked virtually abandoned on Thursday evening. There was not an officer in sight as a large march of protesters moved off toward the city center chanting demands for justice, carrying signs \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!!\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d, and accompanied by a large skull on a bike wearing a police hat. The march passed burned out buildings still smoldering from Wednesday night\u2019s attacks. Other people made their point standing for hours on hundreds of street corners. It was a different story 15 minutes to the east of where Floyd died, in neighboring St Paul, where a group of several hundred protesters faced down the police at a shopping mall. As the crowd swelled, and some attempted to break into a Target store, the police fired rubber bullets and then tear gas. The mood worsened and groups broke away to begin attacking other businesses, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store set on fire. The protests in the Twin cities are ongoing. The fire department is quelling a blaze outside the police station in the 3rd precinct, per reports from local journalists. Police have used tear gas, rubber bullets and flashbangs against protestors, and the national guard have arrived at the protests. Martin Luther King III, a human rights leader and son of the late Martin Luther King, Jr posted a video of his father explaining that \u201ca riot is the language of the unheard\u201d. \u201cA man was lynched. In broad daylight. In public. In America. In 2020,\u201d King III said. \u201cAnd the men responsible have not been arrested. We will not stay quiet.\u201d The US Justice Department has said it has made an investigation into George Floyd\u2019s death a \u201ctop priority\u201d as thousands continue to take to the streets across the country demanding justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality. The FBI is also investigating whether the police officers involved violated federal laws. State agencies in Minnesota have also launched investigations. Two of the police officers who restrained Floyd were previously involved in violent incidents while on duty, according to a database that documents instances of police brutality. Derek Chauvin, officer seen in video footage from the incident with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck had 18 prior complaints filed against him while he was on the force, according to the Minneapolis police department. He and three other officers involved have been fired. In a video, Chauvin is seen kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes, as Floyd pleaded that he couldn\u2019t breathe. The officers responded to a call from a grocery store that siad Floyd has used a forged check to pay. The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal brings us more from the Twin Cities: In Oakland a protest near city hall drew a small but vocal crowd of about 50 to 75 people. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports: Demonstrators took turns rallying the group. \u201cEvery day I wake up is an act of mother fucking resistance. I wake up and I\u2019m risking my life,\u201d said Monifa Dayo, a local resident. \u201cEvery day we can and need to do something to dismantle white supremacy.\u201d Aisha Friedman-Nerian, an 18-year-old from Berkeley, had helped organize the event, saying the news in Minneapolis made her decided \u201cenough is enough\u201d. \u201cI saw that and I said, \u2018It\u2019s time to get it poppin in the Bay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to disrupt white peoples\u2019 spaces. Because they violate our spaces, our bodies, everyday.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re tired of seeing our black and brown brothers and sisters become a hashtag,\u201d said Hadassah Zenore-Davis, a 16-year-old from Berkeley. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of global pandemic and they still show us no humanity.\u201d In Denver, protestors have blocked a highway. Here\u2019s more from a photojournalist for Denver7, KMGH-TV: In New York City, have arrested around 40 protesters, according to the NYPD. Officers have used tear gas and apprehended protestors demonstrating against police brutality. Those apprehended were charged with assault of a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon, and civil disobedience. Here\u2019s more from Minneapolis: In Colorado, protesters have gathered at the capitol again. Shots were heard outside the state capitol earlier, as demonstrators gathered to protest police brutality. A spokesman for the Colorado State Patrol told The Denver Post that he wasn\u2019t aware of any injuries. The protestors organized to demand \u201cjustice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Sean Reed &amp; Others.\u201d Taylor, an EMT, was shot and killed in her apartment by a police officer in Kentucky. Reed was shot and killed by police in Indiana. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, has condemned the killing of George Floyd, urging the US to \u201ctake serious action to stop such killings, and to ensure justice is done when they do occur\u201d. More from her statement: This is the latest in a long line of killings of unarmed African Americans by US police officers and members of the public,\u201d Bachelet said. \u201cI am dismayed to have to add George Floyd\u2019s name to that of Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Michael Brown and many other unarmed African Americans who have died over the years at the hands of the police -- as well as people such as Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin who were killed by armed members of the public.\u201d And here are some photos from the protests in Minneapolis. More scenes from New York, where police have been arresting protesters. At protests in New York, Police have made arrests. In Colorado, where demonstrators have also gathered to protest police violence, state representatives said there were shots fired outside the capitol. The state patrol ushered protestors inside for safety, according to a reporter for the Denver Post: The Republican National Committee has sent a letter to the governor of North Carolina, outlining the safety measures that need to be in place if the RNC were to go ahead with hosting its convention in Charlotte. The New York Times first reported on the letter, which asks governor Roy Cooper to set safety conditions and guidelines prior to the convention. \u201cWe do not have solid guidelines from the state and cannot in good faith ask thousands of visitors to begin paying deposits and making travel plans without knowing the full commitment of the governor,\u201d the letter reads. RNC officials have asked Cooper to approve health checks and screenings for convention attendees, among other safety measures. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has declared a local emergency. A declaration from his office indicates that the city has requested assistance from the state, including the intervention of the national guard, to help local authorities restore \u201csafety and calm due to the civil disturbance\u201d. The state\u2019s governor Tim Walz has also declared a state of emergency in Minneapolis, St Paul and surrounding areas. Demonstrators across the country are taking to the streets after George Floyd\u2019s killing. Floyd\u2019s family has called for murder charges against the officers involved in his arrest. But Michael Freeman, the Hennepin County attorney, said he didn\u2019t want to discuss the investigation into Floyd\u2019s death. During the news conference, a reporter asked Freeman: \u201cI think people will be hard-pressed to understand how you can\u2019t bring charges at least against the officer who had his knee on the neck.\u201d Freeman replied: \u201cIt is a violation of my ethics to talk and evaluate evidence before we announce our charging decision. And I will not do that. I will say this, that video is graphic and horrific and terrible and no person should do that. But my job in the end is to prove he violated a criminal statute. And there is other evidence that does not support a criminal charge. We need to wade through all of that evidence and come to a meaningful decision and we are doing that to the best of our ability.\u201d The four Minneapolis officers involved in the killing of George Floyd were swiftly fired after footage of his death went viral. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re permanently losing their badges. Officers in the US are frequently rehired after their termination for misconduct, a problem that experts say increases the likelihood of abuse and killings by police. Despite the decision on Tuesday to fire the policeman who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes, along with three other officers at the scene, it\u2019s uncertain if the officers will face long-term repercussions. On the contrary, some civil rights advocates warn the men could ultimately avoid legal and financial consequences, continue working in other police departments or even win back their positions. That\u2019s how policing works across America, researchers and activists said, and it\u2019s a process that can drag victims\u2019 families through years of court proceedings and media attention, with minimal relief at the end. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democratic senator of Nevada, announced that she is not interested in serving as Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. Cortez Masto, who in 2016 became the first Latina elected to the Senate, was one of the women regarded as a contender in the 2020 veepstakes. Today, she announced she\u2019s not interested in the job. \u201cI support Joe Biden 100% and will work tirelessly to help get him elected this November. It is an honor to be considered as a potential running mate but I have decided to withdraw my name from consideration,\u201d she said in a statement. She noted that Nevada\u2019s economy was one of the hardest hit, and she wants to focus on helping her state recover. In 2016, Cortex Masto, 56, became the first Latina elected to the Senate. Here are some dispatches from the George Floyd protests in the Twin cities, from the Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal: Here\u2019s the full text of Trump\u2019s executive order. This bit is especially on-brand for Trump, and a bit unusual for a legal document: Twitter now selectively decides to place a warning label on certain tweets in a manner that clearly reflects political bias. As has been reported, Twitter seems never to have placed such a label on another politician\u2019s tweet. As recently as last week, Representative Adam Schiff was continuing to mislead his followers by peddling the long-disproved Russian Collusion Hoax, and Twitter did not flag those tweets. Unsurprisingly, its officer in charge of so-called \u2018Site Integrity\u2019 has flaunted his political bias in his own tweets. In response to the president\u2019s executive order, the US Chamber of Commerce issued a rather pointed statement: We believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system. Regardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.\u201d The Trump administration is finalizing rules that will allow hunters in Alaska\u2019s national preserves to shoot bears and wolves, and their cubs and pups, while they are in their dens. The National Park Service is reversing regulations written by the Barack Obama administration, which banned some of the much-criticized practices for hunting the predators, including luring bears with food like doughnuts. Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, called the rule change \u201camazingly cruel\u201d and said it was \u201cjust the latest in a string of efforts to reduce protections for America\u2019s wildlife at the behest of oil companies and trophy hunters\u201d. The park service\u2019s deputy director, David Vela, said the change would \u201cmore closely align hunting and trapping regulations with those established by the state of Alaska\u201d. Here\u2019s our tech reporter Julia Carrie Wong\u2019s take on the Trump executive order aimed at regulating social media: The president\u2019s executive order on social media will kick off a heated debate over free speech on the internet that will, in all likelihood, lead to nothing. This manufactured dispute is a distraction for the media, and it will almost certainly be an effective one. It would be in everyone\u2019s interest \u2013 including its own \u2013 if Twitter pulled the plug on this specious debate, banned Trump for repeated and egregious violations of its rules, and helped us all focus on what\u2019s more important. More than 100,000 people in the United States have died of Covid-19, more than any other nation in the world. The figure is probably an undercount. More than 1.7 million people in the US have had confirmed cases of Covid-19, more than any other nation in the world. The figure is almost certainly an undercount. The US federal government completely botched the rollout of testing for the coronavirus at the beginning of the pandemic and continues to lag in providing adequate testing for its populace. Read her opinion column in its entirety: Governor Tim Walz signed an executive order, calling on the Minnesota national guard \u201cto help protect Minnesotans\u2019 safety and maintain peace in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death\u201d. After a generally peaceful protest yesterday, things turned violent last night. Windows were broken, and crowds looted nearby shops. Police in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators and the neighborhood around the police station in South Minneapolis devolved into chaos. An apartment under construction was discovered to have been burned down the next morning. Demonstrators indicated that those responsible for the looting and property destruction weren\u2019t the locals who had taken to peacefully protesting the treatment of Floyd. \u201cThe demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved,\u201d Walz said. \u201cThe purpose of the national Guard is to protect people, to protect people safely demonstrating, and to protect small business owners.\u201d That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump signed a social media executive order as the US coronavirus death toll surpassed 101,000. The president is looking to alter liability protections for social media companies, but experts said he does not have the authority to do so, and Trump\u2019s critics said the order was a blatant attempt to distract from the country\u2019s mounting death toll. Trump and Kayleigh McEnany once again criticized states\u2019 efforts to expand vote by mail amid the pandemic. The president and his press secretary argued that vote by mail is particularly susceptible to fraud, even though voter fraud is actually very rare and in-person polling places raise concerns about spreading coronavirus. More than 40 million Americans have now filed for unemployment benefits. Another 2.1 million Americans submitted unemployment claims last week, as many businesses remain shuttered because of the pandemic. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, will sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks. The Democratic governor said businessowners had a right to protect themselves and other patrons by requiring mask usage. The Minneapolis mayor said the protests in reaction to the death of George Floyd were the \u201cresult of so much built-up anger and sadness\u201d. Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer put a knee on the back of his neck. Mayor Jacob Frey said the protests in response to Floyd\u2019s death were the result of \u201canger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community \u2013 not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years\u201d. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Before signing his social media executive order, Trump once again criticized states\u2019 efforts to expand vote by mail. The president argued mass vote by mail would turn US elections into a \u201ctotal joke.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s such fraud and abuse,\u201d Trump said of vote by mail, even though voter fraud is actually very rare. Repeating a false claim that was fact-checked by Twitter, Trump said, \u201cAnybody in California that\u2019s breathing gets a ballot.\u201d When a reporter tried to correct the president, Trump cut him off, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not finished.\u201d In reality, California governor Gavin Newsom has only asked local officials to mail ballots to registered voters. When a reporter noted this, Trump replied, \u201cOh really? So when he sends out 28 million ballots and they\u2019re in all the mailboxes and kids go and they raid the mailboxes and they hand them to people that are signing the ballots ... you don\u2019t think that happens?\u201d There is no evidence that this is happening. Even as Trump signed his social media executive order, he acknowledged it could be vulnerable to legal challenges. For example, the order looks to modify Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants liability protections to social media companies. However, experts have said Section 230 would almost certainly have to be amended by Congress, and the president appeared to acknowledge this. \u201cI guess it\u2019s going to be challenged in court, but what isn\u2019t?\u201d Trump said of the order, according to the White House pool report. When asked about trying to shut down Twitter, the president similarly said there were legal hurdles with that proposal. \u201cI\u2019d have to go through a legal process,\u201d Trump said. The president\u2019s social media executive order comes a day after the US coronavirus death toll surpassed 100,000. Trump addressed the death toll in a tweet this morning, but commentators quesioned why he did not deliver any kind of remarks to commemorate the lives lost to coronavirus. In contrast to his relative quiet about the grim milestone, Trump has sent off several tweets criticizing Twitter for fact-checking his false claims about vote by mail, and he has now signed an executive order aimed at regulating social media companies. The president\u2019s critics suggested that the order was nothing more than an attempt to deflect attention away from the coronavirus death toll and Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic. As he prepared to sign his social media executive order, Trump complained about Twitter fact-checking two of his inaccurate tweets, calling the effort \u201cpolitical activism.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re here today to defend free speech from one of the greatest dangers,\u201d Trump said, slamming social media companies as a \u201cmonopoly.\u201d When asked why he had not deleted his Twitter account if he thinks the platform is biased, Trump blamed the media. \u201cIf we had fair press in this country I would do that in a heartbeat,\u201d Trump said. Trump has gathered the White House press pool in the Oval Office as he signs an executive order aimed at regulating social media companies. The president, appearing alongside attorney general William Barr, said the executive order would look to modify Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants liability protections to social media companies. Trump said Barr would also work with states to establish their own regulations and the administration would develop policies to prevent companies that \u201csuppress free speech\u201d from receiving taxpayer dollars. However, experts have already said Section 230 can likely only be amended by Congress, leaving Trump\u2019s executive order very vulnerable to a legal challenge. The 2020 Boston Marathon, which was originally supposed to occur last month, has now been canceled. The city initially delayed the event, which brings in more than $200 million to Boston\u2019s economy, from April to September out of concern about the spread of coronavirus. Boston mayor Marty Walsh said the decision to postpone was made with the hope that coronavirus \u201cwould no longer be a significant public health risk\u201d by September, but officials no longer feel confident in that. \u201cEconomically, it\u2019s a big hit there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThis entire three months has been a big hit for most sectors economically. \u201cCertainly we\u2019re feeling it in our budget, our restaurants are feeling it, our small businesses are feeling it. Many of our offices are feeling it. We\u2019ll survive. It might be a different reality for a lot of people.\u201d The president just told reporters that he would sign an executive order directed at social media companies in the next half hour. Trump added that he would hold a separate press conference on China tomorrow, when he will likely again accuse Twitter of helping Beijing spread false information about coronavirus. After Twitter added a fact-checking label to two of Trump\u2019s tweets about vote by mail, the platform similarly labeled tweets from a senior Chinese official who claimed the virus may have originated in the United States. Moments ago, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany accused Twitter of being \u201cvery hastily eager to censor President Trump and his employees,\u201d even though the platform did not remove Trump\u2019s inaccurate tweets. The House has voted to send the FISA bill to a conference committee with the Senate, after Republican members turned against the bill at the urging of the president. The House voted 284-122 to send the bill, which would reauthorize three expired surveillance programs, to committee. The vote will give lawmakers a chance to renegotiate a new version of the bill that may be more appealing to Trump, who said he would veto the legislation the House had been prepared to vote on yesterday. But considering the president has conflated the reauthorization with the Obama administration\u2019s surveillance that led to the firing of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, it will probably be difficult to craft a bill to Trump\u2019s liking. Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has concluded her briefing, which ended with the White House adviser once again criticizing states\u2019 efforts to expand vote by mail. A reporter pointed out that McEnany herself has voted by mail 11 times over the past decade, sending her ballot back to her home state of Florida. The press secretary said Trump was comfortable with absentee voting when someone could not physically be in the state, but he was opposed to mass vote by mail due to concerns about voter fraud, which is very rare. \u201cThe president is okay with mail-in voting so long as you have a reason. He\u2019s not okay with mass mail-in voting,\u201d McEnany said. But it\u2019s important to note that Florida does not enforce restrictions on vote by mail. The website of the Florida Division of Elections reads, \u201cExcept on Election Day, no excuse is needed to vote a vote-by-mail ballot.\u201d So when Trump and McEnany say they specifically voted absentee, it\u2019s not exactly accurate because they weren\u2019t asked to provide a reason for not voting in person. They simply voted by mail, as many Americans now want to do out of concern about the spread of coronavirus at polling places. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany deflected a question about a debunked conspiracy theory involving MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. An employee of the conservative website OANN asked if the White House thought Scarborough should sue the president for defamation after Trump repeatedly promoted the theory. The OANN employee seemed to suggest Trump should welcome a lawsuit from Scarborough, so the president could depose the host about the 2001 death of his former staffer, Lori Klausutis. But McEnany interestingly did not take the bait, instead deflecting attention to some of Scarborough\u2019s past comments about the case, indicating the White House may be trying to move away from Trump\u2019s widely criticized attacks on his MSNBC foe. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump is feeling \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201cabsolutely great\u201d (his words) after taking hydroxychloroquine. Quoting the president, McEnany said the president would absolutely take the anti-malaria drug again to help prevent coronavirus. However, the FDA has issued guidance that the drug should not be used outside of a hospital setting due to concerns about possible cardiovascular side effects. An expansive study also indicated that coronavirus patients who received hydroxychloroquine saw a higher death rate than those who did not. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump wants \u201cjustice to be served\u201d for George Floyd, the black man who died after a police officer put a knee on his neck. However, McEnany deflected questions about what justice would look like in this case, including whether the police officers involved should be prosecuted. McEnany described Floyd\u2019s death as \u201cegregious, appalling and tragic\u201d and said Trump is currently being briefed on the case by attorney general William Barr. The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said Trump\u2019s social media executive order would be signed \u201chopefully before 5pm\u201d. But she cast a fair amount of uncertainty over when the order would be ready and provided few details on what it would include. \u201cIt\u2019s still in the works, but it\u2019s getting closer,\u201d McEnany said. CNN reporter Jim Acosta asked White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany why Trump and his advisers do not think he should be fact-checked, when he has often shared false or misleading information over Twitter. McEnany disagreed with the premise of Acosta\u2019s question, arguing it was the media that actually needed to be fact-checked. On Trump\u2019s record of past falsehoods, McEnany said, \u201cHis intent is always to give truthful information to the American people.\u201d According to the Washington Post, the president has made more than 18,000 false or misleading claims since taking office. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany extensively criticized Twitter for fact-checking two of Trump\u2019s tweets about vote by mail. McEnany said Twitter\u2019s fact-checking tool was \u201ctargeted against the president of the United States,\u201d saying the platform was \u201cvery hastily eager to censor President Trump and his employees.\u201d But Twitter did not actually remove Trump\u2019s inaccurate tweets, instead adding a label to them that linked to additional context debunking one of the president\u2019s claims, so it is unclear how the president has been \u201ccensored.\u201d Trump\u2019s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, is now holding a briefing in the White House briefing room. The press secretary opened by acknowledging the loss of George Floyd, saying his death was \u201cabsolutely tragic.\u201d She also confirmed that the justice department has opened an investigation into police involvement in Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cJustice will be served,\u201d McEnany said. As America passes the 100,000 death mark, it has become abundantly clear that the pandemic amounts to a racial disaster of stunning proportions. Figures compiled by APM Research Lab from 40 states show that African Americans are being killed at almost three times the rate of white people. Black Kansans are seven times more likely to die from the virus than white Kansans. In Missouri, Wisconsin and Washington DC the ratio is six times. Such grotesque distortions are most visible in New York City, that giant laboratory test into virulent racial inequity. Data released this week showed that when the city\u2019s zip codes are ranked according to highest death rates, eight out of the top 10 have majority black or Latino populations. None of the 10 are in wealthy, largely white Manhattan. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: The Justice Department announced a settlement Thursday with a South Dakota school district charged with electing board members in a way that discriminated against Native Americans. The case is significant because it marks the first new case the Justice Department filed under the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 voting law, alleging a discriminatory voting scheme. Civil rights groups have loudly criticized the Department\u2019s silence around the law, saying it was abdicating its responsibility to prevent discriminatory voting and giving leeway to bad actors to make it harder to vote. The new case involved the seven-member school board for the Chamberlain School District, which touches three counties in South Dakota. About 70% of the district\u2019s voters are white and the remaining 30% are Native American, but since 2007, just one Native American has won a race for the school board. The Justice Department said in its complaint that that disparity was the result of an \u201cat-large\u201d election system in which the entire school district voted for the school board members. If voters were grouped several districts within the school board\u2019s jurisdiction, Justice Department attorneys said in their complaint, Native American population was significant enough to comprise a majority in at least two of them. \u201cThe Chamberlain School District\u2019s method of election is characterized by the use of practices and procedures that have the result of impairing American Indian electoral opportunities,\u201d Justice Department attorneys wrote in their complaint. \u201cThe at-large method of electing the Chamberlain School Board dilutes the voting strength of American Indian citizens.\u201d Under the settlement, which still needs to be approved by a federal judge, the school district agreed to change the way candidates are elected. Starting in 2021, there will be three districts to elect two candidates each to the school board. The seventh seat will still be at-large. Trump once again lashed out against Twitter, after the social media platform fact-checked two of the president\u2019s tweets about vote by mail. \u201cSo ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid, there are examples, &amp; cases, all over the place,\u201d Trump said. (Voter fraud is actually very rare.) In reality, Twitter did not make any case about vote by mail. The platform simply added a label to Trump\u2019s tweets that read, \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots.\u201d That message linked to a page with tweets from journalists and news articles debunking Trump\u2019s false claim that California was sending ballots to everyone living in the state. In his newest tweet, Trump specifically called out Yoel Roth, Twitter\u2019s head of site integrity, who has attracted scrutiny for some 2016 and 2017 tweets criticizing the president. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said last night that he should be held responsible for the company\u2019s decisions, implictly criticizing the president\u2019s allies for singling out a specific employee. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey said the recent protests in reaction to the death of George Floyd were the \u201cresult of so much built-up anger and sadness.\u201d \u201cAnger and sadness that has been ingrained in our black community \u2014 not just because of five minutes of horror, but 400 years,\u201d Frey said. The mayor\u2019s comments come amid outrage over the loss of Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer put a knee to the back of his neck. \u201cIf you\u2019re feeling that sadness and that anger, it\u2019s not only understandable; it\u2019s right,\u201d Frey said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the truth that our black community has lived.\u201d The mayor emphasized that the anger displayed in the recent protests \u201cmust also be understood by our non-black communities\u201d and cannot be ignored, or the city will \u201cignore the values we all claim to have.\u201d Senator Tim Kaine thanked those who have sent supportive messages since he announced he and his wife have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. The Virginia Democrat said he was grateful he and his wife, Anne Holton, had experienced mild symptoms. \u201cOur hearts go out to all families who have lost loved ones,\u201d Kaine wrote in a tweet. Holton credited Virginia\u2019s stay-at-home order with preventing them from spreading the virus to their colleagues and loved ones. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: US unemployment claims have surpassed 40 million. Another 2.1 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week as many businesses remain shuttered due to the coronavirus pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo will sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks. \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself,\u201d Cuomo said of the order. \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect the other patrons in that store.\u201d Trump offered his condolences to the loved ones of Americans who have died from coronavirus, a message that came a day after the US death toll surpassed 100,000. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump announced he would extend the deployments of National Guard members currently assisting with the coronavirus response, which could make them eligible for key federal benefits. \u201cThe men and women of the National Guard have been doing a great job fighting the CoronaVirus. This week, I will extend their Title 32 orders through mid-August, so they can continue to help States succeed in their response and recovery efforts,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. Politico reported on the National Guard members potentially failing to qualify for the benefits earlier this month: More than 40,000 National Guard members currently helping states test residents for the coronavirus and trace the spread of infections will face a \u2018hard stop\u2019 on their deployments on June 24 \u2014 just one day shy of many members becoming eligible for key federal benefits, according to a senior FEMA official. The official outlined the Trump administration\u2019s plans on an interagency call on May 12, an audio version of which was obtained by POLITICO. The official also acknowledged during the call that the June 24 deadline means that thousands of members who first deployed in late March will find themselves with only 89 days of duty credit, one short of the 90-day threshold for qualifying for early retirement and education benefits under the Post-9/11 GI bill. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump\u2019s social media executive order is a \u201cdistraction\u201d from the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. \u201cI think it\u2019s just typical President Trump. A distraction,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell. \u201cPeople are dying, and all people want to talk about is what he said next about this. That is a success for him. So I just will not go there.\u201d The House speaker tried to redirect attention toward the need to expand coronavirus testing in order to safely reopen the country. \u201cIt\u2019s about testing, testing, testing,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAll of this is a distraction from the problem at hand.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo was joined by actors Chris Rock and Rosie Perez during his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Appearing alongside Cuomo in their native borough of Brooklyn, Rock and Perez called on their neighbors to get tested and wear masks to limit the spread of the virus. \u201cEverybody that can get tested should get tested as soon as possible,\u201d Rock said. \u201cMi gente, love each other, love yourselves,\u201d Perez added. \u201cGet a test. Wear a mask.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers who are not wearing masks. \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself,\u201d Cuomo said of the order. \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect the other patrons in that store.\u201d The Democratic governor has repeatedly said mask usage can limit the spread of coronavirus, noting that rates of infection among frontline healthcare workers are lower than that of the general population in the region. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi closed out her weekly press conference by addressing the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. \u201cWe did see a murder on TV, and it wasn\u2019t self-defense,\u201d Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol. The death of Floyd, a black man, after a white police officer put his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck has sparked protests in Minneapolis and demands for the officers involved to be prosecuted. The justice department has said it is making its investigation into Floyd\u2019s death a \u201ctop priority,\u201d and FBI officials are involved in the \u201crobust\u201d inquiry. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump\u2019s planned executive order directed at social media companies is \u201coutrageous.\u201d Speaking to reporters at the Capitol, Pelosi expressed support for Twitter fact-checking two of the president\u2019s tweets about vote by mail. However, the speaker added that she thought social media companies had been \u201cvery selective\u201d in how they correct Trump\u2019s falsehoods, specifically citing the president\u2019s tweets about a baseless conspiracy theory involving MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. Singling out Facebook and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who said platforms should not be fact-checking tweets, Pelosi said social media companies are \u201call about making money.\u201d Joe Biden provided a more humorous reminder to wear masks while outside, as the CDC has recommended to limit the spread of coronavirus. The presumptive Democratic nominee appeared in a TikTok video from the Washington Post, admonishing a Post reporter for not wearing his mask. As the Post\u2019s Dave Jorgenson walks his dog and listens to Biden\u2019s podcast, the actual Biden interrupts the podcast to say, \u201cDave, what the hell? I told you to wear your mask outside.\u201d As Jorgenson reacts in understandable confusion, Biden appears on his phone screen and adds, \u201cYou need to wear your mask outside. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re just walking your dog.\u201d The funny video comes as Biden and Trump have clashed over wearing masks in public, with the president suggesting it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Biden wore a mask while attending a Memorial Day ceremony, even though that was in compliance with the CDC\u2019s recommendation. Senator Tim Kaine said he and his wife would continue observing CDC guidelines, even though they have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. \u201cWhile those antibodies could make us less likely to be re-infected or infect others, there is still too much uncertainty over what protection antibodies may actually provide,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cSo we will keep following CDC guidelines\u2014hand-washing, mask wearing, social distancing. We encourage others to do so as well. It shows those around you that you care about them.\u201d In contrast, senator Rand Paul, who tested positive for coronavirus in March, refused to wear a mask on the Senate floor this month because he said he did not have to. \u201cI have immunity,\u201d Paul said when asked about his lack of a mask. \u201cI\u2019ve already had the virus. So I can\u2019t get it again, and I can\u2019t give it to anybody.\u201d As Kaine indicated, there is still uncertainty around whether those who have had coronavirus can be reinfected. There are promising signs that former coronavirus patients have immunity, although it remains unknown how long that immunity might last. Senator Tim Kaine announced he and his wife have tested positive for coronavirus antibodies after experiencing flu-like symptoms several weeks ago. \u201cI tested positive for the flu earlier this year and was given standard medication to treat it. The symptoms lingered and I continued to receive treatment from my physician for the flu through mid-March,\u201d Kaine said in a statement. \u201cAt the end of March, I experienced new symptoms that I initially thought were flu remnants and a reaction to an unusually high spring pollen count. Then Anne experienced a short bout of fever and chills, followed by congestion and eventually a cough.\u201d Kaine, who served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in 2016, said he and his wife had been working remotely and isolating themselves as they had symptoms. Their physicians later suggested they may have had mild cases of coronavirus, and they were tested for antibodies. The Virginia senator emphasized that he was not taking the antibody test result as a carte blanche to ignore health guidelines. \u201cWhile those antibodies could make us less likely to be re-infected or infect others, there is still too much uncertainty over what protection antibodies may actually provide,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cSo we will keep following CDC guidelines\u2014hand-washing, mask wearing, social distancing. We encourage others to do so as well. It shows those around you that you care about them.\u201d Trump is once again trying to deflect attention away from his response to coronavirus by blaming China for the pandemic. \u201cAll over the World the CoronaVirus, a very bad \u2018gift\u2019 from China, marches on. Not good!\u201d Trump tweeted this morning. The president was previously criticized for calling coronavirus \u201cthe Chinese virus,\u201d raising concerns about intensifying racism against Asian Americans. The label was derided as a transparent effort by Trump to downplay complaints that his administration had missed critical early opportunities to limit the spread of the virus. Trump\u2019s tweet comes as the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll has surpassed 100,000 and the number of US unemployment claims has reached 40 million. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would seek formal negotiations with the Senate on the FISA bill, after majority leader Steny Hoyer announced he was withdrawing the legislation from consideration. \u201cClearly, because House Republicans have prioritized politics over our national security, we will no longer have a bipartisan veto-proof majority. Therefore, as Leader Hoyer just announced, we will no longer be voting on the FISA bill today,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. \u201cIt will be our intention to go to conference in order to ensure that all of the views of all Members of our Caucus are represented in the final product.\u201d But considering Trump\u2019s opposition to reauthorizing the surveillance programs, it may be difficult to secure a veto-proof majority on the legislation. House majority leader Steny Hoyer said he is withdrawing the FISA bill from consideration, a day after speaker Nancy Pelosi pulled the scheduled vote on the bill. Pelosi scrapped the vote after Trump and many of his Republican allies made clear that they opposed the bill, which would have reauthorized three expired surveillance programs. Combined with progressive criticism of the legislation, it was unclear if the bill would be able to pass the House, despite the chamber\u2019s approval of a similar bill in March. \u201cAt the request of the Speaker of the House, I am withdrawing consideration of the FISA Act,\u201d Hoyer said in a statement. \u201cThe two-thirds of the Republican party that voted for this bill in March have indicated they are going to vote against it now. I am told they are doing so at the request of the President. I believe this to be against the security interest of the United States and the safety of the American people.\u201d Trump tweeted about his opposition to the bill on Tuesday night, equating the programs\u2019 reauthorization with the Obama administration\u2019s surveillance of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who later pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Trump offered his condolences to the loved ones of Americans who have died from coronavirus, a day after the US death toll from the virus surpassed 100,000. \u201cWe have just reached a very sad milestone with the coronavirus pandemic deaths reaching 100,000,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter this morning. \u201cTo all of the families &amp; friends of those who have passed, I want to extend my heartfelt sympathy &amp; love for everything that these great people stood for &amp; represent. God be with you!\u201d Trump did not initially weigh in on the country reaching the grim milestone yesterday, instead tweeting this morning about special counsel Robert Mueller, Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer and his expected executive order directed at social media companies. Trump\u2019s Democratic rival, Joe Biden, released a video last night mourning the loss of 100,000 Americans. \u201cFor all of you who are hurting so badly, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis nation grieves with you. Take some solace from the fact we all grieve with you.\u201d This is Joan Greve, taking over for Joanna Walters. The White House is reportedly not planning to release economic projections this summer, as the coronavirus pandemic causes widespread unemployment and revenue losses. The Washington Post reports: The White House is supposed to unveil a federal budget proposal every February and then typically provides a \u2018mid-session review\u2019 in July or August with updated projections on economic trends such as unemployment, inflation and economic growth. Budget experts said they were not aware of any previous White House opting against providing forecasts in this \u2018mid-session review\u2019 document in any other year since at least the 1970s. ... The document would be slated for publication just a few months before the November elections. Even if Trump declines to release the economic projections before the November presidential election, he will still be confronted with the fact that tens of millions of Americans have had to file for unemloyment since the start of the coronavirus crisis. The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million as the number of unemployment claims continued to rise with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The staggering job losses mark a grim milestone in the economic crisis that has gripped the US since the coronavirus triggered widespread shutdowns and stay-at-home orders in an effort to halt the spread of the deadly pandemic. The latest figures from the Department of Labor show that the rate of new unemployment claims has continued to fall over the last few weeks, down from its peak in early April, when 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment in a single week. Earlier this month, the department reported that more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April, bringing the unemployment rate to 14.7%, up from 4.4% in March. While the growth of unemployment claims has slowed, millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number of unemployed to a disastrous rate not seen since the Great Depression. Good Morning, US live blog readers, there\u2019s a busy day ahead in coronavirus and politics news, so please stay tuned for all the developments in the US. Here\u2019s where things are this hour: Donald Trump has not yet spoken out about the US reaching yesterday the grim milestone of 100,000 Covid-19 deaths across the nation. And in many states the incidence of new cases is still rising, especially in the south and midwest. Washington DC, plans to begin tentative reopening for business tomorrow, although the mayor of America\u2019s capital has warned there will likely be more cases of coronavirus. We are awaiting a possible executive order from the president today that attempts an aggressive regulatory move against social media platforms, after Trump erupted in outrage when Twitter included some fact-checks, for the first time, in two of his tweets related to voting, earlier this week. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany will hold a briefing at 2pm ET.",

The premiers arrived with an 0-2 record but made a mockery of that over the 80 minutes with the returning Boyd Cordner and debutant Josh Morris demonstrating that at full strength Sydney\u2019s Easts remain a force to be reckoned with.</p> <p>A six-point half-time lead felt unders for the Chooks after they defended with control and attacked with craft, in particular Luke Keary\u2019s kicking game. But the game was won in a blitz after the interval when they crossed twice before the Bunnies had mentally left the sheds. </p> <p>The Rabbitohs rallied and were the better team for large portions of the second half but this Roosters outfit has shown over a number of years that they are formidable defensively, and even with the fatigue of a first game back in ferociously fast conditions they stood firm.</p> <p>James Tedesco did James Tedesco things, scoring a beautiful solo try and gaining 295m - almost 100m more than anyone else on the field. Jake Friend led all comers for tackles and his captain\u2019s challenge late in the game was the decisive turning point, especially after he followed it up soon after with his own kick-chase try. </p> <p>That score showed up Latrell Mitchell, who had a mixed night under the spotlight against his former side. His fast hands in the line helped create his side\u2019s opening try, but he was found wanting positionally and fumbled one bomb. </p> <p>Stay tuned for more NRL action right here as sport slowly eases its way back into life following the Covid-19 shutdown. Thanks for your company tonight. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T12:06:30.226Z\">at 1.06pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f6fa8f084df971c8bfa5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:51:43.965Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">FT: Roosters 28-12 Rabbitohs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The premiers are back. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6b1cbd09ea483c0aa0531bc533de58ed0283c1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6b1cbd09ea483c0aa0531bc533de58ed0283c1e/0_0_4130_2753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boyd Cordner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boyd Cordner impressed on his return to footy for 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f5f48f084df971c8bf87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:49:23.714Z\">12.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">TRY! Roosters 28-12 Rabbitohs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>77 mins:</strong> That captain\u2019s challenge has iced this game. The Bunnies make no ground from their own line and the Roosters hold it safely up their jumpers for most of a set before <strong>Jake Friend</strong> snipes off the back of a ruck and grubbers through to an unguarded in-goal to seal the deal. Latrell Mitchell was busy wrestling off the ball. Hmmm. </p> <p>Flanagan extends the margin to 16. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f5548f084df971c8bf7b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:45:27.834Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>74 mins:</strong> Captain\u2019s challenge from the Roosters goes Jake Friend\u2019s way! JWH was penalised for losing possession at the ruck but replays indicated it was knocked from his grasp as he was staggering to his feet by the retreating Sironen. That feels like a huge momentum changer. At a stroke the Rabbitohs go from threatening attacking possession to having to find at least ten points in under five minutes from their own line.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f4e28f08f5e373010c6c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:42:53.499Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>73 mins:</strong> It\u2019s a disappointing meat and potatoes set from the Bunnies and it ends with a kick gobbled up by Tedesco, scrambling to safety in a forest of legs and boots. Souths compound the situation by conceding a penalty early in Sydney\u2019s set. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f4a18f087122eca51c87\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:41:15.543Z\">12.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>71 mins: </strong>The Roosters are defending stoutly but they are being asked to do a lot more tackling than they\u2019d like at this late stage in the game.

Gagai was to the fore stepping in from the right flank with Cook orchestrating matters at the ruck. Once more though they are repelled by a blue wall within inches of the line. The balance of power has shifted in the past 10-15 minutes though with the Bunnies appearing to be coming home the fitter. Can they make it count in time?</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f3488f084df971c8bf46\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:36:43.718Z\">12.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>65 mins: </strong>The fifth handling error of the night from Souths (to Easts four) releases the pressure on the Roosters further. Some party tricks down the left edge resemble a Fiji rugby sevens training drill more than the NRL but it stretches the Rabbitohs\u2019 defence allowing Keary to nail his kick and earn a repeat set with a chase that ends with a tackle in-goal. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed0f2c78f08f5e373010c3f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:33:37.845Z\">12.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> Both sets of players look weary, especially the Roosters, after that long spell of defending they were forced to do.

Roosters 22-12 Rabbitohs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>61 mins: </strong>The Bunnies feel like they\u2019ve had something like six of the last seven sets, and after huffing and puffing they finally blow the house down, <strong>Tom Burgess </strong>bulldozing over from close range with three blue jerseys hanging off him. Reynolds slots an easy two.

We\u2019re underway at Bankwest Stadium around 7.55pm local time.</p> <p>As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware by now, footy\u2019s back! How are you feeling about it? Let me know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jphowcroft?lang=en\">@JPHowcroft</a> or email: <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com\">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com </a></p> <p>I thought last night\u2019s restart went as well as could be expected, once Brodie Croft chilled out prematch anyway. I am an advocate for the piped crowd noise. I thought that aspect was delivered very well indeed, and with the long passages where the camera didn\u2019t pan to empty rows of seats you could easily be forgiven for being hoodwinked into thinking it was business as usual.</p> <p>But clearly this is not business as usual, and not just in the staging of the competition. On the pitch these two heavyweights arrive with plenty of questions to be answered. The Roosters have set the standard over the past two seasons but went winless in their two fixtures before lockdown. The Rabbitohs went one from two but then found themselves at the centre of plenty of unwanted attention during the hiatus with Cody Walker suspended for two matches for an incident that resurfaced from back in December, while Latrell Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/27/police-investigate-nrl-stars-josh-addo-carr-and-latrell-mitchell-over-social-media-post\">reminded the world </a>rugby league players don\u2019t always make the best life choices.</p> <p>Which is a nice segue into tonight\u2019s match-up, which is of course Mitchell\u2019s first appearance for the Bunnies against the Chooks, the side he left in the offseason following a soap opera of negotiations that ended with the star landing nearby, but crucially in his preferred fullback role. He\u2019s probably the only person in the country pleased that fans are unable to attend tonight\u2019s match. </p> <p>But there\u2019s plenty more to consider when the longest rivalry in the history of Australian rugby league resumes. The Roosters should be close to full strength with skipper Boyd Cordner making his first start of the campaign, and he will line-up alongside experienced new recruit Josh Morris.

      "bodyText": "The oldest rivalry in Australian rugby league had to wait a little longer than usual to be rekindled but when it did the Roosters made up for lost time against the Rabbitohs. The premiers arrived with an 0-2 record but made a mockery of that over the 80 minutes with the returning Boyd Cordner and debutant Josh Morris demonstrating that at full strength Sydney\u2019s Easts remain a force to be reckoned with. A six-point half-time lead felt unders for the Chooks after they defended with control and attacked with craft, in particular Luke Keary\u2019s kicking game. But the game was won in a blitz after the interval when they crossed twice before the Bunnies had mentally left the sheds. The Rabbitohs rallied and were the better team for large portions of the second half but this Roosters outfit has shown over a number of years that they are formidable defensively, and even with the fatigue of a first game back in ferociously fast conditions they stood firm. James Tedesco did James Tedesco things, scoring a beautiful solo try and gaining 295m - almost 100m more than anyone else on the field. Jake Friend led all comers for tackles and his captain\u2019s challenge late in the game was the decisive turning point, especially after he followed it up soon after with his own kick-chase try. That score showed up Latrell Mitchell, who had a mixed night under the spotlight against his former side. His fast hands in the line helped create his side\u2019s opening try, but he was found wanting positionally and fumbled one bomb. Stay tuned for more NRL action right here as sport slowly eases its way back into life following the Covid-19 shutdown. Thanks for your company tonight. The premiers are back. 77 mins: That captain\u2019s challenge has iced this game. The Bunnies make no ground from their own line and the Roosters hold it safely up their jumpers for most of a set before Jake Friend snipes off the back of a ruck and grubbers through to an unguarded in-goal to seal the deal. Latrell Mitchell was busy wrestling off the ball. Hmmm. Flanagan extends the margin to 16. 74 mins: Captain\u2019s challenge from the Roosters goes Jake Friend\u2019s way! JWH was penalised for losing possession at the ruck but replays indicated it was knocked from his grasp as he was staggering to his feet by the retreating Sironen. That feels like a huge momentum changer. At a stroke the Rabbitohs go from threatening attacking possession to having to find at least ten points in under five minutes from their own line. 73 mins: It\u2019s a disappointing meat and potatoes set from the Bunnies and it ends with a kick gobbled up by Tedesco, scrambling to safety in a forest of legs and boots. Souths compound the situation by conceding a penalty early in Sydney\u2019s set. 71 mins: The Roosters are defending stoutly but they are being asked to do a lot more tackling than they\u2019d like at this late stage in the game. A Souths penalty 20m out hands them a prime attacking opportunity. 69 mins: Some rapid play-the-balls by South Sydney see them drive from one end to the other. Gagai was to the fore stepping in from the right flank with Cook orchestrating matters at the ruck. Once more though they are repelled by a blue wall within inches of the line. The balance of power has shifted in the past 10-15 minutes though with the Bunnies appearing to be coming home the fitter. Can they make it count in time? 65 mins: The fifth handling error of the night from Souths (to Easts four) releases the pressure on the Roosters further. Some party tricks down the left edge resemble a Fiji rugby sevens training drill more than the NRL but it stretches the Rabbitohs\u2019 defence allowing Keary to nail his kick and earn a repeat set with a chase that ends with a tackle in-goal. 64 mins: Both sets of players look weary, especially the Roosters, after that long spell of defending they were forced to do. A solid set of six and kick gives them field possession and invites the Rabbitohs to respond conservatively with ball in hand. 61 mins: The Bunnies feel like they\u2019ve had something like six of the last seven sets, and after huffing and puffing they finally blow the house down, Tom Burgess bulldozing over from close range with three blue jerseys hanging off him. Reynolds slots an easy two. This one\u2019s not quite done yet. 59 mins: Souths are digging in here. A line break sees Graham flying down the right before Tupou hauls him in. Brett Morris is then alert to slap away a dangerous kick into the right corner. They are a well-oiled defensive machine the premiers. 57 mins: Souths can\u2019t capitalise though and the Roosters clear. A graphic has just popped up showing metres gained - Tedesco is 100m ahead of the pack. 55 mins: The Rabbitohs have their first decent spell of the half, earning a repeat set on the Roosters\u2019 line after a good kick chase forces Manu to adopt a safety-first approach. Before the line drop-out Friend becomes the latest player to walk off in a daze after a clash of heads. 54 mins: Souths\u2019 Bayley Sironen is leaving the field for an HIA. He got his head in an awful position attempting a tackle, but he bounced back up straight away despite what looked an ugly mess. Not long afterwards it\u2019s Liam Knight\u2019s turn to come off for a check after copping a JWH forearm to the mush. The big Rooster is then placed on report for a high shot on Johnston. 47 mins: Annnnnnd the Roosters score with ease. Keary causes mayhem through the middle and times his offload to perfection to feed Boyd Cordner who hits the line like a wrecking ball at an angle in from the left and he bludgeons his way over. Flanagan adds two. One-way traffic since half-time. 46 mins: Worse arrives shortly afterwards though when Ethan Lowe loses the ball after been flattened by three Roosters in contact. Bankwest Stadium, twinned with Barnard Castle? 45 mins: It almost goes from bad to worse for Souths as Friend makes a linebreak with Tedesco on his shoulder. This time the Rabbitohs defence holds firm and the Roosters are forced to kick. Blistering start to the half by the premiers. 42 mins: James Tedesco! How can you defend him in broken play? The ball spills loose as the Roosters attack just over halfway down the left, it\u2019s flicked inside to Tedesco who wriggles free of one tackle then sprints 40m into the right corner, planting the ball over mid-tackle. Too good. Flanagan drags his conversion attempt wide. 41 mins: We\u2019re back underway at Bankwest Stadium. The teams are back out for the second half. Both sides are near enough at 90% completion rates, roughly 50-50 possession, meaning fatigue is inevitable. The Roosters seemed to have the upper hand for most of a breathless half that contained few breaks or clear scoring opportunities. The Rabbitohs will be delighted to reduce the deficit to just six so close to the hooter against such a formidable defensive unit. Brett Morris will receive plaudits for his chase down of Braidon Burns while Victor Radley\u2019s star continues to rise, he ranks third for metres carried and tackles laid, some of those absolutely terrifying bone rattlers. Rabbitohs in possession as the siren sounds with Reynolds dancing around the ruck but Tedesco is alive to the danger and he smothers the kick, heralding the interval. 39 mins: A rare straightforward couple of sets as half-time nears. 36 mins: Eventually the repeat sets towards the end of a breathless half finally count for South Sydney. A couple of forward pile-drivers down the middle create space to exploit down that favoured left edge where Mitchell double-pumps to drag the Roosters a fraction out of position to allow Cameron Murray a smidgen of room and he bullocks his way over the line, grounding the ball - just - at the second attempt. Reynolds converts. 34 mins: The Rabbitohs are favouring their left wing as the main plan of attack and it gets them good territory for two sets in a row, but it\u2019s the switches right to Gagai that look the likeliest route for a score. A second set ends with the winger almost crossing but a Keary offside earns a third bite of the cherry. That soon becomes a fourth with Ashley Klein getting increasingly frustrated with the Sydney defensive line. 31 mins: An infringement at the ruck gifts the Roosters a repeat set after the restart. They approach the line confidently, but after Tedesco fails with a burst the ball is recycled to the right only to be intercepted by Burns! He dashes 40m before being scragged, throwing the ball left to Johnston but he\u2019s hauled down as well! Incredible scrambling defence from the desperate Roosters chasers, Brett Morris in particular. 28 mins: Tedesco v Mitchell for the first time tonight, and it ends with the Rabbitohs defending hammering his opposite number in the tackle. Not that Tedesco minds at all. Sydney retain possession and two tackles later Kyle Flanagan crosses under the posts after a wonderful end-to-end move that goes through hands down the left before Josh Morris chips through adroitly for the flying No7 to pounce on the ball as it dribbles over the line. Flanagan\u2019s conversion was unmissable. 26 mins: Make that three stoppages with players taking some deep breaths before the scrum sets after a Keary grubber deflects off a green and red hooped sock and over the sideline. 24 mins: The Bunnies almost profit from a couple of hacks along the turf in broken play but Manu is alive for the Roosters in defence. This is as fast a game of rugby league as you could imagine. There is no pause from ruck to ruck and probably only two genuine stoppages all night so far. There will be some tired bodies out there. 22 mins: Ooooh, the Roosters really should score there. Keary breaks into open field after a lovely offload by Tupou, but he inexplicably doesn\u2019t pass to the bursting Tedesco who was a certain score. Instead he weaves towards the left wing and accepts the tackle. Nothing comes of the resulting field position. Huge let-off for Souths. 21 mins: Tedesco has been quiet so far but he crosses the line only to be held up. From the next play Reynolds does well to snuff out danger underneath the posts. Easts look stronger and smarter. 19 mins: The Rabbitohs make it within inches of the line after a fifth tackle play that included their longest passing chain of possession of the night. It ended with Graham bulldozing his way with momentum but Josh Morris was too strong one-on-one. The next Roosters set concludes with Latrell Mitchell spilling a routine punt. I\u2019m social media will be fine. 17 mins: The Roosters have their first decent attack for ten minutes or so but after Friend snipes down the blind side towards the left wing he throws a poor pass in front of Flanagan and the attack peters out. 15 mins: The Rabbitohs go to the air for the first time but Brett Morris is comfortable under the high ball. This is relentless footy with hardly any breaks and a swift turnaround between sets. I wonder if the players are going to burn themselves out? The Roosters don\u2019t make a lot of ground, offering Souths another chance to build, their third or fourth in quick succession, but Gagai spills possession in contact and the threat passes. 12 mins: Souths get to halfway before a penalty gifts them decent attacking territory for the first time tonight. They probe down the left before handing debutant Dargan kicking duties on the last tackle but his grubber is hoovered up by the silky Tedesco and the Roosters regroup. 10 mins: Knock-on against the Roosters as they try to pick their way down the right edge on the second tackle around 20m out. The Rabbitohs need some controlled possession. 9 mins: Keary\u2019s kicking game is on point tonight so far. After the Roosters marched 80m downfield he found a cute space behind the defensive line but in front of fullback Mitchell to allow his chasers to force a line drop-out. 7 mins: The Roosters restart with a solid set, forcing the Rabbitohs to build from their own line. They advance a long way though, helped by a repeat set for a ruck infringement, before a sloppy grubber goes dead and Easts clear their lines. ... and not on Nine. 3 mins: First penalty of the night goes to the Roosters after Knight went in high as the third man on Waerea-Hargreaves in midfield. That leads to the first decent attacking opportunity of the match and the premiers take full advantage. Patient build up for four tackles ends with Luke Keary kicking precisely to the left corner where the leaping Daniel Tupou times his jump to perfection to clutch the mark and land safely over the line with green jerseys hanging off him. The touchline conversion from Kyle Flanagan is good. 2 mins: Solid, unspectacular opening sets from both sides. I\u2019m following this on C9 where the piped noise does not appear to be part of the broadcast, giving the match that eerie preseason feel. Here we go! 112 years since these clubs first went at it, they do battle in perhaps the oddest circumstances yet. The players are making their way out into the middle of Bankwest Stadium. We\u2019ll be underway shortly. The Cowboys have sealed the deal 36-6 over the Titans. Looks like another long slog in store for the 0-3 Gold Coast outfit. Conditions are perfect at the deserted Bankwest Stadium. It\u2019s cool, dry and still in Western Sydney, ideal for such a massive contest. We\u2019re only ten minutes or so away from kick-off, but time to plough through this bit of fun from Gavin Willacy about the history of rugby league broadcasting in the UK. As a public service, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with Richard Madeley, who is featured in the story above, here\u2019s an insight into his unironic Alan Partridge stylings. The NRL, like sporting competitions around the world, are having to innovate while crowds are unable to attend matches in person. Mike Hytner has peeked behind the curtain to see how matchdays are being made to look as realistic as possible. Nine\u2019s coverage of tonight\u2019s match very quickly went from a panel introduction to this message from Souths owner Russell Crowe. It felt a bit like rugby league\u2019s version of the Queen\u2019s speech. One late change for Souths with Tom Amone completing the interchange bench in place of Patrick Mago. Plenty of attention on 22-year-old debutant Troy Dargan who partners skipper Adam Reynolds in the halves, not to mention the numero uno. 1. Latrell Mitchell 2. Dane Gagai 3. Campbell Graham 4. Braidon Burns 5. Alex Johnston 6. Troy Dargan 7. Adam Reynolds 8. Tevita Tatola 9. Damien Cook 10. Thomas Burgess 11. Jaydn Su\u2019A 12. Cameron Murray 13. Liam Knight. INT: 14. Mark Nicholls 15. Ethan Lowe 16. Bayley Sironen 19. Tom Amone For the Roosters, captain Boyd Cordner will make his first appearance of 2020, while Josh Morris will make his club debut at left centre. Only one late change to report with Lindsay Collins and the now benched Isaac Liu trading places. 1. James Tedesco 2. Daniel Tupou 3. Josh Morris 4. Joseph Manu 5. Brett Morris 6. Luke Keary 7. Kyle Flanagan 8. Jared Waerea-Hargreaves 9. Jake Friend 17. Lindsay Collins 11. Boyd Cordner 12. Angus Crichton 13. Victor Radley. INT: 10. Isaac Liu 14. Sam Verrills 15. Sitili Tupouniua 16. Nat Butcher The NRL has behaved in a very NRL way en route to resuming the season, and for all its inelegance and brass neck it has worked a charm, as Nick Tedeschi explains. The league has endured: organisational inertia at NRL HQ; outspoken opposition in the corridors of power; broadcasters who wouldn\u2019t pay; players who baulked at a pay cut; referees who threatened industrial action; players who flouted social distancing rules; anti-vaxxers who had the potential to stop a return; and the typical rugby league bickering that has felled so many in the past. Yet the NRL will on Thursday become the first major Australian sports league to resume since the coronavirus shutdown. And the game is not where it is today because it flowed with the current of the worldwide pandemic; it is where it is today largely, if not solely, due to one man \u2013 Peter V\u2019landys. But the impact of Covid-19 will still be felt on the on-field product, as Larissa O\u2019Connor outlines. The game will be adjudicated by a single referee for the first time since 2008; an adjustment welcomed by many fans and one that will net savings for the cash-strapped NRL... New to the NRL rule book is the awarding of six additional tackles for ruck infringements. The change was trialled back in 2012 in a high-scoring Indigenous All Stars game, but shelved ever since. For current players, the new law is virtually untested and teams would be well advised to watch the early games this round to gauge how the rule will be enforced, how it may open up attacking opportunities and to what extend it could wear down defending sides, particularly in the latter stages of a game. There\u2019s some rugby league happening right now, if you\u2019re itching to get stuck in. The Cowboys are turning over the Titans in an all-Queensland affair. For all the afterglow of the return of live sport, it nearly ended in disaster for Brodie Croft who was on the verge of missing out in accordance with Covid-19 protocols. The young halfback twice recorded temperatures above the permitted limit of 37.2C when he arrived at Suncorp Stadium, threatening to throw the Broncos\u2019 preparations for the round three game against Parramatta into chaos. Croft was put in a holding room where he waited 15 minutes before taking a third test, which he passed. The NRL\u2019s strict new biosecurity rules require all players to have their temperature taken upon entry; if they fail the test, they will not be allowed to play. Nick Tedeschi liked what he saw. It was 67 days since the last NRL match was played. The world has changed due to Covid-19, and so has rugby league. The game looked different, felt different and sounded different. It was no less engaging though. Its essence \u2013 brute force the showcasing of speed and skill and athleticism \u2013 remained the same. In case you missed last night\u2019s curtain re-raiser, the Eels thumped the Broncos. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the NRL\u2019s Friday night blockbuster Sydney derby between Easts (AKA the Roosters) and Souths (AKA the Rabbitohs). We\u2019re underway at Bankwest Stadium around 7.55pm local time. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware by now, footy\u2019s back! How are you feeling about it? Let me know on Twitter @JPHowcroft or email: jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com I thought last night\u2019s restart went as well as could be expected, once Brodie Croft chilled out prematch anyway. I am an advocate for the piped crowd noise. I thought that aspect was delivered very well indeed, and with the long passages where the camera didn\u2019t pan to empty rows of seats you could easily be forgiven for being hoodwinked into thinking it was business as usual. But clearly this is not business as usual, and not just in the staging of the competition. On the pitch these two heavyweights arrive with plenty of questions to be answered. The Roosters have set the standard over the past two seasons but went winless in their two fixtures before lockdown. The Rabbitohs went one from two but then found themselves at the centre of plenty of unwanted attention during the hiatus with Cody Walker suspended for two matches for an incident that resurfaced from back in December, while Latrell Mitchell reminded the world rugby league players don\u2019t always make the best life choices. Which is a nice segue into tonight\u2019s match-up, which is of course Mitchell\u2019s first appearance for the Bunnies against the Chooks, the side he left in the offseason following a soap opera of negotiations that ended with the star landing nearby, but crucially in his preferred fullback role. He\u2019s probably the only person in the country pleased that fans are unable to attend tonight\u2019s match. But there\u2019s plenty more to consider when the longest rivalry in the history of Australian rugby league resumes. The Roosters should be close to full strength with skipper Boyd Cordner making his first start of the campaign, and he will line-up alongside experienced new recruit Josh Morris. They will be looking to avoid becoming the first premiers to go zip-three since 2009, and only the third in the NRL era. Let\u2019s get it on!",

      "bodyText": "Liverpool have not given up on signing Timo Werner this summer with J\u00fcrgen Klopp this week telling the board the Germany striker would be perfect for his team. The runaway Premier League leaders have not made a bid for the 24-year-old while they deal with the coronavirus crisis. However, they are still keen to make the transfer happen and have been assured Werner will wait for Liverpool to make a decision before choosing his future club. Werner\u2019s representatives are aware of Liverpool\u2019s situation. They have until 15 June to meet his release clause of \u20ac60m (\u00a352.7m) \u2013 if there is no deal by that date Liverpool will have to negotiate a fee with Leipzig. Werner\u2019s contract runs out in 2023. Inter were one of the clubs who had shown interest in Werner but he has made it clear he does not want to move to Italy. The Inter sporting director, Piero Ausilio, said on Friday: \u201cTimo Werner will not come to Inter. I know his thoughts about his future and we\u2019ll not sign him.

This scaffolding will offer the EFL protection from potential legal action on the part of individual clubs by creating clearcut rules on key issues including promotion, relegation and play-offs. \u201cA decision on whether or not to curtail the season is a matter to be considered by clubs in any affected division, but only once a framework for resolving open issues in such circumstances has been agreed by all members across all divisions through a regulation change,\u201d the EFL said in a statement. During a board meeting this week the EFL unanimously agreed a framework but clubs have until Tuesday to submit any alternative proposals. Then, after the meeting on Monday 8 June, League One clubs will finally be able to vote on the fate of this season. A 51% majority is required if the campaign is to be curtailed. Under the EFL\u2019s framework, unweighted points per game would determine the final league table in the event any of its three divisions go uncompleted. However, League One clubs in particular are deeply divided about this system and, so far at least, achieving any sort of consensus has proved a struggle.",

Special congratulations to the 130 who stuck with it and submitted entries. I didn\u2019t spot any mistakes, though in truth I wasn\u2019t looking very hard for these. I guessed it would be a really tough challenge for you, but if it\u2019s any consolation it took me many, many hours to complete the thing. I started pondering on a suitable theme months before the deadline and was getting pretty desperate before the 502 idea occurred to me and the thing started to take shape. The main problem was not so much the construction of the grid (all entries having to have an even number of letters, at least four of each but not too many 4-letter words and these not having more than one unchecked letter each). Rather it was the clue-writing itself and then&nbsp;checking that I\u2019d accounted for each repositioned half. (One competitor asked if I\u2019d noticed that ZA represented 2,500 in medieval Latin, with the implication that<em> that</em> might have formed the basis for a theme. Alas I had not, and the opportunity has passed for good!)&nbsp;</p> <p>Given the special restraints imposed, writing convincing (and reasonably short) clues was also not easy, and on the whole I was much impressed by your efforts. Many still took the time to pick favourites: 12 received votes with most going to \u2018Severely criticise constitutional activity when limited by the crown\u2019 for PAS(EAR/BER)ATE. Of clues submitted most were on the themes of either the coronavirus scourge or the milestone represented by the puzzle. Many of the latter, including Mr Willett\u2019s fine winner, were blush-makingly complimentary to me and I do hope I do not appear too self-regarding in quoting them above. I was quite overwhelmed by the large number of special messages, cards and other ways of acknowledging the event which you kindly sent. I hope you will understand that I cannot reply personally to them all, but it did make the whole thing gratifyingly memorable for me. Thank you all so much for your continuing loyalty to the series.</p>",

Comments Well, I\u2019m sure we all need several stiff drinks and a straightforward Plain or two after that. Special congratulations to the 130 who stuck with it and submitted entries. I didn\u2019t spot any mistakes, though in truth I wasn\u2019t looking very hard for these. I guessed it would be a really tough challenge for you, but if it\u2019s any consolation it took me many, many hours to complete the thing. I started pondering on a suitable theme months before the deadline and was getting pretty desperate before the 502 idea occurred to me and the thing started to take shape. The main problem was not so much the construction of the grid (all entries having to have an even number of letters, at least four of each but not too many 4-letter words and these not having more than one unchecked letter each). Rather it was the clue-writing itself and then checking that I\u2019d accounted for each repositioned half. (One competitor asked if I\u2019d noticed that ZA represented 2,500 in medieval Latin, with the implication that that might have formed the basis for a theme. Alas I had not, and the opportunity has passed for good!) Given the special restraints imposed, writing convincing (and reasonably short) clues was also not easy, and on the whole I was much impressed by your efforts. Many still took the time to pick favourites: 12 received votes with most going to \u2018Severely criticise constitutional activity when limited by the crown\u2019 for PAS(EAR/BER)ATE. Of clues submitted most were on the themes of either the coronavirus scourge or the milestone represented by the puzzle. Many of the latter, including Mr Willett\u2019s fine winner, were blush-makingly complimentary to me and I do hope I do not appear too self-regarding in quoting them above. I was quite overwhelmed by the large number of special messages, cards and other ways of acknowledging the event which you kindly sent. I hope you will understand that I cannot reply personally to them all, but it did make the whole thing gratifyingly memorable for me. Thank you all so much for your continuing loyalty to the series.",

      "bodyText": "Global stock markets ended their winning streak as attention was turned back to rising tensions between the US and China over Hong Kong. It came after China approved plans for a new controversial security law that will tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous territory Italy\u2019s Q1 GDP was revised lower from -4.8% to -5.4%, compared to a year earlier. That was worse than economists expected Meanwhile, Eurozone inflation tumbled to its lowest level since June 2016 Twitter shares suffered amid a growing rift between the social media platform and the White House The Spanish government approved a form of universal basic income that will guarantee up to \u20ac1,015 (\u00a3916) per household per month, in an attempt to help the country\u2019s poorest US data showed a sharp drop in spending and a record high rate of saving among consumers in April, as the coronavirus and resulting lockdown took hold Oil output by OPEC members fell to its lowest level since 2002 in May, after members including Saudi Arabia embarked on a major supply cut meant to help offset a dramatic drop in demand during the Covid-19 outbreak That\u2019s all from us today. We\u2019ll be back on Monday morning. In the meantime, stay safe -KM Oil output by OPEC members fell to its lowest level since 2002 in May, after members including Saudi Arabia embarked on a major supply cut meant to help offset a dramatic drop in demand during the Covid-19 outbreak. The oil cartel produced 24.77 million barrels per day this month, Reuters has reported. That marks a 5.91 million bpd decline compared to April. However, that\u2019s still higher than the original agreement, which was meant to see members slash supply by a record 9.7 million bpd by 1 May. Oil prices have been trading lower this session, with Brent crude down more than 2% at around $34.58 per barrel. There\u2019s been no reprieve for equity investors today, with Wall Street extending global declines at the open: S&amp;P 500 is down -0.33% Dow is down -0.54% Nasdaq is down -0.1% The focus on renewed trade tensions between the US and China feels strangely familiar, but it\u2019s important to remember how the pandemic has put this in a completely different context. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital explains: From the perspective of the financial markets, these uncertainties manifest themselves at an awkward time, when the global economy is struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global recession is the worst this side of WW2. China\u2019s key role in the global economy is widely-documented, and during the last financial crisis it played an important role through its mega-fiscal policy stimulus back then in preventing a much deeper downturn in the global economy. As a reflection of increasing US-China tensions, CNY has depreciated, with the USD moving closer to the 7.20 level. Normally, for equity market investors a lower CNY=lower equity markets. Slippage in the CNY is seen as hurting the competitiveness of China\u2019s Asian trading partners at a time when world trade is still in contraction. A depreciation in CNY also exports disinflation to the global economy at a time when a slump in global demand heightens disinflationary forces. Equity market investors are alert to the negative effects on corporate pricing power and earnings at a time when US corporate profits have slumped. Dataflash: US data has shown a sharp drop in spending and an increase in savings among consumers in April, as the coronavirus and resulting lockdown took hold. Figures from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis show that personal spending last month fell by -13.6%, worse than consensus estimates for a -12.6% contraction and nearly double the -6.9% drop in March. Meanwhile, the US personal saving rate reached 33% more than double the March rate of 12.7%. CNBC is reporting that is the highest rate since records began in the 1960s. But worth noting that overall personal income increased, thanks in part to government assistance programmes that have helped bolster earnings for workers across the US during the lockdown. As the BEA explains: The April estimate for personal income and outlays was impacted by the response to the spread of COVID-19, as federal economic recovery payments were distributed, and governments continued with \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders. Time to check in with stock markets. With just over an hour until the US open, we\u2019re still looking at a sea of red across European indices, with the FTSE 100 currently the worst performer. While pharma firms and supermarkets like Ocado and Morrisons make the top slots on London\u2019s blue chip index, it is still being dragged down by travel and leisure. Cruise ship owner Carnival currently the worst performer after falling nearly 8%. British Airways is proposing to outsource work being done by at least 450 employees it is making redundant, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes. The Labour party said the proposals were \u201cdisturbing news\u201d and called for the government to scrutinise the plans, revealed by the Guardian. The airline, owned by International Airlines Group (IAG), is also considering closing its operation at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 3 completely and shrinking its footprint at Terminal 5, the Guardian understands. BA, which has received state aid worth hundreds of millions of pounds, proposed cutting as many as 12,000 jobs last month in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Among the thousands of job cuts, the proposals include plans to make at least 450 workers at Heathrow redundant before outsourcing the work they did, according to a person with knowledge of the proposals. BA has said job cuts are necessary because passenger numbers are expected to be significantly lower for as long as four years, meaning demand will be lower. The Spanish government has approved a form of universal basic income that will guarantee up to \u20ac1,015 (\u00a3916) per household per month, in an attempt to help the country\u2019s poorest. The creation of a national minimum income, which has been trailed by the left-leaning government in recent days, has now been approved by cabinet under emergency measures. Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister has said the income scheme will grant each individual living alone \u20ac462 per month, with higher payouts per additional family members up to \u20ac1,015. Those who earn less will receive a top up of earnings so that they get at least the minimum amount every month. The programme aims to reach around 2.5 million people, and is expected to cost the state around \u20ac3bn per year But while the scheme has been approved by the cabinet the FT explains (\u00a3) that Spain\u2019s parliament now has four weeks to back the measure. If the policy fails to get parliamentary backing, it would mean withdrawing the benefits after funds have already started being distributed to households. Currently, potential recipients receive around \u20ac310 a month on average. Twitter shares are down 0.9% in pre-market trading amid a growing rift between the social media platform and the White House. Donald Trump signed signed an executive order overnight that aims to remove Twitter\u2019s protections against civil claims in cases where it acts as an \u201ceditor\u201d rather than a publisher. (That came after the company applied a fact-checking label to the president\u2019s tweets for the first time.) Since then, Twitter has hidden one of Donald Trump\u2019s tweets behind a warning that it \u201cglorifies violence\u201d, further escalating the row with the US president. That tweet, posted on Thursday night Washington time, warned people in Minneapolis protesting against the killing of a black man, George Floyd, by a white police officer that he would send the military to intervene if there was \u201cany difficulty\u201d. Now, it has emerged that Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey was informed by staff in advance of the decision to tag the tweet as glorifying violence. A Twitter spokeswoman told Reuters: The decision was made jointly by teams within Twitter, and our CEO Jack Dorsey was informed of the plan before the Tweet was labelled. All that glitters is...silver? The drop across global stock markets has pushed up safe havens assets including gold which is now trading higher by 0.4% at $1,725 per ounce But silver prices have also come into focus, as the lesser precious metal looks set for its largest monthly gain since June 2016 after rising nearly 0.3% to $17.47 per ounce. Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, says: With gold struggling to make new highs, the market prefers silver, which has lagged gold considerably in this year\u2019s rally, and positioning does not seem to be a factor. Even the typical fast money momentum traders are avoiding selling silver these days. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, says tensions between the US and China over Hong Kong are driving the drop in US futures. But aside from geopolitical tensions, carmakers and tech stocks will also take centre stage on Wall Street today. Renault\u2019s stock, a French car maker, is going to be the primary focus among investors. The company has announced to lay off 14,600 jobs worldwide, nearly 4,600 job losses in France, and reduce its production capacity by nearly a fifth. The strategy is designed to stop the cash bleed under the current circumstances. There is no denying that the automobile industry has been hit hard, and the bigger question is whether we will see a similar reaction from other carmakers such as BMW and Mercedes-Benz. He warns that Twitter shares are likely to suffer \u201canother dismal price action\u201d during the Friday trading session. The stock plunged over four percent yesterday after Twitter decided to fact check Trump\u2019s tweets. Under the current law, social platform companies such as Twitter and Facebook are protected for their user\u2019s posts. However, Trump signed an executive order and called for a new law. Trump calls it freedom of speech, and this threatens the liability shield that companies like Twitter currently enjoy. The new law is likely to be challenged in court, and the outcome of that will determine the future of freedom of speech and also for Twitter. But one thing is for certain, the stock is likely to remain highly volatile because it jumped over one percent in the U.S. after-market session yesterday. Futures are pointing to a drop across major US indices at the start of trading today: S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.5% Dow Jones futures are down 0.6% Nasdaq futures are down 0.5% Eurozone inflation has tumbled to its lowest level since June 2016. Flash estimates from Eurostat showing that the annual rate of inflation increased just 0.1% year-on-year in May, as a jump in food costs were offset by a sharp drop in fuel demand and energy prices. The figure was in line with a Reuters poll of economists but lower than the 0.3% annual rise recorded for April. On a month-on-month basis, eurozone consumer prices declined by 0.1% between April and May. UK lenders have granted around 1.5 million payment holidays on credit cards and personal loans for customers impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown. That\u2019s according to fresh figures released by banking lobby group UK Finance, which shows there has been a near 30% increase in payment delays being granted across both products since the start of May. Currently: 877,800 credit card customers have been granted a freeze, representing around 1.7% of the total 51 million accounts run by its members 608,000 personal loan customers have been put on a payment holiday, which is around 6.8% of the 9 million accounts run by UK Finance members It\u2019s worth noting that interest is usually being charged during the payment holidays, even if principle payments are frozen. Discount retailer B&amp;M has fared relatively well during lockdown. The company has reported exceptionally strong demand for DIY and gardening tools that helped push underlying UK sales up 22.7% over the last eight weeks. Overall, UK like-for-like sales growth accelerated from 6.6% in the final quarter of its 2019-20 year, which benefited from a strong grocery performance in March, Reuters reports. The company said customers were visiting its stores less frequently during the lockdown but their average spend had been much higher than usual. The final reading of Italy\u2019s Q1 economic growth has been revised lower from -4.8% to -5.4%, compared to a year earlier. That is worse than economists had expected, having forecasted no change from preliminary estimates, according to a Reuters poll. It\u2019s the latest snapshot of the impact that coronavirus has had on Italy, which was the first country to be thrust into lockdown in Europe. Also worth nothing that earlier this morning, France\u2019s INSEE official statistics agency predicted that French gross GDP could fall by as much as 20% in the second quarter compared to the previous three months. France - which is the eurozone\u2019s second largest economy, contracted -5.3% in the first quarter, having been revised from -5.8% in its preliminary reading. *Note: this post has been updated to reflect the revised French GDP for Q1 in the last par. The FTSE 100 has extended its losses and is now down over 1.1% at around 6,146 points. Newsflash: China\u2019s foreign ministry has said it reserves the right to take countermeasures against the UK if it offers permanent residency to Hong Kong residents, according to Reuters. It\u2019s not exactly clear what those countermeasures would entail, but it is unlikely to be good news for future trade relations and industry. It comes after the UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said Britain would extend visa rights for as many as 300,000 Hong Kong British national (overseas) passport holders if China continues down the path of imposing repressive security laws on the former British colony. The move is a response to growing Conservative backbench pressure on the Foreign Office to do more to help Hong Kong citizens fearful that China is about to extinguish their independence and political freedoms, my colleagues Patrick Wintour and Verna Yu explain. You can read that story here: In a sign that some semblance of normality is expected in the UK in the months ahead, CityAM has announced that it will be restarting the printing presses by September: Nationwide Building Society has seen its annual profits almost halve, in part due to the impact of hundreds of thousands of customers taking payment holidays due to the coronavirus, my colleague Mark Sweney writes. The mortgage lender said that pre-tax profits plunged by 44% from \u00a3833m to \u00a3466m in the year to 4 April. Joe Garner, chief executive, said that 280,00 customers have so far opted to take a payment holiday which has cost the company \u00a3101m: In the last month of our financial year all our lives have been overshadowed by the coronavirus. We are helping members in financial difficulty with payment holidays on mortgages and loans and interest-free overdraft periods. In total Nationwide booked \u00a3209m in charges as the business was also impacted by investment in technology and higher PPI provisions as customers raced to make last-minute claims ahead of the Financial Conduct Authority\u2019s deadline last August. Garner said that Nationwide has already moved to continue to support struggling homeowners guaranteeing that there will be no compulsory repossessions in the current financial year for those financially affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The lender has also guaranteed that it will not make any staff redundant this year. He added that the hit to profits would be short-term and that it had been expected before the health emergency hit the UK. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 has been dragged lower by autos, banks, and travel &amp; leisure stocks, and the FTSE 100 is not much different. The worst performers including Rolls Royce and cruise company Carnival, as well as easyJet. HSBC is not too far behind either, having been hit by fears that Hong Kong\u2019s robust financial sector could be hurt if it is included in sanctions aimed at China. There are only about 20 stocks trading in positive territory on London\u2019s blue chip index this morning. They include pharma giant AstraZeneca which has been boosted by news that its drug Tagrisso has been shown to hold back certain types of lung cancer. French carmaker Renault plans to cut 14,600 jobs as it aims to save \u20ac2bn in one of the deepest restructuring programmes prompted by the coronavirus pandemic across the global car industry, my colleague Jasper Jolly writes. Renault will cut 4,600 jobs in its French operations, which will undergo a major reorganisation, and another 10,000 around the world. The cost cutting is on a similar scale to Nissan, Renault\u2019s alliance partner, which on Thursday announced the closure of its Barcelona car plant amid a restructuring. The two companies have rejected proposals to merge their operations fully, but have committed to letting one of the carmakers \u201clead\u201d in each global region. Renault said it will cut its global production capacity from 4m vehicles in 2019 to 3.3m by 2024. Closures could include a foundry in Brittany, a factory in northern France. The carmaker will also abandon selling combustion engine cars in China, with Dongfeng buying out its joint-venture partner. The job cuts are likely to have been agreed with the French government, which has been in discussions about providing an emergency \u20ac5bn loan guarantee for Renault. The French state owns 15% of the carmaker. Clotilde Delbos, Renault\u2019s interim chief executive, said: In a context of uncertainty and complexity, this project is vital to guarantee a solid and sustainable performance, with customer satisfaction as a priority. By capitalizing on our many assets such as the electric vehicle, by capitalizing on the resources and technologies of Groupe Renault and the Alliance, and by reducing the complexity of development and production of our vehicles, we want to generate economies of scale to restore our overall profitability and ensure our development in France and internationally. After steadily climbing all week, major indices across Europe have also lost their steam and follows US and Asian stocks into the red: FTSE 100 is down 0.9% Germany\u2019s XETRA DAX is down 1.1% France\u2019s CAC 40 is down 0.9% Spain\u2019s IBEX is down 1.3% Commenting on the negative turn in global stocks, Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK says: Having spent most of this week ignoring the prospect of an escalation of US, China tension over Hong Kong, despite various smoke signals throughout the week suggesting a confrontation was brewing, US markets turned tail sharply late last night on reports that President Trump was going to be holding a press conference later today on China. On top of revoking special trade status for Hong Kong, the US house as also passed further sanctions on China that threaten to increase tensions between Washington and Beijing. Hewson adds: The US house also passed a bill, earlier this week authorising sanctions against senior Chinese officials for human rights abuses, against Muslim minorities, so today\u2019s press conference could well up the ante further, if President Trump signs off on that bill as well as implementing further measures that might hint that the US is keen to send the Chinese a message. This sharp reversal in the last hour of US trading, merely goes to show that markets not only see what they want to see and hear what they want to hear, but that they also choose when they want to as well. The announcement of today\u2019s press conference is probably as a result of yesterday\u2019s vote in the China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress that approved the controversial new security law for Hong Kong. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business. Global stock markets have ended their winning streak as attention was turned back to rising tensions over Hong Kong. It comes after China approved plans for a new controversial security law that will tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous territory. Hong Kong\u2019s government has since warned the US to stay out of its affairs, after Washington revoked a special trading status granted to Hong Kong that recognised it as separate from China. The move could mean potential sanctions would be extended to Hong Kong, which could batter businesses in the region. Wall Street took a turn into the red last night amid news that US president Donald Trump is planning to hold a press conference today that will focus on China. It sent the S&amp;P 500 down 0.2% and the Dow down nearly 0.6% overnight, having shrugged off data released earlier in the day, showing a worse than expected final reading of Q1 GDP, and a further 2.1 million rise in US jobless claims. The bulk of Asian indices followed suit, with the Hang Seng down 0.7%, Australia\u2019s main market down 0.4% and the Nikkei down 0.2%. Europe is also called lower.

What goes unsaid is that this strategy of shielding is distinctly western, and has not proven particularly effective at protecting these individuals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The first vocal proponent of shielding was Boris Johnson, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">announced </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">in mid-March</a> that the UK would keep its economy open and achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d. In the meantime, those at high risk of coronavirus would need to protect themselves by shielding from the rest of society. David Halpern, the chief executive of the behavioural insights team, which is part-owned by the government, said, \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcmarkeaston/status/1237694665824047111?s=21\">there\u2019s going to be a point</a>, assuming the epidemic flows and grows, as we think it probably will do, where you\u2019ll want to cocoon, you\u2019ll want to protect those at-risk groups so that they basically don\u2019t catch the disease \u2013 and by the time they come out of their cocooning, herd immunity\u2019s been achieved in the rest of the population\u201d. </p> <p>This plan turned out to be disastrous. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">Deaths ravaged care homes</a> and households, and the UK quickly reversed tack and introduced a national lockdown on 23 March. The UK now has one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">highest death tolls in the world</a>.&nbsp;Yet shielding strategies stuck: governments in the US, UK, Sweden and other western countries still advise confinement for vulnerable populations. Most (with the exception of Sweden) recommend shielding in conjunction with a national lockdown.</p> <p>In contrast, east Asian governments have adopted policies focused almost exclusively on mass testing, tracing, and isolation of infectious individuals. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing\">South Korea</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/liberal-dutch-taiwan-coronavirus-covid-19-netherlands\">Taiwan</a>, governments made two face masks a week available to citizens and registered non-citizens across the country. The core objective in these countries was to drive the virus out and prevent both young and old people catching it.</p> <p>Two key assumptions underlie shielding use in the UK. First, that if 15% of the population, say, were vulnerable to severe infection from coronavirus, this group could reasonably be isolated from the remaining 85%, who were likely to contract only a mild illness. And second, that those who have contracted coronavirus would develop protective immunity. Yet we still don\u2019t know if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/who-warns-against-coronavirus-immunity-passports\">people develop immunity</a> once they have become infected with coronavirus.</p> <p>And in practice, the first assumption falls apart. According to <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.04.20053058v1\">one&nbsp;study&nbsp;in China</a>, 80% of coronavirus transmissions occurred at home, where multi-generational living complicates attempts at shielding. Elderly people who are shielding and living with family members under one roof are especially at risk as countries move to reopen their economies. This risk shouldn\u2019t be understated. In the US,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/05/a-record-64-million-americans-live-in-multigenerational-households/\">13 million</a>&nbsp;Americans over 65 live in multigenerational households. Some don\u2019t have the space for their own room. For members of this group who are clinically extremely vulnerable, shielding isn\u2019t really an option.</p> <p>Even elderly people who live alone need regular contact for care and services. According to the Institute on Aging in the US,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ioaging.org/aging-in-america\">65%&nbsp;of older adults</a> rely exclusively on family and friends to provide them with assistance. Another 30% receive paid assistance alongside their family support. Every point of contact in the network of care for an elderly person who is shielding increases their threat of infection.</p> <p>Beyond immediate family and friends, people who are shielding are also more likely to need regular contact to receive medical care, grocery deliveries, and transportation. The extent to which at-risk populations must rely on others for essential care and services is a huge challenge to the efficacy of any shielding strategy.</p> <p>We\u2019ve seen that despite attempts to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#staying-at-home-and-shielding\">shield </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#staying-at-home-and-shielding\">people in nursing and care homes</a>, death rates in these places are consistently among the highest in national tolls. Consider Sweden, which remains lockdown-free, despite deaths ravaging its care homes and elder-care services. At least 50% of the country\u2019s coronavirus deaths occurred within nursing homes,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/28/europe/sweden-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-intl/index.html\">according to</a>&nbsp;Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist of the Swedish public health agency.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the UK, where a national shielding strategy was temporarily adopted, care homes also became hotbeds for infection. Care home deaths were found to be <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/05/care-home-death-toll-could-be-22000-more-double-official-figure-academics-say\">higher than 22,000</a> by academics at the London School of Economics. Inefficacies aside, shielding itself is harmful to the mental health of those who are vulnerable. Older adults are already at heightened risk of depression and<strong> </strong>suicidal thoughts;&nbsp;according to&nbsp;the Kaiser Family Foundation, social isolation from shielding can <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/\">exacerbate these mental health challenges</a>. It\u2019s unlikely that the mental health of members of this group who have to shield will improve from being asked to shield indefinitely.&nbsp;</p> <p>And the elderly alone don\u2019t bear the risks of coronavirus. Many younger individuals live with key risk factors that put them into vulnerable groups, and some will be deemed clinically extremely vulnerable to coronavirus.

      "body": "<p>The BBC is looking to cut its local news output across England in order to reduce costs, with both the award-winning Inside Out series of investigative programmes and regional political debate shows potentially facing the chop.</p> <p>Inside Out, which broadcasts 11 different local current affairs shows in a primetime slot on BBC One, was due to return in September, but the autumn series has now been cancelled. Bosses accept that the show\u2019s entire future is now in question as part of a review of all regional programming in England.</p> <p>Although Inside Out is made on a relatively small budget, the regional current affairs programmes have consistently performed well at industry awards for their investigations, with stories also being well read on the BBC website. The slot \u2013 the last remaining major regional current affairs show on British television \u2013 has also been a training ground for many would-be journalists based outside London to get a break in the industry, with former staff now working on high-profile national BBC programmes such as Panorama.</p> <p>The future of the BBC\u2019s regional political debate programmes shown on Sunday mornings is also being considered as part of the review, with the corporation needing to consult regulator Ofcom on changes to its operating licence to enable them to take place.</p> <p>\u201cSlap bang in the middle of the biggest crisis the UK has face for years, the BBC has pulled up the drawbridge on regional current affairs,\u201d said one Inside Out employee. \u201cThey say it is \u2018Covid-related\u2019 but the nation is busy going back to work and it is perfectly possible to cover these stories with proper social distancing measures in place. Aside from the local news there is now no regional magazine covering this story in depth and no local political discussion on a Sunday.\u201d</p> <p>The public broadcaster has previously said it will need to make a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/29/bbc-likely-to-make-cuts-to-output-after-income-forecast-to-drop-125m\">further \u00a3125m of spending cuts</a> as a result of the coronavirus pandemic hitting commercial revenue and licence fee payment. Although England is facing a reduction in current affairs coverage, BBC investment in current affairs programmes in the UK\u2019s other nations has been substantial, with Scotland recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/19/derided-even-before-its-launch-bbc-scotland-has-silenced-the-critics-with-its-brilliance\">gaining its own dedicated television channel</a>.</p> <p>Despite the difficult circumstances, regional television news bulletins across England have performed strongly during the pandemic, attracting high audiences for regional perspectives on the coronavirus lockdown, while the BBC\u2019s local radio stations have become hubs for community support.</p> <p>Sally Joynson, chief executive of industry group Screen Yorkshire, said she would be asking the BBC for more details on the proposed changes and the impact on jobs, adding: \u201cFor a region like Yorkshire that has had a very long track record in journalism and current affairs we are very keen to retain that expertise and those skills in the region.</p> <p>\u201cInside Out remains consistently strong in terms of audience figures. Tony Hall on Sunday was talking about the importance of nations and regions representation, but it\u2019s very concerning that one of the few remaining programmes that delivers on that agenda is under review. This isn\u2019t just about Yorkshire; it\u2019s about regional broadcasting across the country.\u201d</p> <p>A BBC spokesperson said the corporation needed to prioritise its resources and would keep the shows under review, adding: \u201cSeparately we&nbsp;are also taking a thorough look at what we do in England. This is driven by the BBC\u2019s significant financial challenges and efforts to learn lessons from the Covid-19 crisis. No decisions have been taken on the future of any of our content or services.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC is looking to cut its local news output across England in order to reduce costs, with both the award-winning Inside Out series of investigative programmes and regional political debate shows potentially facing the chop. Inside Out, which broadcasts 11 different local current affairs shows in a primetime slot on BBC One, was due to return in September, but the autumn series has now been cancelled. Bosses accept that the show\u2019s entire future is now in question as part of a review of all regional programming in England. Although Inside Out is made on a relatively small budget, the regional current affairs programmes have consistently performed well at industry awards for their investigations, with stories also being well read on the BBC website. The slot \u2013 the last remaining major regional current affairs show on British television \u2013 has also been a training ground for many would-be journalists based outside London to get a break in the industry, with former staff now working on high-profile national BBC programmes such as Panorama. The future of the BBC\u2019s regional political debate programmes shown on Sunday mornings is also being considered as part of the review, with the corporation needing to consult regulator Ofcom on changes to its operating licence to enable them to take place. \u201cSlap bang in the middle of the biggest crisis the UK has face for years, the BBC has pulled up the drawbridge on regional current affairs,\u201d said one Inside Out employee. \u201cThey say it is \u2018Covid-related\u2019 but the nation is busy going back to work and it is perfectly possible to cover these stories with proper social distancing measures in place. Aside from the local news there is now no regional magazine covering this story in depth and no local political discussion on a Sunday.\u201d The public broadcaster has previously said it will need to make a further \u00a3125m of spending cuts as a result of the coronavirus pandemic hitting commercial revenue and licence fee payment. Although England is facing a reduction in current affairs coverage, BBC investment in current affairs programmes in the UK\u2019s other nations has been substantial, with Scotland recently gaining its own dedicated television channel. Despite the difficult circumstances, regional television news bulletins across England have performed strongly during the pandemic, attracting high audiences for regional perspectives on the coronavirus lockdown, while the BBC\u2019s local radio stations have become hubs for community support. Sally Joynson, chief executive of industry group Screen Yorkshire, said she would be asking the BBC for more details on the proposed changes and the impact on jobs, adding: \u201cFor a region like Yorkshire that has had a very long track record in journalism and current affairs we are very keen to retain that expertise and those skills in the region. \u201cInside Out remains consistently strong in terms of audience figures. Tony Hall on Sunday was talking about the importance of nations and regions representation, but it\u2019s very concerning that one of the few remaining programmes that delivers on that agenda is under review. This isn\u2019t just about Yorkshire; it\u2019s about regional broadcasting across the country.\u201d A BBC spokesperson said the corporation needed to prioritise its resources and would keep the shows under review, adding: \u201cSeparately we are also taking a thorough look at what we do in England. This is driven by the BBC\u2019s significant financial challenges and efforts to learn lessons from the Covid-19 crisis. No decisions have been taken on the future of any of our content or services.\u201d",

Just over half of respondents thought the country would be very united or somewhat united, compared with 23% who thought the country was united before the coronavirus outbreak. However, the majority of these responses were completed before the revelations that one of Boris Johnson\u2019s senior political aides, Dominic Cummings, may have broken lockdown rules. Cummings has refused to resign despite Durham police concluding his family trip to Barnard Castle, a beauty spot on the River Tees, may have been in breach of stay at home guidance to stay at home and would have led officers to tell him to turn around, had he been stopped. The survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also revealed working adults have become increasingly concerned about health and safety since the government eased lockdown rules and encouraged those who can return to work to do so. The proportion of adults worried about health and safety in the workplace during the coronavirus outbreak almost doubled in the space of a week, the ONS said. One in five (20%) adults who said the pandemic is affecting their work have health and safety concerns, up from 11% the previous week. The most common concerns are around difficulties in following social distancing and hygiene advice and having limited or no protective equipment. The ONS polled 1,028 adults between 21 and 24 May as part of its weekly opinions and lifestyle survey, to understand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on British society. For a second week, the most common impact was a lack of freedom and independence, with almost six in 10 adults (59%) reporting this. Other common issues were an inability to make plans (58%) and personal travel plans being affected (51%). The survey also showed people continue to be concerned about the future and feelings of boredom had increased this week. Among all adults, about one in five people (21%) said they expect it would be more than a year before life returns to normal. More than one in three (36%) expected the financial position of their household to worsen over the next 12 months. More than four in 10 (43%) said their work had been affected by coronavirus over the past seven days. Of the sample of 310 people asked why, a fifth said it was due to health and safety concerns, making it the third biggest concern behind decreased hours and being furloughed. It follows the change in advice from the government on 10 May, from stay at home to stay alert. This included encouraging those in England who are unable to work from home to return to their jobs if their workplace is open from 13 May. The government had also said people would be allowed to exercise as many times as they wish and spend time outdoors with someone from a different household providing they observe social distancing rules. More than a third of the working adults polled (36%) said they had left home to travel to or from work during the past seven days \u2013 a similar level to the previous week. The proportion of people who said they had stayed at home or only left for work, shopping, medical reasons or exercise, fell to 73%, its lowest level. The most common reasons for leaving home continue to be essential shopping, exercise, work and medical need. However, leaving to meet with others in a public place has seen the largest increase this week. More than four in 10 adults who had left their home (42%) had visited a park or public green space this week \u2013 with 36% of these saying they had met family or friends from outside their household. While outside the home, about three in 10 adults (29%) said they had worn a face covering during the last seven days, while 41% said they are very or fairly likely to wear one over the next week.",

On top of 636 deaths in April reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. In France, the prime minister said a ban on journeys of more than 100km (62 miles) would end on Tuesday, adding that cafes, bars and restaurants in so-called green areas \u2013 where the virus is not circulating widely \u2013 would be able to reopen on the same date.

Health authorities in South Africa say the country has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed coronavirus tests, because of a difficulty in obtaining essential supplies.\u201cThis challenge is caused by the limited availability of test kits globally,\u201d the health ministry said. The president of Namibia, Hage Geingob, and several top officials have been fined after breaching regulations last month by hosting a celebration to mark his party\u2019s 60th anniversary. The South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo) birthday party took place in parliament on 19 April, when Namibia was under lockdown and group gatherings banned.

      "bodyText": "Jimmy Kimmel It\u2019s been an altogether brutal week of news, but \u201cwhile racial injustice is tearing this country apart\u201d, said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, in reference to protests over the killing of George Floyd, a black man, by Minneapolis police, Donald Trump \u201cis going to war with Twitter\u201d. Trump has been apoplectic about the tech company since earlier this week, when it factchecked his misleading tweets on mail-in voting as a widespread cause of voter fraud (there is no evidence to support this, and many states with Republican governors have used mail-in voting for years). Twitter tagged his tweets as \u201cpotentially misleading\u201d with a \u201cget the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d link to articles disproving Trump\u2019s claim. Trump\u2019s attempt to discredit mail-in voting is \u201cpart of his multi-pronged \u2018looks like I\u2019m gonna lose so I\u2019ll make every case I can to say I was cheated\u2019 campaign\u201d, said Kimmel. So on Thursday, in retaliation to Twitter\u2019s factchecking, he \u201cpicked up his executive Sharpie\u201d and signed an executive order that would limit legal protections for social media companies. The order was intended, he argued, to make it so \u201csocial media companies that engage in censoring or any political conduct will not be able to keep their liability shield\u201d. Naturally, he also raged about Twitter on Twitter, tweeting: \u201cTwitter is now interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election. They are saying my statement on Mail-In Ballots, which will lead to massive corruption and fraud, is incorrect, based on fact-checking by Fake News CNN and the Amazon Washington Post \u2026 Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\u201d \u201cThis is crazy,\u201d said Kimmel of the president\u2019s response. \u201cThis would be like if he declared war on Arby\u2019s because they said there are 550 calories in his curly fries.\u201d He continued: \u201cIn a nutshell, the president is mad at an app on his phone, and is using the power of his office to retaliate. This is what is on his mind as the death toll from coronavirus is over 100,000 now.\u201d Trump continued to escalate his Twitter attacks on Thursday, telling reporters he would \u201cshut down\u201d the platform if his attorneys could find a way because it\u2019s \u201climiting his freedom of speech\u201d. The argument is \u201cobviously insane\u201d, said Kimmel. \u201cHe is Mr Twitter. And by the way, if he\u2019s so mad at Twitter, why doesn\u2019t he stop using it? He can\u2019t, because he loves it. He loves mashing those angry little thumbs.\u201d",

Factor in the black and ethnic minority experience, and the state is suddenly not such a good place to live. Despite Minneapolis celebrating itself as the city of Prince and Paisley Park, Minnesota\u2019s black education and employment outcomes by US national standards have long been dismal in comparison with those of the state\u2019s white population. Rated in 2018 second in terms of overall best states in which to live in the US, in the same year Minnesota ranked close to the bottom for both employment gap by race (47th) and income gap by race (38th). According to a report released last year, even before the mass unemployment triggered by the coronavirus took hold, some 10% of black American residents of the Twin Cities were unemployed compared with just under 4% of white American residents. Given the pandemic\u2019s disproportionate impact on communities of color, that already bad situation has now worsened. The reality of Minneapolis and St Paul is that behind the veneer of \u201cMinnesota nice\u201d, behind the reputation of a socially liberal and highly tolerant metropolitan area (in contrast with the state\u2019s more conservative rural areas), there have long been glaring divisions along racial lines in a place where 20% of the population is African-American. Despite having a white mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been outspoken about the problems of structural racism, and being located in the same congressional district that elected Ilhan Omar, the state\u2019s first non-white woman to be elected to Congress, race relations have foundered on chronic inequalities and a series of high-profile killings of black people involving the 800-strong police force.

Finally, as one resident pointed out to the Guardian, the impact of the coronavirus \u2013 not least its devastating economic impact on the poorest and least protected communities \u2013 has fed the simmering anger that existed before George Floyd\u2019s killing. All of which has left a journey along Minneapolis\u2019s historic east-west thoroughfare Lake Street, location of the 3rd police precinct which was attacked after the Floyd killing, as a metaphor for many of the tensions. A longtime magnet for new immigrants, from Scandinavians in the 19th century through black Americans during the Great Migration and those who relocated from cities such as Chicago in the 60s and 70s, to Hispanic, Hmong and most recently Somali immigrants, this street underlines the disparities. Running from uptown with its wealthy homes, and bookended by the middle class neighborhoods close to the river where Black Lives Matter placards proliferated on lawns in 2016 after Castile\u2019s killing, it also traverses poorer neighborhoods with immigrant-run businesses. It was not always this way. While race relations in the state have largely mirrored the wider experience of the US, the Twin Cites in the 60s and 70s were seen for the African Americans who relocated there as a place with access to jobs and good schooling. But race in Minnesota has become foregrounded even more in the Trump era, as some local rightwing politicians in towns such as Saint Cloud, outside the metropolitan area, have fostered anti-immigrant sentiment aimed largely at Somalis and Latinos. All of which led Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor to write in the New York Times that what is \u201cunmistakable in the bitter protests in Minneapolis and around the country is the sense that the state is either complicit or incapable of effecting substantive change\u201d.",

That\u2019s nice. Can she give him permission to act like a prime minister for more than an hour a week? He could start small, then gradually build up his prime-ministering distance, so that by the time of the next election he\u2019s doing a whole day a week. Maybe there\u2019s an app for it. Couch To PM.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, we\u2019ve all seen some shameless moves by Johnson over the past few days, but let\u2019s open a sub-category for Thursday night\u2019s Downing Street briefing. If you missed this How Not To video, it featured the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/johnson-blocks-top-scientists-from-talking-about-cummings\">inserting himself</a> between some perfectly reasonable questions and the scientists Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser and England\u2019s chief medical officer respectively, with Johnson acting for all the world like he\u2019d take a bullet for them.&nbsp;Do me a favour. He wouldn\u2019t even take a NutriBullet for them. He wouldn\u2019t even read a bullet point written BY them.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Plenty of other countries with less money and much worse healthcare options have performed far more successfully than us</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>When Marlon Brando turned up to the set of Apocalypse Now he weighed 300 pounds (21 stone), hadn\u2019t bothered reading Heart of Darkness \u2013 the novel on which the movie was based \u2013 and was sufficiently unfocused on the job to prefer rambling tangential discussions about the script to getting anything done. Obviously he hadn\u2019t learned his lines \u2013 indeed, he was by now quite incapable of it \u2013 having long preferred to have cue cards positioned around his sets in ingenious positions to avoid them being picked up by the various camera angles. On some productions, Brando\u2019s lines were even stuck to other actors\u2019 foreheads.&nbsp;He was, however, literally Marlon Brando, and that rightly counted for rather a lot.</p> \n<p>Watching Johnson playing to MPs on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnsons-liaison-committee-appearance-what-did-we-learn\">liaison </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnsons-liaison-committee-appearance-what-did-we-learn\">committee this week</a>, it was difficult to conclude he will be able to draw much longer on a similar wellspring of tolerance for the idiosyncrasies of his craft. Of his preference for prizing Dominic Cummings more highly than his public health message, Johnson kept saying: \u201cI have already answered a lot of questions about this.\u201d But the only earlier answers to which he is referring were also the words: \u201cI have already answered a lot of questions about this.\u201d His performance was the equivalent of Brando\u2019s Kurtz turning to the camera and gurning: \u201cLOOK MA \u2013 THEY GONE AND LET ME DONE A MOVIE!!!\u201d Basically a production-killer. Couldn\u2019t someone \u2013 perhaps Cummings \u2013 stand just out of shot wearing a sign on his forehead that reads simply: \u201cDON\u2019T SMIRK\u201d?</p> \n<p>The entire effort was so abject it had the flavour of that classic domestic move where someone \u2013 might be a man, might be a lady \u2013 deliberately loads the dishwasher so sensationally, historically badly that it is a clear attempt to ensure they are never asked to do it again.</p> \n<p>Yet, mesmerisingly,&nbsp;Johnson appeared to imagine he was even in the same postcode as adequate. \u201cThe trouble is,\u201d he complained about having to be there at all, \u201cit does take a huge amount of Sherpa time, of preparation time.\u201d On the one hand: oh no. Did you have to be prime minister again for an hour?&nbsp;I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so much work. On the other hand: wait. Are you telling me that this is you WITH preparation? What does busking it look like? Presumably it involves public incontinence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"33b27498-b467-4c86-a391-0263dc48c7c8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/knXsKciv63s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Given this level of leadership, perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that this week saw many of Johnson\u2019s cabinet abandoning the fiction that they possess basic social skills. I know some people like his hoodie, but for me Rishi Sunak was this week wearing the Castrol GTX jacket that was Alan Partridge\u2019s funeral attire. \u201cThe good news we\u2019ve all been waiting for!\u2019 was <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/rishi-sunak-nandos-coronavirus-government-good-news-a4452401.html\">his verdict</a> on the reopening of 54 Nando\u2019s outlets.&nbsp;Or perhaps you prefer self-styled tone policeman Matt Hancock?&nbsp;Asked by Sky News\u2019 Kay Burley if his test-and-trace strategy wasn\u2019t being rushed forward to distract from Cummings, it was an interesting choice on the health secretary\u2019s part to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Zx4_071ivE\">laugh his way</a> through what felt like the next decade of airtime.</p> \n<p>Being charitable, I\u2019d have allowed him one laugh. This particular government being told it\u2019s doing something about the virus too quickly is certainly a total novelty, and within the disingenuous confines of political cut-and-thrust he was entitled to a flourish along the lines of: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard it all now.\u201d Instead, Matt\u2019s guffawing went way past even nitrous-oxide balloon level. Maybe he\u2019s doing a sponsored laugh to raise money for the tracing system we deserve, as opposed to the one we have?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/covid-19-track-and-trace-what-can-uk-learn-from-countries-got-it-right\">Covid-19 track and trace: what can UK learn from countries that got it right?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Either way I enjoy the way Hancock attempts to cover for the lack of sophistication by making his \u201chuman contact tracers\u201d sound like they\u2019re blade runners, who he personally is dispatching to track down biocompromised replicants who just happen to work as delivery drivers or in cafes. God knows the Johnson administration loves a whole \u201cbest of the best\u201d angle, which is why the absurd business of having to hire <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/28/extra-50000-border-staff-needed-for-post-brexit-trade-says-gove\">50,000 form fillers</a> for the red-tape horrorshow that is post-Brexit trade with the EU has turned into what they like to call \u201cthe world\u2019s first customs agent academy\u201d, like it\u2019s fricking Starfleet.</p> \n<p>And yet, perhaps the government would be wise to downplay its obsession with all things \u201cworld-beating\u201d. It would be an odd choice of phrase at the best of times, implying a sort of relish at having whupped countries with less money or worse healthcare options.

      "bodyText": "I read this week that Boris Johnson has been given permission by the Queen to exercise in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. That\u2019s nice. Can she give him permission to act like a prime minister for more than an hour a week? He could start small, then gradually build up his prime-ministering distance, so that by the time of the next election he\u2019s doing a whole day a week. Maybe there\u2019s an app for it. Couch To PM. In the meantime, we\u2019ve all seen some shameless moves by Johnson over the past few days, but let\u2019s open a sub-category for Thursday night\u2019s Downing Street briefing. If you missed this How Not To video, it featured the prime minister inserting himself between some perfectly reasonable questions and the scientists Patrick Vallance and Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser and England\u2019s chief medical officer respectively, with Johnson acting for all the world like he\u2019d take a bullet for them. Do me a favour. He wouldn\u2019t even take a NutriBullet for them. He wouldn\u2019t even read a bullet point written BY them. When Marlon Brando turned up to the set of Apocalypse Now he weighed 300 pounds (21 stone), hadn\u2019t bothered reading Heart of Darkness \u2013 the novel on which the movie was based \u2013 and was sufficiently unfocused on the job to prefer rambling tangential discussions about the script to getting anything done. Obviously he hadn\u2019t learned his lines \u2013 indeed, he was by now quite incapable of it \u2013 having long preferred to have cue cards positioned around his sets in ingenious positions to avoid them being picked up by the various camera angles. On some productions, Brando\u2019s lines were even stuck to other actors\u2019 foreheads. He was, however, literally Marlon Brando, and that rightly counted for rather a lot. Watching Johnson playing to MPs on the liaison committee this week, it was difficult to conclude he will be able to draw much longer on a similar wellspring of tolerance for the idiosyncrasies of his craft. Of his preference for prizing Dominic Cummings more highly than his public health message, Johnson kept saying: \u201cI have already answered a lot of questions about this.\u201d But the only earlier answers to which he is referring were also the words: \u201cI have already answered a lot of questions about this.\u201d His performance was the equivalent of Brando\u2019s Kurtz turning to the camera and gurning: \u201cLOOK MA \u2013 THEY GONE AND LET ME DONE A MOVIE!!!\u201d Basically a production-killer. Couldn\u2019t someone \u2013 perhaps Cummings \u2013 stand just out of shot wearing a sign on his forehead that reads simply: \u201cDON\u2019T SMIRK\u201d? The entire effort was so abject it had the flavour of that classic domestic move where someone \u2013 might be a man, might be a lady \u2013 deliberately loads the dishwasher so sensationally, historically badly that it is a clear attempt to ensure they are never asked to do it again. Yet, mesmerisingly, Johnson appeared to imagine he was even in the same postcode as adequate. \u201cThe trouble is,\u201d he complained about having to be there at all, \u201cit does take a huge amount of Sherpa time, of preparation time.\u201d On the one hand: oh no. Did you have to be prime minister again for an hour? I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so much work. On the other hand: wait. Are you telling me that this is you WITH preparation? What does busking it look like? Presumably it involves public incontinence. Given this level of leadership, perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that this week saw many of Johnson\u2019s cabinet abandoning the fiction that they possess basic social skills. I know some people like his hoodie, but for me Rishi Sunak was this week wearing the Castrol GTX jacket that was Alan Partridge\u2019s funeral attire. \u201cThe good news we\u2019ve all been waiting for!\u2019 was his verdict on the reopening of 54 Nando\u2019s outlets. Or perhaps you prefer self-styled tone policeman Matt Hancock? Asked by Sky News\u2019 Kay Burley if his test-and-trace strategy wasn\u2019t being rushed forward to distract from Cummings, it was an interesting choice on the health secretary\u2019s part to laugh his way through what felt like the next decade of airtime. Being charitable, I\u2019d have allowed him one laugh. This particular government being told it\u2019s doing something about the virus too quickly is certainly a total novelty, and within the disingenuous confines of political cut-and-thrust he was entitled to a flourish along the lines of: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve heard it all now.\u201d Instead, Matt\u2019s guffawing went way past even nitrous-oxide balloon level. Maybe he\u2019s doing a sponsored laugh to raise money for the tracing system we deserve, as opposed to the one we have? Either way I enjoy the way Hancock attempts to cover for the lack of sophistication by making his \u201chuman contact tracers\u201d sound like they\u2019re blade runners, who he personally is dispatching to track down biocompromised replicants who just happen to work as delivery drivers or in cafes. God knows the Johnson administration loves a whole \u201cbest of the best\u201d angle, which is why the absurd business of having to hire 50,000 form fillers for the red-tape horrorshow that is post-Brexit trade with the EU has turned into what they like to call \u201cthe world\u2019s first customs agent academy\u201d, like it\u2019s fricking Starfleet. And yet, perhaps the government would be wise to downplay its obsession with all things \u201cworld-beating\u201d. It would be an odd choice of phrase at the best of times, implying a sort of relish at having whupped countries with less money or worse healthcare options. But during these suboptimal times, where plenty of other countries with less money and much worse healthcare options have performed far more successfully than us, it tips over into state-sponsored delusion. The UK has the second highest rate of excess deaths from the coronavirus pandemic in the world. In the WORLD. It\u2019s a funny sort of world-beating achievement \u2013 but it\u2019s evidently what you get with the boy who grew up wanting to be world king. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist Guardian Newsroom: The Dominic Cummings story On Wednesday 3 June at 7pm we\u2019re holding a live-streamed event exploring the ongoing controversy of Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown-defying road trip and the government\u2019s handling of the ensuing fallout.

Leicester resumed full contact training on Thursday and Rodgers will not put pressure on any player to return to action if they do not feel safe. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great dialogue with the players along the way. There\u2019s been a lot of communication right through the club. With any fears, worries or concerns there was an open-door policy. Naturally everyone had a concern about whether it would be safe. The measures that have been put in place by the police and the Premier League have been followed to the last letter by the club. \u201cWhen the players came in you could see the amount of work that has gone in to ensure this environment is safe. We also said to the players this is entirely your decision. Feel free. If you\u2019re not happy, or you have a fear for yourself, or your family, there is no pressure on you. \u201cBut all the players have felt the support of the club and seen the work that has gone in and have really enjoyed being back into some sort of routine.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The first inkling of the story that shook Downing Street to its core came at the beginning of April.</p> \n<p>It was the first Sunday of the month, a couple of hours before the Queen\u2019s stirring promise to the nation that, however hard it was to endure separation from our loved ones, \u201cwe will meet again\u201d. Boris Johnson was seriously ill, and that evening it would be announced that the prime minister had been admitted to hospital.</p> \n<p>As it would turn out, however, one of the most consequential news events of the day was one almost nobody knew about.</p> \n<p>The Guardian had been told that Dominic Cummings, the cartoon bogeyman of remain voters and the liberal left, was listening to Dancing Queen in his parents\u2019 front drive.</p> \n<p>The Cummings family property is on a fast-moving A road and almost completely hidden behind bushes.</p> \n<p>The chances of anyone spotting a special adviser enjoying a bit of Abba during quarantine \u2013 much less recognising him \u2013 were slim enough that you could see why you might not be particularly worried about it. But as it happened, someone did see. And they wanted the Guardian to know.</p> \n<p>Could Dominic Cummings, the architect of the \u201cStay home\u201d campaign that every minister was imploring the nation to follow, really have gone to Durham?

      "bodyText": "The first inkling of the story that shook Downing Street to its core came at the beginning of April. It was the first Sunday of the month, a couple of hours before the Queen\u2019s stirring promise to the nation that, however hard it was to endure separation from our loved ones, \u201cwe will meet again\u201d. Boris Johnson was seriously ill, and that evening it would be announced that the prime minister had been admitted to hospital. As it would turn out, however, one of the most consequential news events of the day was one almost nobody knew about. The Guardian had been told that Dominic Cummings, the cartoon bogeyman of remain voters and the liberal left, was listening to Dancing Queen in his parents\u2019 front drive. The Cummings family property is on a fast-moving A road and almost completely hidden behind bushes. The chances of anyone spotting a special adviser enjoying a bit of Abba during quarantine \u2013 much less recognising him \u2013 were slim enough that you could see why you might not be particularly worried about it. But as it happened, someone did see. And they wanted the Guardian to know. Could Dominic Cummings, the architect of the \u201cStay home\u201d campaign that every minister was imploring the nation to follow, really have gone to Durham? The Guardian asked a straightforward question of No 10. The response was enough to make you wonder: \u201cIt\u2019ll be a no comment on that one. We wouldn\u2019t get into locations of individual members of staff.\u201d That oddly evasive reply warranted further investigation. And by the end of that week, there was enough corroborating detail to go back to Downing Street. A new set of questions about the senior adviser\u2019s locations, now loaded with specific details, was again met with a flat refusal to comment. It was Friday, 10 April. Exactly six weeks later, when the Guardian and Daily Mirror made a final approach for comment before that evening\u2019s publication, Downing Street would complain that they had not been given enough time. Over the intervening period, as hundreds more deaths were reported each day and the rest of the country wondered when the dull nightmare of lockdown would end, the story rushed forward and receded in unpredictable ways. The attempts to put the media off the scent, however, were not confined to gnomic remarks from Downing Street, which at one point had told another journalist that Cummings was \u201cat home\u201d. Cummings\u2019 wife, Mary Wakefield, wrote a piece for the Spectator (subscription) \u2013 which she also read out on Radio 4 \u2013 that was so artfully constructed that on a casual read it seemed to rule out the possibility that the family had left their home at all. And surely Cummings would think it foolish to write a sidebar to this article, reflecting on the same period, if the family idyll he described was more than 250 miles from home? On a second look, though, both articles were curiously devoid of geographical specifics, until Wakefield finally referred to the family \u201cemerging \u2026 into the almost comical uncertainty of London lockdown\u201d. The line implied they had been cocooned within the capital all along but, tantalisingly, stopped short of saying so outright. Downing Street\u2019s reticence to come clean was understandable. In early May, the government scientist Prof Neil Ferguson was forced to resign after the Daily Telegraph splashed on the revelation that his lover had visited him at home. Cabinet ministers jumped on the indiscretion, proclaiming he was right to quit. But the wriggling and obfuscation would come to a spectacular end \u2013 and from an unlikely source. In response to a question from the Mirror, with whom the Guardian had agreed to work, Durham police provided a statement confirming that the force had spoken to the family about Cummings\u2019 visit. At 8pm on 22 May, both newspapers published their stories. The internet was swiftly awash with indignation and calls for the special adviser to resign. Downing Street was still declining to speak to the Guardian on the record, while simultaneously providing other media with anonymous source quotes condemning the stories as \u201cfake news\u201d. Two of the country\u2019s most eminent behavioural scientists got the news as they ate dinner together last Friday night, and immediately recognised the gravity of what had been disclosed, not as a matter of political drama, but as a profound risk to public adherence to the lockdown rules. \u201cWe looked at each other and said: \u2018What is this?\u2019,\u201d said Robert West, a professor of health psychology at University College London, whose wife, Susan Michie, is director of the same university\u2019s Centre for Behaviour Change and a fellow attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies\u2019 behavioural sub-group. \u201cWe had a very strong sense right away that something was up,\u201d West said. \u201cThere were already concerns about how on earth we\u2019re going to move to the next phase when messaging trust is ebbing away. And then this was like a bombshell.\u201d The next morning, Downing Street provided the kind of detailed statement that the Guardian had been seeking for weeks. But it brought as much confusion as clarity. A spokesman confirmed the trip, saying that it was \u201cessential \u2026 to ensure his young child could be properly cared for\u201d. But it went on: \u201cAt no stage was he [Cummings] or his family spoken to by the police about this matter.\u201d That line \u2013 later justified by an explanation that a conversation with Cummings\u2019 father had been at his request and primarily about security matters rather than a breach of lockdown \u2013 is understood to have caused consternation at the Durham force, which found itself at the centre of a political storm, and was forced to reiterate that a conversation had indeed taken place. (Two days later, it would say that the call focused on security.) But amid cries for clarity, little further information was on offer. Cummings refused to let Downing Street issue a statement on his behalf, the Sunday Times reported, with one insider being quoted as saying: \u201cHe insisted on handling it all himself.\u201d If Downing Street had calculated that a stonewall strategy would make the story go away, they could hardly have been more wrong \u2013 thanks largely to a retired chemistry teacher. Robin Lees got in touch with the Guardian via email. \u201cJust read your report in the Guardian and straight away reminded of an experience in Barnard Castle where I live on April 12th this year,\u201d he wrote, before going on to describe his sighting of Cummings, and adding: \u201cI went home and told my wife, but we thought he must be in London.\u201d Lees had written down a number plate immediately, he added, and Googled it as soon as he got home \u2013 a claim corroborated by his search history. Hearing the transport secretary\u2019s attempt to justify the visit by saying that Cummings had hunkered down and had not moved around, Lees was indignant. \u201cSorry if this has led you off at a tangent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Grant Shapps kept saying he stayed in one place!\u201d After new stories were published by the Observer and Sunday Mirror that evening, featuring the Barnard Castle account as well as a separate allegation \u2013 consistently denied \u2013 of a later visit to the area, the \u201cstay put\u201d defence slid out of the government\u2019s story, to be replaced by a fierce critique of \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d. But if that was an attempt to define the subject as being one restricted to ideological left-wing interest, the response on Sunday and afterwards made it impossible to sustain. Led by the avowed Brexiter (and Cummings opponent) Steve Baker, Conservative MPs started to call for his resignation; with tens of thousands of angry messages sent by constituents, almost 50 more had done so by Friday. The Daily Mail published a ferocious splash on Monday morning, with the headline: WHAT PLANET ARE THEY ON? Meanwhile, TV and radio producers reported difficulty persuading all but a small cast of loyalists to defend Cummings\u2019 position on air, with one saying: \u201cQuite a lot of the usual suspects were actually furious about it. If you listened, the same people popped up again and again.\u201d Polls emerged showing a clear majority of the public felt the adviser had broken the rules, and ought to resign. It was time for the government to try a different approach: they promised us a rose garden. Like all good divas, Cummings came out to greet his audience on Downing Street\u2019s sunlit back lawn half an hour late. Despite the wait, his nearly unprecedented press conference drew a live TV audience of 5.5 million. In an extraordinary prepared statement, he laid out a complex story of difficult personal circumstances, ingenious and necessary solutions, and dismayingly compromised eyesight. Even as he spoke, though, there was little sense that the firestorm would abate. Steven Swinford, the deputy political editor of the Times, tweeted that cabinet ministers were unsatisfied: \u201cHe\u2019s saying he\u2019s so much more important than us plebs,\u201d one told him. Another concluded: \u201cWe\u2019re losing trust and confidence \u2013 it\u2019s draining away before our eyes.\u201d And there were oddities and inconsistencies even in the story that Cummings had set out in such extraordinary detail. Wakefield can drive, or at least could in 2000, when she wrote in a Spectator travel piece about a trip to Texas: \u201cI drove for an hour every morning, slaloming past the road-rage wrecks of battered trucks, up the 135 from Dallas to Denton.\u201d And if he had only gone to the \u201coutskirts\u201d of Barnard Castle, as he claimed, why had he been sighted parked up on the far side of the river from the route he was most likely to have taken? But such queries were unavailable to the journalists at the briefing, who, in line with normal Downing Street practice, had had to give up their phones before going in. The rose garden appearance did not calm the public mood \u2013 and, perhaps most troubling of all for a government seeking to have its messaging taken wholly seriously, stoked widespread ridicule. Memes abounded, including \u201cShould have gone to Barnard Castle\u201d riffs on the famous Specsavers ad. Staff could \u201chardly believe it\u201d, said Maria Sattar, the opthalmic director in the company\u2019s Barnard Castle branch, who noted that the spoofs \u201cgave us a chuckle\u201d. One Twitter account showed a page from Brewer\u2019s slang dictionary which, if real, said \u201cBarney Castle\u201d was existing slang for a \u201cpathetic excuse\u201d deriving from a 16th century general\u2019s refusal to leave his fortified position there to engage in battle. And the comedian Paddy McGuinness posted a reworked version of (Is This The Way To) Amarillo, concluding in a rousing chorus of \u201csha la la la la la bullshit\u201d. Durham\u2019s acting police and crime commissioner, Steve White, could sense the danger and urged the force to \u201cestablish the facts\u201d around the claims. He\u2019d been listening to the \u201cvox pops\u201d from Barnard Castle on the Sunday night news, not far from his home. \u201cWhen people think that we\u2019re fibbing, that we\u2019re under the thumb of No 10, that\u2019s when it starts to become an issue for me,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing that dismay and anger at what people were hearing \u2013 we have to demonstrate that whatever else is going on, they can trust Durham police. \u201cThat\u2019s when I had to act.\u201d That move eventually led the force to the conclusion on Thursday that Cummings may have committed a \u201cminor breach\u201d of the lockdown rules. By then, 100 or more Tory MPs had criticised Cummings or called for him to go; every ministerial briefing and interview had been dominated by the furore, and the government\u2019s poll ratings had tumbled under the weight of middle-England indignation. Yet Cummings was still in place. The more significant question, of what this will mean for public adherence to lockdown and the new test-and-trace system, is yet to be answered. West, the behavioural scientist, says that an earlier resignation or admission of culpability would have been far better, but that the situation could still, theoretically, be improved. \u201cIt\u2019s possible the damage will be mitigated by other people stepping in and saying: \u2018Don\u2019t do it for Cummings, do it for the community,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s like trying to climb an escalator when it\u2019s going down. It\u2019s not a question of whether lives will be lost now; it\u2019s a question of how many. But there is still some point in someone acting. Even too little too late can be enough, and in time.\u201d For the sources who took the chance of coming forward, meanwhile, there has been at least some sense of vindication. Lees received an unsigned postcard addressed to the \u201cRetired chemistry teacher\u201d of Barnard Castle. \u201cI presume this is for you,\u201d the postal worker told him. \u201cThank you for being so brave,\u201d the message read.",

      "body": "<p>Look around, survey the rubble and consider what damage has been done these last seven days. The government, the prime minister and the man who gives both their instructions have all degraded themselves. In the process, they have destroyed something that mattered more than any of them \u2013 something unspoken but precious.</p> <p>Start with the man who wrought this ruin. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/dominic-cummings-democracy-laws-truth-consequences\">Dominic Cummings</a> has ruled chiefly by fear, making Downing Street his personal \u201ccourt\u201d, according to one former minister. His power to intimidate derived from his status as the electorate whisperer, a man uniquely able to hear the vox populi, his brain tuned to the wavelength of the great British public when everyone in the SW1 bubble was stuck on the wrong frequency. Of course, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/brexit-the-uncivil-war-review-superficial-irresponsible-tv-cumberbatch\">Benedict Cumberbatch&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/brexit-the-uncivil-war-review-superficial-irresponsible-tv-cumberbatch\">TV depiction </a>only added to his lustre: politicians wilt before one of their own who acquires celebrity. For proof, look no further than the rise of Boris Johnson.</p> <p>So marvel at the irony that a man who made his name&nbsp;denouncing hypocritical Westminster elitism and its contempt for ordinary people is now the face of it. The king of data can spend this weekend crunching the numbers of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulBrandITV/status/1265385466079195136\">Daily Mail poll</a>&nbsp;that found him wholly out of step with the very public he was supposedly so gifted at reading: 66% think he should quit, 63% think he should be sacked, 78% don\u2019t believe a word of his yarn about driving to Barnard Castle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">to test his eyesight</a>. The electorate are not whispering now: they\u2019re yelling in his face.</p> <p>Even if he stays, whether for just six months, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-cummings/uk-pms-senior-adviser-cummings-considers-quitting-later-this-year-daily-mail-idUSKBN2343HU\">as he&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-cummings/uk-pms-senior-adviser-cummings-considers-quitting-later-this-year-daily-mail-idUSKBN2343HU\">reportedly intends</a>, or longer, he is diminished. Diminished morally, of course, not that the parliamentary Tory party will care about that, but also as a diviner of public sentiment. As of now, there is no one more out of touch with the great British public than him.</p> <p>The taint of Cummings\u2019 behaviour has spread to every <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/27/how-ministers-have-been-floundering-in-their-defence-of-dominic-cummings-video\">cabinet minister who defended him</a>, telling the nation that Dom\u2019s only crime was loving his family too much \u2013 and so implicitly telling every Briton who obeyed the rules that they loved their family too little. Each one of them is shrunk by this.</p> <p>Naturally, the politician most wounded is Johnson. He has insulted the very people who voted for him last December, whether one-time Labour voters or lifelong Tories. Anyone who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/cummings-contempt-lockdown-rules-public-catholic-church-ireland\">followed the rules</a> has reason to be livid. No wonder one Tory MP, a former minister, told me in despair this week: \u201cThis is a cabinet of fools led by a hollow narcissist who is nothing without his svengali.\u201d Some of those who glimpsed Johnson\u2019s physical&nbsp;mortality in April sense they\u2019ve seen his political mortality in May.</p> <p>For all that, the prime minister\u2019s defenders are adamant that he can ride it out. The government has a majority of 80 and it won\u2019t face the electorate again until 2024, by which time Barnard Castle will be on a multiple-choice pub quiz question, alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/26/why-not-go-to-specsavers-michael-gove-grilled-over-dominic-cummings-trip-video\">Specsavers</a> and Dollond &amp; Aitchison.</p> <p>That might be right, but it rests on an assumption that political memories fade. Usually they do, with only nerds and obsessives remembering most of the flaps that grip Westminster. But not always. Sometimes an event cuts through so sharply, it sculpts an image of a government in the public mind that never shifts.</p> <p>The exemplar is 1992. A matter of months after winning an election, John Major\u2019s government trashed its reputation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\">Black Wednesday</a> \u2013 and it remained trashed. Then, too, the Tories told themselves that they had five years to turn things around, but they were wrong. The economy improved, growth returned, but it made no difference. From Black Wednesday on, the government was in a slow-motion descent towards the abyss of 1997.</p> <p>It\u2019s no stretch to believe that this period will similarly define this government. If we hadn\u2019t been talking about bluebell woods this week, we would have been gripped instead by the fact that Britain now hovers between the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">highest and second-highest per capita death&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">rates</a> from Covid-19 in the world, with an excess deaths figure that in absolute terms is the highest in Europe and second only to Trump\u2019s America globally.</p> <p>You don\u2019t even have to relitigate the early decisions \u2013 the delayed lockdown, the release of infected patients from hospitals into care homes \u2013 that proved so fateful and fatal. You merely need to judge the government\u2019s performance right now. It could be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/boris-johnson-blundering-schoolboy-commons-liaison-committee-dominic-cummings\">flailing&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/boris-johnson-blundering-schoolboy-commons-liaison-committee-dominic-cummings\">and floundering of Johnson</a> before Wednesday\u2019s liaison committee of MPs, a prime minister clueless as to the policies of his own government, or Thursday\u2019s move to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/groups-up-to-six-people-allowed-meet-england-monday-coronavirus-lockdown-easing\">ease lockdown restrictions</a> even as the chief scientific adviser warned that new infections are coming at a rate of <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/28may2020\">54,000 per week</a>, a figure that, in his words, \u201curges caution\u201d.</p> <p>Which brings us to the real victims of Cummings\u2019 actions. Not him or his bosses and their political careers \u2013 but the British people.

      "bodyText": "Look around, survey the rubble and consider what damage has been done these last seven days. The government, the prime minister and the man who gives both their instructions have all degraded themselves. In the process, they have destroyed something that mattered more than any of them \u2013 something unspoken but precious. Start with the man who wrought this ruin. Dominic Cummings has ruled chiefly by fear, making Downing Street his personal \u201ccourt\u201d, according to one former minister. His power to intimidate derived from his status as the electorate whisperer, a man uniquely able to hear the vox populi, his brain tuned to the wavelength of the great British public when everyone in the SW1 bubble was stuck on the wrong frequency. Of course, that Benedict Cumberbatch TV depiction only added to his lustre: politicians wilt before one of their own who acquires celebrity. For proof, look no further than the rise of Boris Johnson. So marvel at the irony that a man who made his name denouncing hypocritical Westminster elitism and its contempt for ordinary people is now the face of it. The king of data can spend this weekend crunching the numbers of a Daily Mail poll that found him wholly out of step with the very public he was supposedly so gifted at reading: 66% think he should quit, 63% think he should be sacked, 78% don\u2019t believe a word of his yarn about driving to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight. The electorate are not whispering now: they\u2019re yelling in his face. Even if he stays, whether for just six months, as he reportedly intends, or longer, he is diminished. Diminished morally, of course, not that the parliamentary Tory party will care about that, but also as a diviner of public sentiment. As of now, there is no one more out of touch with the great British public than him. The taint of Cummings\u2019 behaviour has spread to every cabinet minister who defended him, telling the nation that Dom\u2019s only crime was loving his family too much \u2013 and so implicitly telling every Briton who obeyed the rules that they loved their family too little. Each one of them is shrunk by this. Naturally, the politician most wounded is Johnson. He has insulted the very people who voted for him last December, whether one-time Labour voters or lifelong Tories. Anyone who followed the rules has reason to be livid. No wonder one Tory MP, a former minister, told me in despair this week: \u201cThis is a cabinet of fools led by a hollow narcissist who is nothing without his svengali.\u201d Some of those who glimpsed Johnson\u2019s physical mortality in April sense they\u2019ve seen his political mortality in May. For all that, the prime minister\u2019s defenders are adamant that he can ride it out. The government has a majority of 80 and it won\u2019t face the electorate again until 2024, by which time Barnard Castle will be on a multiple-choice pub quiz question, alongside Specsavers and Dollond &amp; Aitchison. That might be right, but it rests on an assumption that political memories fade. Usually they do, with only nerds and obsessives remembering most of the flaps that grip Westminster. But not always. Sometimes an event cuts through so sharply, it sculpts an image of a government in the public mind that never shifts. The exemplar is 1992. A matter of months after winning an election, John Major\u2019s government trashed its reputation on Black Wednesday \u2013 and it remained trashed. Then, too, the Tories told themselves that they had five years to turn things around, but they were wrong. The economy improved, growth returned, but it made no difference. From Black Wednesday on, the government was in a slow-motion descent towards the abyss of 1997. It\u2019s no stretch to believe that this period will similarly define this government. If we hadn\u2019t been talking about bluebell woods this week, we would have been gripped instead by the fact that Britain now hovers between the highest and second-highest per capita death rates from Covid-19 in the world, with an excess deaths figure that in absolute terms is the highest in Europe and second only to Trump\u2019s America globally. You don\u2019t even have to relitigate the early decisions \u2013 the delayed lockdown, the release of infected patients from hospitals into care homes \u2013 that proved so fateful and fatal. You merely need to judge the government\u2019s performance right now. It could be the flailing and floundering of Johnson before Wednesday\u2019s liaison committee of MPs, a prime minister clueless as to the policies of his own government, or Thursday\u2019s move to ease lockdown restrictions even as the chief scientific adviser warned that new infections are coming at a rate of 54,000 per week, a figure that, in his words, \u201curges caution\u201d. Which brings us to the real victims of Cummings\u2019 actions. Not him or his bosses and their political careers \u2013 but the British people. What Cummings did wrecked public trust, turning us cynical about instructions from those in charge. Public trust is not merely a political commodity: in a pandemic, it is an essential public health resource. And now it has been badly depleted. So when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tells Britons it is their \u201ccivic duty\u201d to isolate if they\u2019re identified as a contact of someone who\u2019s tested positive, the natural impulse will be to laugh in his face. Civic duty indeed. Tell that to Cummings. Now an essential public health message has to be qualified and caveated to accommodate Cummings\u2019 behaviour. Isolate \u2013 unless your \u201cinstincts\u201d say otherwise. Isolate \u2013 unless childcare gets a bit tricky. It doesn\u2019t quite carry the same force, does it? It may be that, if it wants to be effective, the government should step aside and let others carry this message. No more Hancock or Johnson or Michael Gove. Let the instructions come from the NHS and NHS officials alone.

In addition, they will have to pay 10% of their wages in September. This will rise to 20% in October.</p> \n<p>Sunak said: \u201cWe stood behind Britain\u2019s businesses and workers as we came into this crisis and we stand behind them as we come through the other side.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining among the most generous in the world.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-29T15:24:22/embed.html\" data-alt=\"wages\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-29T15:24:22/embed.html\">wages</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The Treasury has also brought forward the date on which furloughed staff can be brought back part-time, to 1 July.

With social distancing guidelines likely to remain in force for the foreseeable future, however, many will have seen their previous business model shattered.

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak has confirmed the Treasury is to gradually withdraw its job retention scheme over the next five months, with businesses meeting 20% of the wage bill for their furloughed staff by October. Taxpayers have been meeting the wage bill for 8.4 million workers, at a cost of about \u00a314bn a month, since March. The scheme was aimed at preventing mass layoffs, as lockdown restrictions caused large parts of the economy to shut down. Employees have been receiving 80% of their usual wage, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month. One million firms are using the scheme, according to data released this week. Sunak said that from August, firms will have to pay employer national insurance and pension contributions for staff they continue to keep on furlough. In addition, they will have to pay 10% of their wages in September. This will rise to 20% in October. Sunak said: \u201cWe stood behind Britain\u2019s businesses and workers as we came into this crisis and we stand behind them as we come through the other side. \u201cNow, as we begin to reopen our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining among the most generous in the world.\u201d The Treasury has also brought forward the date on which furloughed staff can be brought back part-time, to 1 July. Business groups had pressed for the change, as rule changes mean some sectors can reopen \u2013 including non-essential retail on 15 June, for example. Firms will only be able to apply for the job retention scheme or furlough additional employees until 30 June. Presenting Friday\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Sunak also announced self-employed workers whose income has been hit by the crisis would be able to claim a second grant. Those who qualified for the Treasury\u2019s self-employment income support scheme would be able to apply for another payment, calculated as 70% of their monthly profits, up to a ceiling of \u00a36,570. The first round of payments were based on 80% of monthly profits. Some sectors are tentatively reopening as lockdown restrictions are eased. With social distancing guidelines likely to remain in force for the foreseeable future, however, many will have seen their previous business model shattered. As the furlough scheme tapers away, they will face tough decisions about whether to keep staff on the payroll. Sunak warned on Friday that \u201cnot everything will look the same as before\u201d. He said: \u201cIt won\u2019t be the case that we can simply put the key in the lock, open the door and step into the world as it was in January.\u201d \u201cI do want to acknowledge that we haven\u2019t been able to support everyone in the exact way they would want. I understand some people have felt frustrated, but you were not and have not been forgotten.\u201d Business groups and trades unions welcomed the changes to the scheme.

We have to enable businesses to develop new products and build back demand while holding on to the skilled workforce that they have invested in over the years,\u201d he said. Shadow Chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: \u201cThe chancellor must publish the evidence behind these decisions to provide reassurance that his proposals won\u2019t cause an additional spike in unemployment, and an even more difficult economic recovery from this crisis.\u201d Sunak has previously warned the UK faces a \u201csevere recession like no other\u201d.

      "bodyText": "French and Belgian police believe they have smashed an international people-smuggling network involved in the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants whose bodies were found in a refrigerated trailer in the UK last October. Officers have arrested 26 people in coordinated raids in several locations in the two countries after keeping the gang under surveillance for several months. Detectives say the network continued to operate after the tragedy last autumn and even through France\u2019s strict eight-week coronavirus lockdown using taxis to ferry the migrants to Channel ports. In Belgium, 13 individuals \u2013 11 Vietnamese and two Moroccan nationals \u2013 appeared before a judge on Friday. All were charged with \u201ctrafficking human beings in aggravated circumstances, membership of a criminal organisation and forgery\u201d and 11 were remanded in custody. In France, a further 13 suspects were still being questioned by police on Friday. The bodies of 31 men and eight women from Vietnam \u2013 10 of them teenagers, the youngest aged 15 \u2013 were found in a container parked near an industrial estate at Grays in Essex on 23 October last year. The container had been shipped from the Belgian port of Zeebrugge. They had all died from asphyxia and hypothermia. The driver who picked up the trailer, Maurice Robinson, 25, was among five people arrested in connection with the deaths. Robinson, of Craigavon, County Armagh, Northern Ireland admitted conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and at a hearing at the Old Bailey pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter. The other defendants face trial in October. French investigators say they tracked the smugglers\u2019 route from Bierne in the north of France to Belgium. Each of the victims had paid up to \u20ac35,000 (\u00a332,000) in total to make the journey from Vietnam to the UK. \u201cThis criminal organisation is suspected of having organised the transfer of illegal migrants \u2013 mostly Vietnamese \u2013 through Belgium and France to the United Kingdom,\u201d Europol said in a statement. The Belgian federal prosecutors added: \u201cThe network set up by the smugglers appears to have transported several dozen people every day for several months.\u201d In France, investigators say they tracked the movements of the dead migrants using GPS signals from mobile phones. Most of those arrested in France are also Vietnamese or French, and are believed to have housed the migrants in the Paris area before transporting them north in taxis whose drivers are also believed to be part of the network. During the lockdown the smugglers are reported to have hidden small groups of three or four people inside lorry cabs crossing the Channel. A police source told Le Parisien newspaper the smuggling network stopped for a short while after the deaths were revealed, but restarted \u201ca few months later\u201d. The investigation involved police from Belgium, France, Ireland and the UK as well as officers from Europol and Eurojust. During the nine-hour crossing from Zeebrugge to Purfleet, where it docked at around 12.30am, Pham Thi Tra My sent her mother a text message to say she was suffocating: \u201cMy trip to a foreign country has failed,\u201d she wrote, before sending a final message: \u201cI love you so much.

In Munich, they are taking al fresco seats to follow the adventures of a communist kangaroo with a penchant for boozy chocolates, and in Prague they are witnessing a croaky vigilante work out some profound childhood traumas. As Europe begins to stir from its Covid-19 lockdown, people bloated by two-month boxset binges have a new way to feed their entertainment needs as they emerge, blinking, into the daylight. Or, rather, the twilight. Open-air cinemas in Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic and Greece have re-opened in recent days, albeit at reduced capacity and with the novel strictures of physical distancing. The Autocine Madrid Race drive-in welcomed 200 customers back on Wednesday night with a screening of John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John\u2019s appropriately escapist and nostalgic paean to 1950s high school life. In normal times, the outdoor cinema screens films for 1,500 people at a time, but its co-founder, Cristina Porta, isn\u2019t complaining. \u201cIt\u2019s been very, very good this week and we\u2019ve have a very warm welcome back,\u201d she said. \u201cOur customers were mad keen to get back and the demand has been huge.

Open-air cinemas in Greece will reopen on 1 June, operating at 40% capacity and with the use of masks and hand sanitiser recommended for customers. One of Prague\u2019s most evocative sites, the ghostly half-abandoned Strahov stadium perched on a hill above the Czech capital\u2019s tourist attractions, has become the centrepiece for the revival of drive-in cinemas in the city. It has fallen into disrepair since the 1989 velvet revolution triggered the downfall of the communist regime in what was then Czechoslovakia and has since served as a football training ground and occasional concert venue. While the Czech Republic\u2019s indoor cinemas were still closed it staged the 2008 Batman film, The Dark Knight, on 12 May after Prague city council, the venue\u2019s owner, gave permission for a parking area to be turned into a makeshift movie theatre with capacity for 120 cars.

The numbers were either provided in response to the Guardian\u2019s request for figures, or in statements MPs had released to constituents.</p> \n<p>Johnson has repeatedly suggested it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/explain-apologise-move-on-johnson-statement-dominic-cummings\">time to \u201cmove on\u201d</a> from the Cummings row, despite about half of Tory backbenchers \u2013 more than 100 MPs \u2013 calling for his most senior aide to resign or be sacked, or criticising Cummings. Many said they were motivated by their constituents\u2019 anger.</p> \n<p>On Friday evening Theresa May added her voice to the Tories criticising Cummings. In a statement to constituents of her Maidenhead seat, the former prime minister said she could \u201cwell understand the [public\u2019s] anger\u201d towards Johnson\u2019s senior adviser.</p> \n<p>\u201cI do not feel that Mr Cummings followed the spirit of the guidance,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"be18dd0b-fce5-4ad6-b1fd-2ec4fa645bc9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cTXBS_lioPQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Several Conservative MPs in marginal seats said they had received more than 1,000 emails about Cummings, in some cases dwarfing their majority. While the average number of emails each MP got was 271, the Tory MPs analysed by the Guardian received 590 each on average.</p> \n<p>Many MPs said the emails were from people writing to them for the first time and not the common copy-and-paste messages on a campaigning issue, and for some it has been the most significant volume since the Brexit crisis in parliament.</p> \n<p>Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, who was among the first to say Cummings\u2019 job was no longer tenable, said: \u201cI\u2019ve had between 700 and 800 emails, and half of those are constituents, half of those are from other people. About 85% are critical [of him], and 15% think I\u2019m the devil incarnate.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot one has been computer-generated, they are all individual observations. This is not about Brexit, or a Labour party campaign, none of this is orchestrated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Richard Fuller, Tory MP for North East Bedfordshire, wrote to constituents: \u201cI have been struck by just how many emails I have received from constituents about the actions taken by Mr Cummings and the strength of sentiment.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost emails contained strong criticisms.&nbsp;The words used by constituents to express their feeling \u2013 \u2018disgust\u2019, \u2018incensed\u2019, \u2018disgraceful\u2019, \u2018shameful\u2019, \u2018anger\u2019 \u2013 convey clearly how deeply hurtful this revelation has been for them.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany constituents included personal stories of sacrifice and loss; a number sharing the searing pain of bereavement in this extraordinary period of isolation and confinement.&nbsp;I have read fully each of the emails sent to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe explanation of this human dilemma has not been communicated in such a manner as to heal the hurt that has been felt.&nbsp;An apology is not always needed as a concession that you did something wrong but sometimes to show that you understand the pain to others that may have been caused.\u201d</p> \n<p>Diana Johnson, Labour MP for Hull North since 2005, said: \u201cOther than Brexit, this is the biggest postbag I\u2019ve had for many years. And it\u2019s still coming in.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Polling suggests most people were unconvinced by Cummings\u2019 explanation of his movements, delivered in a hastily arranged press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on Monday.</p> \n<p>A YouGov poll taken afterwards showed 71% of respondents thought he had broken the rules; the row also appears to have dented the Conservatives\u2019 poll lead over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/tories-shires-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-coronavirus-dominic-cummings\">Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party</a>.</p> \n<p>Among the Conservatives receiving more than 1,000 emails about Cummings were Alex Chalk, MP for Cheltenham, who has a majority of 981; Stephen Hammond, MP for Wimbledon, whose majority is 628; and Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and and Kincardine, with a majority of 843.</p> \n<p>Not all of the correspondence was negative, although many MPs said their mailbox was overwhelmingly weighted towards criticism of the adviser.</p> \n<p>Stewart Wood, a Labour peer and Oxford University fellow teaching politics, said the crisis had touched a nerve akin to the MPs\u2019 expenses revelations. \u201cThe real worry for government is when something that they do politicises people who normally wouldn\u2019t ever write to their MP about something like this, who never really engage in politics,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI worked for Gordon Brown for 10 years and the equivalent issue was the expenses crisis. In terms of the nerve it has touched and the kind of people who are responding, it feels a lot like [that].\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI think what\u2019s happened is our daily lives are dominated by what\u2019s coming out of No 10.&nbsp;So we\u2019re hanging on the words of the prime minister and his top team in a way that you normally would never ever get, and that does bring politics into your life much more vividly. So people then inspect the credentials of the people doing that in a much greater way.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe thing that makes this so poisonous for Boris Johnson and the top team is that we\u2019re in this incredibly unusual crisis moment where everything the government does relies on our trust, because everything they do is essentially asking us to change our behaviour. And that requires faith in the integrity and the authority of the government.\u201d</p> \n<p>One Tory MP said they had received 400 emails, mostly against Cummings. In the Tory stronghold of the south-west, Selaine Saxby, MP for North Devon, was hit with 800 messages and Cherilyn Mackrory, of Truro and Falmouth, said she had received nearly 1,000.</p> \n<p>Elliot Colburn, 27, the Conservative MP representing the marginal Carshalton and Wallington seat, wrote to Johnson to say he had received more emails on this issue than any other. He said \u201cmany hundreds of messages from concerned constituents\u201d had called on Cummings to resign.</p> \n<p>At the other end of the UK, the leader of the Scottish National party in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said he had received more than 1,000 emails. \u201cAt the peak I was getting one email a minute.

      "bodyText": "The furore over Dominic Cummings\u2019 breach of lockdown rules has prompted tens of thousands of people to flood their MPs\u2019 inboxes in what some described as the biggest outpouring since Brexit, a Guardian analysis has found. As Boris Johnson tried to draw a line under the crisis involving his chief adviser, constituents across the country sent missives to their MPs, with many sharing stories of their own lockdown hardships. A Guardian analysis covering 117 MPs found they have received a total of 31,738 emails since a joint Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation a week ago divulged that Cummings had travelled to County Durham and taken a trip to a beauty spot with his family after suffering coronavirus symptoms. If that level of correspondence was reflected across all 650 MPs, it would suggest the revelations may have sparked as many as 180,000 items of correspondence. The numbers were either provided in response to the Guardian\u2019s request for figures, or in statements MPs had released to constituents. Johnson has repeatedly suggested it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Cummings row, despite about half of Tory backbenchers \u2013 more than 100 MPs \u2013 calling for his most senior aide to resign or be sacked, or criticising Cummings. Many said they were motivated by their constituents\u2019 anger. On Friday evening Theresa May added her voice to the Tories criticising Cummings. In a statement to constituents of her Maidenhead seat, the former prime minister said she could \u201cwell understand the [public\u2019s] anger\u201d towards Johnson\u2019s senior adviser. \u201cI do not feel that Mr Cummings followed the spirit of the guidance,\u201d she said. Several Conservative MPs in marginal seats said they had received more than 1,000 emails about Cummings, in some cases dwarfing their majority. While the average number of emails each MP got was 271, the Tory MPs analysed by the Guardian received 590 each on average. Many MPs said the emails were from people writing to them for the first time and not the common copy-and-paste messages on a campaigning issue, and for some it has been the most significant volume since the Brexit crisis in parliament. Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, who was among the first to say Cummings\u2019 job was no longer tenable, said: \u201cI\u2019ve had between 700 and 800 emails, and half of those are constituents, half of those are from other people. About 85% are critical [of him], and 15% think I\u2019m the devil incarnate. \u201cNot one has been computer-generated, they are all individual observations. This is not about Brexit, or a Labour party campaign, none of this is orchestrated.\u201d Richard Fuller, Tory MP for North East Bedfordshire, wrote to constituents: \u201cI have been struck by just how many emails I have received from constituents about the actions taken by Mr Cummings and the strength of sentiment. \u201cMost emails contained strong criticisms. The words used by constituents to express their feeling \u2013 \u2018disgust\u2019, \u2018incensed\u2019, \u2018disgraceful\u2019, \u2018shameful\u2019, \u2018anger\u2019 \u2013 convey clearly how deeply hurtful this revelation has been for them. \u201cMany constituents included personal stories of sacrifice and loss; a number sharing the searing pain of bereavement in this extraordinary period of isolation and confinement. I have read fully each of the emails sent to me.\u201d He added: \u201cThe explanation of this human dilemma has not been communicated in such a manner as to heal the hurt that has been felt. An apology is not always needed as a concession that you did something wrong but sometimes to show that you understand the pain to others that may have been caused.\u201d Diana Johnson, Labour MP for Hull North since 2005, said: \u201cOther than Brexit, this is the biggest postbag I\u2019ve had for many years. And it\u2019s still coming in.\u201d Polling suggests most people were unconvinced by Cummings\u2019 explanation of his movements, delivered in a hastily arranged press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on Monday. A YouGov poll taken afterwards showed 71% of respondents thought he had broken the rules; the row also appears to have dented the Conservatives\u2019 poll lead over Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party. Among the Conservatives receiving more than 1,000 emails about Cummings were Alex Chalk, MP for Cheltenham, who has a majority of 981; Stephen Hammond, MP for Wimbledon, whose majority is 628; and Andrew Bowie, the MP for West Aberdeenshire and and Kincardine, with a majority of 843. Not all of the correspondence was negative, although many MPs said their mailbox was overwhelmingly weighted towards criticism of the adviser. Stewart Wood, a Labour peer and Oxford University fellow teaching politics, said the crisis had touched a nerve akin to the MPs\u2019 expenses revelations. \u201cThe real worry for government is when something that they do politicises people who normally wouldn\u2019t ever write to their MP about something like this, who never really engage in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked for Gordon Brown for 10 years and the equivalent issue was the expenses crisis. In terms of the nerve it has touched and the kind of people who are responding, it feels a lot like [that].\u201d He added: \u201cI think what\u2019s happened is our daily lives are dominated by what\u2019s coming out of No 10. So we\u2019re hanging on the words of the prime minister and his top team in a way that you normally would never ever get, and that does bring politics into your life much more vividly. So people then inspect the credentials of the people doing that in a much greater way. \u201cThe thing that makes this so poisonous for Boris Johnson and the top team is that we\u2019re in this incredibly unusual crisis moment where everything the government does relies on our trust, because everything they do is essentially asking us to change our behaviour. And that requires faith in the integrity and the authority of the government.\u201d One Tory MP said they had received 400 emails, mostly against Cummings. In the Tory stronghold of the south-west, Selaine Saxby, MP for North Devon, was hit with 800 messages and Cherilyn Mackrory, of Truro and Falmouth, said she had received nearly 1,000. Elliot Colburn, 27, the Conservative MP representing the marginal Carshalton and Wallington seat, wrote to Johnson to say he had received more emails on this issue than any other. He said \u201cmany hundreds of messages from concerned constituents\u201d had called on Cummings to resign. At the other end of the UK, the leader of the Scottish National party in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said he had received more than 1,000 emails. \u201cAt the peak I was getting one email a minute. It\u2019s easily more than 1,000,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow, said she had had 117 emails, with \u201cso many powerful stories of sacrifice\u201d. One of her constituents wrote to say how her mother had died alone of Covid-19 in Sunderland on 8 April and \u201cevery instinct\u201d in her body had told to go to be with her for her final moments, but she had abided by the government\u2019s rules. The Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, Neil Coyle, said he had received 227 emails, only one in support of Cummings. He said: \u201cThey are all unique and many are very sad as they explain their anger based on what they\u2019ve been through \u2013 including missing relatives at the end of life.\u201d Chris Bryant, Labour MP for the Rhondda, said he had received 20 messages a day and has had a constituent tell him he now has no intention of abiding by the lockdown rules since Cummings\u2019 drive to Durham and later to Barnard Castle. \u2022 This article was amended on 30 May 2020.

      "body": "<p>Paying workers up to \u00a32,500 a month to kick their heels at home doesn\u2019t come cheap. The cost to the exchequer of paying 80% of the wage bill for furloughed staff is one of the factors likely to push state borrowing to record peacetime levels this year.</p> <p>Yet getting shot of the scheme is proving mighty hard for the government. Speculation that Rishi Sunak would make companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/rishi-sunak-to-taper-furlough-scheme-forcing-employers-to-pay-20-of-wages\">pay 20% of the wages</a> of furloughed employees from August proved to be wide of the mark. Instead, the chancellor has opted for a much more cautious, step-by-step approach, and at the same time extended support to the self-employed for a further three months.</p> <p>The two measures speak volumes about his view of Britain\u2019s likely pace of recovery from the Covid-19 lockdown.</p> <p>Originally, both the furlough and the self-employed schemes were meant to last for three months. Now the former runs until the end of October, the latter until August. Clearly, Sunak thinks recovery will be long and hard. There will be no rapid snap back in activity, no V-shaped recession.</p> <p>Instead, companies that are only slowly returning to normal will be given the flexibility to allow furloughed employees to come back to work, even if it is for just one day a week or a few hours a day. The downside of this flexibility is the risk of fraud: firms claiming staff are furloughed when they are working.</p> <p>But this was just one of the tough choices Sunak had to make. On the one hand, he didn\u2019t want to make the scheme so generous that firms would continue furloughing workers for longer than they needed too.</p> <p>On the other hand, he knows that there are some extremely vulnerable sectors of the economy, such as hospitality, that would find it impossible to pay anything like 20% of the wage bill in current circumstances. The fear was that if these firms were asked to pay too much too quickly there would be a massive surge in unemployment over the coming months. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has estimated there were <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/comment/three-big-decisions-for-the-chancellor-on-the-future-of-the-job-retention-scheme/\">2.5 million people employed</a> in the hardest hit sectors of the economy.

      "bodyText": "Paying workers up to \u00a32,500 a month to kick their heels at home doesn\u2019t come cheap. The cost to the exchequer of paying 80% of the wage bill for furloughed staff is one of the factors likely to push state borrowing to record peacetime levels this year. Yet getting shot of the scheme is proving mighty hard for the government. Speculation that Rishi Sunak would make companies pay 20% of the wages of furloughed employees from August proved to be wide of the mark. Instead, the chancellor has opted for a much more cautious, step-by-step approach, and at the same time extended support to the self-employed for a further three months. The two measures speak volumes about his view of Britain\u2019s likely pace of recovery from the Covid-19 lockdown. Originally, both the furlough and the self-employed schemes were meant to last for three months. Now the former runs until the end of October, the latter until August. Clearly, Sunak thinks recovery will be long and hard. There will be no rapid snap back in activity, no V-shaped recession. Instead, companies that are only slowly returning to normal will be given the flexibility to allow furloughed employees to come back to work, even if it is for just one day a week or a few hours a day. The downside of this flexibility is the risk of fraud: firms claiming staff are furloughed when they are working. But this was just one of the tough choices Sunak had to make. On the one hand, he didn\u2019t want to make the scheme so generous that firms would continue furloughing workers for longer than they needed too. On the other hand, he knows that there are some extremely vulnerable sectors of the economy, such as hospitality, that would find it impossible to pay anything like 20% of the wage bill in current circumstances. The fear was that if these firms were asked to pay too much too quickly there would be a massive surge in unemployment over the coming months. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has estimated there were 2.5 million people employed in the hardest hit sectors of the economy. Adding them all to the dole queues would leave official unemployment nudging 5 million. Once the chancellor decided against a sector-by-sector approach he had little choice but to crank up employer contributions slowly. He has decided that all firms will need to start paying something from the start of August, whether they are open or not. As things stand, it doesn\u2019t look as if many consumer-facing businesses in the retailing and hospitality sectors will be fully out of lockdown by then, but they will still be expected to pay employer national insurance contributions and pension contributions for furloughed workers. The Treasury pointed out that these amount to a fraction \u2013 about 5% \u2013 of the gross employment costs the employer would have faced had the furlough scheme not been in place. In September the Treasury will pay 70% of a furloughed workers wages and in October \u2013 the last month of the scheme \u2013 it will pay 60%. Once NICs and pension contributions are included, employers will pay 14% of gross employment costs in September and 23% in October. Yet the Office for National Statistics reported this week that 58% of firms that had paused trading had cash reserves of less than six months, and 7% had no reserves at all. Many of these businesses were operating on wafer-thin margins even before Covid-19, and they will find it even tougher to make money with social distancing rules in place. Even finding 5% might be enough to tip plenty of them over the edge.",

Before long, flames licked up the front of the building. A huge cheer went up. Someone let off fireworks.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo justice, no peace,\u201d came the cry. \u201cFuck the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there were no police in sight. A large area around the 3rd precinct, including the Minnehaha shopping mall and streets of businesses, was effectively under the control of the protesters without challenge overnight on Thursday.</p> \n<p>By the time the empty police station went up in flames, a handful of other buildings around it were already well ablaze. Others were comprehensively looted as outrage over Floyd\u2019s death drew a widespread peaceful protest to demand justice \u2013 in particular the arrest of the officers involved \u2013 and an outpouring of anger that turned to destruction.</p> \n<p>\u201cDamn right I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Brian Long, an African American man who worked as a mechanic until the coronavirus cut his job. \u201cThat cop suffocated George Floyd right there on camera for everyone to see. It was like strangling him with his bare hands. He knew people were watching. He knew he was being filmed.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe carried on because he had that mindset that the police can kill us and there ain\u2019t nothing we can do about it. Fuck the police.\u201d</p> \n<p>Melvin Carter, the mayor of St Paul, which neighbours Minneapolis and saw its own unrest, tweeted an appeal to end the violence and to \u201ckeep the focus on George Floyd \u2026 and on preventing this from ever happening again\u201d. But many of the protesters were not in the mood.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"877b9c6d-7c9c-4a97-827a-1b9af0c16314\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iwPPqDryPO8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Buildings burned across Minneapolis and St Paul late into the night, but the area around the 3rd precinct station felt different. Highly unusually, the police retreated entirely and left it to the protesters.</p> \n<p>Jacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, had said property wasn\u2019t worth dying for, and sought to avoid the kind of face-off between police and protesters that escalated confrontations and deaths during similar protests, such as in Ferguson six years ago, following the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer.</p> \n<p>It was a different story 15 minutes\u2019 drive away in St Paul, where the police fired rubber bullets and teargas to disperse a crowd of several hundred people attempting to break into another Target store. But that did not work either.</p> \n<p>As the mood worsened, groups broke away to attack other buildings, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store, which were set on fire.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f211650e0b38a4df627f4ad9af19f7e7f89abe70\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f211650e0b38a4df627f4ad9af19f7e7f89abe70/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flames rise from the police station.

Groups of young white people dressed in black spray-painted slogans denouncing the police, capitalism and corporate power.</p> \n<p>The warnings about social distancing because of coronavirus fell apart as the crowd swelled, but many discovered that their Covid-19 masks were also useful for shielding their identities.</p> \n<p>A few hours earlier, hundreds of people set off for downtown on a peaceful protest march, chanting demands for justice, and carrying signs that read \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!!\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d. The marchers were accompanied by a large skull on a bike wearing a police hat.</p> \n<p>Other protesters stayed behind to hold a rally outside the police station. After several speeches about continuing racial injustice in America, and how the lessons from police killings of African American men rarely seem to be applied, a tussle broke out over whether attacks on buildings were a legitimate form of protest.</p> \n<p>An older generation of speakers said it would distract from the demands for justice for Floyd. That racists would use it to justify police violence.</p> \n<p>Kim Edwards, an African American man, appealed to people to stop the looting. He said the lesson of the past was to use economic boycotts to bring about change, because the political system responds to money. Destroying the shops people need only hurts the community, he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>As the mood worsened, groups attacked other buildings, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cOur power is in our pocketbook, not burning down the buildings we need,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Others disagreed.

A pawn shop was completely gutted. Others had what people wanted. A liquor store. A tobacco shop.</p> \n<p>The stripping of the Target store went on into the early hours of Friday morning. A steady stream of people waded through inches of water from the sprinklers set off by fires. By dawn, it had been plundered of everything from clothes to furniture and medicine. Water, soft drinks and snacks taken from the shelves were distributed free to protesters at a pop-up market in the car park.</p> \n<p>Wade Chen spent the night defending his family\u2019s laundry business next door to a looted convenience store and two badly damaged schools, although that did not stop a woman from smashing a window.</p> \n<p>\u201cDoing this hurts our community.

But the military did not appear, and the few police officers who showed their faces were there to accompany firefighters working around the edges to ensure fires did not spread to residential neighbourhoods.</p> \n<p>As dawn broke on Friday morning, buildings still smouldered and burned, but the crowds were gone and the police were back. A few in riot gear blocked main roads into the area around the 3rd precinct. It did not look likely to deter another day and night of protest.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The moment the convoy of police cars crashed through the locked gates out of Minneapolis\u2019s 3rd precinct station and made a dash for safety, the crowd knew that the area was theirs. Young men climbed on to barriers police had erected in a futile attempt to protect the station, and chanted the name of the African American man whose death at the hands of a white officer from the precinct had set in motion furious protests across Minneapolis and in cities across the country. George Floyd. The chant swept the crowd as protesters piled up debris inside the station and set it on fire. Before long, flames licked up the front of the building. A huge cheer went up. Someone let off fireworks. \u201cNo justice, no peace,\u201d came the cry. \u201cFuck the police.\u201d But there were no police in sight. A large area around the 3rd precinct, including the Minnehaha shopping mall and streets of businesses, was effectively under the control of the protesters without challenge overnight on Thursday. By the time the empty police station went up in flames, a handful of other buildings around it were already well ablaze. Others were comprehensively looted as outrage over Floyd\u2019s death drew a widespread peaceful protest to demand justice \u2013 in particular the arrest of the officers involved \u2013 and an outpouring of anger that turned to destruction. \u201cDamn right I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Brian Long, an African American man who worked as a mechanic until the coronavirus cut his job. \u201cThat cop suffocated George Floyd right there on camera for everyone to see. It was like strangling him with his bare hands. He knew people were watching. He knew he was being filmed. \u201cHe carried on because he had that mindset that the police can kill us and there ain\u2019t nothing we can do about it. Fuck the police.\u201d Melvin Carter, the mayor of St Paul, which neighbours Minneapolis and saw its own unrest, tweeted an appeal to end the violence and to \u201ckeep the focus on George Floyd \u2026 and on preventing this from ever happening again\u201d. But many of the protesters were not in the mood. Buildings burned across Minneapolis and St Paul late into the night, but the area around the 3rd precinct station felt different. Highly unusually, the police retreated entirely and left it to the protesters. Jacob Frey, the Minneapolis mayor, had said property wasn\u2019t worth dying for, and sought to avoid the kind of face-off between police and protesters that escalated confrontations and deaths during similar protests, such as in Ferguson six years ago, following the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer. It was a different story 15 minutes\u2019 drive away in St Paul, where the police fired rubber bullets and teargas to disperse a crowd of several hundred people attempting to break into another Target store. But that did not work either. As the mood worsened, groups broke away to attack other buildings, including a health clinic, restaurants and a phone store, which were set on fire. As word spread that the 3rd precinct was now a police-free zone, thousands more people poured in from across the city to protest, to loot, just to watch. Groups of young white people dressed in black spray-painted slogans denouncing the police, capitalism and corporate power. The warnings about social distancing because of coronavirus fell apart as the crowd swelled, but many discovered that their Covid-19 masks were also useful for shielding their identities. A few hours earlier, hundreds of people set off for downtown on a peaceful protest march, chanting demands for justice, and carrying signs that read \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!!\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump\u201d. The marchers were accompanied by a large skull on a bike wearing a police hat. Other protesters stayed behind to hold a rally outside the police station. After several speeches about continuing racial injustice in America, and how the lessons from police killings of African American men rarely seem to be applied, a tussle broke out over whether attacks on buildings were a legitimate form of protest. An older generation of speakers said it would distract from the demands for justice for Floyd. That racists would use it to justify police violence. Kim Edwards, an African American man, appealed to people to stop the looting. He said the lesson of the past was to use economic boycotts to bring about change, because the political system responds to money. Destroying the shops people need only hurts the community, he said. \u201cOur power is in our pocketbook, not burning down the buildings we need,\u201d he said. Others disagreed. To them, Floyd\u2019s death was symptomatic of the whole range of injustices that minorities and poor Americans live with. And corporate America is part of that, too. A young African American woman said people should look to the Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict nearly 30 years ago. \u201cBurn this bitch down,\u201d she shouted. A man snatched the microphone back and admonished her. \u201cWe ain\u2019t going to burn nothing down. We don\u2019t need no foolishness at the microphone,\u201d he said. But another young woman immediately stepped up. \u201cWhen we were protesting peacefully, nothing gets done,\u201d she said. The crowd was with her. Others used spray-paint to make their point. Graffiti covered the area. \u201cPolice murdered George.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!!!\u201d \u201cEverything for everybody.\u201d Some of the burned buildings appeared to be the kind to draw resentment. A pawn shop was completely gutted. Others had what people wanted. A liquor store. A tobacco shop. The stripping of the Target store went on into the early hours of Friday morning. A steady stream of people waded through inches of water from the sprinklers set off by fires. By dawn, it had been plundered of everything from clothes to furniture and medicine. Water, soft drinks and snacks taken from the shelves were distributed free to protesters at a pop-up market in the car park. Wade Chen spent the night defending his family\u2019s laundry business next door to a looted convenience store and two badly damaged schools, although that did not stop a woman from smashing a window. \u201cDoing this hurts our community. People have to wash their clothes, they have to shop. Where are they going to go when they don\u2019t have transportation?\u201d Some owners painted \u201cminority owned\u201d on to the windows in the hopes of discouraging attacks, and that appeared to be enough in many cases. A man stood outside a store near the Target, telling anyone who came near that the business was owned by Somalis. People nodded and moved on. Every now and again, word swept through parts of the crowd that the national guard had arrived, and a stampede would begin before quickly fizzling out. But the military did not appear, and the few police officers who showed their faces were there to accompany firefighters working around the edges to ensure fires did not spread to residential neighbourhoods. As dawn broke on Friday morning, buildings still smouldered and burned, but the crowds were gone and the police were back. A few in riot gear blocked main roads into the area around the 3rd precinct. It did not look likely to deter another day and night of protest.",

      "body": "<p>The UK government released more than 50 documents on Friday \u2013 including the minutes of 34 meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The documents set out how scientists tracked \u2013 and reacted to \u2013 the pandemic. By mid-March, a sense of panic was setting in.</p> <h2>22 January \u2013 Poor data from China</h2> <p>In the first Sage meeting responding to the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, the committee agrees there is considerable uncertainty around the data coming out of China, meaning \u201ca reasonable worst case cannot be made reliably\u201d.</p> <h2>28 January \u2013 Test ready by end of week</h2> <p>The committee says a test for coronavirus should be ready by the end of the week, with a capacity to run 400 to 500 tests per day. It agrees on the importance of behavioural science informing policy.&nbsp;</p> <h2>3 February \u2013 Sage rejects travel restrictions</h2> <p>The committee considers imposing restrictions on travel into the UK. It concludes that reducing imported infections by 50% would maybe delay the onset of any epidemic in the UK by about five days. \u201cOnly a month of additional preparation time for the NHS would be meaningful.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <h2>&nbsp;5 February \u2013 Nervtag recommends masks</h2> <p>Nervtag (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) recommends symptomatic people should be encouraged to wear a surgical face mask, \u201cproviding that it can be tolerated\u201d. Sage agrees that shutting down public transport or restricting public gatherings would \u201cprobably be ineffective\u201d in delaying the spread of the virus.</p> <h2>6 February \u2013 Sage extends self-isolation guidance</h2> <p>The virus is in the UK and Sage notes that a third person, a man who had recently visited Singapore, had tested positive for coronavirus. It now advises that those who have travelled from Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau and are showing symptoms self-isolate.</p> <h2>11 February \u2013 Prediction that mass testing will end</h2> <p>Sage predicts an eventual end for any attempt at mass testing and contact tracing, saying it is not possible for the UK to accelerate coronavirus testing capacity alongside regular flu testing. It recommendeds that Public Health England establishes a criteria for when \u201ccontact tracing is no longer worthwhile\u201d.</p> <h2>13 February \u2013 Prediction that stockpiling could be an issue</h2> <p>Sage hears that \u201cscepticism and general inaction dominate\u201d among the general public and will continue to do so until the first coronavirus death in the UK. They warn there could be perceived competition for limited resource (e.g. food, medicines).</p> <h2>18 February \u2013 PHE contact tracing limited</h2> <p>Sage concludes that \u201cpriorities would shift during a potential outbreak from containment and isolation on to delay and, finally, to case management\u201d. It says Public Health England could cope with \u201cfive new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts)\u201d, with potential capacity to increase to 50 new cases and 8,000 contact isolations.</p> <h2>20 February \u2013 Physical distancing could slow the spread</h2> <p>Meeting hears the first evidence \u201cof local transmission unlinked to individuals who have travelled from China, in Japan, Republic of Korea and Iran\u201d. It is also told there is some evidence from China and Hong Kong \u201cthat social distancing measures have had some impact in limiting the outbreak\u201d.</p> <h2>27 February \u2013 Committee hears 500,000 deaths possible</h2> <p>Meeting discusses the \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d in which 80% of the UK population is infected, with a 1% fatality rate \u2013 which would mean up to 500,000 deaths, a key move towards eventual lockdown. This was modelling from Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who was at the meeting.</p> <h2>3 March \u2013 Start of lockdown guidelines being drawn up</h2> <p>A key conclusion from this meeting is that PHE is ordered to start drafting public guidance on potential lockdown, informed in part by behavioural science advice.</p> <h2>5 March \u2013 First mention of isolating people with Covid</h2> <p>The meeting concludes that there would be a need, within one to two weeks, to make symptomatic people isolate for 14 days, and then about two weeks later to consider \u201ccocooning\u201d older or otherwise medically vulnerable people.</p> <h2>10 March \u2013 Transmission is under way</h2> <p>This meeting concludes that \u201ctransmission is under way in the community\u201d and that modelling suggests \u201cthe UK is 10-14 weeks from the epidemic peak if no mitigations are introduced\u201d. It hears that the UK could have up to 10,000 cases already, and is about four to five weeks behind Italy.

The minutes add: \u201cThese additional measures will need to be accompanied by a significant increase in testing and the availability of near real-time data flows to understand their impacts.\u201d</p> <p>It is possible, the committee is told, that the UK could now have up to 10,000 new cases per day. Sage also speaks of the possibility of closing schools. \u201cWhile Sage view remains that school closures constitutes one of the less effective single measure to reduce the peak epidemic, it may nevertheless become necessary \u2026 to push demand for critical care below NHS capacity.\u201d</p> <h2>18 March \u2013 Evidence backs schools closures</h2> <p>This meeting is told that \u201cavailable evidence now supports implementing school closures on a national level as soon as practicable to prevent NHS intensive care capacity being exceeded\u201d. The UK now seems to be two to four weeks behind Italy. It considers measures just for London, such as closing restaurants and bars, saying the capital appears to be one or two weeks ahead of the rest of the UK.</p> <h2>23 March \u2013 Lockdown is announced</h2> <p>The day the lockdown is announced, and Sage sets out some of its key concerns. The reproductive R rate is high \u2013 and London could run out of ICU capacity in 10 days.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe science suggests the [R rate] is now around 2.6-2.8. High rates of compliance for social distancing will be needed to bring the reproduction number below one and to bring the cases within NHS capacity.\u201d</p> <p>On the NHS: \u201cThe NHS is surging bed capacity over the next fortnight with a&nbsp;focus on London. The data suggest that London is 1-2 weeks ahead of the rest of the UK \u2026 case numbers in London could exceed NHS capacity within the next 10 days.\u201d</p> <p>It adds: \u201cIncreased community testing and surveillance will be invaluable to measure the effects of the interventions taken. Sage noted that social distancing behaviours have been adopted by many but there is uncertainty whether they are being observed at the level required to bring the epidemic within NHS capacity.\u201d</p> <p>Sage also notes \u201cthere is a worldwide shortage of reagents, platforms and equipment\u201d.</p> <h2>26 March \u2013 \u2018No hasty decisions\u2019 on treatments</h2> <p>The meeting agrees that, once R is below 1 and demand on critical care is brought within capacity, a focus is needed on behavioural and social interventions and on the testing regime necessary for exiting lockdown. The scientists advise that no hasty decisions should be made on treatments, such as the malaria drug chloroquine, based on insufficient or conflicting data. The meeting hears that nosocomial transmission \u2013 the spread of Covid-19 in hospitals \u2013 needs urgent attention. Advisers re-emphasise \u201cthe importance of urgently ramping up testing of appropriate quality\u201d.</p> <h2>7 April \u2013 Face masks have \u2018minimal effect\u2019</h2> <p>The meeting hears that the increased use of face masks would probably have minimal effect in terms of preventing the spread of infection. However, questions are raised about whether this conclusion would change if it were known that there were high levels of transmission between asymptomatic individuals.</p> <h2>9 April \u2013 The Peak?</h2> <p>The meeting is told that the epidemic may be reaching its peak, but could remain at a plateau for some time. The chief veterinary officer advises the meeting that the risk of transmission from cats to humans is low.</p> <h2>14 April \u2013 R-value coming down</h2> <p>The meeting hears that the R-value of the epidemic is probably between 0.5 and 1 \u2013 but that relatively small changes to social distancing measures could push R back above 1.</p> <p>However, the spread of infection within hospitals is making up an increasing proportion of cases and care homes are also flagged as a concern, with Sage noting the lack of data available. The scientists discuss the extensive pros and cons of recommending face masks, but conclude that \u201cevidence does not currently support [their] use\u201d in the general population.</p> <h2>21 April \u2013 Obesity is a risk</h2> <p>The scientists decide there is \u201cenough evidence to support recommendation of community use of cloth face masks, for short periods in enclosed spaces, where social distancing is not possible.\u201d They add that any policy decision on masks \u201cmust not jeopardise supply\u201d to health and social care settings. Discussions about who is most vulnerable to the disease flags up that \u201cthere is a clear signal that obesity is a risk factor\u201d.</p> <h2>23 April \u2013 No game-changing existing drugs</h2> <p>Sage is downbeat on the potential for existing drugs to be repurposed to treat Covid-19: \u201cRepurposed medicines are unlikely to deliver a \u2018game-changing\u2019 breakthrough for treating the virus.\u201d</p> <h2>28 April \u2013 Stick with 2 metres</h2> <p>The committee notes that a possible complication has emerged in children.

      "bodyText": "The UK government released more than 50 documents on Friday \u2013 including the minutes of 34 meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The documents set out how scientists tracked \u2013 and reacted to \u2013 the pandemic. By mid-March, a sense of panic was setting in. 22 January \u2013 Poor data from China In the first Sage meeting responding to the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, the committee agrees there is considerable uncertainty around the data coming out of China, meaning \u201ca reasonable worst case cannot be made reliably\u201d. 28 January \u2013 Test ready by end of week The committee says a test for coronavirus should be ready by the end of the week, with a capacity to run 400 to 500 tests per day. It agrees on the importance of behavioural science informing policy. 3 February \u2013 Sage rejects travel restrictions The committee considers imposing restrictions on travel into the UK. It concludes that reducing imported infections by 50% would maybe delay the onset of any epidemic in the UK by about five days. \u201cOnly a month of additional preparation time for the NHS would be meaningful.\u201d 5 February \u2013 Nervtag recommends masks Nervtag (New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group) recommends symptomatic people should be encouraged to wear a surgical face mask, \u201cproviding that it can be tolerated\u201d. Sage agrees that shutting down public transport or restricting public gatherings would \u201cprobably be ineffective\u201d in delaying the spread of the virus. 6 February \u2013 Sage extends self-isolation guidance The virus is in the UK and Sage notes that a third person, a man who had recently visited Singapore, had tested positive for coronavirus. It now advises that those who have travelled from Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau and are showing symptoms self-isolate. 11 February \u2013 Prediction that mass testing will end Sage predicts an eventual end for any attempt at mass testing and contact tracing, saying it is not possible for the UK to accelerate coronavirus testing capacity alongside regular flu testing. It recommendeds that Public Health England establishes a criteria for when \u201ccontact tracing is no longer worthwhile\u201d. 13 February \u2013 Prediction that stockpiling could be an issue Sage hears that \u201cscepticism and general inaction dominate\u201d among the general public and will continue to do so until the first coronavirus death in the UK. They warn there could be perceived competition for limited resource (e.g. food, medicines). 18 February \u2013 PHE contact tracing limited Sage concludes that \u201cpriorities would shift during a potential outbreak from containment and isolation on to delay and, finally, to case management\u201d. It says Public Health England could cope with \u201cfive new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts)\u201d, with potential capacity to increase to 50 new cases and 8,000 contact isolations. 20 February \u2013 Physical distancing could slow the spread Meeting hears the first evidence \u201cof local transmission unlinked to individuals who have travelled from China, in Japan, Republic of Korea and Iran\u201d. It is also told there is some evidence from China and Hong Kong \u201cthat social distancing measures have had some impact in limiting the outbreak\u201d. 27 February \u2013 Committee hears 500,000 deaths possible Meeting discusses the \u201creasonable worst case scenario\u201d in which 80% of the UK population is infected, with a 1% fatality rate \u2013 which would mean up to 500,000 deaths, a key move towards eventual lockdown. This was modelling from Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, who was at the meeting. 3 March \u2013 Start of lockdown guidelines being drawn up A key conclusion from this meeting is that PHE is ordered to start drafting public guidance on potential lockdown, informed in part by behavioural science advice. 5 March \u2013 First mention of isolating people with Covid The meeting concludes that there would be a need, within one to two weeks, to make symptomatic people isolate for 14 days, and then about two weeks later to consider \u201ccocooning\u201d older or otherwise medically vulnerable people. 10 March \u2013 Transmission is under way This meeting concludes that \u201ctransmission is under way in the community\u201d and that modelling suggests \u201cthe UK is 10-14 weeks from the epidemic peak if no mitigations are introduced\u201d. It hears that the UK could have up to 10,000 cases already, and is about four to five weeks behind Italy. There is also, it says, a \u201cpriority\u201d to get more antibody testing. There is also an acknowledgment of the looming crisis to come in care homes. \u201cSage advised that special policy consideration be given to care homes and various types of retirement communities.\u201d 13 March \u2013 \u2018Things are worse than we thought\u2019 This meeting finds there were more cases in the UK than previously expected at this point, and that household isolation and protecting older and more vulnerable people should happen \u201csoon\u201d. \u201cSage now believes there are more cases in the UK than previously thought and we may therefore be further ahead of the epidemic curve \u2026\u201d 16 March \u2013 Sage advice changes This meeting hears of a significantly different situation: now, it says, \u201cthere is clear evidence to support additional social distancing measures be introduced as soon as possible\u201d. The minutes add: \u201cThese additional measures will need to be accompanied by a significant increase in testing and the availability of near real-time data flows to understand their impacts.\u201d It is possible, the committee is told, that the UK could now have up to 10,000 new cases per day.

The Russian activists and the Chilean group \u2013 whose song A Rapist In Your Path became a viral feminist anthem in 2019 \u2013 released the manifesto against police violence and state repression on Friday. \u201cWhile we are confined, governments are intensifying the persecution of social struggles, tearing apart our rights, our freedoms,\u201d it reads.

The song refers to the wave of popular protest which erupted in Chile last year \u2013 and the violent police response which left thousands injured, including 445 people blinded by anti-riot weapons, and at least 30 dead. The five-month uprising was abruptly halted by the pandemic, but the groups\u2019 manifesto warns that state repression in Chile and beyond has only grown worse as police and military enforce lockdowns. \u201cPolice act dangerously,\u201d said Tolokonnikova, the Pussy Riot co-founder who was imprisoned for 18 months in 2012 for staging a protest in the Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow. She has also been beaten by Russian police during protests. \u201cInstead of protecting people and investigating real crimes like rape or domestic violence, police persecute activists and protect those with power,\u201d she added.

      "bodyText": "Lindsey Graham, the Republican chair of the Senate judiciary committee, has publicly urged older conservative judges to retire, so their places can be filled before a November election in which the party could lose the White House and its Senate majority. Graham said the move would help \u201cchange the judiciary for several generations\u201d. Donald Trump made transforming the federal judiciary a key campaign promise in 2016, aiming to appoint more judges than any other president. He has made considerable progress, clinching the confirmations of two supreme court justices and seing a broad transformation of the justice system to conservatism. \u201cThis is an historic opportunity,\u201d Graham told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve put over 200 federal judges on the bench \u2026 If you can get four more years, I mean, it would change the judiciary for several generations. \u201cSo if you\u2019re a circuit judge in your mid-60s, late 60s, you can take senior status, now would be a good time to do that, if you want to make sure the judiciary is right of center.\u201d Graham added: \u201cSo do it now \u2026 I need some time.\u201d McConnell has made the confirmation of new judges a priority, even during the coronavirus pandemic. Experts agree it would be possible for judges to be confirmed during a lame duck period, meaning the time between Trump losing the presidency to Joe Biden and Democrats retaking the Senate, in November, and the resumption of business in January. In the supreme court, Trump has appointed Neil Gorsuch, to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia, and Brett Kavanaugh, to replace the retiring Anthony Kennedy. The court thereby has a 5-4 conservative majority, with the health of 87-year-old liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg watched keenly from both sides of the aisle. Hewitt asked Graham if he had any knowledge of a supreme court justice planning to retire this year. No, the senator said, but he added that if a vacancy does arise, filling it before the election \u201cwould be the goal\u201d. McConnell famously refused to replace Scalia with Merrick Garland, Barack Obama\u2019s nominee, a moderate, the Senate leader citing contested precedent when claiming vacancies should not be filled in an election year. McConnell has said no such strictures would apply in what could be Trump\u2019s last year in office. \u201cWe changed the rules for the supreme court [to require a simple majority for confirmation],\u201d Graham said. \u201cSo if a vacancy did occur, and I don\u2019t expect one to, I hope everybody has a long, healthy 2020 on the court \u2026 you would see an effort by Republicans, I\u2019m sure, to fill the vacancy.\u201d",

The new system, which launched this week, requires people to self-isolate for 14 days if they are told by tracers that they recently came into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus. But an April report presented to the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), said \u201crapid\u201d research was needed on how best to get people to comply with self-isolation advice given that \u201conly around 50%\u201d abided by the rule when they developed a cough or fever, according to Department of Health tracking in England. The revelations appear in the latest tranche of documents and the first minutes of meetings published by Sage. The minutes from 34 meetings held from January to May were released with other documents submitted to Sage by its modelling and behavioural science subgroups. The minutes reveal a sense of rising anxiety at Sage as scientists saw the number of cases grow faster than expected, with the experts recommending on 13 March that household isolation and protecting older, more vulnerable people should happen \u201csoon\u201d. Three days later, the advice changed: the committee heard there could be 10,000 new cases a day, prompting them to recommend further physical distancing \u201cas soon as possible\u201d adding that a \u201csignificant increase in testing\u201d was needed. The group of experts considered further documents on the track-and-trace system, with one report from behavioural scientists warning that they \u201canticipate major behavioural barriers\u201d to people using the NHS contact-tracing app, that would prevent it from being the primary method of containing outbreaks. They go on to warn that foreign powers will seek to capitalise on any weaknesses they spot in the UK\u2019s response to the outbreak. Many of the documents include redactions, mostly of names of people on the Sage secretariat and others who participated directly in the meetings. Weeks before the lockdown was announced, on 25 February Sage held a prescient discussion about the importance of perceived fairness in reducing the chance of disorder, saying public compliance was \u201clikely to be enhanced [by] a sense of collectivism\u201d, and that \u201cflash points tend to happen where there is a perceived lack of equity\u201d. A further meeting on 18 March said that evidence supported school closures on a national level \u201cas soon as practicable to prevent NHS intensive care capacity being exceeded\u201d, warning that the UK appeared to be a few weeks behind Italy in the pandemic curve.

He previously worked with Dominic Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign. Concerns about the vulnerability of care homes, with Sage\u2019s modelling subgroup warning that 90% of care homes having outbreaks \u201ccannot be ruled out if current trends are maintained.\u201d The view that repurposed drugs are unlikely to deliver a \u201cgame-changing\u201d breakthrough\u201d for treating the virus. A warning that the entire UK population may need flu jabs in the coming winter as the search for a Covid-19 vaccine continues. The realisation that longer-term health problems are emerging, including \u201cextreme tiredness and shortness of breath for months\u201d. A warning that creating \u201cbubbles\u201d for people to mix in would have mental wellbeing benefits but carry unforeseen risks and the potential for the virus to spread. A request for pastoral support for advisers and more effective means of screening requests to Sage members, given that they would continue to work \u201cunder intense pressure\u201d for many more months. Government scientific advisers expressed caution about the efficacy of the planned track-and-trace system, which was rolled out across England on Thursday, saying that for it to work, around 80% of non-household contacts would have to be traced and isolated within 48 hours of the first person experiencing symptoms.

      "bodyText": "Durham police is facing a possible inquiry into its handling of the Dominic Cummings saga after complaints were passed to its internal investigation team. The force has received a number of complaints from members of the public angry at the way it dealt with Boris Johnson\u2019s aide over his travels during lockdown. It is understood the messages have been passed to the force\u2019s professional standards department which is assessing whether to take matters further. The force, one of the smallest in Britain, was thrust into the spotlight when the Guardian and Mirror revealed a week ago that Cummings drove 260 miles from London to his family property in Durham then made a second trip to a local beauty spot. Following an investigation this week, Durham police said it believed the special adviser probably did break lockdown rules by embarking on a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. Officers might have intervened to send him home had they caught him on the trip on 12 April, or fined him if he refused, the report said. Its investigation also concluded that Cummings did not break health protection regulations by making the 260-mile trip to Durham with his son and wife, who had coronavirus symptoms, though it made no finding in relation to the \u201cstay at home\u201d government guidance. The force\u2019s findings have been met with anger in some quarters, prompting several emailed complaints which were then passed on to its professional standards department as is protocol. The complaints were first revealed by the Telegraph on Friday. The nature of the complaints is not known. The force\u2019s findings published on Thursday prompted anger both from people who believe Cummings did break the law and those who believe the force should never have retrospectively investigated the matter. A Durham constabulary spokesman said: \u201cThere is currently no investigation into the force\u2019s handling of this inquiry.\u201d The professional standards department could decide to take matters further if it believes there is enough evidence to warrant a misconduct investigation. Such investigations have the authority to seize documents, interview witnesses and even arrest serving police officers. A spokeswoman for the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said no referral had been made to it from Durham police and therefore it was not conducting any investigation. Cummings has denied any wrongdoing and said the journey to Barnard Castle on 12 April, Easter Sunday, was to test his eyesight. The prime minister and cabinet continued to stand by him on Friday.",

He added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>None of us think, who have looked at this in any great detail, that that will be sufficient to be able to hold the reproduction number below one.</p> \n   <p>We all think we will have to have quite significant numbers of wider social distance measures in place.</p> \n   <p>The basic reproduction number for this virus is perhaps three, maybe even more, so we cannot relax our guard by very much at all.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He said there was a need to try and get the economy restarted, to get people back to work and to provide a boost to people\u2019s mental health.</p> \n  <p>But he said even if track and trace kept the R-value at about one, it would still result in around 8,000 community infections a day in England.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/uk-lockdown-rules-what-are-the-key-changes\">UK lockdown rules: what you are allowed to do from Monday</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T15:55:32.318Z\">at 4.55pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed119678f08f5e373010ed2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T14:19:53.758Z\">3.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Private renters are more likely to have fallen behind with housing costs than those with a mortgage since the start of the coronavirus crisis, a new study suggests.</p> \n  <p>One in eight private renters have fallen behind compared to one in 12 mortgaged home owners, said the <strong>Resolution Foundation</strong>.

Members of this group should have had a letter from their GP or hospital advising them to shield initially for 12 weeks. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19\">Guidance issued by the government on 11 May</a> said this group would continue to be advised to shield \u201cfor some time\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The charities are also calling for clear guidance for the wider group of vulnerable people \u2013 including people who are over 70, pregnant, who have heart disease or are taking medication that might suppress the immune system \u2013 who have not been asked to shield but <a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gov.uk%2Fgovernment%2Fpublications%2Ffull-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others%2Ffull-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others%23eel-decline&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cryan.hooper%40pa.media%7C4cb26f8f1a0e4201323108d803b0564f%7C8aea8e714fae4a2b83fc4d84bc2355a2%7C0%7C0%7C637263403214244819&amp;sdata=nfXLnxTb2fTPGxQ%2Ba19IicPc%2FpqXl4yWN7AV5%2FLjn1Q%3D&amp;reserved=0\">have been told to \u201ctake particular care to minimise contact with others outside [their] household\u201d</a>. The charities warn this group will be at greater risk as lockdown is lifted and have to make decisions on whether they and members of their household leave home, go to work or school. </p> \n  <p>In the letter, the charities highlight that while other areas of society have received a detailed national roadmap from the government about the easing of lockdown measures, at the Downing Street press conference on Thursday those in the extremely vulnerable cohort who have been advised to shield themselves in March were simply told to \u201ccontinue to do so\u201d with only a top line commitment to \u201cbetter support\u201d them \u201csoon\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Dr Keith Brownlee, the director of policy, programmes and support at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People with cystic fibrosis have been advised to stay in their homes for nearly 12 weeks now to protect them from Covid-19, yet they don\u2019t know how long this advice will last and what their lives might be like in the coming weeks and months. </p> \n   <p>Many have been shielding as a whole family unit, and this impacts them all \u2013 especially as children start to go back to school and more people return to work. </p> \n   <p>We need urgent guidance from the government which takes into account the wide range of situations people are in, including recognising the importance of being able to go outside to exercise \u2013 which is vital for people with CF to stay healthy and many other concerns such as financial, psychological, education and employment.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/macmillancancer/status/1266294462281474048\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Read our open letter with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asthmauk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@asthmauk</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lunguk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@lunguk</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mssociety?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@mssociety</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NVTweeting?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nvtweeting</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VersusArthritis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@versusArthritis</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kidneycareuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@kidneycareuk</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cftrust?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@cftrust</a> to UK Governments, here: <a href=\"https://t.co/syGBJG0aLw\">https://t.co/syGBJG0aLw</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheForgottenC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TheForgottenC</a></p>\u2014 Macmillan Cancer Support (@macmillancancer) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macmillancancer/status/1266294462281474048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 29, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T11:32:58.942Z\">at 12.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0e3518f08f5e373010b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T10:28:09.912Z\">11.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Police have set out the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> matches they would like to be played at neutral venues, which would include any Liverpool game where the title could be won.</p> \n  <p>Mark Robert, the deputy chief constable of <strong>South Yorkshire police</strong> and the UK\u2019s football policing lead, said in a statement issued to the PA Media news agency: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our discussions with the Premier League throughout this process have been positive, with a shared focus on the priority of public health.

If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Coronavirus is still spreading too fast to lift the lockdown, a Sage adviser warned. Prof John Edmunds said that 8,000 daily infections in England is a very high level of incidence, making lifting restrictions too risky. He said: I think many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that then means that we have fewer cases occurring before we relax the measures. I think at the moment, with relatively high incidence and relaxing the measures and also with an untested track and trace system, I think we are taking some risk here. Employers are set to pay 20% of salaries by October, as the chancellor announced changes to the final months of the furlough scheme. Government contributions to the scheme will be gradually tapered off until it ends in October, with businesses contributing modestly to furloughed salaries from August and improved flexibility to bring furloughed employees back part time from 1 July. The full details are here. The Self-Employment Income Support scheme is to be extended, Rishi Sunak confirmed. Those eligible for SEISS will be able to claim a second and final grant in August, covering 70% of the applicant\u2019s average monthly profits for the three months. The amount will be capped at \u00a36,570. Half of people in England with symptoms are not self-isolating for at least a week, according to a report by a subgroup of Sage. It raises questions about the test and trace policy, which requires people to self-isolate for 14 days if they are informed that a recent contact has tested positive for the virus, even if they have no symptoms themselves. A further 324 people who tested positive for Covid-19 died, bringing the UK total to 38, 161. And 131,458 tests were carried out or dispatched with 2,095 positive results. That\u2019s it from me today from the UK side. Thank you to everyone who spoke to me today and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. More than 1 million people have signed a petition calling for Dominic Cummings to be sacked over his potential breach of lockdown rules. Despite Downing Street\u2019s efforts to divert focus away from the row, hundreds of thousands of people added their names to the petition in recent days demanding that the prime minister fire his most senior adviser. It is a further sign that public outrage over the affair is not abating. It comes as a Guardian analysis revealed that MPs have been bombarded with tens of thousands of emails from angry constituents, with many sharing their own personal stories of lockdown hardship. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the prison estate continues to rise, Ministry of Justice figures show. As at 5pm on Thursday, 459 prisoners across were confirmed to have the coronavirus across 77 prisons, a 1.5% increase in 24 hours, while there were 907 infected prison staff across 105 prisons, an increase of 1% in the same period. The figures are not live cases and include those who have recovered. To date, there have been 22 prisoners and nine staff known to have contracted Covid-19 and died. There are around 80,000 prisoners in 117 prisons in England and Wales, while there are around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. The government\u2019s decision to extend the scheme to help the self-employed still leaves the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d workers at risk, according to a trade body for the creative sector. The Creative Industries Federation has warned that the move is a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d to help those who \u201ccontinue to fall through the gaps\u201d of the government\u2019s schemes to help workers. The chancellor Rishi Sunak announced on Friday that he has extended the self-employment income support scheme - which has so far seen 2.3 million claims worth 6.8 billion - enabling freelancers to access grants of up to 6,570 from August. Caroline Norbury, Creative Industries Federation CEO, said that the government must avoid a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d end to support, adding that many workers in the creative industries will not be able to work anytime soon. A third of the creative workforce is freelance, including those working in music, performing arts, film, festivals and live events, who will be unable to return to work for quite some time. We called on government to extend the self-employed income support scheme and we are pleased to see that this has been announced today. However, the most vulnerable are still at risk, and this is a missed opportunity to catch those freelancers who continue to fall through the gaps, such as PAYE freelancers, limited company contractors and the newly self-employed. She added that there remains a \u201cworrying inequity between those on payroll, who have 80% of their income secured until the end of October, and the self-employed, who will see support cut off in August.\u201d Q. Are places with higher infection rates like Hull more susceptible to the virus as restrictions get lifted across the board? Are they more likely to see local lockdowns imposed? Powis says there will be variation in the rate of infection around the country, which is not unusual. The estimate of the R number across England is that\u2019s it\u2019s below 1, he says, so even with variation the trend is downwards. There will likely be much more localised outbreaks, e.g. in dormitories and prisons, he says, which will require local public health intervention. Key will be detecting these localised outbreaks early and intervening to break transmission before it becomes a wider problem, he adds. Q. Hull has one of the worst unemployment rates in the country. What\u2019s your message to the people struggling? Can you pledge to support the workers after these schemes elapse? Sunak says many Hull businesses will have received help from the government\u2019s schemes, including cash grants and business rates holidays. He is doing everything he can to stand behind Britain\u2019s workers, he says. And that\u2019s it, the press conference is over. Q. Should ministers take a pay cut in solidarity with workers, as in New Zealand? Sunak says he wasn\u2019t aware of this but he\u2019ll look into it. Q. Is it going to be possible to shield the wider public sector from the economic fallout we face? Sunak says the process whereby pay review bodies collect evidence and advise the government, that will happen later this year. Q. Is there a safe way to share a BBQ or should we all be looking to picnics instead? Powis says whether it\u2019s in a private garden or in a park, for having a BBQ, the two metre rule and hand-washing remain critical. Q. Will you reaffirm that you won\u2019t get rid of the Tory manifesto commitment on the triple tax lock? Sunak says he won\u2019t write future budgets today. Q. Would you like to see the two metre rule reduced? Sunak says it is being kept under review but we\u2019re not there at this point. Powis adds two metres isn\u2019t absolute \u2013 the closer you are to somebody and the longer you are close to somebody is also important. The scientific evidence is unchanged but if new evidence becomes available it will be taken into account, he adds. Q. We haven\u2019t gone from level 4 to 3 \u2013 but we\u2019ve pressed ahead anyway. Doesn\u2019t it look like the decision was taken regardless of the advice? Sunak says the decision was taken in conjunction with the scientific advice. The test and trace system and the surveillance system gives us the ability to measure what\u2019s happening across the country and react quickly in a more targeted way, he adds. Q.The alert level remains at 4. It\u2019s only at 3 that you can have gradual relaxation of restrictions, but we\u2019re doing that at 4. Does that mean we\u2019re no longer following the science? Sunak says because we\u2019re meeting the five tests, we can begin to carefully lift restrictions. This is being done in a measured and phased, as opposed to reckless, progressive way, he says. We remain engaged with scientific advice, he adds. Q. Are we being a bit risky in going forward with relaxing restrictions? Powis says the important thing is to keep the transmission \u2013 the R \u2013 below 1. Infection rates in the community need to be monitored really closely and action taken if the R starts to go above 1, he says. The scientific advice to the government will be how to do this through a range of measures going forward and avoid any second peak, he adds. Q. How tough a period do the British people need to prepare themselves for, in terms of unemployment? Sunak says despite this extraordinary intervention to protect as many jobs as possible, they can\u2019t protect every job. We\u2019re in a better place than we otherwise would have been, he says. However, there will be hardships ahead for many when the furlough scheme ends in October, the chancellor says. He will work hard to help get people back into work if they do lose their jobs, he adds. Q. If there\u2019s a second spike and reimposing of lockdown measures, will you switch the furlough scheme back or would it just be over? Sunak says the scheme will end in October. Q. Will there be an emergency budget? Sunak says he was planning an autumn budget but the timing will be released in the normal course of business. Q. Is \u00a3100bn roughly what we\u2019re looking at for the total cost of both schemes for the total eight months? Sunak says the OBR has provided a range of estimates. It\u2019s difficult to say what the total aggregate cost will be, he adds, because the flexible furlough will make that hard to predict. Q. Why haven\u2019t we had people-tested numbers for the past six days? Powis says he can\u2019t give a specific answer on this but testing is increasing all the time. This week the antibody test has been rolled out in hospitals and healthcare facilities, he adds. They are taking questions from journalists now. Q. Is \u00a3100bn your limit [for the furlough/SEISS schemes] and so unemployment will spike after? Sunak says the scheme is very generous and will amount to the employer making a 5% contribution. Around 40% of employers don\u2019t pay national insurance or pension contributions at all, he says, so they won\u2019t be affected by the changes in August. Companies can apply in advance of payroll for the furlough scheme, he adds, which will help with cash flow. Q. If the alert level hasn\u2019t gone down [from 4 to 3], why are we loosening things up? Powis says the Joint Biosecurity Centre is feeding information into the four chief medical officers across the four nations. The NHS needs to be able to respond to any surge of infection in the community, so it\u2019s important to link in to the centre and adapt what we\u2019re doing, he adds. Simona from Eastbourne asks what the government is doing to support women returning to work from maternity leave who have no childcare and can\u2019t be furloughed. Sunak says the various schemes, tax cuts and loans in place will help many people. The reopening of schools will also help people with children to get back to work, he adds. They are taking questions from the public. Will from Manchester asks what specifically is the government doing to maintain low emission rates as lockdown eases. Sunak says more people are cycling as they commute. Powis adds that the NHS wants to make changes such as reducing the number of face-to-face appointments to cut down NHS-related transport. Many of these things have happened during the pandemic and this approach should be kept as much as possible, he adds. The Self-Employment Income Scheme will be extended, with applications opening in August for a second and final grant, he says. It will be paid out in a single instalment, covering three months\u2019 worth of average monthly trading profits, he says. The value of the final grant will be 70%, up to a total of \u00a36,570, he adds. From 1 July, flexible furlough will be in place, he says. Employers will have maximum flexibility to decide to bring back employees for a number of days per week. The furlough scheme cannot continue indefinitely, Sunak says. Employers will be asked to contribute, alongside the taxpayer, to pay the wages of their staff, Sunak says. In June and July, the scheme will continue as before \u2013 with the government pay 80% of wages up to \u00a32,500 \u2013 with no employer contribution at all, he says. In August, the taxpayer contribution will stay at 80%. Employers will only be asked to pay national insurance and employer pension contributions, he says. By September, employers will be asked to start paying towards people\u2019s wages. Taxpayers will pay 70% of the furlough grant, employers 10%. In October, taxpayers will pay 60%, employers 20%. Then the scheme will close, he says. The chancellor is speaking now. He is joined by Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England. 131,458 tests were carried out yesterday, and 2,095 people tested positive. Across all settings, 38,161 people have died, an increase 324 fatalities since yesterday. The chancellor will front this afternoon\u2019s press conference, due to begin shortly. He is expected to outline changes to the government\u2019s job retention scheme, including details on how employers will be asked to contribute to pay the wages of furloughed workers. Sunak has also faced calls from cross-party group of 113 MPs to extend support for the self-employed \u2013 due to end on Sunday \u2013 or risk leaving many \u201cwithout work and without support\u201d. The number of fines for breaches of lockdown rules has plunged since measures were eased, with just 841 handed out by police in England, new figures show. A total of 16,947 fixed penalty notices, including 15,552 in England and 1,395 in Wales, were recorded by forces up to 25 May, according to provisional data released by the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC). There were 1,019 issued in England during the latest two-week period, between 12 and 25 May \u2013 although the figure is likely to be revised upwards as more fines are reported \u2013 compared to 4,967 during the previous fortnight. Just 841 fines were handed out by forces in England since lockdown measures were eased on 13 May with the highest number (178) during the latest period given the day before. The NPCC said penalties have been given to people for driving with others who are not members of their household, house parties, large gatherings and camping, since restrictions were relaxed. NPCC chairman Martin Hewitt said: As restrictions are carefully eased, the public have been able to go about their business in greater numbers, and with greater flexibility. The collective public effort over the past two months has meant police officers have only rarely had to step in to enforce regulations and even less so in the past few weeks. I am confident the vast majority will continue to act responsibly. We will be issuing guidance to officers on how to approach new changes to the regulations in the coming days. The NPCC said most penalties have been given to young men, aged between 18 and 24, with more issued on weekends and during warm weather. It comes ahead of a further easing of lockdown restrictions on Monday, with those in England allowed to gather in groups of six in parks or private gardens. Only half of people who develop coronavirus symptoms self-isolate for at least a week, according to government science advisers, raising urgent questions about the success of the test, trace and isolate strategy needed to contain future outbreaks. In an April report to the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage), behavioural science experts said \u201crapid\u201d research was needed on how best to get people to comply with self-isolation advice given that \u201conly around 50%\u201d took the precaution when they developed a cough or fever, according to Department of Health and Social Care tracking in England. Under the new track-and-trace system, people will be required to self-isolate for 14 days if they are informed that a recent contact has tested positive for the virus. The same document from the Sage subgroup states that scientists \u201canticipate major behavioural barriers\u201d to people using the NHS contact-tracing app that will prevent it from being the primary method of containing outbreaks. No further action is being taken by police over the death from coronavirus of a railway worker, it has been announced. British Transport Police said detectives have conducted \u201cextensive inquiries\u201d into the death of 47-year-old railway ticket officer Belly Mujinga, who died with Covid-19 in April, two weeks after being spat on by a man who claimed to have the virus while she was at work at London\u2019s Victoria station. She is survived by her husband and 11-year-old daughter. BTP said they had held a \u201cfull and thorough investigation\u201d, including interviewing a 57-year-old man, adding that the incident did not lead to Belly\u2019s death. The UK government is \u201ctaking some risk\u201d by relaxing lockdown measures while the number of new cases of coronavirus recorded each day remains \u201crelatively high\u201d, an expert in infectious diseases has said. Prof John Edmunds, who attends meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) supporting the government, said many experts would \u201cprefer\u201d to see the number of Covid-19 infections drop before measures such as a relaxation on social interaction restrictions were introduced. Latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests there are an estimated 54,000 new coronavirus infections a week in England outside of hospital and care settings, equating to nearly 8,000 per day. The R number, or reproduction rate, is currently between 0.7 and 0.9, and must remain under one to avoid a rise in infections \u2013 a key test on whether lockdown measures should be eased, with the government stressing the need to avoid a second wave of cases which would threaten to overwhelm the NHS. Prof Edmunds, speaking during a Science Media Centre briefing, said the decision to relax certain rules came with a degree of risk. He said: I think many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that would mean we have fewer cases occurring before we relaxed the measures. If we had incidents at a lower level, even if the reproduction level went up a bit, we wouldn\u2019t be in a position where we were overwhelming the health service. I think at the moment with relatively high incidents, relaxing the measures and with an untested track and trace system, I think we are taking some risk here. Even if that risk doesn\u2019t play out and we keep the incidents flat, we\u2019re keeping it flat at quite a high level. The government has launched its track and trace system designed to limit the spread of infection by ordering contacts of those who become infected with coronavirus to isolate. Prof Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, supported the decision to essentially substitute a \u201cblanket approach\u201d to containing the virus with a targeted one, adding it saw a return to \u201csome level of normality\u201d. He added: None of us think, who have looked at this in any great detail, that that will be sufficient to be able to hold the reproduction number below one. We all think we will have to have quite significant numbers of wider social distance measures in place. The basic reproduction number for this virus is perhaps three, maybe even more, so we cannot relax our guard by very much at all. He said there was a need to try and get the economy restarted, to get people back to work and to provide a boost to people\u2019s mental health. But he said even if track and trace kept the R-value at about one, it would still result in around 8,000 community infections a day in England. Private renters are more likely to have fallen behind with housing costs than those with a mortgage since the start of the coronavirus crisis, a new study suggests. One in eight private renters have fallen behind compared to one in 12 mortgaged home owners, said the Resolution Foundation. The figures, from a survey of more than 6,000 adults, highlight how the pandemic has exacerbated Britain\u2019s housing divide, said the think tank. One in five private renters have been furloughed or lost their job since the crisis began, compared to around one-in-seven mortgaged home owners, although home owners are more likely to have had their hours and pay reduced, said the report. Private renters face higher costs in the first place, with their average pre-crisis housing costs estimated to be 32% of their family\u2019s income, compared to 11% among mortgaged homeowners, according to the findings. Almost one-in-four private renters had no savings in the run-up to the crisis, compared to one-in-eight home owners, said the foundation, adding that many people living in private rented accommodation have been forced to cut back on basic spending or, in the case of young people, to move house. Lindsay Judge, principal research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: Britain already had a huge housing divide before coronavirus struck, and the current economic crisis has only widened that gap. People living in private rented accommodation have found it harder to meet their housing costs than homeowners in recent months, and harder to negotiate reductions in those costs. The result is that a quarter are cutting back on other spending, in many cases on essentials, to cover their rent during this crisis. Policy makers need to recognise that, while the 1990s recession was infamously most severe for the UK\u2019s home owners, this recession is biting hardest for renters. Afternoon everyone. I\u2019m back from lunch to continue the coronavirus live coverage for the rest of the day. Please do continue to get in touch with tips and comments, your thoughts are hugely appreciated: Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Stewards are to marshal a North Yorkshire beauty spot after around 100 people gathered there on Monday. Police attended Richmond Falls on the River Swale after partying crowds flouted social distancing rules. A 29-year-old man from Staffordshire has been charged with assaulting a police officer, while a 30-year-old man from Catterick Garrsion was fined for disorder. The deputy leader of Richmondshire district council, cllr Helen Grant, said the actions of some who visited the falls over the bank holiday weekend had been \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. She added that stewards would be working at the site this weekend to prevent large groups of people or anyone with alcohol from gaining access. NHS England has announced the deaths of 149 more people who had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals in England to 26,383. However, only 36 of the deaths occurred yesterday, while 59 occurred on 27 May and 17 on 26 May. The figures also show that 30 of the news deaths took place between 3 May and 25 May, while six occurred in April, one one took place on 19 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day of coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the test to be validated. The latest figures show that 8 April continues to have the highest number of hospital deaths in a single day, with a current total of 893. Police in England and Wales have issued nearly 17,000 fines to people for alleged breaches of lockdown rules, according to the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council. Official data shows 15,552 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) were recorded by forces in England up to May 25, with 1,395 issued in Wales. Since lockdown measures were eased on May 13, a total of 841 fines have been handed out by forces in England. A further 10 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths in the country to 1,317. Public Health Wales said another 102 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13,827. A civilian pilot sparked an emergency response after landing without permission on a closed RAF airfield in North Wales \u201cbecause he wanted to go to the beach\u201d. Ministry of Defence guards and fire crews confronted the pilot after he landed on a runway at RAF Valley on the Island of Anglesey on Monday, the RAF confirmed. The pilot is understood to have flown from an airfield in Surrey in order to go to the beach, despite it being in breach of Welsh coronavirus lockdown rules, a source told the PA news agency. Workers were said to be carrying out repairs and maintenance of the airfield at the time of the incident, and no bird control unit was in place. After security checks were carried out, he took off again. An RAF spokesman said the incident had been reported to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). I\u2019m Amy Walker, here to cover the UK coronavirus live blog while my colleague Lucy Campbell takes a lunch break. A Tory MP who says he has received several hundred emails about the lockdown breach by Dominic Cummings has told angry constituents that people who made sacrifices in this pandemic \u201cwill feel let down\u201d but he believed that the prime minister\u2019s chief advisor was operating \u201cat the limit\u201d of rules. A letter from Tom Randall, the MP for Gedling, said: I appreciate that Mr Cummings\u2019 decision to leave London is controversial. He also took advantage of things, like a spare cottage on his parents\u2019 estate and private woodland to exercise in, which you and I can only dream of. He also went on to appear to suggest that media attention towards Cummings potentially placed him and his family in danger. He said that there was no-one in London who could have looked after his child and that there were concerns about safety if he remained at his London address. Having seen the recent scenes outside his house, I am minded to believe him. Randall\u2019s constituents include Ben Davies, whose partner gave birth to a healthy baby daughter on 29 March, but for whom physical distancing has meant relatives, including grandparents, have been unable to visit and meet her. He was among those who told the Guardian of their anger at recent events, saying: How can a prime minister give a briefing where he so blatantly lies, avoids questions and blusters to protect his adviser? We\u2019ve just had the daily Downing Street briefing with Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman, and this is what we learned: The official coronavirus alert level is still at four This is despite the easing of lockdown restrictions from Monday. Speaking to the liaison committee of senior MPs on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said the level would be coming down from four to three. But his spokesman said it remains at four. The decision is seemingly the responsibility of the government\u2019s new joint biosecurity unit, which is not yet fully operational. Police will not have powers to do spot checks on homes over social distancing From Monday, groups of up to six people can meet outdoors, for example in people\u2019s gardens. No 10 said that while the emergency coronavirus laws did allow enforcement of lockdown, police could not do spot checks of people\u2019s gardens. He said: I am sure that members of the public will show common sense and will want to abide by the rules. Police will have the power to enforce the regulations, using proportionality and the pragmatic approach they have taken so far. The government is confident of reaching its 200,000-a-day testing target This is due to happen by the start of June \u2013 that is, Monday. The spokesman said: We do believe we are on target to meet it. The latest daily figure for tests was 119,587, for yesterday. These are the tests to see whether someone has the virus, not the antibody testing which determines if they have had it in the past. There are as yet no figures for the number of antibody tests used from those bought from pharmaceuticals company Roche. It is not clear if teachers must return to work if their schools are open Asked whether refusing to do so for safety reasons would be seen as a breach of contract, Johnson\u2019s spokesman stressed what he said was \u201ca cautious and phased return\u201d of pupils, but indicated this was up to individual schools. He said: Headteachers, I am sure, will be having conversations with their own staff in the usual way. A relaxing of lockdown rules in Wales means that, from Monday, people from two different households will be able to meet outdoors as long as they do not travel more than five miles, the first minister Mark Drakeford said. Under new \u201cstay local\u201d guidelines, which replace the \u201cstay at home\u201d message previously used by the Welsh government, people will still need to observe social distancing when meeting in public or private outdoor spaces. Exceptions will allow for travelling to work, to seek care, and shopping for essentials if they are not available locally. Beauty spots and tourist destinations will remain closed. Also, from Monday, weddings and civil partnerships will also be allowed to take place if the bride or groom is terminally ill. Drakeford added that non-essential retail businesses that can comply with social distancing rules should start to prepare to reopen over the next three weeks. A decision on whether they will reopen will be taken at the next review of lockdown measures on 18 June and will depend on scientific and medical evidence. He said: I understand that we\u2019re talking about people\u2019s businesses and livelihoods. But to be clear with people, the way we do things in Wales, we prepare and we make things safe and then we change the law. Nicola Sturgeon said she was \u201cconscious\u201d that this will be the first weekend where lockdown measures have been eased to the point where people in Scotland can meet those from another household outdoors, and that the rules should be followed closely to avoid a resurgence of the virus. The first minister urged \u201ccaution\u201d as she reiterated her calls to ensure that any meetings with other households must be outside and people must stick to social distancing guidelines by meeting in groups of no more than eight and by keeping two metres apart. She said people should also ensure that items such as cutlery and food are not shared and people do not enter homes that are not their own. She also asked that people stay local as much as possible \u2013 within five miles of their home \u2013 avoid crowds at parks and beauty spots across the country, and to go elsewhere if areas are busy. People should still stay at home as much as possible, she added. Sturgeon said the changes would improve the lives of Scots, but added that she was still \u201cnervous\u201d about the easing of measures. She said: I said yesterday I was nervous ahead of these changes and that\u2019s still the case. If too many of us change our behaviour a bit more than these changes are designed to allow, we could see the virus spread quickly again and we will be back to square one. I\u2019m not trying to cramp anyone\u2019s fun. I want everyone to enjoy these changes - you have more than earned it. But I am asking for you to do it responsibly. I am appealing to your judgment and your sense of solidarity to each other. Please stay within the rules. If you are in doubt about whether your plans are within the rules or not, err on the side of caution. However harsh these rules might feel right now, and I know that they do, abiding by them will never, ever be as harsh as grieving the loss of a loved one. The lack of clear guidance for people who would potentially have to choose between temporarily losing their income or putting their health at risk if asked to self-isolate for 14 days under track and trace risks leaving many families without a safety net, it has been warned. Carol Olley, from Sunderland, asked the prime minister during Thursday\u2019s Downing Street press conference: If localised lockdowns are implemented due to local outbreaks, what measures will the government be putting into place for those unable to go to work and therefore who would potentially temporarily lose their income? Will there be a compensation scheme implemented? With a daughter who has been shielding since 14 March, Olley says she has no idea when her daughter will be able to rejoin society and she has been shielding with her to protect her. In response to her question, Boris Johnson said help such as the furlough scheme and various loan schemes remain in place and that \u201cnobody in this epidemic should be penalised for doing the right thing\u201d. On shielding, he said only that those in the extremely vulnerable cohort who were advised to shield themselves for 12 weeks in March should \u201ccontinue to do so\u201d and that \u201cbetter support\u201d would be in place for them \u201csoon\u201d. Olley, who works for a food poverty organisation, told the Guardian she was furious with the prime minister\u2019s \u201ccompletely unhelpful answer\u201d. The lack of clear guidance and support for families where the wage-earner is unable to work from home and is asked to self-isolate for two weeks with no pay is a \u201cdiabolical\u201d position for people to be in, she said. When a contact tracer rings up many people are going to be left with a choice: self-isolate and not get paid, or go to work and feed their family. She said the lack of clarity and support would force many people to put their health at risk as lockdown is eased: If doing your civic duty means not being able to feed your children and no recompense, many people will have no choice but to go to work and ignore the advice. Not all employees have benefited from the furlough scheme and what about those on zero hour contracts or not eligible for sick pay? What happens to their children and families? Who will pay their bills \u2013especially if it happens several times to one family. If doing your civic duty is to deprive your family of a wage for two weeks without any clear and dependable solutions as to how they can provide for their families, how is this ever going to end? It is diabolical that we are in this position. Citizen\u2019s Advice has warned that those who come under Public Health England\u2019s shielding guidance are only entitled to statutory sick pay, and employers have no legal obligation to furlough an employee who is shielding, leaving some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people at risk of losing up to 60% of their income as lockdown is eased. A loophole in government guidance has caused some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people to lose up to 60% of their income and is now forcing many to put their health at risk as lockdown comes to an end, one of the UK\u2019s biggest charities has warned. Around 2.5 million UK residents, hundreds of thousands of whom are in employment, have been identified by the government as being \u201cextremely clinically vulnerable\u201d. They were ordered to shield at home until the end of June, although their employers did not have to furlough them. Research by Citizens Advice found that of the 2,000 people contacting them since 14 April for help, over 70% of those who were shielding had not been furloughed. Those who come under Public Health England\u2019s shielding guidance are only entitled to statutory sick pay. Employers have no legal obligation to furlough an employee who is shielding. Sarah, a mother of two, has been told her three-year-old daughter must shield due to asthma and allergies. Sarah is currently furloughed from work at a preschool, but has been told she will have to take unpaid leave if she does not return to work when it opens on 1 June. She told the Guardian: I\u2019ve basically been told to choose between my daughter\u2019s health or keeping food on the table. It\u2019s stressful. I can\u2019t concentrate, I can\u2019t sleep, I can hardly eat. More than 40 leading healthcare charities have warned that millions of vulnerable and extremely vulnerable people are getting \u201cmixed and confused messages\u201d about the easing of shielding measures, potentially putting their health and safety at serious risk. Charities including Macmillan Cancer Support, Versus Arthritis, the British Lung Foundation, Asthma UK and the MS Society published an open letter calling for the UK government to publish clear, consistent advice on shielding measures for these groups to ensure they can protect themselves and can access support as lockdown eases. Across the UK approximately 2.2 million people are classified as clinically extremely vulnerable because their specific medical condition places them at greatest risk from the effects of coronavirus. Members of this group should have had a letter from their GP or hospital advising them to shield initially for 12 weeks. Guidance issued by the government on 11 May said this group would continue to be advised to shield \u201cfor some time\u201d. The charities are also calling for clear guidance for the wider group of vulnerable people \u2013 including people who are over 70, pregnant, who have heart disease or are taking medication that might suppress the immune system \u2013 who have not been asked to shield but have been told to \u201ctake particular care to minimise contact with others outside [their] household\u201d. The charities warn this group will be at greater risk as lockdown is lifted and have to make decisions on whether they and members of their household leave home, go to work or school. In the letter, the charities highlight that while other areas of society have received a detailed national roadmap from the government about the easing of lockdown measures, at the Downing Street press conference on Thursday those in the extremely vulnerable cohort who have been advised to shield themselves in March were simply told to \u201ccontinue to do so\u201d with only a top line commitment to \u201cbetter support\u201d them \u201csoon\u201d. Dr Keith Brownlee, the director of policy, programmes and support at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said: People with cystic fibrosis have been advised to stay in their homes for nearly 12 weeks now to protect them from Covid-19, yet they don\u2019t know how long this advice will last and what their lives might be like in the coming weeks and months. Many have been shielding as a whole family unit, and this impacts them all \u2013 especially as children start to go back to school and more people return to work. We need urgent guidance from the government which takes into account the wide range of situations people are in, including recognising the importance of being able to go outside to exercise \u2013 which is vital for people with CF to stay healthy and many other concerns such as financial, psychological, education and employment. Police have set out the Premier League matches they would like to be played at neutral venues, which would include any Liverpool game where the title could be won. Mark Robert, the deputy chief constable of South Yorkshire police and the UK\u2019s football policing lead, said in a statement issued to the PA Media news agency: Our discussions with the Premier League throughout this process have been positive, with a shared focus on the priority of public health. As such we have reached a consensus that balances the needs of football, while also minimising the demand on policing. The majority of remaining matches will be played at home and away as scheduled, with a small number of fixtures taking place at neutral venues, which, contrary to some reports, have yet to be agreed. The views and agreement of forces which host Premier League clubs have been sought and where there were concerns, the Premier League has been supportive in providing flexibility in arranging alternative venues where requested. This plan will be kept continually under review to ensure public health and safety and a key part of this is for supporters to continue to respect the social distancing guidelines, and not to attend or gather outside the stadiums. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the live blog coverage for the rest of the day. If you have any news tips or stories you think we should be covering, please feel free to get in touch as I work. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Transport for London has published the full agreement (pdf) for this month\u2019s central government bailout, showing that it was conditional on London\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, raising charges for motorists and scrapping free travel for older people and under-18s. Khan has said throughout that the 30% increase in the congestion charge, and the removal of free travel on public transport, was insisted on by the Department for Transport as part of the \u00a316bn bailout. Some London Conservatives have disputed this, particularly Shaun Bailey, the Tory candidate for the now-delayed mayoral election, who has repeatedly portrayed the decisions as being Khan\u2019s. However, the seven-page letter from Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, to Khan which sets out the deal, makes the conditions clear. One mandatory term is \u201cthe immediate reintroduction of the London congestion charge, low emission zone and ultra low emission zone, and urgently bring forward proposals to widen the scope and levels of these charges, in accordance with the relevant legal powers and decision-making processes.\u201d The congestion charge, which had been suspended during the Covid-19 crisis, was reintroduced and will rise from \u00a311.50 a day to \u00a315 on 22 June. The emissions zones, intended to improve air quality, impose extra charges on particularly polluting vehicles. The letter from Shapps also requires TfL to maximise space for workers on public transport by stopping free peak-time travel for over-60s, and all free travel for under-18s. Khan in particular wants the latter measure overturned. Sheffield city council has become the latest local authority to tell its schools and nurseries not to admit more students on Monday due to concerns about the infection rate. Boris Johnson had earmarked 1 June as the date when pupils in reception, year 1 and year 6 would return but on Sunday softened his approach, saying schools would not have to open until they felt prepared. Today, councillors in Sheffield said their public health advice suggested it was not safe to reopen schools until at least 14 days after the government\u2019s test and trace scheme was up and running. It has advised schools to delay reopening until 15 June. Councillor Abtisam Mohamed, its cabinet member for education, said: We have been advised by the Sheffield director of public health, Greg Fell, who has reviewed the local position and he does not feel assured that the recently announced test-and-trace programme will be sufficiently well established and robust enough to be in place for 1st June. He has advised that the test-and-trace system should be in place and working effectively for 14 days before schools and nurseries begin increasing their numbers. Whilst nationally the government is requesting that schools and nurseries start to increase the number of pupils attending over the coming weeks, in light of the Sheffield public health advice we do not yet feel assured that it is the right time and are advising our schools and nurseries to delay increasing numbers until 15 June 2020. In a separate statement, Fell said he \u201cdoes not feel assured\u201d that the city has met three of the government\u2019s five key tests for reopening schools. He said test three failed because they \u201cdo not currently have access to data about community transmission of Covid-19 at a local level\u201d; test four failed because \u201cwe do not feel confident that the recently announced NHS test-and-trace programme is sufficiently well established and robust enough to effectively manage any local outbreaks\u201d; and test five failed because they were not confident that any adjustments to the current measures would not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS. The Office for National Statistics has just released its weekly look at the social impacts of coronavirus in Britain. The results are taken from a sample of 1,028 adults (with a 51% response rate) conducted between 21 and 24 May, compared to a similar survey taken on 14 to 17 May. We\u2019ll have a more detailed take shortly, but at first glance these seem to be the most interesting findings: One in five people (20%) say they are concerned about health and safety at work, up from 11% in the previous week. People continue to be worried about the future and feelings of boredom have increased this week, with 62% of respondents saying they feel bored compared to 51% last week. An increasing number of people are worried about their mental health: 29% said the pandemic was making their mental health worse this week, up from 26% last week. Similarly, 29% of people said they were \u201cspending too much time alone\u201d this week, compared to 23% last week. Around one in five adults (19%) said they had self-isolated in the past seven days, a similar figure to last week (20%) but the lowest since the ONS started conducting the survey. Almost one in three adults (29%) have worn a face covering in the past week, mostly for shopping but also for exercise. Just under one in three adults (29%) felt unsafe or very unsafe outside of their home, which has decreased from 41% last week. More people are leaving their homes. This is unsurprising given the more relaxed restrictions in England, but the proportion of people who have not left their home at all in the past week dropped from 14% to 11%. At this brief interregnum, I\u2019ve been asked to flag a special event we\u2019re holding next Wednesday on the Dominic Cummings story. Details and tickets below: Guardian Newsroom: The Dominic Cummings story On Wednesday 3 June we\u2019re holding a live-streamed event exploring the ongoing story of Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown-defying road trip and the government\u2019s handling of the ensuing fallout. With deputy national news editor, Archie Bland, and Observer chief leader writer Sonia Sodha. Book tickets here Wales\u2019s first minister, Mark Drakeford, is holding a press conference at 12.30pm on his government\u2019s new \u201cstay local\u201d guidance. We will bring you that live but here\u2019s a flavour of what Drakeford has been saying this morning. The new rules in Wales will mean that people must not travel more than 5 miles to meet others. Two households will be able to meet outside from next week. Drakeford said he acknowledged that this would seem \u201cunfair\u201d to people in Wales, given the more relaxed restrictions in England, but that he did not want people spreading the virus from one community to another. \u201cWe have parts of Wales where there has been very little coronavirus and the last thing we want is for people to be travelling to those areas and taking the virus with them,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. He added: It\u2019s a sacrifice for those people whose family live further than 5 miles away, I understand that, and we\u2019ll review this again in three weeks\u2019 time. But for now, stay local, keep Wales safe. Those are the key messages that we\u2019re giving people in Wales. On BBC Breakfast, Drakeford was asked why the Welsh government was not following the same measures as announced by the UK government, given the R value is similar in England and Wales. \u201cWell I could put it the other way to you \u2013 why aren\u2019t they following what\u2019s been done in other parts of the United Kingdom?\u201d he said. \u201cEngland isn\u2019t a template for the rest of the UK to follow. I think we are still moving in the same direction across the United Kingdom \u2013 we\u2019re all moving cautiously, we\u2019re all lifting lockdown \u2013 but we\u2019re applying it in our own contexts. Drakeford said pilots of Wales\u2019s test and trace system, which have been running for the past two weeks, indicate that each person with a positive test has around four or five contacts that need to be followed up. Prof Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, has said testing in care homes needs to be prioritised, and expressed fears that the test and trace scheme could result in many members of staff having to self-isolate. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, Green said testing in care homes was \u201can enormous task\u201d and that it was a not a \u201cone-time activity\u201d \u2013 there needed to be a rolling programme of testing for residents as well as staff. He said: We have got to get on top of it and we\u2019ve got to also prioritise care homes because of course it\u2019s care homes where the most vulnerable people live, so I really want to see testing ramped up. I want to see also some really clear policy on how we both test, but also track and trace, because I have real concerns that the tracking and tracing programme \u2013 unless we get proper guidance for care homes \u2013 will produce many staff having to self-isolate and that will again exacerbate the problems in care homes. But I think we\u2019ve got to get testing and it\u2019s got to be regular and it\u2019s got to be something that is continuous, and until we get that we won\u2019t get on top of this pandemic. One of the standout moments of yesterday\u2019s Downing Street briefing was Boris Johnson twice stopping his two most senior scientific advisors, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, from answering questions about Dominic Cummings. Johnson said he wanted to protect them from \u201cany political questions\u201d. However, Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the Sage subcommittee advising the government on behavioural science, says that asking whether the Cummings affair has impacted public trust in the government was, in fact, a scientific question and could reasonably be posed to the government\u2019s advisers: Reicher, of the University of St Andrews, said he believes the saga \u201cwill undermine leadership at a time when we desperately need good leadership\u201d. George Eustice\u2019s interview with Nick Robinson on BBC Radio 4 Today was beset with technical difficulties but here\u2019s a run through. On Dominic Cummings, he said the prime minister\u2019s aide had given a \u201cvery fair and detailed\u201d explanation and that \u201cit\u2019s been dealt with and we need to move on\u201d. He said he had received \u201cprobably over a hundred\u201d emails from constituents about Cummings\u2019 behaviour. Asked whether the government was easing lockdown measures too early, the environment secretary said they were being very \u201ccautious\u201d and lifting restrictions \u201ctentatively\u201d in the knowledge that transmission rates outdoors are \u201cvery, very low\u201d. He was questioned about Boris Johnson telling people in England they can have BBQs with up to six people from Monday. Was it practical to expect people to gather in their friends\u2019 or families\u2019 gardens for BBQs and expect them to fully clean the bathroom once they have been to the toilet, especially after a couple of drinks? Eustice said: That\u2019s absolutely a fair point and we just need people to be pragmatic and sensible in their approach to this. We recognise that people want to see friends and family again \u2013 that\u2019s why we said they can come together in environments if there\u2019s no more than six of them. \u201cBut look, it\u2019s up to you, somebody wants to go in to use a toilet or whatever, then they\u2019re going to do that and they just need to take precautions \u2013 use hand sanitiser, wash things down and be cautious. The environment secretary, George Eustice, has said he does not know how many people were contacted as part of the new NHS test and trace scheme on Thursday. He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cI don\u2019t know that figure, I don\u2019t have that figure to hand.\u201d Asked about the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser not being permitted to answer questions about Dominic Cummings during the Downing Street press briefing on Thursday, Eustice said: I think all the prime minister was really trying to do is to protect people who are there to give a scientific opinion and a medical opinion from what has been a bit of a political row over the last week where they need not get involved. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, has called on the attorney general, Suella Braverman, to apologise for intervening in the Dominic Cummings case. Asked whether Cummings broke the law during his trip to Durham during lockdown, Thomas-Symonds told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThe guidelines that were set up, he broke them.\u201d He added: Look I can\u2019t comment precisely on the communication between the attorney general and Durham police but what I can say for certain is this: the attorney general was wrong to be out making public statements about an individual case before even the police had made a public statement, and particularly given her role as superintendent of the Crown Prosecution Service. She shouldn\u2019t have been commenting on an individual case in those circumstances, that is to misunderstand the role of the attorney general \u2013 to give unvarnished advice to government without fear or favour \u2013 and at the bare minimum she should apologise for that. It follows Braverman\u2019s tweet on 23 May: \u201cProtecting one\u2019s family is what any good parent does. The 10DowningStreet statement clarifies the situation and it is wholly inappropriate to politicise it.\u201d As the government\u2019s chief legal adviser, part of the attorney general\u2019s role is to oversee the CPS which could have been asked to review Cummings\u2019 case had it been requested to do so. Her tweet, therefore, could be perceived as placing prosecutors under undue influence over any decision they had to make. The row over Dominic Cummings\u2019 lockdown trips is continuing, despite Boris Johnson saying at the daily Downing Street briefing last night that he intended to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the saga. Ninety-nine of his own MPs have now called for Cummings to be sacked, demanded an apology or otherwise criticised his conduct. The Daily Mail reports today that Cummings is considering quitting No 10 later this year now that the UK is finally cutting ties with the EU. Most of today\u2019s front pages carry the news that friends and family in England will be able to meet outdoors in groups of six from Monday. From today people from two different households in Scotland can meet outdoors, two metres apart, after 66 days of full lockdown.

You can find me below: Twitter: @JoshHalliday (DMs open) Email: josh.halliday@theguardian.com The environment secretary, George Eustice, is fielding questions on behalf of the government this morning. As the Dominic Cummings row enters its seventh day, Eustice tells Sky News he doesn\u2019t think the controversy \u201cshould affect at all people\u2019s approach\u201d to the lockdown Asked about the furlough scheme, Eustice said the Treasury could not subsidise people\u2019s wages \u201cindefinitely\u201d. He added: Now I don\u2019t know what Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, will say later in terms of self-employed and the furlough scheme for them, but I think there is a general overarching message here that we\u2019ve had a very generous furlough scheme in place to help people through these extraordinary times and to ensure that businesses\u2019 overheads could be covered. Eustice also confirmed that pubs with beer gardens are likely to be the first venues in the hospitality sector to reopen. Alas, he did not set a date. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK liveblog on the coronavirus pandemic. This is Josh Halliday in Manchester to steer you through the news. Later today the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will announce that employers will have to pay a fifth of the wages of furloughed staff, and national insurance and pension contributions, from August as the state subsidy scheme is wound down. Employers have furloughed 8.4 million workers and claimed up to 80% of their wages, to a maximum \u00a32,500 a month. Figures earlier this week revealed that the cost has reached \u00a315bn while a separate scheme to support self-employed workers has cost almost \u00a37bn. Leading our site this morning is Robert Booth\u2019s exclusive report that officials at Public Health England proposed a radical lockdown of care homes last month to stem surging deaths \u2013 but it was rejected by the government. The officials submitted an 11-point plan proposing a \u201cfurther lockdown of care homes\u201d on 28 April, which included staff moving in for four weeks and deploying NHS Nightingale hospitals. However, neither of the proposals were included in a subsequent action plan announced by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, last week.",

Dr Ming Lin, who spoke to the Guardian from a reservation in South Dakota, where he works intermittently in an emergency room, said at the heart of this lawsuit is the issue of healthcare workers being free to speak out about safety concerns. \u201cFor frontline workers to be threatened or silenced, it\u2019s just wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put our life out there and we should have a right to speak out if we see something that\u2019s unsafe.\u201d Dr Lin said since posting about his experience he has heard from hundreds of healthcare workers who have gone through a similar situation at other hospitals. One doctor, for example, told him about getting written up after she provided N100 masks for her nurses, while an anesthesiologist told him he was removed from his shifts when he wore an N95 mask inside an intensive care unit. \u201cI hope this lawsuit brings this to light and maybe there\u2019s some legislative change that can be done,\u201d he added. In late February, when the coronavirus outbreak in the US was just beginning, Lin said he started to grow concerned about the safety practices at PeaceHealth St Joseph medical center in Bellingham, where he had been a physician for 17 years. \u201cWe\u2019re not doing as much as we can to protect our patients and healthcare workers,\u201d he said he realized. \u201cSo I decided to go to social media.\u201d Lin started posting on his public Facebook account about not having enough protective equipment, long delays in receiving coronavirus test results, and risky virus screening practices in which patients were evaluated inside the waiting room. According to the lawsuit, he sent a message to the hospital about his concerns and received a response stating that PeaceHealth\u2019s PR department was \u201cupset\u201d. By late March, the hospital had removed Dr Lin, who has about 30 years\u2019 experience as a physician, from all of his shifts. Now he has teamed up with the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington in order to get his job back as well as monetary relief for \u201clost wages, economic damages and emotional distress\u201d, explained Jamal Whitehead, an ACLU-WA cooperating attorney. The lawsuit was also filed against Richard DeCarlo, PeaceHealth\u2019s chief operating officer, and TeamHealth, a national medical staffing company. It references the fact that the hospital and TeamHealth have no social media policies prohibiting Facebook use. Since going public with his concerns about safety practices at St Joseph, Dr Lin said the hospital had addressed all of the issues he brought up. PeaceHealth said in a statement that they asked TeamHealth to remove Dr Lin because \u201che chose to not use designated safety reporting channels, and his actions were disruptive, compromised collaboration in the midst of a crisis and contributed to the creation of fear and anxiety among staff and the community.\u201d TeamHealth said in a statement on Thursday that Dr Lin was still a paid TeamHealth physician and that they had offered to find another hospital placement for him. Dr Lin said that if he were to take another position it would mean uprooting his wife and three young children to move to another part of the country, which he described as not reasonable.",

      "body": "<p>An MP\u2019s office is a busy place at the best of times. As soon as Olivia was elected in the early hours of Friday 13 December, people began reaching out to her. Forty-eight hours later, as she made her first trip from Sheffield down to Westminster as a new MP, her inbox and parliamentary postbags were already filling up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Strip away all the traffic generated by parliamentary business in Westminster and what remains is the precious correspondence from an MP\u2019s constituents.&nbsp;Since the election we\u2019ve received well over 5,000 contacts by email, phone and post. Each separate issue raised by a constituent \u2013 which can be several letters or emails \u2013 is organised as a case. By the end of March, we had opened 1,147 cases, or 328 a month.</p> <p>During April, this case rate tripled. We opened 1,117 new cases as the Covid-19 crisis took hold. People got in touch about food support, the furlough scheme, small business loans, PPE, testing, and for help to get stranded loved ones home from overseas.&nbsp;Through May, things had settled down a little. That was until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/durham-police-believe-cummings-probably-did-break-lockdown-rules\">Dominic Cummings</a> story.&nbsp;</p> <p>Late on Saturday evening, emails with subject lines \u201cDominic Cummings\u201d, \u201cJohnson and Cummings\u201d and \u201cOutraged\u201d began appearing faster than we could clear them. By Monday our inbox was overwhelmed, and we\u2019d received so many emails with the subject line \u201cDominic Cummings\u201d that the parliamentary spam filter had incorrectly started to classify them as spam.</p> <p>An MP can only represent his or her own constituents, so we are set up to match names and addresses against the electoral roll \u2013 these are real people. My previous life was as a data scientist, and the urge to quantify what we were seeing was instinctive. Graphing the average (three-hourly) case load, the intensity is drastic. In the past few days we have regularly experienced rates well above 10 times the baseline, and that in already busy times.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/cummings_communications/giv-390241rmc1yL4bD5/\" data-alt=\"Communications graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/cummings_communications/giv-390241rmc1yL4bD5/\">Communications graphic</a> </figure>  <p>The first spike corresponds to the immediate hours following Johnson\u2019s press conference on the evening of 24 May. The following day, on Monday 25, this built again and culminated in a second spike through the immediate build-up and aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGTPehjgI84\">Cummings\u2019 rose garden address</a>. Things have showed little signs of abating in subsequent days, either.</p> <p>Graphing cumulative case loads, the impact appears equally drastic. Without the Cummings story, we were on track for around 450 cases in May. In just five days, a single issue in itself will have not far off doubled our case load for the entire month. That is, of course, not to mention the strength of feeling. So many people had their own stories of suffering. Many started by saying it was the first time they had written to their MP. Every single email was written personally. For all Boris Johnson\u2019s insistence that Cummings had relied on his \u201cinstinct\u201d as a father, so many instinctively felt what he had done was wrong. In fact, just three people came out in support.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/cummings_caseloads/giv-3902RkJWxfI2kRFJ/\" data-alt=\"Office caseload revised\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/cummings_caseloads/giv-3902RkJWxfI2kRFJ/\">Office caseload revised</a> </figure>  <p>Counting the cases gives a real sense of the scale of people\u2019s feeling.

      "bodyText": "An MP\u2019s office is a busy place at the best of times. As soon as Olivia was elected in the early hours of Friday 13 December, people began reaching out to her. Forty-eight hours later, as she made her first trip from Sheffield down to Westminster as a new MP, her inbox and parliamentary postbags were already filling up. Strip away all the traffic generated by parliamentary business in Westminster and what remains is the precious correspondence from an MP\u2019s constituents. Since the election we\u2019ve received well over 5,000 contacts by email, phone and post. Each separate issue raised by a constituent \u2013 which can be several letters or emails \u2013 is organised as a case. By the end of March, we had opened 1,147 cases, or 328 a month. During April, this case rate tripled. We opened 1,117 new cases as the Covid-19 crisis took hold. People got in touch about food support, the furlough scheme, small business loans, PPE, testing, and for help to get stranded loved ones home from overseas. Through May, things had settled down a little. That was until the Dominic Cummings story. Late on Saturday evening, emails with subject lines \u201cDominic Cummings\u201d, \u201cJohnson and Cummings\u201d and \u201cOutraged\u201d began appearing faster than we could clear them. By Monday our inbox was overwhelmed, and we\u2019d received so many emails with the subject line \u201cDominic Cummings\u201d that the parliamentary spam filter had incorrectly started to classify them as spam. An MP can only represent his or her own constituents, so we are set up to match names and addresses against the electoral roll \u2013 these are real people. My previous life was as a data scientist, and the urge to quantify what we were seeing was instinctive. Graphing the average (three-hourly) case load, the intensity is drastic. In the past few days we have regularly experienced rates well above 10 times the baseline, and that in already busy times. The first spike corresponds to the immediate hours following Johnson\u2019s press conference on the evening of 24 May. The following day, on Monday 25, this built again and culminated in a second spike through the immediate build-up and aftermath of Cummings\u2019 rose garden address. Things have showed little signs of abating in subsequent days, either. Graphing cumulative case loads, the impact appears equally drastic. Without the Cummings story, we were on track for around 450 cases in May. In just five days, a single issue in itself will have not far off doubled our case load for the entire month. That is, of course, not to mention the strength of feeling. So many people had their own stories of suffering. Many started by saying it was the first time they had written to their MP. Every single email was written personally. For all Boris Johnson\u2019s insistence that Cummings had relied on his \u201cinstinct\u201d as a father, so many instinctively felt what he had done was wrong. In fact, just three people came out in support. Counting the cases gives a real sense of the scale of people\u2019s feeling. The content, of course, must be read carefully and acted upon by an MP and their team. When things settle and time permits, data scientists may well measure the sentiment contained within the unstructured text data itself \u2013 analysing the frequency of words such as \u201cdisgusted\u201d and \u201coutraged\u201d. I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll find it\u2019s off the charts. \u2022 The final graph in this article was amended on 1 June 2020 to correct an error in the labelling.",

But until large gatherings and gigs happen again, there are small things you can do: it\u2019s an imperfect solution, but streaming Australian music can help. Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia will add some 15 new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat. \u201cAustralian music needs all the help it can get right now,\u201d says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who\u2019ve played Sound Australia events. \u201cStreaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Northern Age was founded in Townsville in the 1890s \u2013 there are conflicting reports of the precise date \u2013 in what was still the Colony of Queensland. It was moved to Ingham, just north of Townsville, then the smaller neighboring town of Halifax, changing its name to the Planter, and perhaps the Northern Planter, before returning to Ingham for good. From 1904 until last Wednesday, through world wars, depressions, and four Foley Shield championships for the Herbert River Tigers, it was published as the Herbert River Express. Now its current owners, News Corp, have shuttered it for good, along with 111 other community and regional newspapers. The masthead will disappear and its coverage will be folded into the Townsville Bulletin\u2019s website. No longer a newspaper, the Express will not even have its own URL. Ingham and the surrounding region will no longer have a newsroom of its own. There\u2019s something to say about media ownership regulations that allow so much civic and cultural heritage to be entrusted to a single, profit-driven entity. But even if News was not always the best custodian of local newspapers, owners can change, unless capacity is lost. News Corp is not alone in closing papers. Australia is not alone in wondering what to do when local news disappears, and entire communities are left without newsrooms. We need to understand how advanced the rot already is in Australia, and how much damage has been wrought in 2020 alone. The Public Interest Journalism Institute tracks Australian newsroom closures in their Australian Newsroom Mapping Project. Their latest data, due to be published next week, paints an ugly picture. According to their research and projects manager, Gary Dickson, in 2020 so far, dozens of newspapers have vanished or been seriously diminished. In an email Dickson told me that nine mastheads have merged into other properties. Ninety-one papers have ended print editions. One newsroom (10 Daily) has closed entirely. And 20 mastheads have closed (19 News Corp regional newspapers announced on Thursday, and Buzzfeed Australia). Disproportionately, masthead closures have taken place in Queensland. The pandemic has struck at the news industry in the United States, as well. US journalism-focused non-profit the Poynter Institute reports that 30 local newsrooms have closed or disappeared in mergers during pandemic lockdowns. Some, like the Daily Iowegian of Centerville, Iowa, and the Knoxville Journal Express, had been publishing since the Civil War, or earlier. Elsewhere, Poynter keeps a running list of the newspapers, publishers and broadcasters which have closed, reduced printing days, or shed staff during the Covid-19 emergency. The carnage is also reaching into world cities which are crucial to the US economy. In Palo Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, the Daily Post will only be printing four days a week. The San Francisco Examiner has cut staff. The New York Post has furloughed or laid off reporters. Media researchers use a term, \u201cnews deserts\u201d, to capture the status of communities that aren\u2019t served by a dedicated print news outlet. Already, by 2018, 171 counties in the US had no newspaper at all; 1,449 had only one, usually a weekly. New figures on news deserts are yet to be calculated, but there are sure to be more of them in the US and Australia. The term may not be quite adequate because, in a way, it may be overly optimistic. It\u2019s not quite true that news stops flowing in a town with no paper. Rather, that community loses an institution that, whatever its biases may have been, had ethical and legal imperatives to verify the information that it published. Inhabitants of news deserts do not suffer from a lack of information. They suffer from a dearth of relevant, factual information about the communities they live in. The void left by local news might be partly filled by national news outlets \u2014 the loss of a newspaper does not mean the loss of a cable subscription or an internet connection. Small town audiences can watch CNN, Fox News or Sky; they can also browse news.com.au or the New York Times. Of course, those outlets will not cover council meetings, local courts, or local economies. They will not carry wedding or funeral announcements from Tully or Topeka. And national outlets themselves are often far from financially secure. Moreover, US studies suggest that in the absence of local news, national news can exacerbate the partisan polarisation that contributes to America\u2019s political gridlock, and in turn to its increasing political instability. The question of the relationship between political attitudes and media consumption can easily become a fruitless chicken and egg discussion. But we do know that when it comes to national media, in many western democracies, people with political differences inhabit distinct informational universes. The 2019 Reuters\u2019 Institute Digital News Report shows how people with \u201cpopulist attitudes\u201d in Europe and the US are more likely than non-populists to get their news from television or Facebook, and less likely to get it from print sources. Data from the UK suggests that when \u201cpopulists\u201d do consult print sources, they strongly favour tabloid newspapers such as the Sun. In the US, \u201cpopulists\u201d gravitate to Fox News and websites such as Breitbart, neither of which offer dedicated local news reporting, and each of which, far from seeking to tamp down on political polarisation, have incorporated it into their business model. For all the flaws of national media, a worse alternative exists for newspaperless towns. News deserts may provide particularly hospitable soil for a bloom of mis- and disinformation, fertilised by social media. Social media is already outstripping embattled local outlets as a source of news for many people in many countries. To the extent that local newspapers still exist, evidence suggests that their reach as a news medium is smaller than that of social media, and has been for some time. In Australia, again according to the Reuters News Institute report, the nationwide weekly reach of local newspapers was just 20%; regional news networks Win and Prime7 just 10%; whereas 36% said they got news from Facebook. In the US, local newspapers had a 20% weekly reach, and local newspaper websites 10%, but 39% of people said they got news from Facebook. The trouble with that is that Facebook and other social media companies are not liable for the torrent of disinformation that cascades across their platforms, and they have only intermittently devoted attention and resources to cleaning up their act. This reluctance to take on disinformation has had serious consequences, large and small. Facebook has been used to organise genocidal attacks on minorities in countries such as Myanmar. It has been connected with a rise in vaccine hesitancy, which may yet cruel our chances of defeating the coronavirus. It has been an effective platform for extremist groups around the world. Groups or pages devoted to local communities are prey to the conspiracy thinking, fake news, and polarisation that affects every other part of Facebook. And in the absence of a local newsroom, there\u2019s no obstacle to disinformation taking hold. The coronavirus emergency has dramatised this. In the US, people have poured into state capitals to demonstrate against pandemic precautions derived from the advice of public health experts. Antivaxxers and conspiracy theorists have been front and centre at the events. Facebook has played a crucial role in allowing the anti-lockdown movement to organise at a local level.

It does feel that the openness is not there.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Allyson Pollock,&nbsp;director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, said the lack of transparency was concerning at a critical time when testing was required to ensure restrictions can be eased safely without triggering a resurgence of infections.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea whether we\u2019ve got adequate testing [for track and trace] because we just don\u2019t have enough information,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should know how many people&nbsp;have been tested, why they\u2019ve been tested, where they\u2019ve been tested, who has done the test, the test results. We haven\u2019t got those figures.\u201d</p> <p>The latest figures provide the number of people tested in Pillar 1 (people in hospital and health and care workers), but not for Pillar 2 (tests for the wider population carried out at drive-through centres or through home testing) or overall figures. These numbers were last made available on 22 May.</p> <p>The Department of Health website states: \u201cReporting on the number of people tested has been temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting across all pillars.\u201d</p> <p>The most recent available figures for Pillar 2 show that there had been around 1.6 million tests to date, but just 1.1 million people tested in this category. The gap of roughly 500,000 is understood to be accounted for by people who have had retests and because tests mailed out for home testing and to satellite labs are only counted as \u201cpeople tested\u201d once they return to the system.</p> <p>Only a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of people in Pillar 2 have retests, according to the Department of Health, suggesting that hundreds of thousands of tests mailed out to homes and satellite labs \u2013 potentially more than a third of those mailed out \u2013 had not returned to the system by last week.</p> <p>\u201cIf this service is working properly we need to know that the tests are being done and not just disappearing into the postal service never to be seen again,\u201d said Hunter.</p> <p>The Department of Health declined to say how many tests have been mailed out, but have not returned to the system or are awaiting use in satellite laboratories.</p>",

No 10 insisted that it was \u201con target\u201d to hit 200,000 daily tests by 1 June, as promised by health secretary Matt Hancock. However, no figure for the total number of people tested was provided \u2013 and hasn\u2019t been for a week \u2013 which experts said makes it impossible to judge whether an adequate regime is in place to support the newly launched test-and-trace system. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: \u201cWhether or not the Department of Health is trying to hide these figures ... not making them publicly available could be perceived as that. \u201cIf the government is setting targets that it\u2019s then going to judge itself by, the results should be publicly available so that people outside the small group of advisers to the government are able to judge them independently. It does feel that the openness is not there.\u201d Prof Allyson Pollock, director of the Newcastle University Centre for Excellence in Regulatory Science, said the lack of transparency was concerning at a critical time when testing was required to ensure restrictions can be eased safely without triggering a resurgence of infections. \u201cI have no idea whether we\u2019ve got adequate testing [for track and trace] because we just don\u2019t have enough information,\u201d she said. \u201cWe should know how many people have been tested, why they\u2019ve been tested, where they\u2019ve been tested, who has done the test, the test results. We haven\u2019t got those figures.\u201d The latest figures provide the number of people tested in Pillar 1 (people in hospital and health and care workers), but not for Pillar 2 (tests for the wider population carried out at drive-through centres or through home testing) or overall figures. These numbers were last made available on 22 May. The Department of Health website states: \u201cReporting on the number of people tested has been temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting across all pillars.\u201d The most recent available figures for Pillar 2 show that there had been around 1.6 million tests to date, but just 1.1 million people tested in this category. The gap of roughly 500,000 is understood to be accounted for by people who have had retests and because tests mailed out for home testing and to satellite labs are only counted as \u201cpeople tested\u201d once they return to the system. Only a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of people in Pillar 2 have retests, according to the Department of Health, suggesting that hundreds of thousands of tests mailed out to homes and satellite labs \u2013 potentially more than a third of those mailed out \u2013 had not returned to the system by last week. \u201cIf this service is working properly we need to know that the tests are being done and not just disappearing into the postal service never to be seen again,\u201d said Hunter. The Department of Health declined to say how many tests have been mailed out, but have not returned to the system or are awaiting use in satellite laboratories.",

You can follow developments from around the world in our new live blog here: Here\u2019s a summary of the latest news: The US president says he is terminating the nation\u2019s relationship with the World Health Organization. Donald Trump, who has previously threatened to withhold funding from the organisation, says the US will redirect the money to other bodies. The death toll in Brazil exceeds that of Spain as the country becomes the world\u2019s fifth-worst affected. Reuters reports that Brazil\u2019s health ministry has said another 1,124 people have died, taking the total number of fatalities to 27,878. That surpasses the 27,121 deaths that researchers at Johns Hopkins University believe Spain has suffered. The UK government is lifting lockdown restrictions too early, another member of its own advisory committee warns. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), voices approval of comments made by his Sage colleague Prof John Edmunds, who said the government is \u201ctaking risks\u201d by relaxing measures from Monday. A senior Downing Street aide did not follow the spirit of the UK\u2019s lockdown rules with his actions , the former prime minister Theresa May says. Her successor, Boris Johnson, has refused to sack Dominic Cummings, despite anecdotal evidence lending weight to experts\u2019 concerns his transgressions are harming the country\u2019s public health efforts during an epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people in the country. Worshippers in Turkey hold their first communal Friday prayers in 74 days as the government reopens some mosques. Prayers are held in the courtyards of selected mosques to minimise the risk of infection. Authorities distribute masks at the entrance to the mosques, spray hand sanitisers, and check temperatures. And you can see a summary of some of the earlier events here. The death toll in Brazil exceeds that of Spain as the country becomes the fifth-worst affected. Reuters reports that Brazil\u2019s health ministry has said another 1,124 people have died, taking the total number of fatalities to 27,878. That surpasses the 27,121 deaths researchers at Johns Hopkins University believe Spain has suffered. Brazil, which now has the second-largest outbreak in the world, also registered 26,928 additional cases. British experts have warned of the folly of terminating Washington\u2019s relationship with the WHO during a pandemic. Dr Stephen Griffin, an associate professor in the School of Medicine, University of Leeds, said: There is no logic to the move by President Trump to sever links with the WHO. Pandemics are, by definition, a global crisis. To not face Covid-19 with a united front seems futile. Given the scale of the outbreak in the US, this action appears nothing short of an attempt to refocus attention away from how this has been handled. Dr Gail Carson, the director of network development at the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, said during a pandemic is not the time to make health political. The consultant in infectious diseases at the University of Oxford, added: If there was a time not to make health political it is now, when the world is in the throes of a pandemic. Now is the time for solidarity and to stand together to end the pandemic as soon as we can and to save lives. Is this US government decision going to do good to all? WHO stands for the health of all of us and should not be \u2018punished\u2019 by any country in the middle of a pandemic because of an opinion, certainly not before any action review process has taken place. Now is not the time to weaken the world\u2019s leading health agency, who has shown strong leadership with strong technical messages throughout this pandemic. Sir Jeremy\u2019s comments appeared to be a reference to those made by Edmunds; a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was quoted as saying: We cannot relax our guard by very much at all. There are still 8,000 new infections every day in England without counting those in hospitals and care homes. If you look at it internationally, it\u2019s a very high level of incidence. The issue is, clearly there\u2019s a need to try and get the economy restarted and people back to their jobs and so on, and also there\u2019s a social and a mental health need to allow people to meet with their friends and families. I think many of us would prefer to see the incidence driven down to lower levels because that then means that we have fewer cases occurring before we relax the measures. I think at the moment, with relatively high incidence and relaxing the measures and also with an untested track and trace system, I think we are taking some risk here. The UK government is lifting lockdown restrictions too early, a member of its own advisory committee has warned. Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has tweeted what appears to be a reference to comments made by his Sage colleague Prof John Edmunds, who said the government is \u201ctaking risks\u201d by relaxing measures from Monday. Sir Jeremy also said the newly-introduced NHS test and trace system needed to be \u201cfully working\u201d before measures were eased. Egypt registered 1,289 new cases and 34 deaths, the health ministry has said, marking another record of daily increases on both counts despite stricter curfew rules. That brought the total number of fatalities to 879 and confirmed cases to 22,082, of which 5,511 people have recovered. Infections rose this week during Eid al-Fitr celebrations, at the end of the Ramadan fasting month, despite the government bringing forward a curfew by four hours to 5pm (EET, 4pm BST) and banning public transport for six days since Sunday. Trump\u2019s announcement that he is pulling the US out of the WHO came three weeks ahead of an ultimatum he laid down earlier this month. On 19 May, the US president sent a four-page letter to the WHO director general Dr Tedros warning he would permanently cut US funding of the WHO and reconsider US membership if the organisation did \u201cnot commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days\u201d. He has made the break only 10 days later, falsely claiming that \u201cChina has total control over\u201d the global health body. Trump said: We have detailed the reforms that it must make and engage with them directly, but they have refused to act because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms. We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs. The move will confirm the suspicions of many in the WHO and in western capitals that the US was seeking reforms and a dialogue was a smokescreen for a politically-motivated break with the WHO. Beth Cameron, a biologist and former senior official in the National Security Council tweeted: A senior Downing Street aide did not follow the spirit of the UK\u2019s lockdown rules when he made repeated trips away from his residence, the former prime minister Theresa May has said. Her successor, Boris Johnson, has refused to sack Dominic Cummings, despite anecdotal evidence lending weight to experts\u2019 concerns his transgressions are harming the country\u2019s public health efforts during an epidemic that has killed tens of thousands of people in the country. Among various defences put forward by Johnson\u2019s allies was the claim that Cummings had not breached the government-ordered lockdown in either its letter or spirit. Police have since concluded his actions might have breached the country\u2019s lockdown rules, tempering their language only for fear of police officers being considered to have declared him guilty without a trial. In a letter to her constituents seen by the Daily Mirror, May said she can \u201cwell understand the anger\u201d of people who obeyed the guidance. What this matter has shown is that there was a discrepancy between the simple messages given by the government and the details of the legislation passed by parliament. In these circumstances, I do not feel that Mr Cummings followed the spirit of the guidance. I can well understand the anger of those who have been abiding by the spirit of the guidance given by the government and expect others to do so. May said the focus on Cummings was \u201cdetracting from the most important task\u201d of dealing with the epidemic. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Donald Trump said he was terminating the US\u2019 relationship with the World Health Organization. Trump, who has previously said he would withhold funding from the organisation, says the US will now redirect funds to other bodies. Russia suffered its biggest daily increase in deaths, with 232 more in 24 hours pushing the nationwide total to 4,374. Officials say 8,572 new infections have been confirmed, bringing the national tally to 387,623. Russia has the third highest reported total of cases in the world after the United States and Brazil. Iran identified more new coronavirus cases in a day than at any time since early April, with 2,819 more people testing positive on Friday. Kianoush Jahanpour, the Iranian health ministry spokesman, said that 50 more people had died in the same period, raising the total death toll to 7,677. Out of 146,668 cases, 114,931 people have recovered. Health authorities in South Africa said the country has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed tests as it and other countries on the continent face difficulties in obtaining essential supplies. \u201cThis challenge is caused by the limited availability of test kits globally,\u201d the health ministry said. Plans to reopen more than 800 schools in South Korea were shelved as the country battled a renewed outbreak. The country\u2019s easing of lockdown measures went into reverse, with museums, parks and art galleries closed again on Friday for two weeks amid a resurgence in infections. It was originally reported only 200 schools due to reopen would remain closed. A Nordic rift opened up over proposals to ease coronavirus border restrictions, with Sweden excluded from Norwegian and Danish plans to reopen to tourists from some countries next month. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, and the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, say most restrictions will end on 15 June. UK, France, Spain and Italy were among the countries excluded from Greece\u2019s border reopening. The country to reopen its airports in Athens and Thessaloniki to arrivals from 29 countries from 15 June, the start of the tourist season. Visitors from 16 EU countries \u2013 including Germany, Austria and Denmark \u2013 will be allowed in. Only half of the people in the UK who develop symptoms were self-isolating for at least a week, according to the government\u2019s scientific advisers. The revelation raises questions about the success of the country\u2019s test, trace and isolate strategy, which scientists say is needed to contain future outbreaks. Employers will be asked to contribute to pay the wages of staff sent home under the The UK\u2019s furlough scheme, the country\u2019s chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said, adding that it cannot continue indefinitely. Employers will be asked to pay national insurance and employer pension contributions from August and towards people\u2019s wages in September. Making the announcement earlier, Trump accused the WHO of failing to adequately respond to the pandemic because he believes it is controlled by China. He also noted that the body was much more dependent on funding from Washington than on that from Beijing. The US is the largest single source of financial support to the WHO and its exit is expected to significantly weaken the organisation. Trump also mischaracterised the WHO\u2019s recommendations on travel restrictions, claiming it had strongly resisted his early efforts to ban travel from China. In reality, the WHO\u2019s director general suggested international travel bans were of limited public health benefit and could be counter-productive, but did not call for them to be abandoned altogether. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that, where restrictions were introduced, they should be limited and proportionate. The Trump administration introduced limited restrictions, which came later date than those put in place by many other nations. Trump, who was still publicly dismissing the virus as a \u201choax\u201d when the WHO raised the global risk to its highest level, alleged that the body had misled the world on the dangers in the early stages, under pressure from Beijing\u2019s officials, whom he also accused of ignoring their reporting obligations to the WHO. Trump, who has been embroiled in a long-running diplomatic clash with Beijing, has criticised the WHO for being too forgiving of China since the outbreak began. As he faces criticism of his handling of the epidemic in the US, he has sought to highlight China\u2019s status as the pandemic\u2019s origin. In mid-April, Trump announced the US was freezing payments to the WHO for 60 to 90 days pending a review of the organisation\u2019s handling of the crisis. The US president Donald Trump has said he is terminating the nation\u2019s relationship with the World Health Organization. Trump, who has threatened to withhold funding from the organisation, says the US will redirect funds to other bodies. The pharmaceutical company Sanofi has temporarily stopped recruiting new Covid-19 patients for two clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine and will no longer supply the anti-malaria drug to treat Covid-19 until concerns about safety are cleared up, it has said. The moves come after the World Health Organization paused its large trial of hydroxychloroquine, prompting several European governments to ban the use of the drug, also used in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. That dealt a major blow to hopes for a treatment, touted by the US president Donald Trump, as drugmakers and governments race to find ways to treat patients and control the spread of the virus. Portugal has given the green light to the third phase of its lockdown exit, but some restrictions will remain in Lisbon due to localised outbreaks in industrial hubs and outskirts. From 1 June, shopping malls, childcare centres, gyms, cinemas, theatres and other cultural venues can reopen across most of the country but with capacity restrictions. Gatherings of up to 20 people will be allowed, and the 50% capacity rule on restaurants in place since their reopening on 18 May will be lifted. But in Greater Lisbon, where most recently reported cases were located, gatherings remain limited to ten people, and shopping malls stay closed until at least Thursday. The country\u2019s prime minister Antonio Costa said: Unfortunately, the evolution in Lisbon is significantly different from the rest of the country. But as I said at the beginning, I have no shame in taking a step back if necessary. The UK\u2019s prime minister Boris Johnson and Turkey\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have discussed the pandemic this evening, Downing Street says. A spokeswoman said: The two leaders agreed on the importance of working together internationally to deal with and defeat the coronavirus pandemic. They discussed the importance of the UK and Turkey\u2019s economic and trade relationship and their shared goal to build on it in the future. They also agreed to keep working together on important regional and geopolitical issues, including the crises in Libya and Syria. The prime minister extended an invitation to President Erdo\u011fan to attend the UK-hosted Global Vaccine Summit on 4 June, which aims to raise vital funds to save the lives of millions of children around the world. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Russia suffered its biggest daily increase in deaths, with 232 more in 24 hours pushing the nationwide total to 4,374. Officials say 8,572 new infections have been confirmed, bringing the national tally to 387,623. Russia has the third highest reported total of cases in the world after the United States and Brazil.

We often report news from Sweden, which as a country which has not imposed mandatory measures to curb the spread of coronavirus is a subject of intense interest for those following the outbreak\u2019s spread around the world. However, little is said about another European country that has done even less to respond to the outbreak. Belarus - labelled \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictatorship\u201d by some observers - has made almost no changes to adapt to the Covid-19 pandemic. Belarus has stood out for its lack of official response since the start of the pandemic, with Alexander Lukashenko, who has been president since 1995, repeatedly disputing the seriousness of the virus. The country has ignored insistent calls from the World Health Organisation to implement social distancing and ban mass events, holding a large military parade in the capital Minsk, on 9 May. Presidential elections are scheduled for 9 August and candidates are campaigning as normal. On Friday, the health ministry reported 906 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the total in the country of 9.5 million to 40,765, according to Russia\u2019s Tass news agency. The daily death toll was five on Friday, down from a peak of seven on 12 May, adding to an official total of 224 since the outbreak began. Earlier this week, AFP, the French news agency, reported that volunteer groups in the countries had stepped in to bring supplies of protective equipment to hospitals. Its reporter met a group called ByCovid1, who were taking sacks of protective suits and face masks, funded by donations, to a hospital in the small town of Chervyen, about 40 miles west of the capital Minsk. One of the coordinators, Andrei Tkachev, told AFP the true scale of the outbreak could be much higher. \u201cUnfortunately the statistics from the hospitals are very depressing. And they are different from what is published officially: they are much worse,\u201d he said. Greece might be high on the list of many people\u2019s summer holiday destinations, but for Britons dreaming of getting away the country will be out of reach for some time yet, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. The UK was not included on a list of 29 countries released by Athens on Friday deemed to fit an \u201cepidemiological profile\u201d that makes travel from them relatively safe. However, people from European countries including Albania, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Norway Romania and Serbia \u2013 which like Greece have kept coronavirus infection rates and casualties low \u2013 will be allowed to fly in from 15 June. And further afield, residents of Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, South Korea were also told they could visit. But the epidemiological profile \u201csadly\u201d did not apply to Britain, said government officials, aware that the UK is one of Greece\u2019s biggest markets. Last year close to 4 million Britons travelled to Greece, with most heading to its extensive archipelago, which has remained remarkably Covid-free. As Madrid\u2019s spring evenings warm into summer nights, cinemagoers are parking up to watch Grease. In Munich, they are taking al fresco seats to follow the adventures of a communist kangaroo with a penchant for boozy chocolates, and in Prague they are witnessing a croaky vigilante work out some profound childhood traumas. As Europe begins to stir from its Covid-19 lockdown, people bloated by two-month boxset binges have a new way to feed their entertainment needs as they emerge, blinking, into the daylight. Or, rather, the twilight. Openair cinemas in Spain, Germany, the Czech Republic and Greece have reopened in recent days, albeit at reduced capacity and with the novel strictures of physical distancing. Our reporters in the three countries have investigated Europe\u2019s new entertainment boom. Young doctors and medical students across Italy threw their white coats on the ground on Friday to call for educational reform and for scholarships allowing them to specialise. Many of the doctors and students involved in the protests helped care for patients during Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 32,000 people. They are complaining of training bottlenecks that prevent them from choosing a focus, even as over 10,000 specialists are set to retire in the next five years, AFP reports. Only about 4,000 specialisation grants are allotted by the government, a number far lower than those doctors who want to specialise. That forces many of them to leave Italy for further training abroad, depleting the country of valuable medical expertise. \u201cThe efforts and sacrifices that health workers have made in recent months must not remain in vain, which is why serious medical training reform is urgent and necessary,\u201d organisers wrote in a statement. \u201cBy 2025, more than 60% of our specialist and general practitioner colleagues will retire. Given the current health policy, there will not be enough staff to replace them. \u201cThe right to health care and health of all citizens will therefore be jeopardised.\u201d The one-day protest took place in 21 Italian cities, including Naples, Bologna, Genoa, Turin, Florence and Palermo. Worshippers in Turkey have held their first communal Friday prayers in 74 days after the government reopened some mosques, the Associated Press reports. Prayers were held in the courtyards of selected mosques, to minimise the risk of infection, according to the US news agency. Authorities distributed masks at the entrance to the mosques, sprayed hand sanitisers, and checked temperatures. Worshippers were asked to bring their own prayer rugs, but some mosques offered disposable paper rugs which were placed 1.5 metres apart. Later on Friday, Islamic prayers will also be recited in Istanbul\u2019s 6th-century Hagia Sophia \u2014 the main cathedral of the Byzantine Empire which was converted into a mosque with the Ottoman conquest of the city, then known as Constantinople, in 1453. The prayers are being held to mark the 567th anniversary of the conquest. The Muslim prayers at the Hagia Sophia are highly controversial, hitting at the heart of the country\u2019s religious-secular divide. In 1935, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the Turkish republic\u2019s founder, converted the building into a museum that attracts millions of tourists, but some Islamic groups want it reconverted into a mosque. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who leads an Islamic-oriented party and has himself recited prayers inside Hagia Sophia, has also spoken about the possibility of turning the domed complex back into a place of worship. Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, has more details on the decision by Denmark and Norway to exclude Sweden from plans to drop mutual border controls, after Sweden chose a different approach to tackling its Covid-19 outbreak. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, told a news conference in Copenhagen on Friday that restrictions on Norwegian nationals entering the country, as well as on citizens of Iceland and Germany, would be lifted from 15 June. \u201cDenmark and Sweden have a close relationship and that will continue in the future,\u201d Frederiksen said. There was \u201ca strong desire to find a solution with our neighbour, Sweden\u201d, she added, but Denmark and Sweden \u201care in different places when it comes to the coronavirus, and this affects what we can decide on the border\u201d. Norway\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, said at a simultaneous Oslo event that Norway would admit only Danish citizens for now, but that her government was talking to Sweden, Finland and Iceland about including them at a later date. Solberg said she had twice spoken to the Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, but had entered a bilateral agreement with Denmark \u201cbecause we have a similar infection situation \u2026 The infection situation looks different in Sweden\u201d. While her objective was \u201ca common Nordic regulatory framework\u201d, she said, \u201cit is going to be hardest to find a solution for Sweden. But there are regions in Sweden with a low level of infection where we might be able to find a solution.\u201d Mexico\u2019s president has announced plans for a seven-day, seven-city tour \u2013 which comes as the country\u2019s Covid-19 cases and death toll continue to climb, writes David Agren in Mexico City. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador unveiled details at his Friday press conference, saying he would start in Canc\u00fan on Monday and oversee progress on a suite of mega projects he\u2019s pushed since taking office. The projects included a train around the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and a behemoth refinery in his home state of Tabasco. Those projects have raised environmental concerns and objections from indigenous communities, but have been protected by the president, who spared them from the austerity measures he\u2019s implemented in response to Covid-19. AMLO, as the president is known, announced his plans for a tour on the same day health and education officials unveiled details on Mexico\u2019s return to the \u201cnew normalcy,\u201d which begins June 1. That normalcy will commence with 31 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states under maximum alert, according to a system developed by the health secretariat. Schools will also resume in August \u2013 not on Monday as originally proposed. The health secretariat revealed on Thursday that the Covid-19 death toll had topped 9,000 and the country recorded a record number of new cases. AMLO has courted controversy with his past tours. He held a series of rallies in mid-March as the pandemic was descending on Mexico \u2013 even posting videos of him kissing babies and posing for selfies. He later detoured from a tour in Sinaloa to greet the mother of drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. The country\u2019s coronavirus tsar Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell later defended AMLO\u2019s actions, saying, \u201cThe president\u2019s force is moral, not a force of contagion.\u201d A flight carrying 12 tons of humanitarian aid is scheduled to land in Venezuela on Friday, to assist the sanction-hit country in its response to the Covid-19 outbreak, the UN\u2019s aid agency said. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the UN\u2019s office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) has arranged for more than 100 tons of aid to Venezuela, which remains subject to a trade embargo by the US. Venezuela has so far been spared an outbreak on the scale experienced by some of its neighbours in the region, recording 1,325 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 11 deaths (figures that have been questioned by Human Rights Watch). However, lockdowns imposed across the continent have spurred hundreds of thousands of people who had left the country to escape its economic crisis to return, putting additional strain on services. Peter Grohmann, the UN\u2019s resident coordinator and humanitarian coordinator in Venezuela, said: This is the second humanitarian shipment from the United Nations in support of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic and its socio-economic impact in Venezuela. These vital supplies will help provide nutrition assistance and access to safe water to thousands of families and will be distributed to health centers and the most vulnerable communities. I would like to thank the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for its efforts and for providing the transport for this important shipment that will help save many lives. Users of illicit drugs in Europe are facing higher prices and reduced purity for some drugs, amid local shortages caused by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, according a European Union report published on Friday. Nevertheless, according to the Europol and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the EU drugs agency, organised crime groups have remained \u201cactive and resilient\u201d even during the pandemic, by \u201cadapting transportation methods, trafficking routes and concealment methods.\u201d The findings, based on a survey of drugs experts in EU member states, show that disruption to the drugs supply chain has mostly been at the distribution level, as a result of social distancing, while wholesale trafficking continues largely at pre-pandemic levels. \u201cWith street dealing severely affected by restrictions on movement, consumers and dealers are increasingly turning to alternative methods, including the use of darknet markets, social media platforms and encrypted communication apps, with cashless payments and fewer face-to-face interactions,\u201d the agencies said in a release. Europol\u2019s executive director, Catherine De Bolle, said: The pandemic has had a major impact on our lives and is slowing down our economy. However, this economic trend has not been seen in international drug trafficking. These illegal markets continue to generate huge profits, including during the pandemic. Seizures of illegal drugs in some EU countries during the first half of 2020 have been higher than in the same months of previous years. More than ever, these findings should motivate us to ensure that any recovery from the pandemic is accompanied by a strong and effective international law enforcement response. We need to establish that drug traffickers do not benefit from the potential social and economic consequences of the current crisis. Here\u2019s a link to the full report. Greece is to reopen its airports in Athens and Thessaloniki to arrivals from 29 countries from 15 June, the start of the tourist season, AFP reports. Visitors will be from 16 EU countries, including Germany, Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Czech Republic, Baltic countries, Cyprus and Malta, the tourism ministry said in a statement. Countries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic - such as France, Spain, UK and Italy - were not on the list. Outside the European Union, holidaymakers from Switzerland, Norway, and neighbouring Balkan countries such as Albania, Serbia and North Macedonia will be allowed to land. Also on the list are Australia, Japan, Israel, Lebanon, China, New Zealand and South Korea. The ministry said that further countries could be added before 1 July when the country\u2019s regional airports also reopen. \u201cThe list... has been drawn up on the basis of the epidemiological profile of each country,\u201d taking into account the recommendations of the European Aviation Safety Agency and a report by Greece\u2019s commission for infectious diseases, the statement said. Visitors would be tested for the novel coronavirus when they landed. In light of the changes to border restrictions in the Nordic area, Antonia Wilson, the Guardian\u2019s travel reporter, has updated our guide to European coronavirus lockdown easing measures and travel restrictions across Europe. More from Sweden, where the two biggest opposition parties have called for an independent commission to probe the country\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. The conservative Moderate party and the populist Sweden Democrats on Friday said they wanted a commission in place before the summer, French news agency AFP reports. The prime minister, Stefan Lofven, a Social Democrat, has repeatedly expressed support for a commission but has said he would appoint one after the pandemic was over. Despite criticism from overseas and some domestic public disquiet, there has been broad political unity over Sweden\u2019s softer approach to the outbreak, but most parties have agreed on the need to examine the government\u2019s crisis management. Sweden, which on Friday reported 4,350 COVID-19 deaths, has struggled to protect its elderly from the illness, with more than three-quarters of the dead residing in nursing homes or receiving at-home care. A commission would also be likely to examine the country\u2019s economic response to the crisis, and its slow roll-out of testing for the illness. The World Health Organization\u2019s coronavirus briefing has started. You can watch it in the player embedded at the top of the blog. In today\u2019s briefing, the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, will be joined by Carlos Alvarado, the president of Costa Rica, as they announce the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, \u201can initiative aimed at making vaccines, tests, treatments and other health technologies to fight Covid-19 accessible to all\u201d. Twenty-five people have been arrested in Moscow and St Petersburg after staging protests against the arrest of a prominent journalist, in violation of Russia\u2019s coronavirus restrictions, the Associated Press reports. An opposition Moscow city council member, several journalists and activists were among those detained, the US news agency said, citing the OVD-Info rights group said. Three people were reportedly let go, while others were taken to police stations. The activists were protesting against the arrest of journalist Ilya Azar, who was sentenced to 15 days in jail the night before, also for holding a one-man protest amid the lockdown. Moscow has banned mass public events to curb the spread of the coronavirus. On Tuesday, Azar came to the city\u2019s police headquarters to protest against the jailing, on extortion charges, of an activist who monitors police corruption. His arrest elicited outrage among journalists and opposition activists. On Thursday, 13 people were detained for picketing the police headquarters. Moscow has significantly revised its mortality statistics for the coronavirus outbreak from April amid scrutiny that the government numbers were not reflecting Russia\u2019s true death toll from the disease, writes Andrew Roth, in the Russian capital. The updated data say that coronavirus likely played a role in 1,561 deaths, nearly 2.5 times higher than initial reports of 639 coronavirus deaths. In the release, the health department said there were an additional 756 cases where coronavirus was diagnosed but not identified as the primary cause of death. Another 169 cases of coronavirus were suspected but not confirmed by test. That left 192 cases of excess deaths not attributed to the disease, the department said. Moscow\u2019s health department explained the change as prompted by new reporting guidelines from the World Health Organization issued last month. But local and foreign journalists had already cast doubt on the numbers and been accused by Russian officials and lawmakers of spreading \u201cfake news.\u201d The New York Times had noted that Moscow had more than 1,700 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d for that month, a figure which was confirmed by Moscow health ministry on Friday, which said he correct figure was 1,753 excess deaths. Russia is expected to release April mortality data for the whole country on Friday and officials have warned to expect a significant rise in mortality rates. Even with the additional coronavirus cases, Moscow\u2019s reported mortality rates from the disease are still far lower than other western capitals. Wearing face masks will no longer by mandatory in shops in Austria from mid-June, the government has announced. Covering the mouth and nose will only be mandatory on public transport, in health facilities including pharmacies, and in places where social distancing rules are hard to keep, such as hairdressers, said the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz. \u201cWe are on a good path in Austria ... so we can begin the next phase: fewer rules, more self-responsibility,\u201d he was quoted as saying by AFP. However, he warned that while numbers of new infections had subsided, they could shoot up again quickly, urging citizens to use \u201ccommon sense\u201d to avoid posing a risk to others. The relaxation of mask-wearing rules will take effect on 15 June. Restaurants will also allowed to stay open until 1am, an extension from the 11pm mandatory closing time imposed when they reopened earlier this month, and the current limit of four adults per table will also be abolished. On Friday no new Covid-19 deaths were reported in Austria. Twenty-seven more people tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 16,655, of whom 668 have died. A Nordic rift has opened up over plans to ease coronavirus restrictions, with Sweden excluded from plans by Denmark and Norway to reopen their borders to tourists from some countries next month. During news conferences taking place simultaneously on Friday, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, and the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, said most restrictions would end on 15 June. The leaders said they would allow tourists to travel between the two countries, and Denmark will also welcome tourists from Germany and Iceland. But tourists from Sweden will still not be able to visit, with Frederiksen telling journalists that the two countries were in different places when it came to the coronavirus. On Friday Sweden\u2019s public health authority reported a further 84 deaths from Covid-19. The country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak now stands at 4,350, about four times the combined total of the other Nordic countries. Sweden has chosen not to impose the kinds of compulsory lockdown measures imposed by its neighbours and elsewhere across Europe, instead opting for public health advice. Earlier this week, Sweden\u2019s foreign minister, Ann Linde, warned that excluding Sweden from moves to open borders across the Nordic region would be a political decision and not justifiable on health grounds. On Thursday, Norway said it would reopen its borders to business travel from all its Nordic neighbours. Damien Gayle back at the controls now. Feel free to send any comments, tips or suggestions for coverage to me, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter to @damiengayle. Dominic Cummings may have weathered the storm of anger which engulfed him for apparently flouting the government\u2019s own coronavirus lockdown guidance, but that has not stopped Boris Johnson\u2019s top adviser being ridiculed on the other side of the world. As Australia\u2019s NRL season restarted this week, the Fan in the Stand initiative allowed the public to pay $22 for a cardboard cutout of themselves to be placed in a seat to \u201cwatch\u201d their teams in action. But it seems one Sydney Roosters fan with a sense of humour had other ideas. A cardboard cutout of the under-fire Cummings appeared at Bankwest Stadium for the Roosters\u2019 behind-closed-doors clash with South Sydney Rabbitohs, and did not go unnoticed by TV viewers. Hello all. I am on the live blog while my colleague Damien gets some lunch. Please do share your thoughts, comments and news tips with me as they are always very useful. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com We reported earlier that more than 200 schools in South Korea had been forced to close just days after they reopened. In fact, the planned reopening of more than 800 schools was postponed. We have deleted the earlier post. Luke Harding reports: South Korea has postponed the planned reopening of more than 800 schools as it battles a renewed outbreak of the coronavirus, with cases now at their highest level for almost two months. The country\u2019s easing of lockdown measures has gone into reverse, with museums, parks and art galleries closed again on Friday for two weeks. Kindergarten pupils, and some primary and secondary school students were due back from Wednesday, in the last phase of school reopenings. According to the education ministry, however, 838 schools out of 20,902 nationwide remain shut. They are located in areas hard hit by the latest wave of infections, including the capital Seoul and the cities of Bucheon and Gumi. South Korea has been praised for its deft handling of the Covid crisis. It seemed to have brought the virus under control only to record 79 new cases this week, the highest daily figure for two months. The government has responded by bringing back lockdown measures in the Seoul metropolitan area, home to half of the country\u2019s 51 million population. Most of these cases have been linked to a distribution centre in Bucheon. The warehouse is run by the country\u2019s biggest e-commerce firm Coupang. Health officials traced at least 82 infections to the facility, with the virus found on workers\u2019 shoes and clothes. They are now testing all employees and visitors. People in Turkey have held their first communal Friday prayers in 74 days after the government reopened some mosques as part of its plans to relax measures put in place to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Prayers were held in the courtyards of selected mosques, to minimize the risk of infection. Authorities distributed masks at the entrance to the mosques, sprayed hand sanitizer and checked temperatures. Worshippers were asked to bring their own prayer rugs, but some mosques offered disposable paper rugs which were placed 1.5 metres apart. Healthcare professionals should closely monitor Covid-19 patients who are receiving malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, given the serious side-effects associated with the medicine, the European health regulator said on Friday. Several EU countries have paused trials of the drug in patients infected by the new coronavirus over safety concerns, the European Medicines Agency said, adding the drug\u2019s benefits have not been established for the illness. The World Health Organization also suspended testing the drug in Covid-19 patients last week. Monkeys mobbed an Indian health worker and took coronavirus test blood samples, spreading fears that the animals could spread the pandemic in the local area. After making off with the three samples earlier this week in Meerut, near the capital New Delhi, the monkeys scampered up nearby trees and one then tried to chew its plunder. The sample boxes were later recovered and had not been damaged, Meerut Medical college superintendent Dheeraj Raj told AFP on Friday, after footage of the encounter went viral on social media. \u201cThey were still intact and we don\u2019t think there is any risk of contamination or spread,\u201d Raj said. He added that the three people whose samples were stolen were retested for the virus. Health authorities in South Africa say the country has a backlog of nearly 100,000 unprocessed coronavirus tests, as it and other countries on the continent face difficulties in obtaining essential supplies. \u201cThis challenge is caused by the limited availability of test kits globally,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement, seen by the Associated Press, which put the backlog at 96,480 as of Monday. Priority is given to processing tests from patients admitted to hospitals and health workers, it said. South Africa has conducted more tests for the virus than any other country in Africa \u2014 more than 655,000 \u2014 and has the most confirmed cases with 27,403. The shortages, especially in testing materials, have exposed how richer countries are sidelining African nations in the race to obtain crucial supplies. The continent relies almost entirely on imports for drugs and other medical items. \u201cWe have to have Made in Africa products,\u201d the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe cannot keep importing basic things.\u201d Across Africa slightly under 2 million tests for the virus have been conducted, Nkengasong said, far below the target of testing 13 million people \u2014 or 1% of the continent\u2019s population of 1.3 billion. Hello all. I am taking over the live blog while my colleague Damien gets some lunch. Please do share your thoughts, comments and news tips with me as they are always very useful. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Spain\u2019s government will discuss with various political parties whether to seek another extension to a state of emergency over the coronavirus beyond 7 June, the government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said on Friday, according to Reuters. She added that the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, would disclose during the weekend the government\u2019s decision on such an extension, which has to be approved by parliament. The state of emergency was first established in mid-March, imposing some of the toughest restrictions in Europe. When the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly jobs report earlier this month, the unemployment numbers were jaw-dropping: the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% in March to 14.7% in April \u2013 a decade\u2019s worth of job gains wiped out in mere weeks, writes Lauren Aratani for the Guardian US. The jobs report also unveiled the grim reality of which communities have been hit hardest from the economic impacts of Covid-19. Hispanic Americans saw the highest unemployment rate of any racial group at 18.9%, over 4% more than the national unemployment rate of 14.7%. Clara Lopez of Miami, Florida, worked for 17 years as a room attendant at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel and was laid off at the end of March as things were starting to shut down. She has been trying to apply for unemployment insurance since 29 March, but has yet to have success. Florida, which has a 12.9% unemployment rate, continues to have a backlog of unemployment applications, meaning people like Lopez have been left with no unemployment insurance to pay essential bills. \u201cI have my light bill, my water bill, my car bill, my electric bill. As of now, I don\u2019t even have one cent left to be able to pay for any of it,\u201d Lopez said. Even though Lopez is able to buy groceries with food stamps, prices in supermarkets have gone up, meaning she is barely able to buy the groceries she needs. The mass job losses hitting the community are a devastating blow in light of the gains that Hispanic Americans had made before the pandemic hit. In September, the Hispanic unemployment rate hit a historic low at 3.9% and hovered about 4% through February. Median household income had risen to $51,450 in 2018, another record high. Hispanic Americans were buying homes at a rate higher than any other race and had the highest labor force participation rate of any race. The debate rages on about the merits and risks of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, after dozens of scientists signed an open letter raising concerns over a study that suggested the antiviral drugs had no benefit for Covid-19 patients. The research, which was published in the Lancet on 22 May, concluded that treatment with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, an anti-malarial, could produce potentially serious side effects, particularly heart arrhythmia. Within days of the research being published the World Health Organization suspended use of the drugs in its Solidarity trial, which has seen hundreds of hospitals across several countries enrol patients to test possible treatments for Covid-19. \u201cThis impact has led many researchers around the world to scrutinise in detail the publication in question,\u201d said the open letter, signed by a number of prominent scientists, French news agency AFP reports. It added this scrutiny raised \u201cboth methodological and data integrity concerns\u201d. The authors list several issues with the study, including a lack of information about the countries and hospitals that contributed to the data, a lack of an ethics review and discrepancies in data for Australia, which did not match published national figures. \u201cSurgisphere [the data company] have since stated this was an error of classification of one hospital from Asia. This indicates the need for further error checking throughout the database,\u201d the letter said. Among the signatories are clinicians, statisticians and other researchers from around the world, from Harvard to Imperial College London. Hydroxychloroquine, normally used to treat arthritis, is one of an array of drugs being tested as scientists look for potential treatments for coronavirus patients. It has also become the most high profile, partly because of comments by Donald Trump, who announced this month he was taking the drug as a preventative measure against coronavirus. About 5,500 more more people have tested positive for the coronavirus in Africa since Thursday, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. The latest update from the UN health agency\u2019s Africa office showed that there were now 128,500 confirmed infections across the continent\u2019s 54 countries, which between them account for about 1.3billion people. Of those who have tested positive so far, more than 53,000 have recovered and about 3,700 have died. On Thursday, Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional Director for Africa, lauded the swift action taken by African governments to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But she called on member states to be cautious in easing containment measures. Moeti said: These actions came at great social and economic cost, particularly for the most vulnerable and there is an understandable push to lift the measures as rapidly as they were implemented. However, WHO urges countries to follow a step by step approach. We must all remain vigilant. As more countries begin to ease confinement measures, it is vital that effective testing and surveillance systems are in place to detect any spike in cases. Ending a lockdown is not an event, but a process, and it\u2019s important to have a clear view of local conditions so informed decisions can be made about how to relax these measures. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Spain\u2019s cabinet has approved a minimum basic income scheme, the deputy prime minister, Pablo Iglesias, announced. The \u20ac3bn scheme will provide monthly payments of between \u20ac462 and \u20ac1,015 to about 850,000 households struggling to buy food in the wake of the pandemic. Global deaths from the coronavirus outbreak have passed 360,000, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The US remains the worst-affected nation, followed by the UK, Italy and France. The carmaker Renault plans to eliminate about 14,600 jobs worldwide and lower production capacity by almost a fifth, as part of cost reductions aimed at outlasting the downturn that has rocked the global auto industry. The Philippines has recorded its highest daily infection rate but will ease lockdowns. Residents in Manila will see their lockdown \u2013 one of the toughest and longest in the world \u2013 ease from Monday, despite the country reporting 539 infections on Thursday, its highest ever daily tally. Iran recorded its highest tally of new coronavirus infections since early April, with 2,819 more people testing positive in the past 24 hours. The increase in new infections comes as measures to restrict the spread of the disease are eased in Iran. Life during the coronavirus lockdown has reinforced gender inequality across Europe, with the economic and social consequences of the crisis threatening to push women back into traditional roles in the home. Campaign groups are warning that the growth in equality over the past decades is in danger of being rolled back by the health crisis. The Spanish cabinet has approved a \u20ac3bn minimum basic income scheme to help the poorest people in the country, who are among those hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. The \u20ac3bn scheme, which will provide monthly payments of between \u20ac462 and \u20ac1,015 to around 850,000 households, comes as tens of thousands of Spanish families struggle to buy food in the wake of the pandemic and charities, foodbanks and neighbourhood associations report huge demand for help with basic items. The monthly payments, which will be available to those under 65, will begin on 15 June. Speaking at a press conference on Friday morning, the deputy prime minister and Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, hailed the decision as \u201ca historic day for our democracy\u201d. Iglesias said the scale of Spain\u2019s socio-economic problems had been laid bare by Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on human rights and extreme poverty, who visited the country in January. He said: Even before the Covid-19 pandemic hit, we already had a very high poverty rate and were the European country with the third highest level of child poverty. The pandemic has made things worse for many of our compatriots. And although we have mobilised resources to build a social shield to protect Spanish families from the economic impact of the crisis, it\u2019s obvious that the situation has obliged us to speed up the implementation of this basic income. Now more, than ever, he said, it was a \u201cabsolutely urgent necessity because thousands of Spanish families just can\u2019t wait any longer\u201d. Iglesias thanked the neighbourhood associations, foodbanks, churches and NGOs that had stepped in to help people, but added: \u201cThey have been playing a role that needs to be played by the public authorities.\u201d Iran recorded its highest tally of new coronavirus infections since early April on Friday, with 2,819 more people testing positive in the past 24 hours, the health ministry reported. Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said in his daily update that 50 more people had died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, pushing the total death toll from the outbreak to 7,677. Out of 146,668 cases detected so far, 114,931 people have recovered. Currently there are 2,547 people in a critical condition in hospital with the virus, he added, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. The increase in new infections comes as measures to restrict the spread of the disease are eased in Iran. The last time the health ministry reported a higher number of new infections was 2 April, when 2,875 new confirmed cases were recorded, according to data archived on the Worldometers website. Egypt\u2019s prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, has told the country\u2019s embattled medical syndicate that doctors who die on the job will be viewed as \u201cmartyrs\u201d and their families compensated, in the same manner as security forces who die in battle, Ruth Michaelson reports. The comparison to military honours was an attempt to cool tensions between the country\u2019s medical syndicate, which represents medical professionals in Egypt, and a government that has drawn anger over poor working conditions for medical professionals on the frontline against Covid-19. Earlier this week the syndicate accused the Egyptian health ministry of negligence, describing it as a \u201ccrime of killing by irresponsibility\u201d. Twenty-three Egyptian doctors have died and 350 have contracted Covid-19. True numbers are expected to be higher, as doctors previously complained of barriers to obtaining vital tests for themselves and patients. The health ministry drew particularly pointed criticism this week over the death of doctor Walid Yehia, who died after he was unable to access treatment at an overcrowded Cairo hospital, despite the attempts of his colleagues. In an alarming development, the medical syndicate warned earlier this week that the Egyptian healthcare system is on the brink of collapse if the government fails to take action. \u201cThe syndicate is warning that the health system could completely collapse, leading to a catastrophe affecting the entire country if the health ministry\u2019s negligence and lack of action towards medical staff is not rectified,\u201d it said. At the beginning of May, one health ministry official warned a parliamentary committee that the country\u2019s quarantine facilities were full. Madbouly said that at least 8,900 tests of medical staff have been conducted, while the government made a further 330 hospitals available to screen Covid-19 patients. Egypt on Thursday recorded 20,793 cases of Covid-19, and 845 deaths. Government officials had hoped that an extended five-day curfew over the Eid al-Fitr holiday that began last weekend would help stop the surge in numbers. Yet each day has brought a new record number of cases, and increasing alarm from the medical syndicate who say the government should reconsider plans to begin reopening the country after the Eid holiday, and implement a full lockdown. Government officials have repeatedly spoken of a need to \u201ccoexist\u201d with the coronavirus, even as cases spike. About a third of Egyptians live in poverty, according to the government\u2019s own statistics. Authorities have spoken of a need to prioritise the health of the economy while repeatedly claiming that it is citizens\u2019 individual responsibility to avoid getting infected. \u201cWe looked into all scenarios, including a total lockdown, but to be honest we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d the information minister, Osama Heikel, told the local cable news channel MBC Egypt. \u201cThe citizen\u2019s is the major role, the state\u2019s task is merely to organise, and every person should be responsible for themselves.\u201d South Korea closes schools days after reopening More than 200 schools in South Korea have been forced to close just days after they reopened, due to a new spike in virus cases. Thousands of students had earlier on Wednesday returned to school as the country began easing virus restrictions, but a day later, 79 new cases were recorded, the highest daily figure in two months. Spain approves minimum basic income scheme Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister Pablo Iglesias, the Podemos leader, has just announced that the coalition government\u2019s minimum basic income scheme has been approved by the cabinet. The \u20ac3bn scheme, which will provide monthly payments of between \u20ac462 and \u20ac1,015 to around 850,000 households, comes as tens of thousands of Spanish families struggle to buy food in the wake of the pandemic. Global deaths pass 360,000 According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center global deaths from coronavirus have now passed 360,000. Renault to cut nearly 15,000 jobs worldwide Renault SA plans to eliminate about 14,600 jobs worldwide and lower production capacity by almost a fifth as part of cost reductions aimed at outlasting the downturn that has rocked the global auto industry. Philippines records its highest daily infection rate \u2013 539 new cases \u2013 but will ease lockdowns. Residents in Manila will see their lockdown \u2013 one of the toughest and longest in the world \u2013 ease from Monday, despite the Philippines seeing its biggest spike in coronavirus cases on Thursday. The Philippines reported 539 infections on Thursday, its highest ever daily tally, to make a total of 15,588. It has recorded 921 deaths. Life during the coronavirus lockdown reinforces gender inequality across Europe Life during the coronavirus lockdown has reinforced gender inequality across Europe with research emphasising that the economic and social consequences of the crisis are far greater for women and threaten to push them back into traditional roles in the home which they will struggle to shake off once it is over. Throughout the continent, campaign groups are warning that the burdens of the home office and home schooling together with additional household duties and extra cooking, has been unequally carried by women and that improvements made in their lives by the growth in equality over the past decades are in danger of being rolled back by the health crisis. The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million, with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week The growth in the number of claims has slowed, but millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number to a rate not seen since the Great Depression. US records more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, the UK. More than 159,000 excess deaths recorded in Europe since early March There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent said. Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died. Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday Members of different households will have to stay two metres apart, the prime minister has said. This will be allowed in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, Boris Johnson added. Paris is no longer a \u2018red\u2019 coronavirus danger zone The risks posed by the virus have been reduced to \u201corange\u201d, according to France\u2019s prime minister, Edouard Philippe. The rating means Paris is not as free as the majority French regions designated \u201cgreen\u201d. Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths to add those who \u2018died with\u2019 the virus. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. The Philippines has been granted a $500m loan from the world bank to help it cope with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with its economy facing the deepest contraction for nearly three decades. From next month, in spite of the country seeing its highest daily tally yet of new infections on Thursday, the government has said it will begin easing the lockdown in Manila, the capital, and other key cities, which has been one of the longest and toughest in the world. The Philippines reported 539 infections on Thursday, its highest ever daily tally, to make a total of 15,588. It has recorded 921 deaths. Figures for Friday are yet to be published. Achim Fock, World Bank acting country director for Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, said: \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has badly hurt millions of poor and vulnerable Filipino families, particularly daily wage earners.\u201d The loan will support efforts to provide immediate relief to poor Filipinos and small business workers who have lost their jobs during the lockdown since mid-March, the finance secretary, Carlos Dominguez, said in a statement. Russia recorded its biggest increase yet in coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, with 232 more deaths in the past 24 hours pushing the nationwide total to 4,374. Officials said 8,572 new infections had been confirmed, bringing the national tally to 387,623, according to Reuters. Russia has the third highest reported total in the world after the United States and Brazil. According to Tass, a Russian news agency, 50 deaths were recorded in Dagestan, 20 in the Moscow region and 11 in St Petersburg, while the North Ossetia, Krasnoyarsk and Oryol regions reported six coronavirus deaths each. In the face of questioning over the country\u2019s comparatively low coronavirus death toll, given its high infection rates, Russian officials have said its low virus death figures are also down to mass testing which has identified many cases with mild or no symptoms. San Francisco has seen a surge in deaths among homeless people this spring, fatalities that officials are not directly attributing to coronavirus but which advocates say is a result of the shelter-in-place order that forced people onto the streets, writes Vivian Ho for the Guardian US. From 30 March to 24 May, 48 people experiencing homelessness died in San Francisco, more than three times the 14 deaths recorded during this same period last year. Though some of those 48 tested positive \u201cnear their time of death,\u201d their causes of death are still under investigation and have not been counted among the city\u2019s Covid-related fatalities, according to the San Francisco department of public health. There have been 40 Covid-related deaths officially recorded in San Francisco since the first case was reported in the city on 5 March. When the mayor, London Breed, joined the other Bay Area counties in putting into effect the nation\u2019s first regional shelter-in-place order on 17 March, businesses and many places that provided services to homeless individuals had to close. Shelters, no longer taking in new guests during the pandemic, were forced to reduce capacity by 76% to adhere by social distancing guidelines. In a statement, the city\u2019s department of public health acknowledged that \u201cmeasures San Franciscans have taken to protect our community from the virus and reduce its spread have been necessarily disruptive, and have saved lives, but they could also be having indirect impacts on other aspects of life for people experiencing homelessness\u201d. Belgium reported 42 more coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, taking the total death toll to 9,430. According to the latest update from the Sciensano health institute, 212 more people have tested positive for the virus. So far the country of 11.6 million people has reported 58,061 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Earlier this week, Belgium\u2019s data watchdog called for more safeguards around a plan by the government store massive amounts of personal data in a database to carry out contact tracing. Other countries, including the UK, have proposed similar schemes. The watchdog said: There is no reason for the Belgian state to foresee - and hence impose - the registration of the massive amounts of personal data, including health-related, used by the tracing contact centres into a unique central database. Hi this is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog now, for the next eight or so hours, bringing you the latest news from the global coronavirus outbreak. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions for coverage, feel free to drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center global deaths from coronavirus have now passed 360,000. Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister Pablo Iglesias, the Podemos leader, has just announced that the coalition government\u2019s minimum basic income scheme has been approved by the cabinet. The \u20ac3bn scheme, which will provide monthly payments of between \u20ac462 and \u20ac1,015 to around 850,000 households, comes as tens of thousands of Spanish families struggle to buy food in the wake of the pandemic. Giving more details of the scheme last Saturday, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said: \u201cNeither the government nor Spanish society is going to look the other way while our compatriots queue up to eat, as we are sadly seeing now in some parts of the country.\u201d More details will follow at a press conference in half an hour \u2026 Starting from 19 June Poland will allow football fans back into stadiums at a maximum of 25% capacity, according to Jakub Krupa. More on this when we get it. Indonesia reported on Friday 678 new coronavirus infections, taking the total number of cases in the Southeast Asian country to 25,216, said health ministry official Achmad Yurianto. Yurianto reported 24 new deaths related to COVID-19, bringing the total to 1,520, while 6,492 people have recovered Malaysia reported 103 new coronavirus infections on Friday, mostly involving foreigners, the health ministry said, raising the country\u2019s total to 7,732 cases. The health ministry reported no new deaths, leaving the total number at 115. Love this story from Uki Go\u00f1i in Buenos Aires. With commercial flights cancelled around much of the world because of the coronavirus pandemic, one country has adapted its main airport to a new use: as a drive-in cinema. Instead of planes flying in and out of Uruguay\u2019s Carrasco international airport, cars are now arriving nightly for Uruguayans to enjoy a socially distanced movie in the safety of their own vehicle. \u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d said dentist Cecilia Muttoni who recently went to a screening of Sonic the Hedgehog with her 29-year-old daughter. \u201cIt was the chance to have a communal experience but with each car being its own private universe.\u201d Read the full piece here: Bulgaria plans to lift an obligatory 14-day quarantine from June 1 for travellers from most European Union countries, but not those states with the biggest coronavirus outbreaks, a senior health official said on Friday. Reuters reports: The quarantine will remain obligatory for travellers from Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Malta, the official said, as well as the UK, which is in a transition period after leaving the EU. Angel Kunchev, the country\u2019s chief health inspector, said the anti-virus taskforce had proposed to the government to lift the quarantine as of June 1. The health minister still needs to approve the plan. A ban on the entry of visitors from outside the EU will remain in place. Bulgaria has eased most of the restrictive measures it imposed in March to combat the spread of the coronavirus, allowing restaurants, cafes, gyms and theatres to reopen and lifting a ban on travel between cities. Kunchev said: \u201cWe plan to lift the obligatory quarantine for Bulgarians returning from abroad and for travellers from the European Union countries and Serbia and North Macedonia. We will keep it for the eight EU countries that have the biggest registered cases in the past two weeks.\u201d The Balkan country of 7 million people registered eight new cases of the coronavirus on Friday, bringing the total registered cases to 2,475, including 136 deaths - a much lower rate than many other EU countries. In Afghanistan, there are signs of a continued surge in coronavirus cases in the capital, Kabul, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii in Herat. The western province of Herat has recorded its worst day of the crisis after seven patients died overnight. More than of half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive across the country. There has been 623 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours, and 11 new deaths. This takes the number of confirmed cases to 13,659 and the death toll to 245. However, there have been no tests carried out in most of southern provinces in last two weeks due to a problem in testing process in Kandahar lab, which risks creating a backlog. Meanwhile, the defence ministry said at least 14 security forces personnel had been killed in a Taliban attack in eastern province of Paktia as the Taliban \u201cviolated the truce\u201d. The Thursday night attack comes as a government officials confirmed on Friday morning that the Eid ceasefire which started on 24 May continues across the country despite some security incidents in the last two days. Javid Faisal, spokesman for the Office of National Security Council said: The d\u00e9tente that started during Eid ul-Fitr continues despite reports of scattered incidents to the contrary. A ceasefire is a complex operational undertaking that requires significant and ongoing coordination to avoid incidents. Those efforts will continue. A three-day transition from lockdown to relative normality is under way in Saudi Arabia, with malls and waterfronts open and the Kingdom readying to allow up to 90,000 mosques to receive worshippers on Sunday for the first time in nearly two months, writes the Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov. It\u2019s a similar story in the United Arab Emirates, where Dubai beaches and parks were reopened on Friday. The city\u2019s museums are expected to reopen their doors on Monday, as officials try to position the country as \u2018open for business\u2019 after the most crippling economic slowdown in the country\u2019s history. Both the Emirates and Saudi Arabia have been among the regional states most affected by Covid-19, with the virus taking an unprecedented toll on state revenues and forcing seismic shake-ups in labour markets and other key sectors. Balancing dwindling revenues and consumer confidence against a public health emergency has been particularly challenging for the UAE, one of the globe\u2019s main aviation hubs and an emerging tourist destination, the viability of which depends heavily on a pre-Covid interconnected world resuming on a similar scale. Both countries have enforced social distancing and have imposed curfews throughout the crisis. Numbers have increased steadily throughout the pandemic, with more than 32,500 cases registered in the UAE and more than 80,000 in Saudi Arabia. Migrant workforces account for large numbers of cases in each state. The ratio of deaths to contractions in each state is lower than the global average, at less than one per cent. In the UK all eyes are on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who this morning is expect to announce details about how the country\u2019s furlough scheme will be reduced. The government is expect to start tapering the scheme from August by forcing those employers taking part to pay 20% of workers\u2019 wages as well as covering their national insurance and pension contributions. Currently the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (read more here) allows employers to stand down workers and claim a cash grant of up to 80% of their wages, capped at \u00a32,500 a month. The scheme is currently paying out to around 7.5 million employees, a quarter of Britain\u2019s private sector workforce. It has been used by 935,000 companies. The support given by the furlough scheme will be cut back due to government concerns about its spiralling cost and the likely impact on the UK\u2019s growing public spending deficit. Our full story is here: Singapore\u2019s health ministry said on Friday it had confirmed 611 new coronavirus cases, taking the city state\u2019s tally for infections to 33,860. After US president Donald Trump saw some of his tweets fact-checked by Twitter, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has also had a tweet flagged. Lijian suggested the U.S. military brought the novel coronavirus to China on March 12, writing: \u201cWhen did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\u201d. Twitter posted a blue exclamation mark under it with a comment urging readers to check the facts about COVID-19. Clicking on the link directed readers to a page with the headline, \u201cWHO says evidence suggests COVID-19 originated in animals and was not produced in a lab\u201d. The United Nations has decided to delay a crucial climate summit that had been scheduled for Britain this year. The COP26 summit, billed as the most important climate change summit since the 2015 talks that produced the Paris Agreement, will be rescheduled to Nov. 1 to 12, 2021, the UN\u2019s climate body decided on Thursday. The dates were proposed by the British government and, as planned, the summit will take place in Glasgow, Scotland, with \u201ca warm-up summit\u201d in Italy.

Bloomberg reports: Renault SA plans to eliminate about 14,600 jobs worldwide and lower production capacity by almost a fifth as part of cost reductions aimed at outlasting the downturn that has rocked the global auto industry. The plan includes cutting almost 4,600 positions in France, or about 10% of the carmaker\u2019s total in its home country, through voluntary retirement and retraining, according to a statement released on Friday. More than 10,000 further jobs will be scrapped in the rest of the world. Renault employs about 180,000 people globally. In Glasgow: A 94-year-old woman living alone, who did not eat for five days because she was \u201ctoo scared\u201d to leave her house under lockdown and had no one to shop for her, has been rescued from acute hunger by charity volunteers. The woman (not named) from Govan, Glasgow, came to the attention of Salvation Army volunteers and housing officers who were knocking on doors to check up on people as a part of a local Covid-19 food support scheme. More than 120 researchers and medical professionals from around the world have written an open letter to the editor of the Lancet raising serious concerns about a large and widely publicised global study that prompted the World Health Organisation to halt several Covid-19 clinical trials. On Thursday Guardian Australia revealed that the Australian data in the study, published last week, did not reconcile with health department records or databases. In Germany, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 741 to 180,458, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 39 to 8,450, the tally showed. Thailand confirmed 11 new coronavirus cases on Friday and no new deaths, taking the number of infections to 3,076. The new cases were all patients who had arrived from Kuwait and were in quarantine, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration. The coronavirus has killed 57 people in Thailand since it was first detected in January. The number of people infected by Covid-19 has exceeded 5.8 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. At least 360,000 people have died from the virus. The US accounts for about 30% of cases, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%). Philippines records its highest daily infection rate- 539 new cases - but will ease lockdowns. Residents in Manila will see their lockdown \u2013 one of the toughest and longest in the world \u2013 ease from Monday, despite the Philippines seeing its biggest spike in coronavirus cases on Thursday. The Philippines reported 539 infections on Thursday, its highest ever daily tally, to make a total of 15,588. It has recorded 921 deaths. \u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d Duterte said in a late-night televised address, citing what he described as the country\u2019s low mortality rate. His health minister, Francisco Duque, said 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 cases were \u201cmild\u201d and only less than 2% are \u201csevere and critical\u201d. India\u2019s health system is at risk of being overwhelmed by Covid-19 spread. In Mumbai\u2019s Sion hospital emergency ward there are two people to a bed. Patients, many with coronavirus symptoms and strapped two to a single oxygen tank, were captured lying almost on top of each other, top-to-toe on shared stretchers or just lying on the floor, in footage shared on social media in India this week. Mumbai, a city of more than 20 million people, is weeks into the pandemic, but with new cases showing no sign of slowing down the city\u2019s already weak healthcare system appears to be on the brink of collapse. State hospitals such as Sion, overcrowded in normal times, are overrun. With frontline doctors and nurses falling sick with the virus in their droves, it is also leading to a shortage of medical staff. Life during the coronavirus lockdown has reinforced gender inequality across Europe with research emphasising that the economic and social consequences of the crisis are far greater for women and threaten to push them back into traditional roles in the home which they will struggle to shake off once it is over. Throughout the continent, campaign groups are warning that the burdens of the home office and home schooling together with additional household duties and extra cooking, has been unequally carried by women and that improvements made in their lives by the growth in equality over the past decades are in danger of being rolled back by the health crisis. The number of Americans who have lost their jobs in the past 10 weeks soared to more than 40 million, with 2.1 million people filing for unemployment last week. The growth in the number of claims has slowed, but millions more have continued to file for unemployment each week, bringing the total number to a rate not seen since the Great Depression. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would sign an executive order allowing businesses to deny entry to customers not wearing masks. He said: \u201cThat store owner has a right to protect himself \u2026 You don\u2019t want to wear a mask, fine. But you don\u2019t have a right to then go into that store if that storeowner doesn\u2019t want you to.\u201d The US has now recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, as many states continued to relax mitigation measures. The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, the UK. There have been more than 159,000 excess deaths in Europe since since early March, during the height of the coronavirus epidemic, the head of the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent said. Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died. Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart, the prime minister has said. This will be allowed in gardens and other private outdoor spaces, Boris Johnson added. Paris is no longer a \u201cred\u201d coronavirus danger zone, the risks posed by the virus moving down a notch to \u201corange\u201d, according to France\u2019s prime minister, Edouard Philippe. The rating means Paris is not as free as the majority French regions designated \u201cgreen\u201d. Health officials in Moscow updated their figures on coronavirus deaths to add those who \u201cdied with\u201d the virus. On top of 636 deaths in April directly caused by Covid-19 reported earlier, the health department added the deaths of 756 people who tested positive for the virus but died of other causes. It is Italy\u2019s wealthiest province, yet Covid-19 spread lethally through Lombardy and residents want answers. From our correspondent Angela Giuffrida. From our correspondent Justin McCurry: South Korea\u2019s government will inspect working conditions at distribution centres and toughen guidelines on the number of students allowed to attend classes in the Seoul metropolitan area, amid concern over a recent spike in the number of coronavirus cases in the capital and surrounding areas. The education ministry said it would limit the number of students going back to school to one-third of the total student body at primary and middle schools, and two-thirds at high schools, according to the Yonhap news agency. The announcement came after the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported 58 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, a day after it reported a near two-month high of 79 cases. All of the infections identified on Friday were in the Seoul metropolitan area, home to around half of the country\u2019s 51 million people, bringing the national total to 11,402 infections and 269 deaths. After managing to contain the first outbreak, South Korea is battling to prevent a second wave of infections. The latest cluster has been traced to a warehouse in Bucheon, near Seoul, where employees reportedly failed to take preventive measures such as wearing masks and observing social distancing. Their employer, the e-commerce firm Coupang, reportedly refused to allow some workers to self-isolate even after they started showing symptoms of the illness. Health authorities have found at least 82 infections linked to the warehouse, and are in the process of testing all 4,000 employees and recent visitors. As a precaution, the Bucheon city government earlier this week ordered the closure of 251 local schools, but allowed classes for older high school students to continue, Yonhap said. Life during the coronavirus lockdown has reinforced gender inequality across Europe with research emphasising that the economic and social consequences of the crisis are far greater for women and threaten to push them back into traditional roles in the home which they will struggle to shake off once it is over. Throughout the continent, campaign groups are warning that the burdens of the home office and home schooling together with additional household duties and extra cooking, has been unequally carried by women and that improvements made in their lives by the growth in equality over the past decades are in danger of being rolled back by the health crisis. From my colleagues Kate Connolly, Ashifa Kassam, Kim Willsher, and Rory Carroll, from Berlin to Dublin. The arts community of New Zealand is celebrating after prime minister (and arts minister) Jacinda Ardern announced a NZ$175m rescue package. The sector contributes nearly $11 billion a year to the country\u2019s GDP, Ardern said, and employs 90,000 people. Without pandemic interventions, modelling based on treasury forecasts warned the cultural sector would be hit roughly twice as hard as the rest of the economy, and 11,000 jobs could be lost within 12 months. \u201cThe arts and music sectors have been decimated by Covid-19,\u201d the PM s said. \u201cA healthy cultural sector has many positive flow-on effects for other important parts of our economy, such as technical production, hospitality, venues and domestic tourism.\u201d The first wave of funding will be available from July. \u201cWe know many of our creatives get income from multiple sources and it is an ongoing challenge to piece together the gigs and commissions to earn a livelihood,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cThese initiatives will provide hundreds of opportunities for creatives to earn income and rebuild their careers, and at a time when we have all been reminded of the importance of our creative industries.\u201d The funding was met with elation by those in New Zealand\u2019s arts community - and envy from many across the Tasman. Graham Russell is too noble to put his byline on it. But he has compiled this most comprehensive global summary. News from, inter alia, the Philippines, China, South Korea, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, the UK, the US, and France. In Japan, there are fears of an emerging mental health crisis. The phones at the Tokyo suicide hotline start ringing as soon as it opens for its once-weekly overnight session. They don\u2019t stop until the lone volunteer fielding calls from hundreds of people yearning to talk signs out early the next morning. Both operating days and volunteer numbers at the volunteer-run Tokyo Befrienders call centre have been cut to avoid coronavirus infection, but the desperate need remains. \u201cThere are so many people who want to connect and talk to somebody, but the fact is we can\u2019t answer all of them,\u201d centre director Machiko Nakayama told Reuters. Health workers fear the pandemic\u2019s economic shock will return Japan to 14 dark years from 1998 when more than 30,000 people took their lives annually. With the grim distinction of the highest suicide rate among G7 nations, Japan adopted legal and corporate changes that helped lower the toll to just over 20,000 last year. Worried the current crisis will reverse that downward trend, frontline workers are urging the government to boost both fiscal aid and practical support. \u201cWe need to take steps now, before the deaths begin,\u201d said Hisao Sato, head of an NGO that provides counselling and economic advice in Akita, a northern prefecture long known for Japan\u2019s worst suicide rate. National suicides fell 20% year-on-year in April, the first month of the country\u2019s soft lockdown, but experts said that was likely due to an internationally recognised phenomenon in which suicides decrease during crises, only to rise afterwards. \u201cIt\u2019s the quiet before the storm, but the clouds are upon us,\u201d Sato said. Prevention workers see echoes of 1998 when a sales tax hike and the Asian economic crisis first drove annual suicides above 30,000, then to a peak of almost 34,500 in 2003. Economic circumstance is the second biggest reason for suicides, behind health, according to 2019 police data, which also shows that men are nearly three times more likely to kill themselves than women, and most are in the 40-60 age group. The current crisis, which is forecast to shrink Japan\u2019s economy 22.2 percent this quarter, is especially dangerous for cash-strapped small and medium-sized businesses for whom government subsidies might not arrive in time. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. A lot of people are really worried,\u201d said Shinnosuke Hirose, chief executive of a small human resources firm that has lost nearly 90% of its business. \u201cIt\u2019s like waiting at the execution grounds to see if they survive or not.\u201d A Health Ministry official in charge of suicide policy told Reuters his department planned to ask for more money from a $1.1 trillion central government stimulus package to help fund measures such as extra hotlines. The official, who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak on the record, added there were limits to central government action and local efforts were crucial. News from Australia\u2019s most populous state (and where your correspondent currently sits): a further easing of Covid-19 restrictions. Australia\u2019s Covid-19 infection numbers remain, by global standards, very low. 7165 cases have been confirmed. 103 people have died. From Australian Associated Press: NSW will ease coronavirus restrictions on religious services, weddings and funerals from Monday, when measures to increase pub and restaurant patronage come into effect. Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Friday said in a statement that from June 1, up to 20 people could attend weddings, 50 at funerals and 50 at places of worship. However, strict social distancing guidelines would continue to apply. \u201cWe know how important these services are to individuals and families but as we ease restrictions further, we must remember to keep one another safe,\u201d Berejiklian said. South Korea reported 58 new cases of the coronavirus, all of them in the Seoul area, as officials scramble to stem transmissions linked to a massive e-commerce warehouse near the capital. The figures announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought national totals to 11,402 infections and 269 deaths. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun called for officials to examine working conditions at warehouses of online shopping companies, which have seen orders surge during the epidemic, and other congested workplaces where infections risks may be high. South Korea has reported 177 new COVID-19 cases over the past three days, a resurgence that threatens to erase some of its hard-won gains against the virus and worsen whats already a massive shock on its trade-dependent economy. South Korea\u2019s factory output plunged 6% in April from a month earlier, the sharpest decline since December 2008, as global outbreaks and lockdowns battered exports, Statistics Korea said Friday. A little more on the Philippines lifting key Covid-19 restrictions despite the country announcing its highest new daily infection total for the whole pandemic. Health officials have announced 539 new infections Thursday. The country has had more than 15,000 cases and 921 deaths, but it is believed the real toll is far higher, because of limited testing across the archipelagic nation. As well, in correspondence, readers have told The Guardian that different cities are enforcing the lockdown laws with varying severity. The ban on bars has been lifted in many parts of Manila, but in places like Davao City in Mindanao, it remains strictly enforced. From Agence France Presse: The Philippines will lift key coronavirus lockdown measures in the nation\u2019s capital, President Rodrigo Duterte said Thursday, aiming to resuscitate a faltering economy after nearly three months of strict home quarantine. Manila has endured one of the world\u2019s longest lockdowns, which has hit the livelihoods of millions of workers but not halted a steady stream of new infections. Most businesses will be allowed to re-open from Monday and public transit is to return in a limited form, although children and the elderly will have to stay home unless they are out getting essentials or headed to work. \u201cRemember that the entire nation is under quarantine,\u201d Duterte said in a late-night speech. \u201cLet us move to the so-called \u2018new normal\u2019.\u201d Schools, bars, dine-in restaurants and barber shops will all remain shuttered. The capital\u2019s shopping malls - de-facto centres of community life and drivers of consumer spending - have been open at a limited capacity for about two weeks. Duterte\u2019s announcement came hours after health officials announced 539 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily figure since the outbreak took off in March. Health officials said that was primarily due to delays in submissions from testing labs and a manual process for validating results. The Philippines has detected 15,588 cases with 921 deaths, but the number of infected is believed to be higher due to limited testing. Manila, home to some 12 million people, is the centre of the nation\u2019s outbreak and efforts to battle the contagion. The capital has been under lockdown since mid-March, roughly the same time when hard-hit France and Spain issued their stay at home orders. While those countries have steadily loosened their restrictions in recent weeks, Manila only started allowing outdoor exercise two weeks ago. Trips to the grocery store have been allowed, but only workers deemed essential were allowed out while everyone else was expected to work from their homes. Under the eased restrictions, most people will be allowed to go to their places of work, but working from home is still strongly encouraged. The easing of the capital\u2019s restrictions came shortly after the nation\u2019s economy shrank 0.2 percent in January-March this year - the first contraction in over two decades. Economic pain will likely only increase as hundreds of thousands of Filipino migrant workers are expected to be put out of work by the global economic halt prompted by the pandemic. In Mumbai\u2019s Sion hospital emergency ward there are two people to a bed. Patients, many with coronavirus symptoms and strapped two to a single oxygen tank, were captured lying almost on top of each other, top-to-toe on shared stretchers or just lying on the floor, in footage shared on social media in India this week. Mumbai, a city of more than 20 million people, is weeks into the pandemic, but with new cases showing no sign of slowing down the city\u2019s already weak healthcare system appears to be on the brink of collapse. State hospitals such as Sion, overcrowded in normal times, are overrun. With frontline doctors and nurses falling sick with the virus in their droves, it is also leading to a shortage of medical staff. I\u2019m in Australia. Surely we can have the Sheffield Shield back by our summer. Every spectator gets their own grandstand (and that was before the pandemic). Meanwhile... at a mall in Bangkok. \u201cThe deep cracks in the glittering facade...\u201d from my colleague Ed Pilkington in the US. Already one lesson of the pandemic is clear: America\u2019s deep and brutal fault lines \u2013 of race, partisanship, gender, poverty and misinformation \u2013 rendered the country ill-prepared to meet the challenges of this disease. The ravages of Covid-19 have revealed the deep cracks in the glittering facade of the richest and most powerful nation on Earth. The coronavirus pandemic could cause up to 7 million unwanted pregnancies globally, and child deaths could spike by up to 6000 a day. The Thomson Reuters Foundation reports: A \u201cwake-up call\u201d is needed to protect women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights amid the pandemic, said the president of Estonia and former prime minister of New Zealand who held a virtual summit with leaders from Canada, Costa Rica, Senegal and United Nations officials. \u201cWe\u2019ve all come together because none of us are prepared to stand by and see this pandemic erode the significant progress that has been made on the health and rights of women and children and adolescents,\u201d Helen Clark, prime minister of New Zealand from 1999 to 2008, said. \u201cWe are hearing stories from the front lines of the immunisations not being able to be done, the pregnancy services not there, the sexual health and reproductive health services generally not there,\u201d she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this, but there\u2019s not currently enough global solidarity.\u201d The United Nations estimates the pandemic could cause 7 million unwanted pregnancies over the next six months as women lose access to contraception and reproductive health care. Child deaths are expected to spike by up to 6,000 per day due to reductions in routine services such as postnatal check-ups and vaccines, which could mark an increase in the under-5 death rate for the first time in decades, according to the U.N. Children\u2019s Agency (UNICEF). As vulnerable members of society, particularly in poorer countries, women are likely to take a big economic hit and have a hard time recovering, Clark said. Several leaders said community-level interventions are the best solution, such as a campaign in Senegal to distribute food and information about health resources to women working in markets. \u201cIf it is small, it is still important,\u201d Awa Marie Coll-Seck, minister of state to the president of Senegal, said. President Kersti Kaljulaid of Estonia urged countries to look for innovative solutions. \u201cTraditional tools are not sufficient. Therefore let us try to do things differently, reach out more at grassroots level,\u201d Kaljulaid said. \u201cIf something positive can stem from this pandemic at all, it is the wider acceptance of the importance of global communal goods ... and supporting the weakest in society, the children, adolescents and women,\u201d she said. In Japan, a cluster response team has been sent to the south-western city of Kitakyushu, which has seen a sudden rise in cases after three weeks with no new infections, the Mainichi reports. It says 43 cases have emerged in the six days to Thursday, after not reporting any at all since the end of April, bringing the total for the city to 119. How more than a dozen of the latest infections came about remains unclear. The mayor, Kenji Kitahashi, warned of a second wave of infections and asked residents to refrain from non-essential outings. \u201cIf we leave this as it is, we will definitely be hit by a large second wave,\u201d he said at a press conference. From Monday in Manila, gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed. Workplaces, shops and some public transport will reopen and movement in and out of Manila will be permitted, provided the people wear masks and observe social distancing. Schools, universities, tourist destinations and dine-in restaurants will stay closed, however, and stay-at-home orders will remain for the elderly and children. Residents in Manila will see their lockdown \u2013 one of the toughest and longest in the world \u2013 ease from Monday, despite the Philippines seeing its biggest spike in coronavirus cases on Thursday. The Philippines reported 539 infections on Thursday, its highest ever daily tally, to make a total of 15,588. It has recorded 921 deaths. \u201cFor me, this does not look bad,\u201d Duterte said in a late-night televised address, citing what he described as the country\u2019s low mortality rate. His health minister, Francisco Duque, said 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 cases were \u201cmild\u201d and only less than 2% are \u201csevere and critical\u201d. Manila\u2019s lockdown will this weekend surpass the 76-day quarantine of Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first outbreak of the coronavirus was detected. China has reported zero new cases of coronavirus, the country\u2019s National Health Commission has said. Just five new asymptomatic cases were recorded, down from 23 a day earlier.

You can reach me by email ben.doherty@theguardian.com or via twitter @BenDohertyCorro. Below is a summary of recent developments around the globe. The number of Covid-19 infections still rising, now above 5.7m. The number of people infected by Covid-19 has exceeded 5.7 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US accounts for about 30% of cases, way ahead of Brazil (7.2%), Russia (6.6%), the UK (4.7%), Spain (4.1%) and Italy (4%). Up to six people will be able to meet outside in England from Monday, providing members of different households continue to stay two metres apart, the prime minister has said.

Hans Kluge said 2 million people had been confirmed to have caught the coronavirus since it was first detected on the continent four months ago. About 175,000 had died. The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12. Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week. The only other case was a returned overseas traveller who is already in hotel quarantine. The president of Namibia and several of the country\u2019s top officials have been fined after breaching coronavirus regulations last month by hosting a celebration to mark his party\u2019s 60th anniversary. The South West Africa People\u2019s Organisation (Swapo) birthday party took place in parliament on 19 April, when Namibia was under lockdown and group gatherings were banned to limit the spread of coronavirus. As well as the president, Hage Geingob, himself, the guests included vice-president Nangolo Mbumba, prime minister Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila and SWAPO secretary-general Sophia Shaningwa. All have since been fined N$2,000 (\u00a392.34). In sport, Premier League football is poised to return after a three-month coronavirus shutdown, with top-flight games in England provisionally set to resume in June. Aston Villa will host Sheffield United and Manchester City face Arsenal on 17 June. Serie A, Italy\u2019s top division, will return on 20 June after a three-month suspension, the sports minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, said on Thursday. Australia\u2019s professional rugby league competition, the NRL, resumed on Thursday night with Parramatta defeating Brisbane. Cancer patients with Covid-19 treated with a drug combination promoted by US President Donald Trump to counter coronavirus were three times more likely to die within 30 days than those who got either drug alone, U.S. researchers said. The preliminary results suggest doctors may want to refrain from prescribing the decades-old malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine with the antibiotic azithromycin for these patients until more study is done, researchers said. \u201cTreatment with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were strongly associated with increased risk of death,\u201d Dr. Howard Burris, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology(ASCO), said in a briefing with reporters on the results.",

While 3% might not sound significant, Kellaway points out that across the UK population as a whole that would amount to more than enough recruits to solve any teaching shortages in Britain\u2019s schools for a generation. Now Teach said it has seen a 70% rise in applications for its training programme between March and May this year, at the height of the lockdown. One of those, Aisha Singleton, who worked in publishing in Norwich, said: \u201cMy previous industry had so many opportunities and I have many great memories of it, but the bottom line is, I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve really helped anyone. \u201cWhen coronavirus broke out, I thought, \u2018I want to inspire young people, I want to be giving back.\u2019 This pandemic has given me the final push in that direction. \u201cWhen children go back to school in September, they\u2019re going to need support, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u201d The survey found that despite some high-profile complaints, 64% of parents have enjoyed the experience of home schooling and only 9% reported a negative experience \u2013 which Kellaway thought might help explain the new attraction of a career in teaching. The desire to change careers was strongest among workers who are still in full-time employment, according to the survey, rather than those who had been furloughed or were unemployed during the lockdown. \u201cI co-founded Now Teach four years ago because I hoped there were other professionals out there who, like me, wanted to do something more useful with their lives. The pandemic has made this point more powerfully than I ever could. It has shone a light on the emptiness of some jobs and made people want to do something that really matters,\u201d Kellaway said. The survey also found that respondents with school-age children \u2013 who have spent the past two months home schooling \u2013 \u201coverwhelmingly reported increased gratitude to teachers and respect for what they do\u201d, compared with just 4.5% who said their respect had lessened. This came despite high-profile attacks on teaching unions by some in the media and government, over their concerns about the safe return of pupils into schools.",
