Speculation reached fever pitch in 2016, before Trump sewed up the nomination. </p> <p>Nevertheless, we are here again. The prognosticators at FiveThirtyEight give Bernie Sanders the <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">same odds </a>of winning the nomination as a contested convention. <br></p> <p>The rationale: muddled results in Iowa and New Hampshire, a weak frontrunner and at least five leading candidates have committed to staying in the race until Super Tuesday, when roughly 40% of the overall delegates are allocated. It\u2019s there they will meet a sixth candidate, <strong>Michael Bloomberg</strong>, whose unorthodox campaign and unparalleled financial resources will like shake up the race further at that stage. </p> <p>It\u2019s been decades since either party arrived at their convention without a nominee, but anxiety is growing this cycle and the campaigns are drawing up plans in the unlikely event this year is different. This comes as moderate and establishment are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of nominating a democratic socialist to take on Trump. </p> <p>Sanders this week warned of a scenario in which Democratic insiders try to overrule a frontrunner who arrives at the convention with a plurality, but not a majority, of delegates. However, such an outcome would be allowed under the rules agreed to after 2016 by Sanders\u2019 allies in collaboration with the party. </p> <p>\u201cThe convention would have to explain to the American people, \u2018Hey, candidate X got the most votes and won the most delegates at the primary process, but we\u2019re not going to give him or her the nomination,\u2019\u201d Sanders said on MSNBC. <strong>\u201cI think that would be a divisive moment for the Democratic Party.\u201d</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e46a8d58f086a28115abc31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T14:11:53.297Z\">2.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Hello \u2013 this is Lauren Gambino in Washington taking over from Paul Owen</strong>.

US attorney general William Barr <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/william-barr-trump-twitter-justice-department\">made an unexpected intervention</a> into the ballooning controversy over Donald Trump\u2019s interference in the trial of his friend Roger Stone</strong>.</p> <p>Barr \u2013 seen as a staunch Trump loyalist \u2013 publicly rebuked the president, saying that Trump\u2019s tweets about the Stone case \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and adding that he would not be \u201cbullied or influenced\u201d over justice department decisions. <br></p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/barr-blasts-trumps-tweets-stone-case-impossible-job/story?id=68963276&amp;cid=social_twitter_wnt\">told ABC</a>.<br></p> <p>The attorney general claimed Trump \u201chas never asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d, but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority.</p> <p>The initial reaction from the White House was relatively calm. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by Barr\u2019s comments, adding: \u201c[Barr] has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions. President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Whether that line holds when Trump gets up this morning and begins his effective use of social media for the day remains to be seen. The president has a low tolerance for criticism, whether from friends or enemies \u2013 as former chief of staff John Kelly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227986935240691712\">saw yesterday</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227986935240691712\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldn\u2019t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn\u2019t for him. He came in with a bang, went out with a whimper, but like so many X\u2019s, he misses the action &amp; just can\u2019t keep his mouth shut,.</p>&mdash; Donald J.

He has been called to testify to Congress about alleged political interference at the justice department, and may be preparing the groundwork for that. He may also be attempting to save his reputation \u2013 which has been shredded since he joined the Trump administration last year, particularly after his handling of the Mueller report. </p> <p>Barr characterized the report in ways that appeared to absolve Trump of wrongdoing on numerous occasions, even though the redacted version of the Mueller report released in April 2019 showed nearly a dozen instances in which the president or his campaign sought to obstruct justice.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/us/politics/william-barr-trump.html?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_200214&amp;campaign_id=2&amp;instance_id=15978&amp;segment_id=21266&amp;user_id=0efc432f77b540affba7c95c094bc5e0&amp;regi_id=715647290214\">New York Times suggests</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The attorney general had been contemplating how to respond since he became aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the department, according to a person familiar with his thinking.

The four prosecutors on the case subsequently resigned in protest. Stone is due to be sentenced on 20 February. </p> <p>We\u2019ll cover the continuing fallout from this and all US political news here throughout the day.</p> <p>Trump is heading to Mar-a-Lago after his meetings today, while the Democratic candidates competing to take him on in November continue to campaign across the country.

      "bodyText": "Kari Paul here, logging off for the night. Here is the news of the last few hours: The Trump administration has promised to deploy specially trained tactical border patrol units to crack down on sanctuary cities across the US. Attorneys for Roger Stone demanded a new trial on Friday. Donald Trump tweeted in memory of the Parkland, Florida massacre that killed 17 people two years ago today. Bill de Blasio, the New York Mayor, has endorsed Bernie Sanders for president. Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor, has officially endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, the Sanders campaign said on Friday. De Blasio himself made a bid for the White House in September but dropped out after just a few weeks. He will travel with Sanders to Nevada on Sunday ahead of the state\u2019s caucuses on 22 February. \u201cNew Yorkers know all too well the damage caused by Donald Trump\u2019s xenophobia, bigotry and recklessness, and Bernie is the candidate to take him on and take him down,\u201d the announcement quoted de Blasio as saying. \u201cI have called for a bold, progressive agenda, and that\u2019s exactly what Senator Sanders has championed for decades.\u201d In 2016, de Blasio endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders, but later said he believes Sanders could have beaten Trump. On Friday, Donald Trump offered condolences on Twitter to commemorate two years since the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people. The president said he met with family members of victims earlier this week. Indeed Trump invited families of those killed to the White House to discuss school safety and developed an online tool to prevent violence. Not all families were invited to the event, however. In a move that has been called \u201cvengeful\u201d, one parent was left out. Fred Guttenberg, the parent of a 14-year-old girl who was killed in the Parkland shooting, was not allowed. He was forced to leave the State of the Union after shouting during the president\u2019s address. \u201cI wish the families well today and I hope that they have a great meeting\u201d, he said. \u201cMy issue with the public schedule remains however as it is not accurate and considering this week is two years since this happened, this should have been handled differently by the White House.\u201d Attorneys for Roger Stone demanded a new trial on Friday, as the ally of Donald Trump awaits sentencing on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress. The request comes after Trump sent out tweets on Thursday suggesting the trial was unfair. \u201cNow it looks like the fore person in the jury, in the Roger Stone case, had significant bias,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cAdd that to everything else, and this is not looking good for the \u2018Justice\u2019 Department.\u201d Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the congressional investigation into whether the Trump campaign orchestrated interference in the 2016 elections. The legal motion could delay sentencing for Stone, which was scheduled for 20 February. The Trump administration will soon deploy more aggressive border patrol methods in sanctuary cities, the New York Times reported on Friday. Specially trained tactical units that function as the \u201cSWAT of Border Patrol\u201d will assist local Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) units to enforce immigration laws, anonymous officials familiar with the secretive mission told the Times. They will begin operating in sanctuary cities around the country, including Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Houston, Boston, New Orleans, Detroit, and Newark, New Jersey. The deployment of these teams represents an escalation of Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing fight against \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, localities that decline to prosecute immigrants for deportation and allow them to stay. Kari Paul here, your friendly San Francisco tech reporter, hopping on the blog for the next few hours. Stay tuned for more updates. It\u2019s been a steady news day in Washington. To recap: The DOJ declined to pursue criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI. Attorney general William Barr has assigned an outside prosecutor to scrutinize the criminal case against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, according to multiple news outlets including the New York Times and CNN. Trump said he didn\u2019t interfere in the Roger Stone case, but that he had the \u201clegal right\u201d to do so if he wanted to. Michael Avenatti has been found guilty in the Nike extortion trial. New polling out of Nevada and South Carolina contained good news for Bernie Sanders, the party\u2019s new frontrunner. US negotiators have reached a temporary truce with the Taliban to reduce violence in Afghanistan, which they hope will pave the way to a more formal ceasefire. New York mayor Bill de Blasio, who ended a short-lived White House bid in September, will endorse Bernie Sanders for president, according to the New York Times. The mayor, an unapologetic progressive, endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in 2016. It was a tortured decision and De Blasio later said he believes Sanders would have beaten Trump. The US and the Taliban have agreed to a temporary truce to reduce violation in Afghanistan, a deal that, if successful, could lead to an official cease-fire, the start of peace negotiations with Afghan leaders and, eventually the withdrawal of US troops from the country. According to the Associated Press: The official said the agreement for a seven-day \u201creduction in violence\u201d is \u201cvery specific\u201d and covers the entire country, including Afghan government forces. There were indications a formal announcement could come as early as the weekend. The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Taliban had committed to a halt in roadside and suicide bombings as well as rocket attacks. The official said the U.S. would monitor the truce and determine if there were any violations. Read more here. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib joined protests for airline catering workers in Detroit. This is how she began her political career and she vowed not to change. Previous reports said she had been arrested at the protest but in fact she just sat with the workers in solidarity. Trump is departing Washington for Mar-a-Lago this weekend. But no chopper talk before he leaves. According to a pool report, Trump and Melania Trump boarded Marine One without taking any questions. We\u2019ve got some new polling out of South Carolina. According to an ECU poll released today, 28% of likely Democratic primary voters in South Carolina favor the Joe Biden, dropping nine percentage points since its last survey, conducted before the Iowa caucuses. Meanwhile, Sanders is closing in on Biden\u2019s lead, at 20% with Steyer dropping to third at 14%. Among likely voters who are African American, Biden leads with 36% compared with Sanders at 20% and Steyer with 17%. But the poll found a significant generational divide among the state\u2019s African American electorate. African American voters who are 55 and older prefer Biden by a wide margin while Sanders holds a narrow lead among African Americans voters younger than 55. The poll suggests that the results of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary have had an impact. After two dismal showings, Biden\u2019s standing has dropped significantly in South Carolina, where he has staked his political fortunes. Meanwhile, Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar are all enjoying a bump in the state. Still, Buttigieg and Klobuchar register only 4% and 1% support among likely African American voters, a critical constituency in the state and in the Democratic party. Well, this is awkward. For the record, the answer is Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, or as he is commonly known, AMLO. Also during his remarks Trump understated the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US. He said there had been 12, when the CDC confirmed a 15th case on Thursday. A New York Times report on the White House\u2019s tepid response to the outbreak revealed that public health experts fear Trump\u2019s \u201cextreme fear of germs, disdain for scientific and bureaucratic expertise and suspicion of foreigners could be a dangerous mix, should he wind up overseeing a severe outbreak at home.\u201d At the moment, Trump is addressing the National Border Security Council. He just said that he wanted to build his wall the \u201cold-fashioned way\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s throw up concrete. Plank!\u201d he said, explaining that he was persuaded that the wall needed to be transparent by stories about drug dealers catapulting 150lbs-200lbs-bags of drugs over the border wall. \u201cSometimes it would actually hit Border Patrol agents and other people on the other side because you couldn\u2019t see through,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as soon as they said that, that\u2019s what got me, I was like, you\u2019re right. You\u2019ve got to be able to see what\u2019s on the other side.\u201d He also said the wall will be too hot to touch in the baking desert sun and suggested that those trying to climb it would need serious athleticism and access to a hose. In other news, Michael Avenatti, a fallen hero of the anti-Trump resistance, was found guilty on all charges related to an attempt to extort Nike. He was convicted by a jury in federal court in New York on Friday afternoon. The revelation that Barr privately ordered an outside prosecutor to examine several high-profile cases, including one involving Flynn, comes days after Barr faced public outcry for intervening in the case of Roger Stone, a Trump confidante. That decision led four career prosecutors to quit the case and raised fears about the impartiality of the Justice Department and Trump\u2019s attorney general. \u201cThis is a crisis of credibility,\u201d Sasha Samberg-Champion, a former federal appellate attorney now with Relman Colfax told The Guardian recently. \u201cNobody knows whether decisions are being made based on the facts and the law, or whether they are based on a political whim.\u201d Read more by Ed Pilkington here: The New York Times is reporting that attorney general Barr has assigned an outside prosecutor to \u201cscrutinize the criminal case\u201d against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser. The review is highly unusual and could trigger more accusations of political interference by top Justice Department officials into the work of career prosecutors. Mr. Barr has also installed a handful of outside prosecutors to broadly review the handling of other politically sensitive national-security cases in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington, the people said. The team includes at least one prosecutor from the office of the United States attorney in St. Louis, Jeff Jensen, who is handling the Flynn matter, as well as prosecutors from the office of the deputy attorney general, Jeffrey A. Rosen. This comes less than an hour after news broke that the DOJ would not pursue criminal charges against McCabe. The Guardian has not independently confirmed this report. A bipartisan trio of US senators traveled to Ukraine with a message: let\u2019s move on from impeachment, according to Reuters. \u201cI think we all are confident that President Zelenskiy does not want to be involved in U.S. politics, and we hope that any pressure (that) existed in the past to do so is over,\u201d Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said after meeting the Ukrainian leader, Reuters reported from Kiev. \u201cOur message is we want to put this impeachment question behind us, and we want to be moving together, Republicans and Democrats, in supporting Ukraine.\u201d Murphy was accompanied to Kiev by Republican Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and John Barrasso of Wyoming. A July 25 call between Trump and Zelenskiy was at the heart of the impeachment charges against the US president, who was accused of withholding aid to Ukraine until the country agreed to investigate his political rivals. Speaking of the Nevada caucuses, a new survey out of the famously hard to poll Silver State contains some good news for Bernie Sanders, who is now the Democratic frontrunner. Sanders is betting big on support from young Latinx primary voters. Nevada will provide an early test ahead of Super Tuesday, where Sanders has invested heavily in courting California\u2019s Latinx voters. As in Iowa, a minimum threshold of 15% is required in each precinct in order to achieve viability. But unlike the Iowa caucuses, Nevada residents can vote early. Starting on Saturday and continuing through Tuesday, residents can cast their ballot in more than 80 polling locations, many of them on the Las Vegas strip. Surprise! Trump will extend his stay in Las Vegas so that it backs up fairly closely to the Nevada caucuses on 22 February. Trump has enjoyed counter-programming critical primary events in Iowa and New Hampshire to steal the attention from Democrats and gin up support from his base. Melania Trump is spending Valentine\u2019s Day decorating cookies and making heart-shaped wreaths with children at the National Institutes of Health. Here\u2019s a sampling of how other politicians are celebrating the day and some are much better at it than others. The Department of Justice announced on Friday that it would not pursue criminal charges against Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of Trump\u2019s wrath. Trump had publicly called on the department to take action against McCabe, who became acting head of the agency after the president fired FBI director James Comey in 2017. A lawyer for McCabe says that \u201cjustice has been done\u201d. A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that the Trump administration violated the law by allowing Arkansas to impose work requirements on their Medicaid programs for lower-income residents. Arkansas moved forward the first ever work requirements in Medicaid in 2018. Kentucky has also imposed restrictions though its plans were blocked by a trial judge and the state\u2019s new Democratic governor rescinded the plan. The issue has long divided Republicans and Friday\u2019s ruling comes as other conservative states consider e requirements. The ruling is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, tweeted on Friday: \u201cOur democracy is in crisis.\u201d Congressman Adam Schiff, who led the prosecution team in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, has called attorney general Barr an \u201caccomplice to trump\u2019s attack on the rule of law.\u201d Trump enjoys sowing division in the Democratic primary race, as the party\u2019s hopefuls battle for a chance to take him on. As such, Trump frequently claims that the Democratic party is attempting to rig the primary against Sanders, in an effort to inflame the long-simmering tensions supporters of the Vermont senator and the DNC. Yet, there is reason to question the sincerity of his concern for Sanders\u2019 standing. By many accounts, Trump\u2019s allies want to run against Sanders, who they believe can be easily targeted with attacks on his political ideology. As a caveat, campaigns are very bad at picking their opponents. Hillary Clinton\u2019s team was eager to take on Trump, assuming he\u2019d be the easiest to defeat. Trump is tweeting again, this time about his disappointment that senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, one of the few Democrats willing to work with the president, voted to convict him. But he is also quite pleased with his support among Republicans. Nevada\u2019s most politically powerful Culinary Union announced on Thursday that it would not endorse a candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary. But it has not stayed quiet. In a pamphlet distributed to its 130,000 members, the union warned against supporting Sanders and Warren over their embrace of Medicare for all. The union is strongly opposed to a government-run healthcare system, which would replace their hard-won health insurance plan. In a statement Wednesday, Culinary Union Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline said Sanders supporters have \u201cviciously attacked\u201d the union since it began sharing the flyer with members. The Nevada Independent on Friday published some of the threatening calls, emails and tweets directed at union officials. Some officials were attacked over their Latin American heritage and others reported that their personal information was shared online. \u201cThis is your chance to fix your mistake before the millions and millions of Bernie Sanders supporters will find you and end your ability to earn a living,\u201d one of the email says, according to the Nevada Independent. \u201cWe will find you corrupt mother fuckers of that you can be sure and we will make sure you wallow in poverty and suffering.\u201d \u201cApologize and fix your mistake or else you will pay \u2026 I know tens of thousands of Bernie supporters and we will come after you fascist imbeciles,\u201d it continues. \u201c#Bernie2020 #NotMeUs.\u201d Sanders has come under scrutiny for his reticence to condemn his \u201cinternet army,\u201d which he insists he cannot control. But his critics have been forced to hire security and even change their phone number after sustained online harassment by some of his supporters. In a statement Thursday, Sanders condemned \u201charassment in all forms\u201d and urged \u201csupporters of all campaigns not to engage in bullying or ugly personal attacks.\u201d \u201cWe can certainly disagree on issues, but we must do it in a respectful manner,\u201d he said. He went further in an interview with PBS Newshour: \u201cAnybody making personal attacks against anybody else in my name is not part of our movement.\u201d Read the full story here. It\u2019s a quadrennial thought experiment, entertained by journalists and pooh-poohed by party insiders, that a competitive primary race will result in a contested convention. Speculation reached fever pitch in 2016, before Trump sewed up the nomination. Nevertheless, we are here again. The prognosticators at FiveThirtyEight give Bernie Sanders the same odds of winning the nomination as a contested convention. The rationale: muddled results in Iowa and New Hampshire, a weak frontrunner and at least five leading candidates have committed to staying in the race until Super Tuesday, when roughly 40% of the overall delegates are allocated. It\u2019s there they will meet a sixth candidate, Michael Bloomberg, whose unorthodox campaign and unparalleled financial resources will like shake up the race further at that stage. It\u2019s been decades since either party arrived at their convention without a nominee, but anxiety is growing this cycle and the campaigns are drawing up plans in the unlikely event this year is different. This comes as moderate and establishment are increasingly alarmed by the prospect of nominating a democratic socialist to take on Trump. Sanders this week warned of a scenario in which Democratic insiders try to overrule a frontrunner who arrives at the convention with a plurality, but not a majority, of delegates. However, such an outcome would be allowed under the rules agreed to after 2016 by Sanders\u2019 allies in collaboration with the party. \u201cThe convention would have to explain to the American people, \u2018Hey, candidate X got the most votes and won the most delegates at the primary process, but we\u2019re not going to give him or her the nomination,\u2019\u201d Sanders said on MSNBC. \u201cI think that would be a divisive moment for the Democratic Party.\u201d Hello \u2013 this is Lauren Gambino in Washington taking over from Paul Owen. (Thanks Paul!) Today the president heads to Mar-a-Lago, aka the winter White House, but not before we see him speak to National Border Patrol Council Members this afternoon. Meanwhile, the leading 2020 Democratic hopefuls are fanning out around the country ahead of next week\u2019s caucuses in Nevada, the South Carolina primary and what\u2019s being called the \u201cbig Kahuna\u201d of the nominating contest, Super Tuesday. But the big morning news is another tweet from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. An emboldened president earlier assailed the sentencing recommendation of his convicted friend Roger Stone. The Department of Justice, led by attorney general Barr, intervened to lessen the recommendation, eliciting praise from Trump and setting off alarm among prosecutors. In an interview with ABC on Thursday, Barr said the president\u2019s tweets about about the Justice Department \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we\u2019re doing our work with integrity\u201d. On Friday, Trump quoted from that interview in a tweet, saying that while he never asked Barr to intervene directly in a criminal case, he had the \u201clegal right\u201d to do so. Trump is up and about, and giving us his first \u2013 relatively restrained \u2013 response to William Barr\u2019s criticism last night (see earlier). To summarise: I didn\u2019t interfere in the Roger Stone case, but I could have if I wanted to, and if I had, that would have been fine. But I didn\u2019t. 5/5 Bernie Sanders America\u2019s leading socialist won the New Hampshire primary without any of the confusion that surrounded last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses (which still don\u2019t have an official winner). On top of that the field of centrists who oppose him continues to fracture \u2013 with Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar now jostling for space with former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg, ex-VP Joe Biden and (soon) billionaire businessman and former mayor of New York Michael Bloomerg. If that split endures, Sanders could end up winning the most delegates in the Democratic race \u2013 although perhaps not a majority. That would usher in a second round in which elected officials and party bigwigs or \u201csuperdelegates\u201d \u2013 many of whom seem terrified at the prospect of a Sanders win \u2013 get to play a role, raising the prospect of a hugely contentious battle at the end of the primary process. 4/5 Amy Klobuchar The Minnesota centrist was this week\u2019s surprise success story, jumping from single figures in the polls to win nearly 20% of the vote in New Hampshire and place third. Whether Klobuchar can keep this momentum rolling into Nevada and South Carolina is very much up for debate \u2013 like Buttigieg, she has negligible support among the minorities whose votes are crucial in those states \u2013 but for now she has been thrown an unexpected lifeline. She\u2019ll try to make the most of it with another memorable debate performance in Las Vegas on 19 February. 3/5 Donald Trump Voting to acquit Donald Trump in his impeachment trial last week, moderate Republican senator Susan Collins said: \u201cI believe that the president has learned from this case\u201d and \u201cwill be much more cautious in the future\u201d. Trump didn\u2019t seem to get that memo. Instead he fired two of the officials who gave evidence against him in his impeachment \u2013 plus one guy\u2019s twin brother for good measure. Then he tweeted that the sentence faced by his friend Roger Stone was a \u201chorrible and unfair \u2026 miscarriage of justice\u201d, after which the justice department reduced its sentence recommendation and the entire prosecution team resigned. As the controversy over the independence of his department snowballed, attorney general William Barr \u2013 a staunch loyalist \u2013 told the president to stop tweeting about criminal cases because it was making his job \u201cimpossible\u201d. Was this a plan agreed by Barr and Trump in order to take the heat out of the issue or the start of a damaging split with one of the administration\u2019s big beasts? The jury\u2019s out. 2/5 Michael Bloomberg On the one hand, the billionaire continued to rise in the polls \u2013 he is now third nationally in polling averages \u2013 as he continued spending freely amid palpable media excitement about him joining the Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday (3 March). On the other, his record on race came under fierce scrutiny, with Trump tweeting (and then strangely deleting) a clip of a 2015 speech in which the former New York mayor defended putting \u201call the cops in minority neighbourhoods \u2026 because that\u2019s where all the crime is\u201d. Even before he formally kicked off his campaign, Bloomberg had apologised for his discriminatory \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policy, and was rising in the polls with black voters. But this clip reopened the issue, and was followed by the resurfacing of 2008 comments in which Bloomberg said the crash of that year was caused by banks ending a practice called \u201credlining\u201d which discriminated against lending to minorities. Rival Elizabeth Warren said his comments meant he was unfit to be the Democratic candidate. \u201cI want to be clear,\u201d she said: \u201cthat crisis would not have been averted if the banks had been able to be bigger racists, and anyone who thinks that should not be the leader of our party.\u201d 1/5 Larry David The writer and star of Curb your Enthusiasm came up with a typical witty and intricately plotted gag for the first episode of the show\u2019s new season: Larry buys a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat to wear as a \u201cpeople repellent\u201d to get him out of unwanted social situations involving his liberal LA peers. The hat also works the other way \u2013 a biker furious at Larry\u2019s dangerous driving instantly forgives him when Larry puts on the red cap \u2013 and it was this clip that Trump tweeted out, summarising its message as \u201cTOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!\u201d While commentators were quick to accuse the president of not getting the joke, it\u2019s more likely that he and his formidable social media guru knew exactly what they were doing \u2013 appropriating another piece of pop culture to his ends as he had with Game of Thrones and the Avengers, driving liberals crazy and reducing the joke to the reductive point that fearsome-looking bikers back the president. Poor Larry found himself unwittingly enlisted into the Trump 2020 re-election campaign. 0/5 Joe Biden The man once expected to dominate the Democratic primary race lost his frontrunner status this week, limping in fifth in New Hampshire and rushing straight on to South Carolina, which may end up being his last stand when it votes on 29 February. Can he hold on to the African American vote that he has always seen as one of his great sources of political strength? In between he also has to compete in Nevada, where Sanders is looking increasingly strong. Biden also found time this week to call a voter \u201ca lying, dog-faced pony soldier\u201d \u2013 an incident that did nothing to calm worries about his temperament and acuity. He claims the line comes from a John Wayne movie, but another one comes to mind about the faltering Biden campaign: \u201cMister, you better find yourself another line of work. This one sure don\u2019t fit your pistol.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Pete Buttigieg have so far focused on his unusual name and his alleged resemblance to Mad magazine mascot Alfred E Neumann \u2013 a slightly outdated reference the young Democrat humorously said he \u201chad to Google\u201d. But there has been speculation about whether Trump \u2013 or his allies \u2013 will eventually attempt to make an issue of Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality if the former South Bend mayor continues his run of strong primary showings. Yesterday Rush Limbaugh \u2013 the rightwing talk-show host honoured by Trump with the Presidential Medal of Freedom last week, gave a taste of what that might look like, speculating that Democrats were worried about \u201chow\u2019s this going to look? Thirty-seven-year-old gay guy kissing his husband on stage, next to Mr. Man, Donald Trump.\u2019\u201d Joe Biden \u2013 one of the 38-year-old Buttigieg\u2019s main centrist competitors \u2013 sprang to his defence. \u201cPete and I are competitors, but this guy has honor, he has courage, he is smart as hell.\u201d Sebastian Gorka, another Trump ally, also made an issue of Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality on his own talk show. \u201cWhy is a homosexual man lecturing us about the sanctity of life in the womb? Just a little curious there. Strange, strange,\u201d Gorka said of Buttigieg\u2019s views on abortion. \u201cI thought you\u2019re supposed to stay in your lane as a leftist. You can\u2019t comment on the lived experience of the other.\u201d Trump himself, however, was asked about whether Americans would vote for a gay man as president on Cleveland\u2019s Newsradio WTAM yesterday. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there would be some that wouldn\u2019t. I wouldn\u2019t be among that group, to be honest with you.\u201d Two leading Republican voices came out in favour of Barr in the dispute yesterday, with Senator Mitch McConnell, the party\u2019s leader in the Senate, saying: \u201cIf the attorney general says it\u2019s getting in the way of doing his job, maybe the president should listen.\u201d Lindsey Graham, a close Trump ally who was scathing about the impeachment trial against the president, said Barr was \u201cthe right man at the right time to reform the department and stand up for the rule of law\u201d. Perhaps more significant in terms of influencing Trump\u2019s response was feedback from his favourite TV channel, Fox News. Sean Hannity put a brave face on the dispute, stressing to viewers that Barr had said Trump had not discussed Stone\u2019s sentencing with him. \u201cIn fact, the attorney general, he takes orders from no one,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cAnd by the way, he shouldn\u2019t. He needs to remain independent.\u201d But Lou Dobbs \u2013 another favourite of the president\u2019s \u2013 was openly critical \u2013 not just angry, but disappointed too. \u201cI guess I am so disappointed in Bill Barr,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame when he doesn\u2019t get what this president has gone through, and what the American people have gone through, and what his charge is as attorney general.\u201d He added: To hear this attorney general complain about this president, who is fighting every one of those damn people to do the right thing and get this country straightened out and it\u2019s mission to do so and not to carp about his boss. And, by the way, I don\u2019t want to hear any crap about an independent Justice Department. This Justice Department, as does everyone, works for the president. It\u2019s part of the executive branch. Conventional legal opinion holds that the justice department should be independent from White House pressure. Good morning. US attorney general William Barr made an unexpected intervention into the ballooning controversy over Donald Trump\u2019s interference in the trial of his friend Roger Stone. Barr \u2013 seen as a staunch Trump loyalist \u2013 publicly rebuked the president, saying that Trump\u2019s tweets about the Stone case \u201cmake it impossible for me to do my job\u201d and adding that he would not be \u201cbullied or influenced\u201d over justice department decisions. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,\u201d Barr told ABC. The attorney general claimed Trump \u201chas never asked me to do anything in a criminal case\u201d, but he acknowledged the president\u2019s comments undercut his authority. The initial reaction from the White House was relatively calm. Press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president \u201cwasn\u2019t bothered\u201d by Barr\u2019s comments, adding: \u201c[Barr] has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions. President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country.\u201d Whether that line holds when Trump gets up this morning and begins his effective use of social media for the day remains to be seen. The president has a low tolerance for criticism, whether from friends or enemies \u2013 as former chief of staff John Kelly saw yesterday. Barr\u2019s motivations are also in question. He has been called to testify to Congress about alleged political interference at the justice department, and may be preparing the groundwork for that. He may also be attempting to save his reputation \u2013 which has been shredded since he joined the Trump administration last year, particularly after his handling of the Mueller report. Barr characterized the report in ways that appeared to absolve Trump of wrongdoing on numerous occasions, even though the redacted version of the Mueller report released in April 2019 showed nearly a dozen instances in which the president or his campaign sought to obstruct justice. The New York Times suggests: The attorney general had been contemplating how to respond since he became aware of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks on the department, according to a person familiar with his thinking. Speaking up could have put Mr. Barr at risk of losing the backing of the president, but remaining silent would have permitted Mr. Trump to continue attacking law enforcement and all but invited open revolt among the some 115,000 employees of the Justice Department. Ultimately, Mr. Barr concluded that he had to speak out to preserve his ability to do his job effectively, the person said \u2026 The attorney general had let the president know some of what he planned to say and is remaining in his job, a person familiar with the events said. The attorney general\u2019s rebuke comes amid an intensifying fallout over the Stone case, after the justice department overruled its own prosecutors who had recommended that Stone, a longtime Trump ally and confidant, be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison. The four prosecutors on the case subsequently resigned in protest. Stone is due to be sentenced on 20 February. We\u2019ll cover the continuing fallout from this and all US political news here throughout the day. Trump is heading to Mar-a-Lago after his meetings today, while the Democratic candidates competing to take him on in November continue to campaign across the country. Bernie Sanders will be in North Carolina and Texas; Pete Buttigieg in Nevada and California; and Joe Biden, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer in Nevada. Oh, and by the way:",

Beijing has a population of more than 20 million people and the annual National People\u2019s Congress, where thousands of Communist Party delegates pour into the city, is due to start on 5 March. \u201cFrom now on, all those who have returned to Beijing should stay at home or submit to group observation for 14 days after arriving,\u201d Beijing\u2019s virus prevention working group said in a notice cited by the Beijing Daily. \u201cThose who refuse to accept home or centralised observation and other prevention and control measures will be held accountable under the law,\u201d it said. A National Health Commission official Liang Wannian told a news conference the government would continue to try to contain the spread of virus in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province \u2013 the centre of the outbreak.

The number of trade fairs, sports events and industry conferences in China and overseas that have been affected by the spread of the virus continued to increase. International Business Machines Corp (IBM) said on Friday it had canceled its participation in the RSA cyber security conference in San Francisco at the end of February due to coronavirus-related concerns. Earlier, Facebook said it had cancelled its global marketing summit scheduled for next month, also in San Francisco, over worry about the same risks. The Mobile World Congress (MWC), the annual telecoms industry gathering in Barcelona, was also cancelled after a mass exodus by exhibitors linked to the coronavirus. Organisers of next week\u2019s gymnastics World Cup in Melbourne said on Saturday the entire Chinese team had pulled out due to travel restrictions. A top Chinese official, in an interview with Reuters, acknowledged that the coronavirus was a huge challenge, but defended the government\u2019s management of the epidemic and lashed out at the \u201coverreaction\u201d of some countries.

Outside mainland China, there have been nearly 450 cases in some 28 countries and territories, and three deaths. Japan confirmed its first coronavirus death on Thursday. One person has died in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. The virus is killing about 2% of those infected, but has spread faster than other respiratory viruses that emerged this century.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cPassengers will be screened for symptoms and we are working with our Japanese partners to ensure that any symptomatic passengers receive the required care in Japan if they cannot board the flight,\u201d the letter said.</p> \n<p>\u201cShould you choose not to return on this charter flight, you will be unable to return to the United States for a period of time.\u201d</p> \n<p>It added: \u201cWe recognise this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can and seeing you safely and expeditiously reunited with family and friends in the United States,\u201d the letter said.</p> \n<p>The Diamond Princess\u2019s 3,700 passengers and crew were placed in quarantine on 3 February after it emerged that a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong at the end of last month had tested positive for the virus.</p> \n<p>So far, 218 people on the ship have tested positive for the coronavirus, officially known as Covid-19 \u2013 the biggest cluster of cases outside China.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of American passengers onboard a cruise liner quarantined in Japan due to the coronavirus outbreak will be flown home on chartered aircraft, the US embassy in Tokyo said on Saturday. The aircraft is expected to arrive in Japan late on Sunday to fly the estimated 380 US citizens onboard the Diamond Princess to Travis air force base in California, where they will have to spend another fortnight in quarantine. The embassy said in a letter to the passengers that they would have to undergo health checks before boarding the US government-chartered plane, adding that those showing symptoms such as a fever or cough would not be allowed on the flight. The plane is expected to leave from Tokyo\u2019s Haneda airport on Monday. \u201cPassengers will be screened for symptoms and we are working with our Japanese partners to ensure that any symptomatic passengers receive the required care in Japan if they cannot board the flight,\u201d the letter said. \u201cShould you choose not to return on this charter flight, you will be unable to return to the United States for a period of time.\u201d It added: \u201cWe recognise this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can and seeing you safely and expeditiously reunited with family and friends in the United States,\u201d the letter said. The Diamond Princess\u2019s 3,700 passengers and crew were placed in quarantine on 3 February after it emerged that a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong at the end of last month had tested positive for the virus. So far, 218 people on the ship have tested positive for the coronavirus, officially known as Covid-19 \u2013 the biggest cluster of cases outside China. The remaining passengers and crew must remain onboard at least until their two-week quarantine ends next Wednesday. Matthew Smith, an American passenger, said he would prefer to see out the next few days of quarantine in his cabin than leave early and potentially spend another two weeks in isolation in the US. \u201cIncredibly disappointed that the US government has decided to throw a monkey wrench into the quarantine we have maintained here on board the Diamond Princess. If we stay onboard through next week, we will be tested and will likely come up negative,\u201d Smith tweeted on Saturday. \u201cBut the US government instead wants to take us off without testing, fly us back to the US with a bunch of other untested people, and then stick us in two more weeks of quarantine? How does that make any sense at all?\u201d Japan\u2019s health ministry allowed 11 passengers to leave on Friday, giving priority to those aged over 80, and those who have pre-existing medical conditions or are staying in windowless cabins.",

I thought my family, prevented from going out, would at least be safe,\u201d she wrote on 29 January from Italy, where she is in her last year of university. \u201cIt never occurred to me they would not be able to escape this.\u201d</p> <p>Liu\u2019s 54-year-old father, Liu Daoyu, who developed a sore throat and cough five days earlier, had just tested positive for the virus. Her 90-year-old grandfather, Lei Ruting, was showing even more serious symptoms: a fever that wouldn\u2019t relent and breathing difficulties.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone in the family is extremely worried,\u201d she wrote. Still, she ended her entry on a positive note: \u201cWe believe everything will be okay. Thank you to the frontline people fighting this. Thank you to those who have helped us.\u201d</p> <p>Three days later, that optimism had disappeared. \u201cOn 2 February 2020 at 3:08pm Beijing time, my grandfather passed away from \u2018unknown pneumonia\u2019. He just turned 90 last month. He was always healthy,\u201d Liu, distraught, wrote. \u201cFar more than grief, I feel lost and angry.\u201d</p> <p>The coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19, has claimed at least 1,380 lives in China, with more than 1,300 in Hubei province. Wuhan, the provincial capital, was where the virus emerged in December, and has suffered the worst, with 1,016 deaths.</p> <p>Liu\u2019s family is one of hundreds who have not only lost a loved one to the virus, but struggled to get them treatment. A few days before her grandfather died, he had a fever all through the night and fell out of bed. When her relatives called for an ambulance, they were told there was no use in sending him to the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cIf he really is suffering from the virus there is nothing that can be done. Going to the hospital where no one will take care of him may be even more difficult,\u201d Liu said, recounting the advice her family had been given. Following instructions, the family contacted the local neighbourhood committee \u2013 which is charged with arranging tests, quarantines and transport to the hospitals \u2013 but were given no help. Eventually, Liu posted her family\u2019s story on Weibo, pleading for help, and also contacted local media, which reported her account.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fb6d877948eacf0f12eb36bada89031ee147102\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fb6d877948eacf0f12eb36bada89031ee147102/19_119_1421_853/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lei Ruting celebrating his 90th birthday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lei Ruting celebrating his 90th birthday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Liu Mengdi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually, health workers came to their home, took a blood sample from her grandfather and advised him to find somewhere to do the full diagnostic test, kits for which are in short supply across the city. But her family was advised to stop putting out online calls for help and to post only \u201cpositive\u201d messages.</p> <p>A journalist and friend of the family helped find a hospital that had testing kits available. Seeing photos and videos of him at the hospital, Liu felt relieved. But the next day, Lei died before the diagnosis could come back. His body was sent for immediate cremation after a short ceremony where staff set off firecrackers. The family was not allowed to go or collect the ashes.</p> <p>\u201cGrandpa really is strong. We knew he must have been in a lot of pain, but he still insisted and pretended he was fine,\u201d Liu said. \u201cBefore his results could come back, he couldn\u2019t hold on any more and closed his eyes for the last time.\u201d</p> <p>Now, Liu\u2019s family is fighting to save her father \u2013 an increasingly common scenario as sick patients are turned away from overcrowded hospitals and sent home to self-quarantine, where they often end up infecting other family members.</p> <p>The family is not sure how the two may have caught the virus. But just before the city was put under quarantine, both Liu\u2019s father and grandfather had visited friends and neighbours who were later found to be infected. More than 50,000 people in the province have been infected.</p> <p>Her father has been in the hospital since 29 January \u2013 they managed to find a bed through family friends. To get a diagnosis, he had to walk to the hospital and back, covering almost 18 miles on foot while in the grip of a fever. Liu spoke to him as he walked back until his phone\u2019s battery gave out.</p> <p>The doctors said her dad was the most cheerful person in the ward. He told the family he would be better in three weeks at the most. Her father is extremely active, doesn\u2019t drink or smoke and plays badminton three times a week. He always walks 10,000 steps a day.</p> <p>\u201cHe is 54 years old, but everyone says he looks like he is in his 40s,\u201d Liu said. When he was first admitted, she asked the hospital staff if they could give her father, who still had a good appetite, two lunch boxes.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>He liked to say that he fought with Mao Zedong. I wish my dear grandfather a safe journey</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But his condition has worsened dramatically. On 10 February, his birthday, Liu made a video with friends from around the world wishing her father well and an early recovery. But that day, the hospital asked her mother to sign a form confirming his critical state.</p> <p>Later, Liu\u2019s mother told her that his lungs had stopped working. Her father is now in an intensive-care unit connected to a machine that pumps and oxygenates his blood.</p> <p>Like many residents watching in desperation as their loved ones grow sicker, the family\u2019s views have started to shift. Liu is especially angry about being told not to post online. \u201cI can\u2019t even ask for help?\u201d she wrote in one of her diary entries.</p> <p>Earlier this month, her WeChat account was blocked \u2013 she suspects because she was posting about the virus. Her father\u2019s phone seems to have been taken away and she can no longer call him.</p> <p>\u201cThe epidemic has changed how some in my family view the news we get at home. In the past, my family always 100% believed the domestic reports. Even when I told them about overseas reports, they would never believe me,\u201d said Liu, who has lived in Italy for six years. \u201cAfter the outbreak, they said would believe me in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The outbreak, which has shown no signs of abating despite drastic quarantine measures implemented across the country, has inspired what is for the ruling Communist party a dangerous level of public anger. Residents are angry at local authorities for their slow response to the virus, allowing it to spread for weeks. People like Liu are angry at the government for leaving the people of Wuhan to struggle. Party leaders have promised to win the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against the virus, and last week fired several senior officials in Hubei province.</p> <p>\u201cFor the regime, this has been a Chernobyl moment. Immediately around the event, everything continued as before,\u201d said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese politics at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cHowever, in their hearts, many people lost the belief that the party is uniquely capable of governing China. If that is the case, the effectiveness of government decrees will decline over time as lower-level officials and the people resist passively. Only time will tell.\u201d</p> <p>Liu hopes that her father will recover soon, and that she can take him on a trip to Europe to relax.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/channel-4-worker-taken-to-hospital-for-coronavirus-test\">Channel 4 worker taken to hospital for coronavirus test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But her family is still coping with the loss of her grandfather. Her mother, now alone at home, has taken to staying with her sister. She cries often. Liu herself has trouble focusing on her education in Italy, where she studies architecture, and her internship. She wants to go home to see her family, but her mother says it isn\u2019t safe.</p> <p>She remembers her grandfather fondly. He loved singing, and he was proud of his contributions to his country as a loyal party member and volunteer during the Cultural Revolution. \u201cHe liked to say that he fought with Mao Zedong,\u201d she said.</p> <p>He spoiled his grandchildren, including Liu, bringing her KFC when he picked her up from school and giving her change to buy snacks. The family, of about 20 members, is close. In one of her last conversations with her grandfather, he laughed over the phone and told her to take good care of herself.</p> <p>\u201cI will never forget why my grandfather died. I will never forget his smile. I wish my dear grandfather a safe journey,\u201d she wrote on the day he passed away.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu</em></p>",

Only time will tell.\u201d Liu hopes that her father will recover soon, and that she can take him on a trip to Europe to relax. But her family is still coping with the loss of her grandfather. Her mother, now alone at home, has taken to staying with her sister. She cries often. Liu herself has trouble focusing on her education in Italy, where she studies architecture, and her internship. She wants to go home to see her family, but her mother says it isn\u2019t safe. She remembers her grandfather fondly. He loved singing, and he was proud of his contributions to his country as a loyal party member and volunteer during the Cultural Revolution. \u201cHe liked to say that he fought with Mao Zedong,\u201d she said. He spoiled his grandchildren, including Liu, bringing her KFC when he picked her up from school and giving her change to buy snacks. The family, of about 20 members, is close. In one of her last conversations with her grandfather, he laughed over the phone and told her to take good care of herself. \u201cI will never forget why my grandfather died. I will never forget his smile. I wish my dear grandfather a safe journey,\u201d she wrote on the day he passed away. Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu",

Daniel Zhang, the boss of China\u2019s biggest listed company, Alibaba, described the coronavirus outbreak as a potential \u201cblack swan\u201d event that could derail the global economy. Here are some of the main industries affected so far. Airlines The virus has prompted 21 airlines to cancel all flights to mainland China, including Delta, United, Qantas and Air France/KLM.

About 30% of its network capacity has been cut, and it has asked its 27,000 employees to take unpaid leave to help it stay afloat.

Prof Christl Donnelly, of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling, Imperial College London, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In our modern interconnected world, it is not surprising for imported Covid-19 cases to be detected in previously unaffected countries. It is encouraging that the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) are working with the World Health Organization and African member states to support diagnostic and surveillance capabilities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician, Cardiff University School of Medicine, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It was always inevitable that the virus would spread to the African continent. Indeed, there may well already be more cases in other African countries that have evaded detection. The concern is that it may prove impossible to contain the spread of Covid-19 in developing countries with less robust health systems; this, in turn, could lead to wider global spread.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Prof Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The WHO declared this to be a PHE [public health emergency] because they wanted to support less well resourced nations in responding and preparing for cases. This first case in Africa is important but not unexpected. The patient is isolated and contacts found and tested (all negative). The response of the Africa CDC shows the strong networks and collaboration that there is in place across Africa and these organisations are working now to train and prepare staff in order to maximise capabilities to detect and isolate cases. A key challenge is diagnostic capacity across much of Africa and here is where global support and research to find validated, inexpensive kits that can be used in the community is going to be critical.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Cairo is the destination typically receiving the most visitors and workers from China, so it is unsurprising the first case on the African continent is seen in Egypt. There have been concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak when it arrives in Africa. Therefore, it is reassuring that there has been some rapid contact tracing and all contacts have tested negative. This gives confidence that this might be an isolated case with minimal transmission.\u201d</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-15T15:41:44.805Z\">at 3.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e47fef98f0811db2faf84e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-15T14:34:29.404Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">American woman on cruise ship turned away by five countries tests positive for coronavirus</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An American passenger on a cruise ship that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/westerdam-cruise-ship-with-2000-onboard-refused-port-by-four-countries-amid-coronavirus-fears\">was turned away from five countries, despite no reports at the sickness on board at the tim</a>e, has tested positive for coronavirus. </p> <p>The 83-year-old female holidaymaker tested positive in Malaysia, the country\u2019s health ministry confirmed.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s main coronavirus developments, as the outbreak continues across the globe: Europe has its first confirmed death from the disease as France\u2019s health minister announced that an 80-year-old Chinese man who travelled from the coronavirus-hit Hubei province to Paris last month had died. Eight of the nine patients in the UK who tested positive for the coronavirus have been discharged, NHS England has confirmed. Five of the patients released a statement saying that they were \u201cfeeling well and looking forward to being home\u201d. Health secretary Matt Hancock said the fact that eight patients had been successfully treated and discharged from hospital was \u201cevidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. An American passenger on a cruise ship, turned away from five countries despite no reports of the sickness on board at the time before finally docking in Cambodia, has tested positive for coronavirus. Here\u2019s some experts views on yesterday\u2019s confirmation of the first coronavirus case in Africa, after a patient tested positive in Egypt. Prof Christl Donnelly, of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling, Imperial College London, said: In our modern interconnected world, it is not surprising for imported Covid-19 cases to be detected in previously unaffected countries. It is encouraging that the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) are working with the World Health Organization and African member states to support diagnostic and surveillance capabilities. Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician, Cardiff University School of Medicine, said: It was always inevitable that the virus would spread to the African continent. Indeed, there may well already be more cases in other African countries that have evaded detection. The concern is that it may prove impossible to contain the spread of Covid-19 in developing countries with less robust health systems; this, in turn, could lead to wider global spread.\u201d Prof Trudie Lang, director of the Global Health Network, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, said: The WHO declared this to be a PHE [public health emergency] because they wanted to support less well resourced nations in responding and preparing for cases. This first case in Africa is important but not unexpected. The patient is isolated and contacts found and tested (all negative). The response of the Africa CDC shows the strong networks and collaboration that there is in place across Africa and these organisations are working now to train and prepare staff in order to maximise capabilities to detect and isolate cases. A key challenge is diagnostic capacity across much of Africa and here is where global support and research to find validated, inexpensive kits that can be used in the community is going to be critical.\u201d Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: Cairo is the destination typically receiving the most visitors and workers from China, so it is unsurprising the first case on the African continent is seen in Egypt. There have been concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak when it arrives in Africa. Therefore, it is reassuring that there has been some rapid contact tracing and all contacts have tested negative. This gives confidence that this might be an isolated case with minimal transmission.\u201d An American passenger on a cruise ship that was turned away from five countries, despite no reports at the sickness on board at the time, has tested positive for coronavirus. The 83-year-old female holidaymaker tested positive in Malaysia, the country\u2019s health ministry confirmed. She had flown there along with 144 others from the ship on Friday from Cambodia, where the Westerdam cruise ship eventually docked. The woman\u2019s husband tested negative for the disease, Malaysia\u2019s health ministry added. The Westerdam, operated by US-based Holland America Line, docked in the port of Sihanoukville, Cambodia on Thursday after being turned away by several countries on fears that passengers could be carrying the virus. The vessel, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, spent two weeks at sea. Passengers were tested regularly on board and 20 were also tested once the ship docked in Cambodia. However, no one tested positive at the time. The coronavirus outbreak is still an emergency for China and it is impossible to tell where the epidemic will spread, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general has said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreye told the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday that he was encouraged by actions China had taken to slow the spread of virus but was still concerned about the increasing number of cases, with the total hitting 66,000. Five members of a ski group who stayed at a French chalet visited by the businessman Steve Walsh, who has been linked to 11 cases of coronavirus, say they are looking forward to returning home after beating the disease. The patients, who are among eight released from hospital in the UK after recovering from coronavirus, said in a joint statement that they were \u201cfeeling well and looking forward to being home\u201d. They were at the same chalet as Walsh, a scout leader from Hove, who was the first British national identified as having caught the virus. He said on Tuesday that he had fully recovered. In a statement, the five group members said: \u201cAll of our group, including the six in other countries, have recovered quickly from the virus having required minimal medical treatment during our time in isolation. \u201cWe understand the virus can be dangerous for some, but we also want to share the important facts of our situation to help reassure people. \u201cWe want to thank everybody who has been involved in our care, in particular the NHS nurses and doctors who have looked after us over the past few days. \u201cWe would also like to thank our families, friends, work colleagues and members of the public for their support.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has responded to the news that all but one of the UK\u2019s nine coronavirus patients have been discharged from hospital and the release of quarantined returnees from China. He said: As the last group leave supported isolation in the Wirral today, I want to express my thanks for their patience in these unique circumstances. The overwhelming gratitude expressed by those who left earlier this week is a testament to the exceptional support and tireless dedication of our NHS in trying circumstances. I am also pleased that 8 of the 9 individuals who tested positive for coronavirus have now been successfully treated and discharged from hospital. Again, this is evidence of how well prepared our NHS is to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus. I want to stress that any individuals who are discharged from hospital are now well and do not pose any public health risk to the public. UK citizens on board the locked-down cruise ship in Japan are appealing to be brought home for quarantine in Britain but the government has not yet said if it would follow the US lead in flying them out. Earlier, the US embassy in Tokyo announced it would fly out an estimated 380 Americans currently onboard the vessel, which has been in quarantine since the start of the month. Asked if the UK was planning an evacuation flight for British nationals on board the Diamond Princess, a Foreign Office spokesperson said only that officials are \u201cworking around the clock to ensure the welfare of the British nationals on board\u201d and \u201curgently speaking to authorities in Japan and the UK\u201d. Yesterday, a British man stuck with his wife onboard the luxury cruise ship appealed to billionaire Richard Branson to save them. In a Facebook live video, David Abel asked the Virgin boss to charter a plane to fly all British nationals on the ship home to carry out their quarantine. Appealing directly to Branson, he said: \u201cIf you and your family were in this situation, what would you do? And please don\u2019t say \u2018chill out, stay calm\u2019, that\u2019s not what we want to hear. \u201cI\u2019m asking: what would it cost to hire one of your smaller planes, put all the Brits onboard, no flight attendants, packaged food?\u201d Australia is dispatching a medical expert to Japan to assist the country\u2019s response to the quarantined cruise ship in Yokohama on which there are more than 200 confirmed coronavirus cases. The infectious disease expert will bolster an international team gathering details about the Diamond Princess\u2019s 3,000-plus passengers and crew, including 200 Australians. It follows the Australian government extending the country\u2019s two-week travel ban from mainland China for another seven days this week to prevent the spread of the disease. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says keeping Australians safe from the virus is \u201cabsolutely paramount\u201d, but concedes that it is a \u201csavage blow\u201d to tourism. \u201cThe ban on passenger air travel also impacts on a range of other industries that depend on frequent air movements to shift goods, including perishable products,\u201d the body\u2019s tourism executive chair, John Hart, said in a statement. \u201cTourism and trade would greatly benefit from even a partial lifting of the ban from provinces in China that present a much lower risk to Australians.\u201d Eight of the nine patients in the UK who tested positive for the coronavirus have been discharged, NHS England has confirmed. The last of those being quarantined at Arrowe Park after returning from China have left hospital, NHS England added. More than 100 people remain in isolation at the Kents Hill Park Hotel, Milton Keynes. Prof Keith Willet, NHS strategic incident director, said: The last guests have left Arrowe Park hospital and I would once again like to thank them for the calm, patient and responsible way that they have responded to what must have been a trying situation. Over the coming weeks many more of us may need to spend some time at home to reduce the spread of the virus and they have set a great example. I would like to thank all those NHS staff and partners, as well as Public Health England, who have worked so hard to make their stay as comfortable as possible, those still caring for guests in Milton Keynes and all the doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals who have successfully treated patients at other hospitals. We must not forget the local residents, council staff, volunteers and numerous others who have rallied round to help our guests in their time of need. Thank you all. My colleague, Lily Kuo, has written a heart-wrenching piece detailing the story of a 25-year-old Chinese woman who could only look on as her relatives were ravaged by the virus. Liu Mengdi has been keeping a diary of the past few weeks about the impact of coronavirus in her home town of Wuhan, but has now been warned to stop posting about the trauma. Writing movingly in her diary about her 90-year-old grandfather\u2019s death, Mengdi recorded: \u201cGrandpa really is strong. We knew he must have been in a lot of pain, but he still insisted and pretended he was fine. Before his results could come back, he couldn\u2019t hold on any more and closed his eyes for the last time.\u201d A further 67 passengers have come down with coronavirus on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, the country\u2019s health minister confirmed earlier. The Diamond Princess, which already had more than 200 people on board who tested positive for the disease, has been in lockdown since the start of the month. It had 3,700 passengers and crew when it went into quarantine on 3 February. It comes as the US embassy in Tokyo said earlier that it would fly nearly 400 of its citizens stuck onboard the ship home. As news filters through of Europe\u2019s first coronavirus death, here\u2019s some expert reaction. Dr Andrew Freedman, reader in infectious diseases and honorary consultant physician, Cardiff University School of Medicine, said: This first reported death in Europe from Covid-19 in an 80-year-old man comes as no surprise. Although the mortality rate is low \u2013 probably less than 2%, we know that the risk of severe disease and death is greatest in the elderly as well as those with underlying co-morbidities such as diabetes and chronic respiratory disease. It is still the case that the vast majority of infections are relatively mild with full recovery.\u201d Dr Robin Thompson, junior research fellow in mathematical epidemiology, University of Oxford, added: Given that we have now seen 46 coronavirus cases in total in Europe, it is unsurprising that we have seen our first death. The most important thing to point out, however, is that there still hasn\u2019t been sustained person-to-person transmission in Europe. As a result, the risk to individuals in the UK remains low.\u201d The confirmed coronavirus fatality in France is the first among 46 cases of the disease in Europe. According to the latest figures released by the World Health Organization (WHO) yesterday, Germany tops the list of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the continent at 16, followed by 11 in France and nine in the UK. There have been three cases in Italy, two in each of Russia and Spain, as well as individual cases in Sweden, Finland and Belgium. Here\u2019s some advice released by WHO on Twitter this morning on how to cope with stress during the outbreak: Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus live blog, where we will be bringing readers rolling coverage throughout the day, furnishing you with the latest developments on the outbreak. The death toll has now topped 1,500 with an additional 143 fatalities in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday. There have been more than 66,000 confirmed cases worldwide. Significantly, it emerged this morning that Europe has its first confirmed death from the disease as France\u2019s health minister announced that an 80-year-old Chinese man who travelled from the coronavirus-hit Hubei province last month had died. Meanwhile, nearly 400 American passengers stuck onboard a cruise liner quarantined in Japan due to the coronavirus outbreak will be flown home on chartered aircraft, the US embassy in Tokyo has said. Beijing has also ordered people returning to the city from holidays to quarantine themselves for 14 days. And, finally, in another bid to halt the coronavirus spread, China is disinfecting and isolating used banknotes.",
