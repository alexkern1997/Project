What was going on? How and why did the largely progressive and left-leaning proponents of wellness merge with rightwing conspiracy theorists and Donald Trump supporters? Such unlikely allegiances were termed \u201cfusion paranoia\u201d in a 1995 New Yorker article by the journalist Michael Kelly, who saw leftwing and rightwing activists coalesce around the anti-war and pro-civil liberties movements that shared common traits of anti-government views and belief in conspiracy theories. Such a tight alliance (or fusion paranoia) between the wellness industry and the far-right would have been unthinkable to me a year ago.

A popular, multitrillion-dollar sector, the wellness industry\u2019s huge reach and influence has the power to bring people into the conspiracy that previously would not have had any contact with the alt-right.

The ongoing and now-accelerated collapse of mainstream media has provided a perfect environment for the Covid conspiracies to reach millions of people unchecked and unchallenged. Disagreement with a conspiracy on an influencer\u2019s page could have you blocked, in dispute with other followers or, as the logic of conspiracies dictate, mocked and pitied for not getting it and having your mind controlled by the \u201cevil forces\u201d that you are too dumb to see. Like many conspiracies \u2013 or even religions \u2013 the beliefs are part of a closed system that is engineered to provide answers to our most maddening mysteries but also designed to allow no room for questioning and dissent. And there are a lot of maddening mysteries about the coronavirus.

If we were to move away from the US, and Trump obviously poses the challenge that that may have to happen, we are going to find ourselves in a situation in which much of our Foreign Office infrastructure had been predicated on working very closely with the US for a very long time.</p> <p>\u201cIf we have to move away from the US, it will involve a much bigger shift in national security infrastructure than we have ever experienced.

It is the first time in our lifetime we have experienced that.</p> <p>\u201cIf he gets elected for a second time some of the changes we have seen in the past few years will become embedded and entrenched and then, absolutely Britain will not be so much a bridge between the US and Europe.

Both men were speaking at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics.</p> <p>In a sign of British diplomats\u2019 despair with Trump, Sir Peter Westmacott, a former ambassador to Washington, said: \u201cI would love to say, as we look to the future, would it not be nice to see political leadership also addressing old-fashioned principles such as accountability, respect for the rule of law, independent judiciary, telling the truth, institutional independence and indeed the importance of a free press?</p> <p>\u201cThat may not be what public opinion is crying out for, but they are not very far removed from the principles that \u2026 Biden believes in. Otherwise the chances of the western world retaining any sort of moral leadership and giving itself the right to call out other people when they behave badly will be gone forever.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8004f8b93131d99ec9e8b89442c215fbecc7bb99/0_134_2655_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Westmacott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Westmacott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Debate is fierce in British diplomatic circles about whether Trump merely marks the acceleration of a pre-existing trend to a more disengaged US, and whether Biden is either willing or able to reverse the trend.</p> <p>Blinken has tried to reassure British diplomats that Biden will re-engage with multilateral institutions, and told the London thinktank Chatham House that US leadership would return. \u201cWhen Joe Biden looks at the world, one thing stands out. Whether we like it not, the world tends not to organise itself and, for 75 plus years, the US played the leading role in working to organise the world, establishing the institutions, writing the rules and setting the norms,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are not doing that, then one of two things happen. Either someone else is, and probably not in a way that advances our interest and values, or no one is, and that can be even worse. Then you have a vacuum which tends to be filled by malevolent things before good things. So the US has a responsibility and self-interest in leading with humility.\u201d</p> <p>Many senior former UK ambassadors are desperately hoping Washington will lead again. One said: \u201cI think that if you have a different, more internationally minded leadership in the US then a lot of what has happened over the past few years can be reversed. If we get another four years of this leadership, then some of the bonds and some of the cement that holds the west together, and holds Europe and America together will be broken forever. If things change in November then we can recapture things if we get the right sort of leadership in Europe.\u201d</p> <p>The same diplomat also said, however, that Biden might \u2013 like Barack Obama \u2013 see Europe and particularly Germany as his primary interlocutor: \u201cIf you get a Joe Biden presidency in the US, then the relationship will focus again on Europe, on Germany and France, and we may feel a little neglected.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/addb17dd8d841f04dc9d7c60f066d76b61ee4674/0_0_2468_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama and Angela Merkel pictured in April 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kay Nietfield/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said that although Boris Johnson was closer to Trump than most European leaders, the importance of the special relationship was overrated. \u201cIf I\u2019m brutally frank it has not been that special for awhile,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Obama wanted to know what Europe thought about something his first call was to Merkel.\u201d</p> <p>Another ambassador from Tony Blair\u2019s time as prime minister said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to imagine restored American leadership to a multilateral world.

Armed with petrol bombs, acid bombs, gas cylinders, molotov cocktails and explosives, the men, numbering around 100, piled stealthily into small boats to cross over the Ganges river. Reaching their target, the banks of the small town of Telinipara, they climbed ashore. And then, they pounced.</p> <p>The violent onslaught that began at midday of 12 May was the pinnacle of the worst outbreak of religious violence in India since the riots that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">ripped through north-east Delhi in February</a> and killed over 50 people. Over three days in this small town in West Bengal, which, like the rest of India was under a strict nationwide coronavirus lockdown that confined everyone to their homes, Hindu attackers burned and decimated Muslim homes and shops and vandalised two mosques and a Muslim shrine. According to multiple accounts given to the Guardian, the perpetrators also exposed themselves to Muslim women and made rape and death threats as they carried out the brutality. In retaliation, local Muslims then began setting fire to Hindu homes. Of the 55 buildings eventually destroyed, around 45 belonged to Muslims.</p> <p>\u201cWe are ruined, they reduced everything to ashes,\u201d recalled Rubina Khatun, 22, who was with her four-year-old son when her home came under attack on 12 May. \u201cThey threw petrol bombs into our room and set it on fire. All nine Muslim houses in our row were attacked and four of them, including ours, were burned or destroyed completely.</p> <p>Speaking through shuddering sobs, Khatun continued: \u201cThe attackers stood on the roof next door and started shouting unthinkably vulgar abuses at me. \u2018Are you having sex with your son? He cannot satisfy you. Wait, I am coming to your room \u2026\u2019 one said and then pulled down his shorts. Another shouted, \u2018We will rape all the Muslim women here\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are the Hindus attacking us so cruelly?\u201d she said. \u201cDo we have no right to live in India just because we are Muslim?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">Inside Delhi: beaten, lynched and burnt alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since Narendra Modi\u2019s far-right Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) took power in India in 2014, with an agenda to make India a Hindu rather than secular nation, India\u2019s Muslims - who make up 14% of the country \u2013 have faced increasing persecution, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality\">often state-sponsored</a>. Already socio-economically disadvantaged, Muslims have faced discrimination, boycotts and fatal lynchings and a recent amendment to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/20/india-largest-protests-in-decades-signal-modi-may-have-gone-too-far\">citizenship law</a>, introduced in December, ruled that refugees from all religions except Islam could have Indian citizenship.</p> <p>Modi\u2019s landslide re-election win in May last year marked an escalation in the Hindu nationalist agenda, and with that came more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/feed-them-bullets-not-biriyani-bjp-uses-delhi-elections-to-stoke-religious-hatred\">brazenly anti-Muslim rhetoric</a> from BJP leaders and politicians. It was the provocative comments of a BJP leader that are widely acknowledged to have sparked the communal riots in Delhi in February.&nbsp;And as coronavirus began to take hold across India in March, it was the comments of BJP politicians and public figures that helped fuel the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-targeting-muslims-spread-in-india\">widely-adopted conspiracy theory</a> that it was a \u201cMuslim virus\u201d and that Muslims across the country were on a mission of \u201ccorona jihad\u201d to infect innocent Hindus.</p> <p>The scapegoating of Muslims as coronavirus \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d&nbsp;was followed by&nbsp;everything from the boycotts of Muslim businesses to refusals by hospitals to take in Muslim patients.&nbsp;But in Telinipara, it manifested as an all-out anti-Muslim riot. This week, the police filed cases against two BJP MPs for their role in triggering the violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>The trouble began for Telinipara when it emerged that five Muslims had tested positive for coronavirus in early May. Within hours<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;in many Hindu majority localities of Telinipara, the residents set up blockades on roads and lanes to bar Muslims from entering.</p> <p>\u201cMuslims were banned from using public toilets and collecting food provisions from ration shops,\u201d said Mohammad Hashim, a local municipality councillor. \u201cIn the neighbouring town of Chandannagar, using loudspeakers, some Hindus made public announcements, asking people not to let Muslims from Telinipara enter the area. Hindu youths even threatened to beat up Hindu shopkeepers if they sold anything to Muslims.\u201d</p> <p>It was also on 10 May that things began to turn violent. The first reported incident was that night when a gang of young Hindu men from the village who, armed with sticks and metal rods, attacked a group of Muslims living in a labourer colony and demanded they leave the colony. In retaliation, local Muslim men began attacking Hindu shops and homes, burning some to the ground.</p> <p>On 11 May, West Bengal BJP MP Locket Chatterjee spoke to a local TV channel, claiming that Muslims in Telinipara were violently refusing to comply with coronavirus quarantine. \u201cIn Telinipara, Muslims have vandalised and set fire to Hindu households,\u201d she said. \u201cThose who attacked the Hindus are all corona positive. They do not want to go on quarantine. They are moving around freely in the Hindu localities. They want to infect all Hindus. Even police have not taken any action against them.\u201d</p> <p>However police, health officials and those who tested positive have since confirmed to the Guardian that this statement was false and all five reported to the police station as requested and had been peacefully taken to a local quarantine centre.</p> <p>Another Bengal BJP MP, Arjun Singh, also waded in, posting a photo of one of the Muslim labourers who had been injured in the first attack. But Singh claimed the man was an injured Hindu, beaten by Muslim mobs, and posted on Faceboook: \u201cHow long will the blood of Hindus flow on in Bengal \u2026 we will not stay quiet if they [Muslims] attack ordinary people. You are playing with fire. Bengal will burn to ashes.\u201d</p> <p>The next day, on 11 May, Singh posted: \u201cIf police and [West Bengal] government are not protecting the Hindus,&nbsp;we will come out and fight to the last drop of our blood, to save our own people.\u201d</p> <p>Humayun Kabir, local commissioner of police, confirmed that after an enquiry, the police had filed two cases against Singh and one against Chatterjee&nbsp;accusing them of inciting rioting&nbsp;and a cybercrime investigation was being carried out into Singh\u2019s social media posts.</p> <p>However, Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP national general secretary, denied the BJP&nbsp;had any&nbsp;involvement in the riots and insisted it was caused by Muslims violating lockdown who \u201cattacked Hindu dominated areas\u201d. He accused police commissioner Kabir of being biased and said he has \u201cinstigated crimes against the victims, ie Hindus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOur MPs had been there [in Telinipara] to protect Hindus,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were there to stop the riot but have been slapped with riot cases. I demand an enquiry against the accused police officials.\u201d</p> <p>Yet as Chatterjee and Singh\u2019s words began to be shared widely on social media, it appears that Hindus in the surrounding area began to mobilise. \u201cGo ahead, Arjun Singh. We are with you on your mission,\u201d one comment read. The next day, the armed mob of 100 men boarded boats to Telinipara and launched their attack.</p> <p>Mohammad Sajid, a 22-year-old Muslim resident of Telinipara who witnessed the men descend, said that most of the Hindu attackers were outsiders, not from the village, and most carried guns with them.</p> <p>\u201cThey were around 100 young men,\u201d said Sajid. \u201cAlmost all of them used <em>gamchha</em> [a thin towel] to mask their faces. Some of them carried iron rods, crowbars and hammers. Some carried bombs and Molotov cocktails. As soon as they appeared in the Muslim area they started throwing the bombs and Molotov cocktails targeting the Muslim houses and many Muslims started screaming for help. Most Muslims, including women and children, latched up their front doors from inside and slipped out through their back doors.\u201d</p> <p>Police allegedly ignored the frantic calls from victims. Sajid added: \u201cThe rioters broke open the front doors using heavy tools and entered the houses carrying jerry cans, apparently filled with petrol.

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s new quarantine rules have come into effect from today. What are the new restrictions on international arrivals and how will they be enforced?</p> <h2><strong>How will arrivals be tracked?</strong></h2> <p>Most people arriving in the UK will need to fill in an online form with contact and travel details and the address where they will be staying in quarantine for the subsequent 14 days. Self-isolating people can shop for essentials such as food and medicine. Random checks will be carried out by Public Health England.</p> <h2>Who is exempt?</h2> <p>A large list of people, including anyone on government or defence business, foreign diplomats, regular international commuters, lorry drivers, medical workers and fruit pickers. By and large, the exemptions are international key workers.</p> <h2>How it will be enforced?</h2> <p>In England, fines start at \u00a3100 for not filling in the form, \u00a31,000 for breaching self-isolation and possible deportation for foreign nationals not complying. However, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to say whether and how they will enforce the rules for any arrivals in their jurisdictions \u2013 an anomaly that IAG and others argue undermines the process.</p> <h2><strong>Why do airlines and travel firms object?</strong></h2> <p>Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/07/ba-launches-legal-battle-over-covid-19-quarantine-ruling\">started legal proceedings against the government</a>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;bid to overturn&nbsp;quarantine rules.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s new quarantine rules have come into effect from today. What are the new restrictions on international arrivals and how will they be enforced? How will arrivals be tracked? Most people arriving in the UK will need to fill in an online form with contact and travel details and the address where they will be staying in quarantine for the subsequent 14 days. Self-isolating people can shop for essentials such as food and medicine. Random checks will be carried out by Public Health England. Who is exempt? A large list of people, including anyone on government or defence business, foreign diplomats, regular international commuters, lorry drivers, medical workers and fruit pickers. By and large, the exemptions are international key workers. How it will be enforced? In England, fines start at \u00a3100 for not filling in the form, \u00a31,000 for breaching self-isolation and possible deportation for foreign nationals not complying. However, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to say whether and how they will enforce the rules for any arrivals in their jurisdictions \u2013 an anomaly that IAG and others argue undermines the process. Why do airlines and travel firms object? Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines have started legal proceedings against the government in a bid to overturn quarantine rules. Although lockdown rules prevent overnight stays in the UK, and the Foreign Office has warned against all non-essential foreign travel, signs of progress had led airlines to plan more flights over the next two months, after grounding fleets in March. Holiday firms hoped that people would start booking trips. They argue that imposing the rules so late in the pandemic is ineffective, illogical, and will deter visitors and potential outward bookings long after the quarantine rules are lifted. Why does the government say they are necessary? The government says the measures are backed by science and will help prevent a second wave of Covid-19 cases imported from abroad, as other countries move out of lockdown, with restrictions on work and movement potentially eased further in the UK in coming weeks. Have other countries imposed similar quarantine measures? Yes, many either ensured that arrivals self-isolated or closed their borders to foreign visitors. However, Britain decided against doing so early in the crisis and is now bringing in quarantine just as other EU countries are in the process of opening up.",

Drawn by the fact that it had one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in the country, the team behind the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\">Anywhere </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/anywhere-but-westminster\">but Westminster</a> video series had decided to talk to as many local people as possible \u2013 about the illness and what remained of the lockdown, but also how they felt about the future.</p> \n<p>Via video-conferencing platforms and phone calls, one of the neighbourhoods we focused on was South Bank, three miles east of the town centre. We had been there <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/apr/23/tories-north-east-teesside-workers-video\">five years ago</a>, when we heard about the closed down shops and businesses, long-term unemployment and the cruelties of the benefits system. This time around, along with a strong community spirit, all these things were even more evident, but it was clear that even the opportunities to make ends meet by ducking and diving through precarious work and the informal economy were now shrinking fast.</p> \n<p>We spoke at length to Tonia Nixon, the co-founder of a <a href=\"https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/18397654.coronavirus-redcar-womens-charity-launches-scheme-help-pandemic/\">local community charity</a> called Tees (Together, Engage, Encourage, Support), who was stepping up work on a clothing bank, and also busy supplying people with such basics as cookers, fridges and furniture. \u201cThe people who are struggling now \u2013 it\u2019s the people who\u2019ve been self-employed,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who\u2019ve always worked. And it\u2019s humiliating for them. The lads round here have always found a way to make money. But they\u2019ve had their legs chopped off.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">'The way we get through this is together': mutual aid under coronavirus | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Beyond places such as South Bank, it feels as if the rest of the country is ignorant of the emerging social catastrophe.<strong> </strong>On paper, we surely all know what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/million-more-britons-pushed-in-to-poverty-by-christmas-warn-charities]\">millions</a> of people are now staring into: a recession without modern precedent, 10% unemployment by Christmas, and the prospect of the most fragile parts of local economies \u2013 including the fabled high street \u2013 being fatally hollowed out. But there is still a sense of these things being variously ignored, thought about as eventualities that will hit us in the near-future, or mainly understood as abstract statistics. The reality, of course, is that whatever the help that has so far been provided \u2013 Rishi Sunak\u2019s furloughing scheme, or the current ban on evictions \u2013 people\u2019s lives are being upturned right now, in the most awful ways.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec4c1df0-c625-4da7-9871-70345e77f1ef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GD2UxKWDRgc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While covering Middlesbrough, I also spoke to <a href=\"https://www.pipdisabledmum.co.uk/\">Pip Donegan</a>, an inspirational disability activist who set up an operation at the start of the crisis that has rapidly grown into a community food bank, partly targeted at households containing shielded people. Referrals to her service from Citizens Advice and charities, she said, are increasing by the day, and the reason is plain. \u201cIt\u2019s the amount of people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, and the amount of businesses that have closed,\u201d she said. She emphasised the number of people she deals with who are self-employed: electricians, childminders, painters and decorators. \u201cA lot of people are struggling for the first time and they don\u2019t know where to turn. They\u2019ve always worked. So where do they start?\u201d</p> \n<p>There is something very strange about having conversations like these, and then logging on to social media \u2013 online spaces divided between politics, the media and a surplus of opinions about everything and nothing, in which the crisis you have been talking about sometimes seems to be barely registering. One world seems light years from the other; you begin to wonder if even the most vivid human experiences count for much any more.</p> \n<p>As if to highlight such gaps, while we were covering Middlesbrough, my feeds were aflame with righteous anger about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/27/bbc-switches-emily-maitlis-in-newsnight-episode-over-cummings-remarks\">alleged treatment</a> of the Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis by the BBC: an issue of some importance, perhaps, but surely not worth two days of massed rage. Of late, I think I have read more about MPs\u2019 voting arrangements than fast-rising poverty and unemployment. In that context, the entry into the news of an international uprising over racism represents a much-needed dose of hard reality, but the antidote is never far away: comparatively trivial matterspumped up by the more misplaced furies of the so-called culture wars.</p> \n<p>To some extent, the fact that so many of us are seemingly unaware of other people\u2019s daily lives shines light on what Britain \u2013 or certainly England \u2013 has become. If the 2016 EU referendum felt like the result of one group of people knowing precious little about the other and the suffering of whole swathes of the country going unanswered, I wonder whether the social disasters unleashed by Covid-19 will play out in a similar way. Inequality, after all, manifests itself culturally as well as economically: it is partly about people ignoring or neglecting the predicament of other human beings, thereby making social gaps even worse.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b2cb786362e7e91a5350283c20893d95e449ec1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8b2cb786362e7e91a5350283c20893d95e449ec1/0_26_5444_3267/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A self-employed woman who was employed by a fast food chain on a contract protests against the level of statutory sick pay, Edinburgh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A self-employed woman who was employed by a fast food chain on a contract protests against the level of statutory sick pay, Edinburgh.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The past 10 weeks have brought some glaring examples of this: people whose experience of lockdown has been pleasant and whimsical seemingly averting their eyes from those who are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/13/millions-lockdown-food-parcels-coronavirus-crisis\">enduring real nightmares</a>; a certain kind of shrill indignation about the complex web of issues surrounding schools that ignores deep social problems that the effective suspension of state education is making much worse. These attitudes transcend ideological divides; indeed, they arguably run deepest of all among well-heeled people who think of themselves as being thoroughly liberal, and positioned somewhere on the left. As our social and economic prospects slide, it does not seem misplaced to wonder if our national estrangements will get in the way of a proper understanding of what is actually going on, who it is affecting and what needs to be done about it.</p> \n<p>Two kinds of places are experiencing the worst of Covid-19\u2019s&nbsp;social and economic effects: our inner cities, where people\u2019s suffering is made even worse by the structural and everyday prejudices that are now being so loudly contested; and&nbsp;the post-industrial areas now crudely associated with the Brexit vote and Tory success along the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/working-class-voters-desert-labour-stoke-on-trent-england-red-wall\">red wall</a>. In different ways, both still seem too far from too many people\u2019s thoughts. The fact that that distance has been formalised by the restrictions of lockdown \u2013 on reporting, as much as anything else \u2013 has clearly deepened that problem.</p> \n<p>To even begin to relieve such places\u2019 predicament will obviously demand unprecedented action from the government. What the state can do to help ought to be the defining political question of the coming years; <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-lockdown-now-its-the-economy-stupid-qpspdk0r9\">the weekend\u2019s rumblings</a>&nbsp;about rescuing the economy via a bonfire of regulation suggest that grave problems may be met with stock Tory answers that will offer no convincing remedies. But what I heard from Middlesbrough also pointed to something else: the fact that in an era of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit\">community activism</a>&nbsp;and self-help, those things will now require the support and involvement of as many people as possible.</p> \n<p>From that, there follow a couple of imperatives. Put down your phone, and consider where we have arrived. A social and economic disaster looms. What are we going to do about it?</p> \n<p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last week I came to the end of 10 days of work focused on the north-eastern town of Middlesbrough. Drawn by the fact that it had one of the highest Covid-19 infection rates in the country, the team behind the Guardian\u2019s Anywhere but Westminster video series had decided to talk to as many local people as possible \u2013 about the illness and what remained of the lockdown, but also how they felt about the future. Via video-conferencing platforms and phone calls, one of the neighbourhoods we focused on was South Bank, three miles east of the town centre. We had been there five years ago, when we heard about the closed down shops and businesses, long-term unemployment and the cruelties of the benefits system. This time around, along with a strong community spirit, all these things were even more evident, but it was clear that even the opportunities to make ends meet by ducking and diving through precarious work and the informal economy were now shrinking fast. We spoke at length to Tonia Nixon, the co-founder of a local community charity called Tees (Together, Engage, Encourage, Support), who was stepping up work on a clothing bank, and also busy supplying people with such basics as cookers, fridges and furniture. \u201cThe people who are struggling now \u2013 it\u2019s the people who\u2019ve been self-employed,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who\u2019ve always worked. And it\u2019s humiliating for them. The lads round here have always found a way to make money. But they\u2019ve had their legs chopped off.\u201d Beyond places such as South Bank, it feels as if the rest of the country is ignorant of the emerging social catastrophe. On paper, we surely all know what millions of people are now staring into: a recession without modern precedent, 10% unemployment by Christmas, and the prospect of the most fragile parts of local economies \u2013 including the fabled high street \u2013 being fatally hollowed out. But there is still a sense of these things being variously ignored, thought about as eventualities that will hit us in the near-future, or mainly understood as abstract statistics. The reality, of course, is that whatever the help that has so far been provided \u2013 Rishi Sunak\u2019s furloughing scheme, or the current ban on evictions \u2013 people\u2019s lives are being upturned right now, in the most awful ways. While covering Middlesbrough, I also spoke to Pip Donegan, an inspirational disability activist who set up an operation at the start of the crisis that has rapidly grown into a community food bank, partly targeted at households containing shielded people. Referrals to her service from Citizens Advice and charities, she said, are increasing by the day, and the reason is plain. \u201cIt\u2019s the amount of people who\u2019ve lost their jobs, and the amount of businesses that have closed,\u201d she said. She emphasised the number of people she deals with who are self-employed: electricians, childminders, painters and decorators. \u201cA lot of people are struggling for the first time and they don\u2019t know where to turn. They\u2019ve always worked. So where do they start?\u201d There is something very strange about having conversations like these, and then logging on to social media \u2013 online spaces divided between politics, the media and a surplus of opinions about everything and nothing, in which the crisis you have been talking about sometimes seems to be barely registering. One world seems light years from the other; you begin to wonder if even the most vivid human experiences count for much any more. As if to highlight such gaps, while we were covering Middlesbrough, my feeds were aflame with righteous anger about the alleged treatment of the Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis by the BBC: an issue of some importance, perhaps, but surely not worth two days of massed rage. Of late, I think I have read more about MPs\u2019 voting arrangements than fast-rising poverty and unemployment. In that context, the entry into the news of an international uprising over racism represents a much-needed dose of hard reality, but the antidote is never far away: comparatively trivial matterspumped up by the more misplaced furies of the so-called culture wars. To some extent, the fact that so many of us are seemingly unaware of other people\u2019s daily lives shines light on what Britain \u2013 or certainly England \u2013 has become. If the 2016 EU referendum felt like the result of one group of people knowing precious little about the other and the suffering of whole swathes of the country going unanswered, I wonder whether the social disasters unleashed by Covid-19 will play out in a similar way. Inequality, after all, manifests itself culturally as well as economically: it is partly about people ignoring or neglecting the predicament of other human beings, thereby making social gaps even worse. The past 10 weeks have brought some glaring examples of this: people whose experience of lockdown has been pleasant and whimsical seemingly averting their eyes from those who are enduring real nightmares; a certain kind of shrill indignation about the complex web of issues surrounding schools that ignores deep social problems that the effective suspension of state education is making much worse. These attitudes transcend ideological divides; indeed, they arguably run deepest of all among well-heeled people who think of themselves as being thoroughly liberal, and positioned somewhere on the left. As our social and economic prospects slide, it does not seem misplaced to wonder if our national estrangements will get in the way of a proper understanding of what is actually going on, who it is affecting and what needs to be done about it. Two kinds of places are experiencing the worst of Covid-19\u2019s social and economic effects: our inner cities, where people\u2019s suffering is made even worse by the structural and everyday prejudices that are now being so loudly contested; and the post-industrial areas now crudely associated with the Brexit vote and Tory success along the so-called red wall. In different ways, both still seem too far from too many people\u2019s thoughts. The fact that that distance has been formalised by the restrictions of lockdown \u2013 on reporting, as much as anything else \u2013 has clearly deepened that problem. To even begin to relieve such places\u2019 predicament will obviously demand unprecedented action from the government. What the state can do to help ought to be the defining political question of the coming years; the weekend\u2019s rumblings about rescuing the economy via a bonfire of regulation suggest that grave problems may be met with stock Tory answers that will offer no convincing remedies. But what I heard from Middlesbrough also pointed to something else: the fact that in an era of community activism and self-help, those things will now require the support and involvement of as many people as possible. From that, there follow a couple of imperatives. Put down your phone, and consider where we have arrived. A social and economic disaster looms. What are we going to do about it? \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

Marshall said: \u201cAlthough these health interventions might not have been deemed critical, they will have been necessary for our patients, or else they would not have been recommended. In some cases, the longer patients have to wait, the more likely it is conditions will deteriorate.\u201d The research is the first to quantify how many patients decided not to proceed with a scheduled test, operation or outpatient consultation. NHS leaders and senior doctors have pointed out that many patients were too scared to come into hospital. One in 10 people cancelled their own care, the research found. People with respiratory problems (12%), cardiovascular conditions (12%) and diabetes (11%) were the most likely to do so. But only 7% of cancer patients opted not to proceed. More positively, the study also found that, despite the suspension of so much hospital-based care, 98% of people were still able to obtain prescription medications and 75% could access GP services or see a pharmacist. \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging that a high proportion of people have been able to access care in the community,\u201d said Marshall. Jennifer Dixon, the chief executive of the Health Foundation, which co-funded the research along with the ESRC, voiced unease about its findings. She said: \u201cThese findings show the serious impact Covid-19 has had on the delivery of services for people with long-term conditions like cancer, diabetes and cardio-vascular disease. That 63% of people with serious long-term conditions had their planned treatment cancelled suggests we may be storing up greater health problems for the future. \u201cWhile measures were put in place to protect and support vulnerable people, it\u2019s evident that many people\u2019s needs may have gone unmet during the lockdown, meaning their conditions may have worsened when they should have been receiving care.\u201d Benzeval said the widespread lack of treatment was \u201cobviously worrying for the individuals concerned, and may impact on their long-term outcomes\u201d. A spokesperson for the NHS in England said: \u201cData for health service usage show a strong rebound in patients coming forward for check ups and treatment. The ONS report today has not found evidence of significantly increased cancer mortality, with Covid-protected cancers hubs in place and almost 30,000 people starting cancer treatment in March. For other conditions such as heart problems, the number of people coming to A&amp;E is now back to the levels we would normally expect.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020.

      "bodyText": "Top story: It\u2019s like the toppling of Saddam statue, says historian Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start your week. Anti-racism campaigners have claimed a symbolic victory after protesters in Bristol toppled a statue to the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston that has long been the focus of anger in the city. Demonstrators driven by the worldwide reaction to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis gathered at the memorial on Sunday before attaching ropes to it, hauling it down and then pushing it into the docks. The historian David Olusoga compared it to the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Iraq but home secretary, Priti Patel, called the incident \u201cdisgraceful\u201d. Colston made a fortune from the slave trade but was honoured by the city for his philanthropy to churches, almshouses and schools, some of which still bear his name. After a weekend of protests all over the country, ministers have been criticised by black politicians and campaigners for claiming that Britain is not racist. David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, said it was \u201creal ignorance\u201d to suggest that the protesters were not motivated by discrimination at home. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died two weeks ago after his neck was knelt on by a police officer for nine minutes, lawmakers have vowed to dismantle the city\u2019s police department. The unprecedented response came after what the city council president called the failure of \u201cincremental reform\u201d and calls at protests all over the US for police departments to be defunded. You can read how the world has responded to the protests and how they day unfolded in the US at our live blog. * * * Virus victims \u2013 Doctors say many coronavirus victims have died at home and lain undetected for up to two weeks before being found by relatives or neighbours. A study by pathologists in London found \u201cplenty\u201d such cases, including instances where the body had begun to decompose before being discovered. Campaigners for the elderly said the study highlighted the vulnerability of older people living alone, while a doctor explains the \u201cprofoundly sad job\u201d of certifying the deaths of victims who died alone. BAME women are suffering greater financial and psychological stress from the pandemic than their white counterparts, polling suggests. Charities are concerned about Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to offer support to immigrants who are struggling to get by during the crisis because they don\u2019t qualify for benefits. Lawyers backed by health workers and the families of some coronavirus victims have launched a new investigation into the lockdown car trip to Durham by Johnson\u2019s key adviser, Dominic Cummings. Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines \u2013 BA, EasyJet and Ryanair \u2013 have started legal action against the government\u2019s new 14-day quarantine rules for overseas arrivals which come into force today. Find out what the rules say and what they mean for travellers here. And you can catch up with all the main developments with the pandemic at our live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Fishing net \u2013 Ministers fear that the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator has lost control of the talks over the future of the fisheries industry, raising doubts over the UK\u2019s hopes of sealing a swift Brexit deal on trade and security this summer. Michel Barnier was reportedly blindsided by European fishing nations \u2013 France, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium, Germany and Sweden \u2013 last week when they rejected a compromise deal. * * * Army death \u2013 The Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation after a man was found dead at an army base in Shropshire. The body was discovered on Sunday morning at Clive Barracks in Tern Hill, the current base of the 1st battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment. The MoD expressed \u201cgreat sympathy\u201d about the death but said it would \u201cinappropriate to comment any further at this time\u201d. * * * Times a-changing \u2013 A senior editor has resigned from the New York Times in the wake of the furore about a comment piece in which a republican senator wrote that troops should be sent in to deal with the George Floyd protests. James Bennet, editorial page director at the Times since May 2016, has quit and one of his deputies reassigned. * * * Not so smart \u2013 So-called \u201csmart\u201d domestic appliances such as dishwashers and fridges that can be controlled remotely may not be worth the extra cost in the long run, according to Which? The consumer group says the machines can cost hundreds of pounds more than conventional ones but often malfunction after as little as two years. Coronavirus Extra Known cases of the virus around the world have passed 7 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker site. The US remain the worst-affected country with almost 2 million of those confirmed cases and more than 110,503 deaths. Brazil\u2019s rightwing government, which presides over the world\u2019s second highest number of cases, has been accused of totalitarianism after it stopped publishing a daily tally of fatalities. Britain has 287,000 cases and over 40,625 deaths. In contrast, New Zealand says it has no more active coronavirus cases for the first time since 28 February and the government is expected to lift all remaining lockdown restrictions. Today in Focus podcast The effects of global heating are in evidence everywhere across the islands of Antarctica \u2013 from penguin colonies to melting glaciers. The Guardian\u2019s global environment editor Jonathan Watts explains how conditions are changing quickly. Lunchtime read: writer and actor Michaela Coel on work and race After bursting on to the small screen as a sexually frustrated woman losing her religion in Chewing Gum, Michaela Coel is back in a new self-written drama about young creatives navigating work, consent and racism. Coel explains how I May Destroy You was inspired by her own experience of sexual assault and why she thinks her character could become the voice of her generation.

      "bodyText": "Families will have to pay childcare fees again from 13 July as the Australian government moves to end the emergency relief package introduced at the height of the coronavirus crisis. It has prompted warnings from Labor and the Greens that the reintroduction of fees may push childcare out of the reach of struggling families at a time when economic conditions remain tough. The government has also revealed it will stop paying the economy-wide jobkeeper wage subsidy to childcare services from 20 July, replacing this with a total of $708m in transition payments that it concedes may be less than the amount the sector would have received under jobkeeper. This shift has sparked opposition claims of a broken promise, because Scott Morrison told reporters last week the jobkeeper scheme had been legislated to apply for six months \u201cand people can count on that\u201d. Asked in general terms to guarantee jobkeeper would be there until the end of September, the prime minister said on Friday: \u201cYes.\u201d In response to an earlier question, though, he kept the door open to amendments to the scheme as a result of a coming review \u2013 in line with longstanding signals that it could be adjusted to provide more targeted support. Announcing the childcare changes on Monday, the education minister, Dan Tehan, said the temporary relief package introduced in early April had \u201cdone its job and would be turned off on 12 July\u201d, with the old childcare subsidy system returning the following day. This mean centres will be able to charge parents fees again from 13 July and the government will resume paying the childcare subsidy \u2013 with the latter funding estimated to be worth about $2bn this quarter. But in return for new transition payments between July and late September, childcare services will be temporarily banned from increasing their fees above the level they were in late February. Services will also \u201cneed to guarantee employment levels to protect staff who will move off the jobkeeper payment\u201d. The previous activity test will also be eased until 4 October, supporting eligible families whose employment has been affected by Covid-19. \u201cThese families will receive up to 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised care during this period,\u201d the government said in a statement. At a media conference in Canberra on Monday, Tehan was pressed repeatedly on whether parents would be able to afford a return to childcare fees given the broader economic challenges, amid fears unemployment would peak at around 10%. Tehan could not guarantee demand would hold up after the reintroduction of fees, but said the government had \u201cdone everything we can to support the sector transition\u201d and pointed to the activity test changes as an important way to help parents who had lost work. Tehan said that with attendance levels now at 75%, it was no longer appropriate to keep in place a temporary relief package designed for earlier in the pandemic when demand was \u201ccollapsing\u201d. But Labor\u2019s early childhood education and development spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, said the snap back to the old childcare arrangements \u201cwill snap families\u201d and \u201ccould well act as a hand brake on the economy\u201d. \u201cI have great concerns that parents will be sitting around their kitchen tables doing the maths and working out that childcare will just be too expensive for them,\u201d she said. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said ending free childcare was a \u201cbetrayal of Australian families\u201d and \u201can anti-women move\u201d because it would mostly be women who were forced out of work. The $708m earmarked for transition payments will be split among all childcare services between July and September, at the rate of 25% of their fee revenue from late February. This \u201creplaces jobkeeper\u201d \u2013 the $1,500 per worker fortnightly subsidy \u2013 for the childcare sector, following longstanding concerns about gaps in eligibility, including centres run by big charities or councils, or those that employ short-term casuals and visa holders. Tehan conceded the total transition funding would \u201cprobably be a tiny bit less than what jobkeeper would be\u201d, but said the sector had argued the change \u201cspreads more equitably the support right across the sector\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Never in my lifetime has the case of such visible injustice moved white and black people, moved them as human beings. There have been protests all across America. But there have been huge protests in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/03/sing-his-name-thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest-video\">Britain</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-pictures/photos-the-george-floyd-protests-go-global-1008934/\">Spain</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzLs6den37s\">Nigeria</a>, in fact all across the world. Why has the killing of George Floyd struck such a profound chord in us? Maybe it was that phrase: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The consonance of the phrase with the very root of our pandemic fears is uncanny.&nbsp;The phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man.</p> <p>There have been many times when black people have been gagged, strangled and choked by the police in the US, and even in Britain. The names of those who have died unjustly at the hands of the police are legion. And the police officers have mostly always gotten off entirely free. What happened to George Floyd isn\u2019t new. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d was uttered by another police victim, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/21/eric-garner-police-chokehold-firing-pantaleo\">Eric Garner</a>, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal. Language taps into primal fears.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people say they are colour-blind they are being naive. They are in sweet denial. History is not colour-blind</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We don\u2019t really empathise when we understand. People understand racism. It isn\u2019t difficult to understand. But still people don\u2019t behave as if they understand. Perhaps we empathise best when we can enter into the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d suddenly equates racism with the deprivation of air, which is what it always was. Previously we saw racism, if we saw it all, as a diminishment of a person\u2019s humanity. But that was always too vague. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d goes beyond saying that you are depriving me of freedom, of humanity, of respect. It says: \u201cYou are depriving me of the right to air itself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d: we need a new language to express the fundamental clarity of what happens when people are demonised, excluded, deprived, oppressed, and killed because of the colour of their skin. We need a new language, a phrase for that condition.</p> <p>Only an extreme, and terminal agony could have expressed the very heart of what racism does as when George Floyd said, almost in a whisper: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Not even William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, James Baldwin or Toni Morrison at their most eloquent came out with anything as simple in the genius of its truth as: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it should be the phrase that people who are oppressed should use. It should become the mantra of oppression. Maybe every time the police stop you in your car for no other reason than that you are a black man or woman, you should say: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe every time people cross the road in the evenings when they see you, one should hold up a placard that says: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe when jobs are denied you, deserved promotions elude you, or when the police come to deport you, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/its-inhumane-the-windrush-victims-who-have-lost-jobs-homes-and-loved-ones\">Windrush victims</a>, one should record the moment on one\u2019s phone while saying: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe the true response to all the subtle and deadly forms that racial discrimination takes should now have a new code: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d</p> <p>The truth is that \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d hints at the apocalypse of human values. When George Floyd said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and still the police officer applied the chokehold to his windpipe, it was declared in that moment that a human life means nothing in that country. That\u2019s where the apocalypse begins.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will become the condition of the world. We ignore the deadly warnings of climate catastrophe. It took the worldwide outcry of the #MeToo movement to signal to the world that millions of women are in situations where they can\u2019t breathe. Boris Johnson had oxygen support, delivered through a tube under his nose, lingering for days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/boris-johnson-it-was-50-50-whether-to-put-me-on-ventilator-coronavirus\">between life and death</a> \u2013 perhaps he knew the meaning of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d? Across the world right now we are asking ourselves what it means to be human.</p> <p>When people say they are colour-blind they are being naive. They are in sweet denial. History is not colour-blind. Examine the history of slavery and of colonialism and of genocide. Education is not colour-blind. Otherwise the objective facts of what a people have done and what has been done to a people would be as much part of the curriculum as the death of Socrates, the plays of Shakespeare, and basic mathematics. Culture is not colour-blind. Otherwise the history of art would include the <a href=\"https://www.thesculpturepark.com/shona-sculpture/#:~:text=Shona%20sculpture%20is%20the%20name,are%20the%20largest%20in%20Zimbabwe.\">rock sculpture</a> of Zimbabwe, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/david-hammons/\">radical&nbsp;interventions</a> of David Hammons, and the <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/ben-enwonwu/\">paintings</a> of Ben Enwonwu.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/this-time-the-promise-of-change-has-to-be-realised-black-americans-have-had-enough\">This time, the promise of change has to be realised. Black Americans have had enough | Niambi Michele Carter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maybe the real trouble is colour deficiency. We know what racism is. It is, finally, the reduction of the human race to the validity of one race. Put another way, it is saying that there is a hierarchy of being human, that some are more human than others, or that some are less. The moment you can think, even unconsciously, that one race is superior to another, that is the beginning of murder. It is the beginning of genocide.

      "bodyText": "Never in my lifetime has the case of such visible injustice moved white and black people, moved them as human beings. There have been protests all across America. But there have been huge protests in Britain, in Spain, in Nigeria, in fact all across the world. Why has the killing of George Floyd struck such a profound chord in us? Maybe it was that phrase: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The consonance of the phrase with the very root of our pandemic fears is uncanny. The phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man. There have been many times when black people have been gagged, strangled and choked by the police in the US, and even in Britain. The names of those who have died unjustly at the hands of the police are legion. And the police officers have mostly always gotten off entirely free. What happened to George Floyd isn\u2019t new. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d was uttered by another police victim, Eric Garner, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal. Language taps into primal fears. We don\u2019t really empathise when we understand. People understand racism. It isn\u2019t difficult to understand. But still people don\u2019t behave as if they understand. Perhaps we empathise best when we can enter into the condition. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d suddenly equates racism with the deprivation of air, which is what it always was. Previously we saw racism, if we saw it all, as a diminishment of a person\u2019s humanity. But that was always too vague. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d goes beyond saying that you are depriving me of freedom, of humanity, of respect. It says: \u201cYou are depriving me of the right to air itself.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d: we need a new language to express the fundamental clarity of what happens when people are demonised, excluded, deprived, oppressed, and killed because of the colour of their skin. We need a new language, a phrase for that condition. Only an extreme, and terminal agony could have expressed the very heart of what racism does as when George Floyd said, almost in a whisper: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Not even William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, James Baldwin or Toni Morrison at their most eloquent came out with anything as simple in the genius of its truth as: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe it should be the phrase that people who are oppressed should use. It should become the mantra of oppression. Maybe every time the police stop you in your car for no other reason than that you are a black man or woman, you should say: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe every time people cross the road in the evenings when they see you, one should hold up a placard that says: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe when jobs are denied you, deserved promotions elude you, or when the police come to deport you, like the Windrush victims, one should record the moment on one\u2019s phone while saying: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Maybe the true response to all the subtle and deadly forms that racial discrimination takes should now have a new code: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The truth is that \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d hints at the apocalypse of human values. When George Floyd said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and still the police officer applied the chokehold to his windpipe, it was declared in that moment that a human life means nothing in that country. That\u2019s where the apocalypse begins. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will become the condition of the world. We ignore the deadly warnings of climate catastrophe. It took the worldwide outcry of the #MeToo movement to signal to the world that millions of women are in situations where they can\u2019t breathe. Boris Johnson had oxygen support, delivered through a tube under his nose, lingering for days between life and death \u2013 perhaps he knew the meaning of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d? Across the world right now we are asking ourselves what it means to be human. When people say they are colour-blind they are being naive. They are in sweet denial. History is not colour-blind. Examine the history of slavery and of colonialism and of genocide. Education is not colour-blind. Otherwise the objective facts of what a people have done and what has been done to a people would be as much part of the curriculum as the death of Socrates, the plays of Shakespeare, and basic mathematics. Culture is not colour-blind. Otherwise the history of art would include the rock sculpture of Zimbabwe, the radical interventions of David Hammons, and the paintings of Ben Enwonwu. Maybe the real trouble is colour deficiency. We know what racism is. It is, finally, the reduction of the human race to the validity of one race. Put another way, it is saying that there is a hierarchy of being human, that some are more human than others, or that some are less. The moment you can think, even unconsciously, that one race is superior to another, that is the beginning of murder. It is the beginning of genocide. By small degrees what is innocently thought of as minor variations of a hierarchy of being human slowly becomes degenerates into allowing one set of people to suffer and endure conditions that another set of people would not tolerate, for a second, for themselves. Racism is a human thing. It is a human problem. It can be solved. All it takes is facing the truth that many of us have been lied to about history and about other people\u2019s humanity. All it takes is realising that to passively sanction the diminishment of anyone\u2019s humanity on any ground is to begin to sanction your own diminishment too. This really isn\u2019t rocket science. Racism is a failure of humanity. It is a failure to be human. This lack of empathy is part of the problem that is destroying the world. The lack of empathy extends not just to humans but to other species, and even to the planet as a whole. That police officer who pressed his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck snuffed out one life, but lit a universal fire. It is deeply moving that the world has responded not to the death of a great man or woman, but to the killing of one of the Earth\u2019s poor and seemingly insignificant people. We know what to do.

This is a great moment in the life of humanity and it is rich with the possibilities for change. Maybe \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d will begin the real change that our world so desperately needs. Let\u2019s all breathe. Freedom. \u2022 Ben Okri is a Nigerian novelist and poet.

To comply with money-laundering regulations, companies making a refund will almost always insist it has to be done to the card that was used to make the purchase.

To comply with money-laundering regulations, companies making a refund will almost always insist it has to be done to the card that was used to make the purchase. As well as affecting those who have cancelled their card since using it to pay, this has also been a problem for consumers with an updated card on an account that still exists. We asked NewDay to get on the case and happily, it quickly found your money. It has apologised, sent you the money owed, plus an extra sum to make up for the inconvenience. In the second case, GWR, which regularly features in this column for the wrong reasons, said part of the delay was caused by you telling it in the application that you purchased the ticket online, when it had been at a ticket office. This meant it went to the \u201cwrong team\u201d. Happily, the application has now been sent to the right team and processed \u2013 and is on its way. GWR has apologised for the delay, which it said was \u201ccompounded by an unprecedented volume of refunds requested and lower than normal staff numbers because of the coronavirus pandemic\u201d. For anyone who still plans to ask for a refund, I would do it in person at a station. Note, you can only back-claim for 56 days, and you still have to a pay a \u00a310 admin fee.

Instead, Madeleine McCann is frozen in time \u2013 the little girl who disappeared from the family\u2019s Portuguese holiday apartment on 3 May 2007.\u2019 Lachlan Murdoch says black lives matter \u2013 but did Greg Sheridan get the memo? \u2018Fox News personalities largely ignored Murdoch\u2019s sentiments, as did it seems some of the pundits who work for the Murdoch family\u2019s Australian outpost, News Corp Australia. The Australian\u2019s foreign editor, Greg Sheridan, a regular guest on ABC programs including Insiders and The Drum, boldly told Sky News the Floyd murder was a one-off and there was no systemic racism in the States.\u2019 Experience: I met my sister for the first time at Glastonbury \u2018He pointed his thumb towards the woman beside him. I had no idea I had a sister, but she had a hint of ginger in her hair and a pale complexion, just like me. She was clearly nervous, but had a big beaming smile on her face. I asked her what her name was and told her mine, but she already knew it.\u2019 Pennsylvania man who wrongly spent 23 years on death row is freed \u201cWe not only stole 28 years of your life,\u201d assistant district attorney Carrie Wood told Ogrod, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cWe threatened to execute you based on falsehoods.\u201d Bernie Madoff fails in bid for compassionate release from prison \u2018A federal judge on Thursday rejected Bernie Madoff\u2019s request to be released early from prison because he was dying of kidney failure, saying the swindler has never fully accepted responsibility for his massive, decades-long Ponzi scheme.\u2019 Saturday \u2018Everyone is in that fine line between death and life\u2019: inside Everest\u2019s deadliest queue \u2018He knew things could go catastrophically wrong, and quickly; this stretch of Everest, from the sheer rockface of the Hillary Step to the summit, was the most exposed part of the climb, with drops of up to 3,000 metres (9,842ft) on either side. As people queued, they got colder and used up unplanned-for quantities of their oxygen supplies. It was literally the worst place on Earth to get stuck in a queue.\u2019 Blind date: \u2018He looked more grown-up than me. Luckily, he wasn\u2019t\u2019 \u2018When we were discussing her work as a barista, I was lucky enough to see some photos revealing how her latte art had progressed from phallic to heart-shaped.\u2019 How we stay together: \u2018You can\u2019t spend all your life worrying about the other person\u2019 \u2018The first time Michael Buky took his now-wife Trish Soper sailing, during a holiday in Greece, the small boat sank. Fortunately they survived, and not long after that, when he suggested they pack up their lives in London and go sailing around the world, she agreed.\u2019 America\u2019s top cop is a rightwing culture warrior who hates disorder. What could go wrong? \u2018Barr and many conservatives of his generation remember the 1960s cultural revolution as a kind of traumatic rupture in US history. The results, as they see it, were leftist militancy, drug addiction, out-of-wedlock childbirth and a decoupling of religion from society. For a certain kind of conservative, undoing that legacy has been a decades-long political project.\u2019 The NFL did the unthinkable: it gave Donald Trump the middle finger \u2018Goodell hardly deserves a parade for his change of tone. After all, his NFL is the one that tossed aside its moral compass and turned its back on Kaepernick four years ago and every day since. Goodell\u2019s statement would have been far more powerful had he mentioned Kaepernick by name. Either way, the NFL\u2019s banishment of Kaepernick is a permanent stain on the NFL. Nothing can change that now.\u2019 Sunday A week that shook a nation: anger burns as power of protests leaves Trump exposed \u2018America has been here before, split by racial division that left its cities in flames and its citizens demanding a different country. But not for half a century, and never with a president whose responses to demands for basic justice were so belligerent and divisive that even his former top military officials have turned on him.\u2019 Trump\u2019s use of the military backfired \u2013 but will it back him if he refuses to go? \u2018This past week, Donald Trump bet his political future on repression. Much of the rest of America, on the other hand, wants to liberate black people from police brutality and centuries of systemic racism. As of this writing, it looks like Trump is losing and America winning, but the contest is hardly over.\u2019 Murder in the Outback: the Falconio and Lees Mystery review \u2013 more tragic than mysterious \u2018One of the reasons Murdoch\u2019s conviction has long been supposed by some to be doubtful is because of how Lees behaved before the media. Just as there was supposed to be something wrong with Meursault for not crying at his mother\u2019s funeral in Albert Camus\u2019s L\u2019\u00c9tranger, so Lees\u2019s refusal to perform her grief on telly made some think she was hiding something.\u2019 German suspect in Madeleine McCann case linked to two more child disappearances \u2018Andreas Hasee said a German investigator called him on Friday to confirm they were reopening the case of his missing son, Ren\u00e9, following the identification of the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of three-year old Madeleine.\u2019 Buffalo officers filmed shoving 75-year-old protester charged with assault \u2018McCabe, 32, and Torgalski, 39, \u201ccrossed a line\u201d when they shoved the man down hard enough for him to fall backward and hit his head on the sidewalk, said John Flynn, the Erie county district attorney, at a news conference, calling the victim \u201ca harmless 75-year-old man\u201d.\u2019",

Guards fired tear gas at inmates of Long Bail Jail in Sydney, in what Corrective Services said was to break up a fight. Prisoners then spelled out \u201cBLM\u201d \u2013 meaning Black Lives Matter \u2013 after being gassed. An Indigenous woman is in a critical condition after an incident with a prison guard in Western Australia. A WA Department of Justice spokesman told Guardian Australia she suffered a medical episode on Sunday. The department is investigating allegations that the woman was body-slammed by a guard, and whether the medical episode was linked. Australia recorded 5 new cases of coronavirus overnight, including one in an aged care facility in north-east Victoria. New Zealand has lifted all domestic restrictions, after the country reached no active Covid-19 cases. International border restrictions are still in place Thanks for reading and stay safe. Here\u2019s our full story on the tear gas used at Long Bay Jail today: Organisers of a second Black Lives Matter protest in Perth are refusing to apply for an exemption to host more than 300 people under coronavirus restrictions, AAP report: Co-organiser Tanesha Bennell said no exemption had been sought for the first rally, which drew about 2,000 people. But the venue for the second event on Saturday has changed to Langley Park to provide people with more space to physically distance. Protesters are also urged to bring their own water bottles, face masks and hand sanitiser. In a social media post, co-organiser Jacinta Taylor-Foster said they were doing everything they could to ensure the safety of everyone participating. \u201cIf you are sick and vulnerable, we urge you to stay home,\u201d she said. \u201cFor politicians feigning concern, use the position that you are in now to actually do something about this, so that we don\u2019t have to consistently protest and campaign.\u201d The ABC\u2019s reporter at Long Bail Jail has said it is \u201cunclear\u201d what triggered a fight that Correctional Services says occurred, but that at least some of the incident today was related to the Black Lives Matter protests. It has been reported earlier that \u201cBLM\u201d was spelled out in the yard after tear gas was used. \u201cIt is unclear what triggered the situation,\u201d reporter Jamie McKinnell said. \u201cFrom the helicopter shots, we can see some of the inmates were using material or towels to spell out the letters \u201cBLM\u201d... So we can probably say that part of the incident was related to the Black Lives Matter incident.\u201d New Zealanders will be able to attend the Super Rugby in person \u2013 with unlimited crowd sizes \u2013 this weekend after the government eased all domestic restrictions. The opening round of the Super Rugby Aotearoa competition kicks off this weekend. AAP report: With no restrictions on crowd size, there is the possibility of sold-out grandstands when the Highlanders host the Chiefs in Dunedin on Saturday and the Blues face the Hurricanes at Eden Park on Sunday in the first round of matches. NZ Rugby chief executive Mark Robinson confirmed tickets would go on sale from Monday. Jacinda Ardern has said that Australia would need to be \u201cin a similar position\u201d to New Zealand \u2013 having no active Covid-19 cases \u2013 before a travel bubble could be implemented. Ardern said today that travel bans would remain in New Zealand even as domestic restrictions are lifted. \u201cOur border is critical,\u201d AAP report. \u201cThe reason that New Zealanders, as of tomorrow, will be able to move around with freedom that very few other countries in the world have is because we are maintaining those restrictions at the border.\u201d Deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth has responded to people drawing links to the protests being allowed and spectator sport not being allowed. He says: I do understand why that might frustrate people. I would point out, perhaps, we don\u2019t have protests on every Friday and Saturday night of the footy season. There are some substantive differences to it. The return to stadium sport and spectators is something the Australian health protection principal committee is considering, it is something that we have been discussing. So there may well be a way to do that in a safe, measured way in the coming months. I guess in principle there is a rather big difference between a single protest and a return to spectator sport in Australia. Coatsworth says people who attended Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protests over the weekend should not be treated differently to other people when it comes to getting tested. Attendees of the protests are being urged to get tested if they develop any symptoms \u2013 but Coatsworth says that\u2019s the same advice for anyone who develops symptoms. Questions from media continue about the protests on the weekend. There have not been any questions on the new case in a Victorian aged care home that Coatsworth also announced. The deputy chief medical officer, Dr Nick Coatsworth, is speaking now. He says there are 5 new cases in Australia overnight, with 2 new cases in Victoria \u2013 one is a returned traveller and one is a resident of an aged care facility in north-east Victoria. He says contact tracing is underway. Overall, 19 people are hospitalised, three people are in intensive care and two are on ventilators. The ABC is reporting that inmates at Sydney\u2019s Long Bay jail spelled out \u201cBLM\u201d \u2013 meaning Black Lives Matter \u2013 after tear gas was used on prisoners earlier today. Corrective Services NSW said the tear gas was used after \u201ca number of inmates in one yard began fighting\u201d and \u201crefused to comply with directions\u201d. Helicopter footage shot after the tear gas was used showed inmates used nearby materials to spell \u201cBLM\u201d on the ground. One inmate has been taken to hospital after being bitten by a police dog that was deployed. Indigenous man David Dungay died in Long Bay jail\u2019s hospital in 2015, after guards stormed his cell after he refused to stop eating a packet of biscuits. Dungay said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died. Some more information about the Indigenous woman who is in a critical condition after an incident with a prison guard in Western Australia. A WA Department of Justice spokesman told Guardian Australia it was investigating allegations that the woman was body-slammed by a guard at Bandyup women\u2019s prison. The spokesman said that there was an alleged incident on Saturday, then in the morning, the woman suffered a medical episode. The Department of Justice Professional Standards Division is reviewing it to see what the alleged incident was, and whether there is a connection between that and the medical episode. The spokesman said the claim there was a body slam came from a third party from outside the prison. AAP is reporting that the woman is being treated at St John of God Midland Hospital in Perth. Tear gas that was used at Sydney\u2019s Long Bail jail is also affecting residents of the suburb of Malabar. The ABC has also reported that children at a nearby playground were affected and had to be taken inside. And here is our full story on the relaxing of restrictions in New Zealand today: Thanks to my colleagues Luke Henriques-Gomes and Calla Wahlquist for running the blog earlier today. The ABC is broadcasting live footage from Long Bay jail in Sydney, where tear gas was used earlier today. Corrective Services NSW said it was to break up a fight, and the incident is under control. The footage shows a lot of black-clad guards in the yard area of the jail. With that, I\u2019ll handover to my colleague Naaman Zhou, who will guide you through the afternoon. Hours after New Zealand\u2019s health officials announced there were no active cases of Covid-19 in the country for the first time since 28 February, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced her government would abandon all restrictions except border controls from midnight tonight. The removal of all domestic restrictions is happening a couple of days sooner than the government initially flagged it might. From tonight, all remaining rules about physical distancing and gathering sizes will end. \u201cWe are ready,\u201d Ardern told reporters at a news conference in Wellington that is ongoing. She praised New Zealanders for having \u201cunited in unprecedented ways to crush the virus\u201d. New Zealand recorded less than 1,500 cases of Covid-19; 22 people died. But Ardern warned that elimination was not \u201ca point in time\u201d and was cautious about saying the crisis was over for New Zealand. We almost certainly see cases here again. That is not a sign that we have failed; it is a reality of this virus. Strict border controls will remain in place; only New Zealanders and their families are currently allowed to enter the country and must stay in government-run quarantine for a fortnight. This report is from AAP: Tear gas has been used on inmates in Sydney\u2019s Long Bay jail after a fight broke out. The incident is now under control following the brawl, which happened at about midday on Monday, a Corrective Services NSW spokeswoman told AAP. AAP understands tear gas was used when those involved in the brawl refused to comply with directions. Dodgy carers and service providers could soon be banned from entering the National Disability Insurance Scheme, reports AAP. The proposed new powers follow the death of South Australian woman Ann Marie Smith. Smith, 54, who had cerebral palsy, was left in squalid conditions while under the care of the NDIS and later died in hospital. NDIS minister Stuart Robert is planning to introduce the proposed powers to federal parliament within the next two weeks. The NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission would be able to draw on sources outside the scheme to determine a ban, including a worker\u2019s history at aged- or child- care centres. A blacklist already exists of people banned after working in the NDIS, but the updated powers would stop risky operators entering or re-entering the scheme. People with Disability Australia spokeswoman El Gibbs said the new powers would be the first step towards improving safeguards in the NDIS. Labor\u2019s childcare spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, is criticising the government\u2019s return to the child care subsidy \u2013 and away from free childcare. She is painting the change as a \u201csnap back\u201d, saying: The government had a number of options on the table. And they chose none of them. They chose not to change the CCS percentage, not to look at which groups might really need free childcare. Like I said, there was a range of proposals on the table, and they chose none of them. Rishworth sidesteps questions on what exactly Labor would do, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not the minister.\u201d This could well act as a handbrake on the economy. If women and families are not able to access affordable childcare, how are they going to get back to work? How are they going to actually participate in the economy? The Greens\u2019 education spokeswoman, Mehreen Faruqi, says ending free childcare is the wrong move. \u201cEnding free childcare is a huge mistake,\u201d she said in a statement. Thousands of families that have been hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis will now have to make some very hard choices. We know that a significant proportion of families currently accessing free childcare will now be forced to reduce their work days or completely remove their little ones from care. Let\u2019s be honest: it will mostly be women who are forced out of work now. Ending free childcare is an anti-women move. Australian childcare fees are some of the highest in the world. We need a radical revamp of the whole system, and it starts with looking at how we make childcare free for good. Childcare is an essential service. Known cases of Covid-19 worldwide have passed 7 million, according to Johns Hopkins University. For an international perspective on the pandemic, you can follow our global live blog with my colleague Helen Sullivan. We will hear Labor\u2019s response to the childcare announcement at 12.30pm from its spokeswoman Amanda Rishworth. Samantha Maiden points out that the PM said recently that jobkeeper would last six months. Today we learnt it will be switched off for childcare centres from 20 July (counting backpay, it began 30 March). Pressed on whether he concedes the changes will still put financial pressure on some people, Tehan says the childcare system needs to be \u201csustainable into the future\u201d. Asked by Daniel Hurst for the value of jobkeeper that is being removed by the government, Tehan says: \u201cWe are still working that out.\u201d But he concedes the \u201cbusiness continuity payment\u201d will be less than the current jobkeeper payments the sector is currently receiving. The flipside, of course, is that some providers that were not eligible for jobkeeper will get these continuity payments. Tehan is asked how will reintroducing childcare fees help people who\u2019ve lost their jobs. He says: This is something that we have discussed with the sector at length and what we have done is, through the changes that we have made to the activity test, that will help us deal with that issue. So what that will enable parents who have lost their work to do is to be able to get access to support because of those changes we have made to the activity test. The temporary free childcare system will end on 12 July, the Morrison government has announced. The system, introduced at the height of the pandemic, was due to expire in late June, but the government had previously kept the door open to extending it, depending on the health and economic situation. In recent times, though, the government had signalled it would expire soon because of increases in childcare attendance. The education minister, Dan Tehan, said the temporary early childhood education and care relief package had \u201cdone its job and would be turned off on 12 July\u201d. From 13 July the childcare subsidy would return, along with new transition measures to support the sector and parents as they moved back to the subsidy, the government said in a statement. Jobkeeper would cease for the childcare sector from 20 July. Instead, the government would pay childcare services a transition payment of 25% of their fee revenue until late September. During the transition period, childcare fees would also be capped at February levels. Services would also need to guarantee employment levels to protect staff who moved off jobkeeper. The existing activity test would also be eased until early October, supporting eligible families whose employment had been affected by Covid-19. \u201cThese families will receive up to 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised care during this period,\u201d the statement said. Tehan says the government expects to pay $2bn in child care subsidy in this quarter. The activity test \u2013 which sets out the number of hours a person must work or study to qualify for the subsidy \u2013 will also be eased until 4 October. \u201cThese families will receive up to 100 hours per fortnight of subsidised care during this period,\u201d he says. Dan Tehan says: The government has taken the decision that the temporary childcare package, which includes free childcare, will end on July 12. From the 13 July, childcare fees will return, along with new transition measures. He says the government will stop paying jobkeeper to childcare providers from 20 July. \u201cInstead, the government will pay childcare services a transition payment of 25% of their fee revenue during the relief package reference period, the fortnight ending March 2.\u201d We are waiting for Dan Tehan to stand up at this press conference this morning. He will provide more details, but the headline is that 12 July will be the end date of free child care. Three new Covid-19 cases have been diagnosed overnight, NSW Health says. It brings the total number of cases in the state to 3,112. \u201cTwo of the new cases today are travellers in hotel quarantine,\u201d NSW Heath said in a statement. \u201cThe third case is under investigation. \u201cThere are currently 66 Covid-19 cases being treated by NSW Health, and none are in intensive care. \u201cIn NSW, 2,724 people have recovered from Covid-19.\u201d Before today, the state had recorded two days with no new coronavirus cases. Droves of women are reporting first-time family violence in Australian research showing Covid-19 lockdown has been a flashpoint for abuse, AAP reports. The Monash University study released on Monday found an increase in the frequency and severity of violence against women in Victoria during coronavirus lockdowns. Almost 170 Victorian practitioners who have spent the past two months supporting women experiencing violence, contributed. First-time family violence reporting by women rose by 42%, the study found. Fifty-nine per cent of respondents reported Covid-19 had increased the frequency of violence against women, while half reported the severity of abuse had increased amid virus lockdown measures. Some perpetrators allegedly weaponised the virus, spreading rumours that women had Covid-19 so nobody would come near them to help. Travel bubble, Kiwi friends? Two new Covid-19 cases were reported overnight in Victoria, authorities say. One of those cases was a resident aged care facility in Bright, in the state\u2019s north east. The 25 remaining residents are now in quarantine. The two new infections takes the total number of cases to 1,687. There are currently 71 active infections, with seven people in hospital. Two of those people are in intensive care. A statement from the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services said 1,595 people had now recovered after testing positive to the coronavirus virus. \u201cOf yesterday\u2019s cases, one was detected in returned travelers in hotel quarantine,\u201d the department said. Of the aged care resident who rested positive in Bright case, the department said: \u201cThe person is currently being isolated in hospital where they were transferred for an unrelated condition. \u201cAbout 25 remaining residents of Hawthorn Village in Bright have been placed in quarantine and contact tracing has begun. \u201cThe families of residents have been advised of the situation.\u201d Dr Brett Sutton, Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, said it was vital those who attended Melbourne\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest and develop symptoms get tested He said: \u201cOur clear advice was not to attend last Saturday\u2019s protest as thousands of people flooding the city in close contact was a risk. \u201cIf you attended and go on to develop any symptoms, no matter how mild - it is critically important that you go and get tested.\u201d We are expecting a press conference from the education minister, Dan Tehan, at 11.30am. Tehan is likely to announce changes to the system as the government\u2019s temporary free childcare system comes to an end. It was announced at the height of the pandemic. There are reports an Aboriginal woman is fighting for life after she was allegedly body slammed by a prison guard at Bandyup prison in Western Australia. The West Australian newspaper reported late last night the woman was at St John of God hospital in a critical condition. The paper reported allegations that inmates witnessed her being \u201cbody slammed\u201d on Saturday. She was then taken to hospital a short time later, it said. A WA Department of Justice spokesman told the newspaper: \u201cThe corrective services commissioner is aware of the allegation and has referred the matter to the Department of Justice professional standards division for review.\u201d A response to Mathias Cormann from the Greens senator Rachel Siewert. Cormann said the Black Lives Matter protesters were \u201cselfish\u201d. \u201cFifty-four First Nations peoples have died in custody since 2008 in Minister Cormann\u2019s home state of WA and I haven\u2019t seen him say anything about that,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least 432 people have died since the royal commission into deaths in custody, no government can claim to have done a close to adequate job at pursuing justice for First Nations peoples. \u201cThis has to be a wakeup call. The commonwealth has to show leadership and ensure an end to deaths in custody. \u201cIt\u2019s the same vicious cycle, a royal commission or committee is held, truth is told, credible, tangible solutions are offered and governments cop out. \u201cThe fact is governments don\u2019t like their failures being highlighted and this lack of justice is a massive failure of Australia\u2019s governments.\u201d Parents and visitors are now allowed on school grounds in Western Australia as the state government moves to lift more coronavirus restrictions, AAP reports. Under the changes from Monday, events and activities such as assemblies, excursions, choirs and examinations can resume providing schools abide by a limit of 100 people indoors and 300 people outdoors. School camps will also be permitted for up to 100 people. \u201cThanks to the hard work and diligence of school staff, parents and students, we\u2019re able to make these changes and get schools closer to their usual operations,\u201d the WA education minister, Sue Ellery, said. In other changes under the phase three guidelines, sports training and swimming classes can recommence and senior students can engage in work placements as long as employers are complying with Covid-19 guidelines. Canteens can also provide a dine-in service for up to 100 people and school libraries can allow 100 people in a shared space. Thanks to Calla for her work this morning \u2013 and a nod to her use of unusual abbreviations. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. Get in touch by email luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter @lukehgomes. I am going to hand over to m\u2019colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes who will take you through the morning. A Victorian police officer is under investigation for using his boot to pin down a 42-year-old man during an arrest in the Melbourne suburb of Abbotsford on Saturday. The investigation by the professional standards command followed the airing of footage on Channel Seven, which drew a comparison with the killing of George Floyd. AAP reports that five police officers attended the arrest, after receiving reports that a man was \u201cbehaving erratically\u201d From AAP: It was believed he had been making threats to passers-by and damaging property while armed with a hockey stick, police said on Monday. The man then allegedly locked himself inside the Johnston Street business. Officers used capsicum spray during the arrest and the man was treated at the scene for minor injuries. He appeared in court on Sunday, charged with various offences including theft, riotous behaviour and resist arrest. Citizenship ceremonies can now be conducted in person again, AAP has reported. For the past few months citizenship ceremonies have been conducted online, but councils can now choose to conduct ceremonies in person, or online. Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge said: The government is also working to resume citizenship testing and interviews in the coming weeks so we can have people moving through all stages of becoming Australian citizens. Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy was on Channel Nines\u2019 Today show this morning, and she was asked what she thought of Mathias Cormann\u2019s comment that the Black Lives Matter protesters were \u201cquite irresponsible\u201d. She said: Well that\u2019s his opinion and I will tell you mine, Karl and my opinion is this, that we have way too many deaths in custody, way too many people incarcerated in terms of First Nations people and this was an opportunity by leaders across Australia, Aboriginal leaders, non-Aboriginal leaders, not politicians. They were people who came together, pulled all sorts of people together. They had police involved in Queensland, for example, giving out masks. They had hand sanitisers. People in many of these marches were trying to keep their distance. This issue of First Nations people dying in custody is what is reckless in this country and irresponsible and that\u2019s where this focus was all about. From AAP: Socceroos goalkeeper Mitch Langerak is facing a stint on the sidelines after testing positive for coronavirus at J-League club Nagoya Grampus. Langerak, 31, did not report any symptoms but became the second player at the Japanese club to become infected, the J-League club confirmed. Teammate and striker Mu Kanazaki registered a positive test result on Tuesday. Subsequent to Kanazaki\u2019s positive test another 19 players were tested at the club. On Saturday, Grampus announced players would be sent home and club facilities disinfected. Another 26 individuals at the club then underwent tests at their request. Langerak produced the only new positive test result. In March, Vissel Kobe defender Gotoku Sakai tested positive for the virus, but he has resumed practising with teammates after making a full recovery. The J-League top flight is set to resume behind closed doors on July 4 following a roughly four-month suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic. Langerak joined the Japanese top-flight club in 2018 after a lengthy stint in Germany. He has played eight matches for the Socceroos since 2013 but has been largely a back-up to No.1 keeper Matt Ryan. A thought: Meanwhile, in Queensland, more than 250 people have been tested for Covid-19 after a 24-year-old man travelled form Melbourne to Brisbane while infectious. The man, who was going to work as a fruit picker in Bundaberg, socialised with friends and family in Brisbane before travelling on to Bundaberg and checking into shared accomodation to work at a strawberry farm. Some 147 tests were conducted at a pop-up clinic at the farm worker accomodation and to date 57 have returned negative results, including 15 who socialised with the man in Brisbane. The results for the remaining tests are expected today. Said Queensland chief health officer, Dr Jeanette Young: These are early days and we have much more work to do before we can be confident there has been no further transmission. Scott Morrison has maintained his record high approval rating, the latest Newspoll published in the Australian this morning shows. Morrison\u2019s approval rating is at 66%, and his disapproval rating has fallen a point to 29%, the highest prolonged approval ratings for a prime minister since the early days of Kevin Rudd\u2019s first prime ministership. The two-party preferred figure remains unchanged at 51-49. Although the poll shows that support for the Coalition dropped a point to 42% while Labor\u2019s primary vote dropped a point to 34%. The primary vote for the Greens rose two points to 12%, while support for Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation lifted one point to 4%. Morrison was also ahead of opposition leader Anthony Albanese as preferred prime minister, with 56% to Albanese\u2019s 26%. Albanese\u2019s personal approval rating dropped three points to 41%, and his disapproval rating lifted one point to 38%. The poll was conducted between June 3 and June 6, based on 1,512 online interviews of voters. It has a 2.5% margin of error. Dodson was also asked about the destruction of a rock shelter in Juukan Gorge near Tom Price in the Pilbara, despite significant archeological evidence showing it had been occupied for at least 46,000 years. He said that \u201csome heads will have to roll\u201d at Rio Tinto, for failing to properly implement its monitoring of and consultation about cultural heritage sties with traditional owners. Rio Tinto has apologised, but not said it was in the wrong. But Dodson said the federal government could have acted to stop the destruction, after lawyers for the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples sent an 11th hour plea to federal Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt. Dodson said: The commonwealth could have issued an injunction for that activity to stop and they failed to do that. He said that Wyatt, who referred the matter to environment minister Sussan Ley, should bear some responsibility: The palming off by the minister of Aboriginal Australians to [Ley] \u2026 he\u2019s a West Australian, he knows now draconian the Aboriginal Heritage Act is in Western Australia ... They have just failed in their duty. They have failed to act in a way that could give Aboriginal people any confidence that the federal crown and the state crown have any interest in their welfare and their cultural values. Western Australian senator and Labor\u2019s spokesman for reconciliation, Patrick Dodson, is also speaking on Radio National. He was travelling and did not attend a protest on Saturday, and said he hoped there would be no transmission of Covid-19 from the gatherings. But he said deaths in custody were a real, present threat to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and not a sign of a lack of care by Aboriginal people and other activists about the coronavirus threat. I have lost a nephew recently ... he still has to come back from Perth. Family are distraught about that. It\u2019s affected everyone and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s responsible to describe people as uncaring. Dodson said the dismissal of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, particularly the request for a constitutionally-enshrined Indigenous voice to parliament, meant many felt they had no option but to protest. I think the Aboriginal community feel very much disconnected and uncared for in society, particularly since the Uluru Statement \u2026 there\u2019s no real progress taking place in the deaths in custody arena, and then we have the awful and disgraceful destruction of ancient sites in Western Australia. Unless there is a voice to parliament, he says, \u201cthen you are going to have people defying the odds, as it were, to try and get their points across\u201d. Trade minister Simon Birmingham has told Radio National that he thought the timing of the Black Lives Matter protests this weekend was \u201cincredibly unfortunate\u201d but acknowledged, when pushed by host Fran Kelly, that the timing was sparked by the alleged murder of George Floyd by US police officers and therefore not of the protesters\u2019 choosing. Said Birmingham: The timing was unfortunate and I accept that events that occurred in the US were not in the control of the protest organisers \u2026 nonetheless there would have been other ways of trying to create the kind of movement of symbolism that people sought without coming out in a mass gathering. He suggests something like the driveway lights on Anzac Day. A mass gathering, he says, shows a \u201clack of regard for the other Australians who have been making sacrifices\u201d during lockdown, but adds that he \u201cunderstands the sentiment\u201d of the protesters. In other news, Tony Abbott has been made a companion of the order of Australia in the Queen\u2019s Birthday honours. It\u2019s the top gong. Abbott was awarded it for his contributions to border control and the Indigenous community. Other former Liberal politicians Bronwyn Bishop, Philip Ruddock, former NSW premier Mike Baird, former Victorian premier Denis Napthine were made officers of Order of Australia, the second highest honour. Bishop was awarded the honour for \u201cdistinguished service to the Parliament of Australia, to the people of New South Wales, and to women in politics\u201d. Marcia Langton, the foundation chair in Australian Indigenous Studies at the University of Melbourne, was also made an officer of the Order of Australia for \u201cdistinguished service to tertiary education, and as an advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\u201d. Langton said she was: ... very pleased to accept [the award] because it is a way of turning the tide on the historical racism and low expectations that typified an older Australia, and one which I hope we can leave behind. More on this from Elias Visontay here. Good morning and welcome to our continuing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee will meet today to discuss \u201cstage three and beyond\u201d of lifting the lockdown restrictions. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the AHPPC would take into account the potential spread of the virus at the large protests on the weekend. About 30,000 people gathered in both Melbourne and Brisbane and an estimated crowd of 20,000 gathered in Sydney in solidarity with US protests over Black Lives Matter and the death of George Floyd, and to protest the number of Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia. Hundreds more gathered in smaller cities and towns. Kelly told AAP: At the moment, it won\u2019t change how we are viewing those processes, but in particular states it may do, depending what happens in relation to [any] cases that crop up. The protests have seen business owners place increased pressure on state governments to open up lockdown restrictions, according to a report in the Australian. Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett told the Oz: Don\u2019t tell me after thousands of people attended the rally, we couldn\u2019t have had thousands of people at the footy on the weekend social distancing. We need to open up the borders. We need to start moving. Protesters at all rallies were told to wear face masks and remain 1.5m apart whenever possible. Face masks and hand sanitiser were distributed at entry points to the major rallies in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. The order to wear masks was almost universally obeyed. Victoria\u2019 deputy chief health officer, Annaliese van Diemen, told reporters yesterday that she was \u201chopeful\u201d Victoria\u2019s case numbers continue to trend downwards. She said: If we have no outbreaks in general in [the next] two weeks, and we continue to trend downwards, we will see that as a positive in terms of low levels of community transmission. Stage three restrictions could see gatherings of up to 100 people permitted, employees returning to their workplaces, and interstate travel. Some states are going slightly off book: in Western Australia gatherings of up to 100 people have been permitted since midnight on Saturday, and the premier, Mark McGowan, has maintained his insistence that the hard border between WA and the rest of the country will not lift. As of last night, there have been 7,260 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Australia and sadly 102 people have died. Oh, and in case you\u2019re wondering: today is Monday.",

New Zealand lifts Covid-19 restrictions \u2026 New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced her government would abandon all coronavirus restrictions from midnight tonight, after health officials confirmed the recovery of the country\u2019s last known Covid-19 case. There are no active cases of Covid-19 in the country for the first time since 28 February. New Zealand has recorded fewer than 1,500 cases of coronavirus, and 22 deaths. Border restrictions will remain in place, meaning only New Zealanders and their families will be allowed to enter the country and must stay in government-run quarantine for a fortnight. But Ardern said the fight was not over for New Zealand, warning they would \u201calmost certainly see cases here again\u201d. \u201cThat is not a sign that we have failed; it is the reality of this virus.\u201d \u2026 and lays out conditions for NZ-Australia travel deal Ardern has quelled the idea of a possible travel bubble between New Zealand and Australia that would allow residents to travel between both countries without quarantining. She said Australia would first need to be \u201cin a similar position\u201d to New Zealand, with no active Covid-19 cases. \u201cThe reason that New Zealanders, as of tomorrow, will be able to move around with freedom that very few other countries in the world have is because we are maintaining those restrictions at the border.\u201d End of free childcare announced The Morrison government announced it will roll back its free childcare scheme, introduced on 12 July at the height of the pandemic. The education minister, Dan Tehan, said fees would be capped at what they were in February, and extra subsidies would be provided to eligible families whose employment has been affected by coronavirus. Labor\u2019s childcare spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, has criticised the government\u2019s \u201csnap back\u201d change, saying that \u201cthis could well act as a handbrake on the economy\u201d. \u201cIf women and families are not able to access affordable childcare, how are they going to get back to work? How are they going to actually participate in the economy?\u201d Despite Scott Morrison recently promising that jobkeeper would last until September, the government today announced the program would cease for the childcare sector from 20 July. Instead, the government would pay childcare services a transition payment of 25% of their fee revenue until late September. Global coronavirus cases reach 7 million The number of known Covid-19 cases worldwide have passed 7 million and deaths have passed 400,000, according to John Hopkins University. The US remains the worst-affected country, with over 1.9 million confirmed cases and more than a quarter of the world\u2019s total deaths, 110,503. Meanwhile, Australia reported only five new cases overnight across NSW and Victoria: three returned travellers, an aged care facility resident, and another case \u201cunder investigation\u201d by NSW Health. Deputy CMO says protests don\u2019t pave the way for return of sports matches Deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth has responded to those saying there is a double standard between protests being allowed despite spectator sport being prohibited, arguing there were \u201csubstantive differences\u201d between a single protest and weekly footy matches. Coatsworth also said those who attended protests over the weekend should not be treated differently than other people when it came to getting tested. Meanwhile on Sunday, the minister for finance, Mathias Cormann, attacked protesters, saying in a Sky News interview that going to the march was \u201cincredibly selfish\u201d and \u201cincredibly self-indulgent\u201d given the health risk.

The policy is to be reviewed every three weeks and the idea of \u201cair bridges\u201d to popular destinations for holidaymakers such as Portugal has been discussed.</p> <p>However, O\u2019Leary said thousands of Britons were still booking holidays with Ryanair, which intends to operate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/ryanair-flights-resume-coronavirus-rules-july\">almost 1,000 flights a day from 1 July</a>. He added that he had no intention of cancelling flights in the peak months of July and August if the rules were still in place then.</p> <p>\u201cNo [we won\u2019t cancel], because the flights are full outbound of the UK,\u201d he said, speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Radio 4. \u201cBritish people are ignoring this quarantine.

      "bodyText": "The Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has said he will not cancel flights despite the government\u2019s new quarantine rules for travellers arriving in the UK, because \u201cBritish people are ignoring this quarantine. They know it\u2019s rubbish.\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s comments come after Ryanair, easyJet and IAG, the owner of British Airways, started legal action against the government in an attempt to overturn rules requiring all passengers arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days, which came into effect on Monday. Breaking the rules, which are designed to help prevent a second wave of the coronavirus, is punishable with a \u00a31,000 fine. The policy is to be reviewed every three weeks and the idea of \u201cair bridges\u201d to popular destinations for holidaymakers such as Portugal has been discussed. However, O\u2019Leary said thousands of Britons were still booking holidays with Ryanair, which intends to operate almost 1,000 flights a day from 1 July. He added that he had no intention of cancelling flights in the peak months of July and August if the rules were still in place then. \u201cNo [we won\u2019t cancel], because the flights are full outbound of the UK,\u201d he said, speaking to the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Radio 4. \u201cBritish people are ignoring this quarantine. They know it\u2019s rubbish. Ryanair is operating a thousand daily flights to points all over Portugal, Spain, Italy [and] Greece from the 1st of July, the 2nd, the 3rd and every day after that.\u201d O\u2019Leary said he expected British tourists would still book holidays in Europe but European travellers would be put off travelling to Britain. He added that inbound bookings to the UK were the only notable weakness Ryanair was finding as it prepared to resume flights after the coronavirus lockdown. Outbound bookings from the UK, Ireland and northern Europe to the Mediterranean were strong. The airlines argue that the rules have come into force much too late to stop the transmission of Covid-19 and will kill off any nascent recovery in their industries. O\u2019Leary said the airlines planned to file legal papers on Monday or Tuesday and hoped the case would be heard this week. Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of easyJet, said the government rushed through the measures and that the airlines had a good chance of winning the legal action to have them scrapped. \u201cWe think that there\u2019s enough evidence and there\u2019s a strong case here that this should be challenged by the courts,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cThis is something that has been rushed through. It\u2019s not in proportion.\u201d Lundgren also warned that the quarantine measures were likely to lead to more job losses. Last month, easyJet announced it was planning to cut 30% of its workforce, some 4,500 jobs, because of the impact of the coronavirus on the aviation industry. Asked if the quarantine could lead to more job losses, he said: \u201cI fear so ...

      "body": "<p>As the lockdown rules&nbsp;loosen, friends and family members of our&nbsp;nursing&nbsp;home residents, who have been so supportive through this crisis,&nbsp;are&nbsp;nurturing&nbsp;hopes of a relaxation in our visiting policy.<br><br>It was on 17 March \u2013 only 11 weeks ago, though it feels like a lifetime \u2013&nbsp;that&nbsp;we decided with the heaviest of hearts to close our doors to almost all visitors. When the country went into lockdown that decision seemed a prudent, if painful one; the home is normally full of the laughter and joy of up to 30 residents and their visitors, who are usually such an important presence. Deprived of their company, many of our residents have become more anxious, confused or both, in spite of our best efforts to maintain connections using technology.</p> <p>By the end of March, 16 out of 58 staff members were isolating because they or a family member was sick, or shielding,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>meaning it has also been a day-by-day struggle to make sure we have had enough people on duty, not to mention supplies of food and personal protective equipment (PPE). Thankfully our local authority has provided support on all fronts, which helped us through the most turbulent initial weeks, and we\u2019ve since managed to find new suppliers and recruit new staff&nbsp;alongside those who have been able to come back to work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have for the most part stopped worrying about becoming ill ourselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><br>We have watched the devastating consequences of the virus in other homes with horror. Our own numbers make painful reading, with 11 deaths in as many weeks, but we think we have actually been lucky; most of those have been the culmination of a long illness, or new admissions to us from our local hospital for end-of-life care. Initially only three residents were tested so we won\u2019t know for sure \u2013 and we try not to drive ourselves crazy wondering \u2013 but, although one of those three positive patients has sadly died, the other two, including a lady in her 90s, appear to have made a full recovery.</p> <p>The rollout of the promised weekly testing of all care home residents and employees is painfully slow. Our first full set of tests arrived on Sunday 17 May, with a 30-hour window of opportunity to carry out tests before the prearranged collection; miraculously we managed to&nbsp;test 72 people, including all but three of the staff who weren\u2019t on duty over those two days. When the results arrived&nbsp;two days later, a resident and a member of staff&nbsp;\u2013 neither of whom had experienced any symptoms \u2013 had tested positive. By chance, that staff member hadn\u2019t been at work for a few weeks, but it brought home how important&nbsp;testing is, and how badly we need to repeat it regularly. Disturbingly, we still have no idea&nbsp;when that will be possible.<br><br>Current guidance states that the PPE that staff wear will protect them from transmitting the virus, and we can only hope this is the case, because our converted premises, which give us a lovely homely atmosphere, make social distancing impossible \u2013 even if two people&nbsp;washing and dressing the same resident&nbsp;could keep two metres apart. The guidance at least means we won\u2019t lose half the staff team as the result of a single positive test \u2013 as the PPE is supposed to protect us \u2013 but given how Covid-19 has spread in other homes, all the PPE and infection-control processes in the world don\u2019t give us confidence that if we have another case, we will be able to contain it.<br><br>And that is why, despite the easing of restrictions, and the government\u2019s seemingly spontaneous last-minute decision to allow the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/lockdown-to-be-eased-for-englands-most-clinically-vulnerable\">extremely vulnerable</a>\u201d to leave their houses, we are not yet comfortable with even the most socially distanced of visits.&nbsp;The only piece of&nbsp;official guidance, issued to&nbsp;care homes on 15 May,&nbsp;advises that face-to-face visits should only take place at the very end of a resident\u2019s life, and under strict conditions (no more than two visitors, no kissing, PPE to be worn). It hasn\u2019t been updated, leaving homes to navigate this minefield for themselves.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/12/testing-coronavirus-uk-care-homes-complete-system-failure\">Testing for coronavirus in UK care homes a \u2018complete system failure\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Portsmouth has had lower infection and death rates than many parts of the country, but as people start to mix we know that the local infection rate is likely to go up,&nbsp;making it&nbsp;more likely that any visitor brings more than they intend with them. It is a short step from there to another outbreak in the home, and we can\u2019t count on being so lucky next time.<br><br>So for the time being, we are keeping our doors closed and&nbsp;trialling&nbsp;meetings between a resident inside the conservatory and a visitor outside who will be able to see and speak to each other through the glass double doors. We are also puzzling over how to provide chiropody, and when&nbsp;hairdressing and worship can resume in the home.<br><br>In spite of the severe symptoms some of our colleagues suffered, we have for the most part stopped worrying about becoming ill ourselves. Protecting our residents feels like our most important task. It also feels like an impossible one.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Robin Hall is administration manager at the <a href=\"http://www.homeofcomfort.org.uk/\">Home of Comfort</a> in Southsea, a charitable nursing home, and secretary of the <a href=\"https://hampshirecare.org/\">Hampshire Care Association</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "As the lockdown rules loosen, friends and family members of our nursing home residents, who have been so supportive through this crisis, are nurturing hopes of a relaxation in our visiting policy. It was on 17 March \u2013 only 11 weeks ago, though it feels like a lifetime \u2013 that we decided with the heaviest of hearts to close our doors to almost all visitors. When the country went into lockdown that decision seemed a prudent, if painful one; the home is normally full of the laughter and joy of up to 30 residents and their visitors, who are usually such an important presence. Deprived of their company, many of our residents have become more anxious, confused or both, in spite of our best efforts to maintain connections using technology. By the end of March, 16 out of 58 staff members were isolating because they or a family member was sick, or shielding, meaning it has also been a day-by-day struggle to make sure we have had enough people on duty, not to mention supplies of food and personal protective equipment (PPE). Thankfully our local authority has provided support on all fronts, which helped us through the most turbulent initial weeks, and we\u2019ve since managed to find new suppliers and recruit new staff alongside those who have been able to come back to work. We have watched the devastating consequences of the virus in other homes with horror. Our own numbers make painful reading, with 11 deaths in as many weeks, but we think we have actually been lucky; most of those have been the culmination of a long illness, or new admissions to us from our local hospital for end-of-life care. Initially only three residents were tested so we won\u2019t know for sure \u2013 and we try not to drive ourselves crazy wondering \u2013 but, although one of those three positive patients has sadly died, the other two, including a lady in her 90s, appear to have made a full recovery. The rollout of the promised weekly testing of all care home residents and employees is painfully slow. Our first full set of tests arrived on Sunday 17 May, with a 30-hour window of opportunity to carry out tests before the prearranged collection; miraculously we managed to test 72 people, including all but three of the staff who weren\u2019t on duty over those two days. When the results arrived two days later, a resident and a member of staff \u2013 neither of whom had experienced any symptoms \u2013 had tested positive. By chance, that staff member hadn\u2019t been at work for a few weeks, but it brought home how important testing is, and how badly we need to repeat it regularly. Disturbingly, we still have no idea when that will be possible. Current guidance states that the PPE that staff wear will protect them from transmitting the virus, and we can only hope this is the case, because our converted premises, which give us a lovely homely atmosphere, make social distancing impossible \u2013 even if two people washing and dressing the same resident could keep two metres apart. The guidance at least means we won\u2019t lose half the staff team as the result of a single positive test \u2013 as the PPE is supposed to protect us \u2013 but given how Covid-19 has spread in other homes, all the PPE and infection-control processes in the world don\u2019t give us confidence that if we have another case, we will be able to contain it. And that is why, despite the easing of restrictions, and the government\u2019s seemingly spontaneous last-minute decision to allow the \u201cextremely vulnerable\u201d to leave their houses, we are not yet comfortable with even the most socially distanced of visits. The only piece of official guidance, issued to care homes on 15 May, advises that face-to-face visits should only take place at the very end of a resident\u2019s life, and under strict conditions (no more than two visitors, no kissing, PPE to be worn). It hasn\u2019t been updated, leaving homes to navigate this minefield for themselves. Portsmouth has had lower infection and death rates than many parts of the country, but as people start to mix we know that the local infection rate is likely to go up, making it more likely that any visitor brings more than they intend with them. It is a short step from there to another outbreak in the home, and we can\u2019t count on being so lucky next time. So for the time being, we are keeping our doors closed and trialling meetings between a resident inside the conservatory and a visitor outside who will be able to see and speak to each other through the glass double doors. We are also puzzling over how to provide chiropody, and when hairdressing and worship can resume in the home. In spite of the severe symptoms some of our colleagues suffered, we have for the most part stopped worrying about becoming ill ourselves. Protecting our residents feels like our most important task. It also feels like an impossible one. \u2022 Robin Hall is administration manager at the Home of Comfort in Southsea, a charitable nursing home, and secretary of the Hampshire Care Association",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. The largely peaceful protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd went on across the US and around the world over the weekend, as it emerged that more than 10,000 US protesters have been arrested during the weeks of unrest \u2013 many for non-violent offences. In Minneapolis, where Floyd died, the city council has taken a dramatic step towards reform, by declaring their intent to disband the city\u2019s police force and replace it with an alternative system of \u201cpublic safety\u201d. The Obama administration introduced or stepped up measures to impose accountability on police forces after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. But, as Ed Pilkington explains, Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice has allowed those incremental efforts to wither on the vine \u2013 which may partially explain the growing support for a more radical solution: \u201cdefund the police\u201d. \u2018The police are still killing during a pandemic.\u2019 The families of Tamir Rice, Oscar Grant and other black Americans killed by police tell Lois Beckett their anger has been tempered by glimmers of hope in the response to Floyd\u2019s death. American police act like occupying armies because their founders studied tactics used to quell foreign uprisings, says Stuart Schrader: Every overseas war has reshaped policing in the United States, including by filling the ranks of police departments with veterans and pushing surplus materials into their hands. British protesters pulled down a slave trader\u2019s statue In the English port city of Bristol, Black Lives Matter protesters pulled down a statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston and tipped it into the harbour during a demonstration on Sunday, amid a heated debate about Britain\u2019s legacy of racism, inspired by the protests in the US. Demonstrations have spread to cities as far afield as Nigeria and Australia. The novelist Ben Okri suggests Floyd\u2019s case has caused worldwide reverberations because his words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d speak eloquently both to our fears of the coronavirus pandemic and to the implacable nature of institutional racism: Maybe it should be the phrase that people who are oppressed should use. It should become the mantra of oppression. Maybe every time the police stop you in your car for no other reason than that you are a black man or woman, you should say: \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 Has Trump\u2019s denigration inspired a crackdown on the media? Reporters covering the protests have been assaulted and arrested \u2013 sometimes live on air \u2013 in a crackdown on journalists that seems worthy of a developing world dictatorship, writes David Smith. And campaigners argue that it is difficult to separate the situation from Trump\u2019s consistent denigration of the news media: \u201cIt\u2019s as if a switch had been turned off in terms of respecting the role of a free press in a democracy,\u201d says the chief executive of PEN America. Two editors quit following backlash. The New York Times oped editor with ultimate responsibility for publishing a controversial comment piece by Senator Tom Cotton has resigned. So has the executive editor at the Philadelphia Enquirer, after facing a backlash to the headline \u201cBuildings matter, too\u201d. How the world sees the protests \u2013 and the president\u2019s response The Guardian\u2019s correspondents around the world report on how others see the unrest in the US, from those in South America who hear echoes of their continent\u2019s authoritarian dictatorships, to countries criticised by the US for their human rights records, now revelling in news of Trump\u2019s harsh response. British diplomats say they fear Trump\u2019s re-election would imperil the so-called special relationship between the two countries. The president is reaching for Nixon\u2019s playbook \u2013 and relaxing into his own comfort zone \u2013 by making \u201claw and order\u201d central to his campaign strategy, writes David Smith. But he has already alienated major Republican figures including Colin Powell, who on Sunday told CNN he intended to vote for Joe Biden in November. Are the protests energising young voters? People running for local office say they are seeing a spike in enthusiasm among young people, as Adam Gabbatt reports. In other news \u2026 Brazil\u2019s government has stopped releasing its numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and wiped an official website clean of information, reportedly on the orders of the president, Jair Bolsonaro. Tropical Storm Cristobal made landfall in Louisiana on Sunday afternoon, but also generated extreme weather in other nearby states, including a tornado in Florida. A $1m treasure chest hidden in the Rockies has been found, 10 years after it was put there by the eccentric New Mexico antiquities dealer Forrest Fenn. At least four people died looking for it. \u201cI feel halfway kind of glad, halfway kind of sad because the chase is over,\u201d Fenn said. Great reads Our long love affair with living underwater In the 1960s, the world was gripped by the space race. But a craze for another kind of exploration also took hold. Chris Michael explores how humanity\u2019s fascination with life underwater, sparked by pioneers such as Jacques Cousteau, has altered our relationship with the planet. The designer who introduced streetwear to the catwalk Willi Smith was the most high-profile black fashion designer of the 1980s: the man who invented streetwear, and whose own label was grossing $25m a year before his death with Aids in 1987. So why, asks Priya Elan, has he been all but forgotten? Does South Africa hold the key to an assassination mystery? On Wednesday, Swedish officials are due to unveil the findings of an investigation into one of the world\u2019s most infamous cold cases, the 1986 assassination of the then prime minister, Olof Palme. G\u00f6ran Bj\u00f6rkdahl explains how an unexpected tipoff led him to look into apartheid-era South Africa\u2019s alleged links to the killing. Opinion: the left changed the pandemic narrative overnight Less than two weeks ago, the enlightened position was to exercise nothing less than extreme caution in the face of the coronavirus. Now, writes Thomas Chatterton Williams, we are told social distancing is of secondary importance to mass protest. Even as the coronavirus lockdown threw 40 million Americans out of work \u2013 including Floyd himself \u2013 many progressives accepted this calamity, sometimes with stunning blitheness, as the necessary cost of guarding against Covid-19. Last Thing: TikTok\u2019s teenage tadpole talent Hannah McSorley, an Irish teenager who came across a patch of frogspawn in a shallow puddle in the first week of lockdown, has become a TikTok sensation after nursing 37,928 tadpoles (her own estimate) towards frogdom in her backyard paddling pool. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping my dad will build me a pond,\u201d she told Elle Hunt.

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">Twitter</a> and elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. </strong>A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">here</a> what defunding the police might mean. </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. </strong>New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">tweet</a> from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </li> \n   <li><strong>New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. </strong>De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-curfew-rules-arrests\">curfew</a> that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/new-york-police-brutality-protests-george-floyd\">brutality</a> against participants in demonstrations following the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd.</a> </li> \n   <li><strong>A protester was shot in Seattle. </strong>A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeattlePD/status/1269836366109536262\">in custody</a> who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side.</li> \n   <li><strong>US attorney general said troops were a last resort. </strong>The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona,</strong> where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson<strong>, </strong>a 28-year-old black man who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/29/george-floyd-killing-protests-minneapolis-minnesota-us-twitter-donald-trump-latest-news-live?page=with:block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b#block-5ed1ebe48f084df971c8c71b\">shot and killed </a>by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T07:07:42.569Z\">at 8.07am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edde0218f0883ec2fc1cbb1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:55:45.212Z\">7.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New York City Mayor pledges to cut police department funding</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. </p> \n  <p>In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">BREAKING: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYCMayor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYCMayor</a> announces new policing reforms in New York City: <a href=\"https://t.co/aWQgz0NBDK\">pic.twitter.com/aWQgz0NBDK</a></p>\u2014 City of New York (@nycgov) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nycgov/status/1269730600505794565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddd318f08bd75dbb63dca\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:40:20.014Z\">7.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a> or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:41:33.047Z\">at 7.41am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edddbfe8f083999a26dbfa5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T06:37:07.408Z\">7.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178?s=20\">anti-racism protests in the UK</a> were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</em></p> \n  <p><em>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights.

Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out <strong>African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans</strong>.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are <strong>some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs?</strong> Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really <strong>a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge</strong>, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families. So I think we need to keep that in mind as well.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Florida congresswoman and former Orlando police chief, <strong>Val Demings</strong>, was also on the show and disagreed with Wolf\u2019s comments. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to solve some of America\u2019s toughest problems, <strong>we\u2019ve got to be painfully honest about what those problems are</strong>,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we know that we have been fighting systemic racism in this country for 400 years. We know that it has found its \u2013 or reared its ugly head in law enforcement agencies, in housing, in education, in \u2013 in too many other places. And so while I heard what the secretary said, we have a lot of work to do. And systemic racism is always the ghost in the room.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Demings, who is a potential running mate for Joe Biden in November, spoke about <strong>her own experiences after a 27-year career as a police officer</strong> in Orlando.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve worked beside some of the bravest men and women with hearts big as gold that America has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cWas everybody perfect? Were we completely perfect? Of course not. But what I have seen across the nation involving law enforcement officers and their reaction, in many instances unprovoked, has been extremely troubling. And what we have to do as a nation is hold police accountable, provide the necessary oversight to do that, look at training standards, look at use of force policies, look at who we are hiring, look at diversity within those agencies, and come together and create legislation that will support initiatives like that.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edcf4d68f0883ec2fc1c60f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T14:22:29.485Z\">3.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has said the <strong>national guard are withdrawing from Washington DC</strong>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control,\u201d wrote the president on Twitter. \u201cThey will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed.

Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on Twitter and elsewhere. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city\u2019s police department. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains here what defunding the police might mean. New York City\u2019s mayor pledged to cut police department funding. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d New York City\u2019s curfew was lifted. De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm curfew that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police \u2013 including numerous accounts of brutality against participants in demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd. A protester was shot in Seattle. A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington. It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man in custody who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side. US attorney general said troops were a last resort. The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said. Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona, where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was shot and killed by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department\u2019s funding, shifting it instead to social services. In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to \u201cShift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.\u201d \u201cThe amount will be finalized with the city council during the budget process,\u201d the statement says: As always, please do get in touch with questions, comments, news and tips from your part of the US on twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the anti-racism protests in the UK were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d, after some protestors clashed with police in London: Fans of the popular South Korean boy band BTS matched its $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter (BLM) in support of US protests against police brutality, an organisation that runs fundraisers for the fans said on Monday. The K-pop group\u2019s music label, Big Hit Entertainment, on Sunday told Reuters that BTS had donated $1 million to BLM in early June. The seven-member BTS wrote on its Twitter account on Thursday that they are against racism and violence with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination. We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together.\u201d The hashtag went viral among the group\u2019s fans and started another wave of donations with the hashtag #MatchAMillion. The movement encouraged BTS\u2019 fan base, known as ARMY, an acronym for Adorable Representative MC for Youth, to match the group\u2019s $1 million donation. The campaign had raised $1,007,518 as of Monday at 9:47 a.m. (0047 GMT), and will continue indefinitely, the organisers said. The US Soccer Federation is considering repealing its ban on players kneeling during the national anthem, ESPN reports: At the urging of USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone, the board will meet via conference call Tuesday to discuss the policy, sources said. The board probably will take a formal vote Friday. If the board votes to repeal the policy, it would take effect immediately, but it would still have to be voted on at the next annual general meeting, scheduled to take place in February or March. At that point, the National Council could either back the repeal or vote to keep the policy in place. \u201cNever in my lifetime has the case of such visible injustice moved white and black people, moved them as human beings,\u201d poet and novelist Ben Okri writes for the Guardian: There have been protests all across America. But there have been huge protests in Britain, in Spain, in Nigeria, in fact all across the world. Why has the killing of George Floyd struck such a profound chord in us? Maybe it was that phrase: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d The consonance of the phrase with the very root of our pandemic fears is uncanny. The phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man. ... What happened to George Floyd isn\u2019t new. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d was uttered by another police victim, Eric Garner, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal. Language taps into primal fears. As #BlackLivesMatter and George Floyd protests in the US inspire people around the world to demonstrate against racism, statues commemorating figures known for their brutality against black people are coming under fire. On Sunday, as my colleague Martin Farrer writes, \u201cprotesters in Bristol in the UK toppled a statue to the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston that has long been the focus of anger in the city. Demonstrators gathered at the memorial on Sunday before attaching ropes to it, hauling it down and then pushing it into the docks. The historian David Olusoga compared it to the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Iraq but home secretary, Priti Patel, called the incident \u2018disgraceful\u2019.\u201d Meanwhile in Brussels, Belgium, Euronews journalist Jack Parrock filmed as a group of men climbed onto a statue of King Leopold II and waved the Congolese flag, while chanting \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201creparations\u201d. Some estimates put the toll of people who died between 1885 and 1908 in the Congo Free State \u2013 an area that today lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 which was privately owned and controlled by the Belgian king, as high as ten million. Artists on Sunday painted the words End Racism Now on a downtown street in Raleigh, North Carolina, the Raleigh News &amp; Observer reports. The message was added days after the mayor of Washington, DC., had the words Black Lives Matter painted on a street leading to the White House amid days of demonstrations in the nations capital and all over the country in response to George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis. Floyd was born in North Carolina, where memorial service for family was held on Saturday. Charman Driver, former chair of the Contemporary Art Museum on Martin Street, where the painting is located, called it a very painful totem. The street leads to Confederate monuments on State Capitol grounds, which have been spotlighted as offensive during protests, according to the AP. The painting was applied Sunday morning when a city engineer met the artists and brought barricades to block off the street. \u201cWe did it. And it\u2019s wonderful. And we feel really good about it. Our voices are being heard, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Driver said. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Meanwhile, Trump has \u201cliked\u201d a tweet about the HBO show \u2018Insecure\u2019 on Twitter. It is unclear whether this was on purpose, but the unlikely pairing (Insecure is a show about a young black woman living in LA) is causing a stir online. US President Donald Trump has tweeted about statements made by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Friday last week regarding racism at the NFL. Goodell, speaking in a video, said the league made mistakes in not listening to players in a video on Friday denouncing racism in the United States amid widespread protests over police brutality against black people. \u201cWe, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.\u201d Trump tweeted around an hour ago that it might be possible that Goodell is \u201cintimating that it would now be OK for the players to KNEEL or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country &amp; out flag.\u201d Goodell did not mention Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback whose decision to kneel during the national anthem during a preseason game in August 2016 kick-started the protest movement. He did not mention the US flag or national anthem, either. More on Goodell\u2019s statements here: Here is the full report on Minneapolis lawmakers vowing to disband the police department: Speaking at a community rally on Sunday, a veto-proof majority of councilmembers declared their intent to \u201cdismantle\u201d and \u201cabolish\u201d the embattled police agency responsible for George Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 and build an alternative model of community-led safety. The decision is a direct response to the massive protests that have taken over American cities in the last two weeks, and is a major victory for abolitionist activists who have long fought to disband police and prisons. \u201cIn Minneapolis and in cities across the US, it is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe,\u201d said Lisa Bender, the Minneapolis city council president, at the event. Nine councilmembers announced their support and represent a supermajority on the twelve-person council, meaning the mayor, who earlier this weekend opposed disbanding the department, cannot override them. The remaining three councilmembers are broadly supportive of the effort as well, but weren\u2019t ready to sign on, activists said. While the mayor has oversight over the police, the city council has authority over the budget and policy, and could work to dismantle the department through cuts and ordinances. More footage of today\u2019s protests in Los Angeles: The decorations on the White House fence, which protestors are turning into a makeshift memorial, are growing: In happier news, Sunday in the US saw marching taken to new levels of speed, grace and cool. In LA, the Compton Cowboys, who describe themselves as \u201cA collective of lifelong friends on a mission to uplift their community through horseback and farming lifestyle, all the while highlighting the rich legacy of African-Americans in equine and western heritage,\u201d lead a \u201cpeace ride\u201d to the Martin Luther King memorial: In Philadelphia it was a group of skateboarders: Photographer Lindsey Wasson has captured this photo of the moment the shooter in Seattle emerged from his car, as the 26-year-old man he shot \u2013 who later identified himself as Daniel \u2013 is treated by paramedics on the ground nearby: Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now.

That\u2019s it from me today. Handing over to the incredible Helen Sullivan. Stay safe, everyone. A protester was shot in the arm in Seattle, Washington trying to protect his fellow demonstrators from a man who had driven his car into the crowd and came out with a gun. Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona, where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was shot and killed by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer. In Kauai, hundreds gathered to denounce police violence and racism in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Protesters in Miami, Florida briefly took over a section of an interstate ahead of the 9pm curfew. A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington. It\u2019s unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man in custody who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun.

Photographer Alex Garland got video of the victim as the street medics who treated him for a gunshot wound in his arm helped him down the street. \u201cI punched him in the face,\u201d said the man, who identified himself as Daniel. \u201cI heard the gunshot go off, in my arm. I moved right in time. But my whole thing was to protect those people, my whole thing was to protect those people down there.\u201d Thousands marched in Portland, Oregon, where law enforcement has come under scrutiny for responding to hostility from crowds with tear gas and stun grenades. Police used \u201ctear gas, stun grenades and a device that emits ear-piercing sounds\u201d in nine of the 11 consecutive days of protest, according to the Oregonian. Law enforcement has justified this use of force by tweeting items allegedly thrown at officers during the protests. Protesters in Miami, Florida briefly took over part of Interstate 95 ahead of the 9 pm curfew: Police allowed protesters to march along the interstate: Guardian contributor Jon Letman has this dispatch from Kauai, where demonstrators have turned out in a rural part of Hawaii over the weekend: Hundreds gathered on Kauai on Saturday to express solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Waving placards and chanting slogans denouncing police violence and racism, demonstrators reflected the diversity of Hawaii\u2019s mostly Asian, Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander population. Boisterous, but peaceful, protesters shouted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d as passing cars honked in support. Overhead, Hawaii\u2019s state flag flew upside-down, signaling distress. The only police present were six officers standing to the side on the steps of the county building as Kauai chief of police Todd Raybuck walked through the crowd talking with demonstrators. Earlier in the morning, Raybuck had spoken at a \u201cpaddle-out\u201d on Kauai\u2019s north shore where hundreds had paddled surfboards into Hanalei Bay in a show of unity. Although African Americans make up less than one percent of Kauai\u2019s population, black demonstrators repeatedly described Kauai as \u201cthe best place they\u2019d ever lived,\u201d an island where community, respect, and tolerance were the norm. One woman named Tsige Gesit said the Hawaiian spirit of aloha made Kauai different. Native Hawaiian demonstrator, Peleke Flores, brought his small children to witness how kapu aloha (a philosophy and practice of nonviolent engagement) could be a positive force for change. Raymond Catania, a local labor rights activist, was impassioned. \u201cThe Kanaka Maoli (Native Hawaiians) suffer with their lands taken away. Filipino and Micronesian workers are on the bottom\u2026 American capitalism does not work,\u201d Catania said. \u201cThis is the beginning of the end of their system. It\u2019s going take a while, but people are wising up.\u201d In Phoenix, Arizona, thousands showed up to march not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was shot and killed by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer in a \u201cstruggle\u201d in which there are scant details. The Guardian\u2019s amazing voting rights editor Ankita Rao brings us more reporting from the protests in New York: New York City saw more protests across the city today, with most expecting less tension with the New York Police Department after mayor Bill de Blasio lifted the 8pm curfew. The majority of the marches, including one with family and children and a meditation, were largely without incident. But later in the evening, a small protest of about a hundred people made their way down Flatbush Avenue and then planned to cross the Manhattan Bridge on the pedestrian walkway. Like most protests, there was a group of protestors on bicycle at the front and back of the crowd. As protestors made their way, two or three protestors trailed behind, slowing down a long line of police vehicles going down the street, zig zagging on their bikes. At one point, police officers exited the car with batons in hand before pushing the protestors on their back and chest, telling them to get on the sidewalk. At one point, a cop picked up a bicycle and threw it from a few inches away at the owner. Hey there, Vivian Ho taking over the blog for Bryan Graham. Protesters took to the streets in San Francisco and Oakland again on Sunday, some on foot and some on bicycle. Barack Obama said that the nationwide protests following the recent deaths George Floyd and others were fueled from \u201cdecades worth of anguish, frustration, over unequal treatment and a failure to perform police practices\u201d and issued a warning against \u201cdivision and falsehoods\u201d in a commencement speech during YouTube\u2019s Dear Class of 2020 virtual ceremony. The former US president spoke along with his wife, Michelle, on a bill that included Beyonc\u00e9, Katy Perry, K-pop titans BTS and Tampa Bay Buccaneers star quarterback Tom Brady. \u201cDemocracy isn\u2019t about relying on some charismatic leader to make changes from on high,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s about finding hope in ourselves, and creating it in others. Especially in a time like this. You don\u2019t always need hope when everything\u2019s going fine. It\u2019s when things seem darkest \u2013 that\u2019s when you need it the most.\u201d He added: \u201cIn a lot of ways, the pandemic just brought into focus problems that have been growing for a very long time, whether it\u2019s widening economic inequality, the lack of basic health care for millions of people, the continuing scourge of bigotry and sexism, or the divisions and dysfunction that plague our political system. \u201cAs scary and uncertain these times may be, they are also a wake-up call. And they\u2019re an incredible opportunity for your generation.\u201d CNN reports that White House officials are deliberating a plan for Donald Trump to address the nation on the racial tensions and civil unrest across the country in coming days, citing a senior administration official. Housing and Urban Development secretary Ben Carson suggested as much on Sunday during an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union when asked about the subject, saying: \u201cI believe you\u2019re going to be hearing from the president this week on this topic in some detail. And I would ask you maybe to reserve judgment until after that time.\u201d After firing off tweets and retweets at a record-shattering clip to start the weekend, Trump has kept a relatively low profile on Sunday: posting a handful of boilerplate endorsements, retweeting his own previous musings for amplification\u2019s sake, taking a shot at the New York Times and claiming: \u201cI built the greatest economy in the World, the best the U.S. has ever had. I am doing it again!\u201d Trump\u2019s most recent attempt at an Oval Office address at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in March was widely panned even by some friendly outlets, with Daniel Larison of the American Conservative writing it \u201cwent over like a lead balloon\u201d. Of course, Trump has also risen to the moment of a prime-time spotlight in the past. Even previously hostile CNN pundit and former Obama administration official Van Jones couldn\u2019t help but gush after Trump\u2019s first State of the Union address: \u201cHe became president of the United States in that moment, period.\u201d The Associated Press reports charges have been filed against a man in St Louis who police say shot and killed a retired police captain during a night of violent protests as the former officer tried to protect his friend\u2019s pawn shop. A 24-year-old St Louis man has been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a retired police captain who died on a night of violent protests while trying to protect his friend\u2019s pawn shop, the city\u2019s prosecutor announced Sunday/ Stephan Cannon was being held without bond on a first-degree murder charge in the death of David Dorn, 77, who was killed Tuesday on the sidewalk outside Lee\u2019s Pawn and Jewelry. Dorn\u2019s last moments were caught on video and apparently posted on Facebook Live, though the video has since been taken down. Dorn\u2019s death came on a violent night in St Louis, where four officers were shot, officers were pelted with rocks and fireworks, and 55 businesses were burglarized or damaged, including a convenience store that burned. The unrest came as cities across the US have seen protests and violence since George Floyd died May 25 after a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck for several minutes, even after the handcuffed black man stopped moving and pleading for air. St Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner announced the charges. According to a police probable cause statement, Cannon was among those seen on surveillance footage entering the store and then stealing several televisions, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Dorn, a friend of the pawn shop\u2019s owner who was in the habit of checking on the business when alarms went off, arrived at the store. Cannon then walked toward the street corner with gun in his hand. \u201cAt the time the shots were fired, (Cannon) was the only person standing at that corner,\u201d the probable cause statement reads. \u201cMultiple plumes of smoke\u201d can be seen coming from where Cannon was standing, and shell casings were found on the spot, police said. Cannon also faces several other charges including robbery and felon in possession of a firearm. The NBA\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks led an estimated crowd of 7,500 supporters on what the team described as a public protest march through the city\u2019s downtown area on Sunday. Sterling Brown, a third-year Bucks guard whose own police brutality case against the city for a 2018 incident is still pending, led the crowd in nine seconds of silence to honor George Floyd. \u201cWe making something great happen, something positive happen, something that\u2019s heard around the world,\u201d Brown said to the gathered demonstrators outside the team\u2019s home arena, who responded with a various chants including \u201cblack lives matter\u201d, \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d, and \u201cwe will be seen, we will be heard\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see everybody out here standing as one, standing for equality, standing for George Floyd and his family and everybody who\u2019s been a victim to police brutality.\u201d Guardian US columnist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who started his own NBA career playing in Milwaukee, wrote about Brown\u2019s parking violation gone wrong at the time. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti has announced that national guard troops will be pulled out of the California cities where they\u2019ve been deployed for a week. \u201cThe California National Guard is departing Los Angeles this evening,\u201d Garcetti said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cA small number of units will be stationed nearby until June 10 to provide emergency support if needed. I\u2019m proud that our city has been peaceful this week \u2013 and that our residents are leading a powerful movement to make Los Angeles more just, equitable, and fair for Black Angelenos, communities of color, and all of our workers, youth, and families.\u201d The announcement came amid another day of peaceful demonstrations across the state over the death of George Floyd and calls for police reforms. Over 7,000 national guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento and other cities after rampant violence and thievery marred the first days of protests marred the first days of the protest, though the overwhelming majority of the more than 3,000 arrests in Los Angeles county by Wednesday were for non-violent offenses like failure to disperse or breaking curfew. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council has announced its intent to dismantle the city\u2019s police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. Nine of the council\u2019s 12 members announced their pledge to create a new system of public safety before hundreds of demonstrators at a rally at Powderhorn Park in south Minneapolis on Sunday afternoon. \u201cThis council is going to dismantle this police department,\u201d councilman Jeremiah Ellison said. Added city council president Lisa Bender: \u201cWe\u2019re here because we hear you. We are here today because George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police. We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe. \u201cOur efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\u201d On Friday, the council approved an agreement to ban the use of police chokeholds and neck restraints in response to the killing of Floyd with the state\u2019s department of human rights, which also requires officers to intervene anytime they seen an unauthorized use of force. When pressed by CNN for details on what a city with a defunded police department might look like, Bender told the network that funding would be shifted to other needs. \u201cThe idea of having no police department is certainly not in the short term,\u201d Bender said. Utah senator Mitt Romney is among the roughly 1,000 demonstrators marching in a faith-based protest to the White House in Washington on Sunday afternoon. Asked by a Washington Post reporter why he chose to join the movement, Romney said: \u201cFinding a way to end injustice and brutality and to make sure people understand that black lives matter.\u201d On Saturday, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate shared a photo of his father, George, participating in a civil rights march in protest of housing discrimination in 1963, his first year as Michigan\u2019s governor. The caption included a quote from the elder Romney: \u201cForce alone will not eliminate riots. ... We must eliminate the problems from which they stem.\u201d Earlier Sunday, Romney was topic of discussion on the morning news shows after a New York Times story that said he and former US president George W Bush won\u2019t be supporting Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. The New York Times has announced editorial page editor James Bennet has resigned amid outrage over an op-ed by a Republican senator who called for using federal troops to quell protests outrage. The opinion piece by Arkansas lawmaker Tom Cotton drew widespread criticism from when it was first published late Wednesday afternoon, including from Times staff, that only grew when it was revealed that Bennet had not read the piece before publication. Some Times staff members called in sick Thursday in protest and the paper said a review found that the piece did not meet its standards. Bennett responded to the backlash by posting an explanation on the Times\u2019 decision to run Cotton\u2019s piece: \u201cThe Times editorial board has forcefully defended the protests as patriotic and criticized the use of force, saying earlier today that police too often have responded with more violence \u2013 against protesters, journalists and bystanders,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs part of our explorations of these issues, Times Opinion has published powerful arguments supporting protests, advocating fundamental change and criticizing police abuses. Times Opinion owes it to our readers to show them counter-arguments, particularly those made by people in a position to set policy. We understand that many readers find Senator Cotton\u2019s argument painful, even dangerous. We believe that is one reason it requires public scrutiny and debate.\u201d The Times said on Sunday that Katie Kingsbury has been named as acting editorial page editor through the November election. The Rev Jesse Jackson spoke at a worship service on Sunday at St Stephen Church in Louisville, the Kentucky city where Breonna Taylor was shot at least eight times in her home after a brief confrontation with police who were there to serve a warrant in mid-March. \u201dWhen you kill, you should be arrested and charged,\u201d Jackson said. \u201dThere\u2019s a George Floyd in every town. ... There\u2019s a Breonna in this town, Laquan McDonald in Chicago, Arbery in Brunswick, Georgia, the world is revolting for justice.\u201d On Saturday, the 78-year-old activist called for Congress to pass an anti-lynching law and eliminate protections for police officers from lawsuits, a subject he spoke about during a conversation with Guardian US reporter David Smith last week. A crowd of about 1,600 demonstrators have gathered outside Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle in midtown Manhattan, chanting \u201cThrow him out!\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace!\u201d The 11th days of protests in New York City have unfolded peacefully on a warm Sunday afternoon following the mayor\u2019s rescinding of a citywide 8pm curfew that had drawn extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police from the New York Civil Liberties Union, Legal Aid Society, Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center and the Center for Constitutional Rights. The Associated Press reports a white police officer has been charged with assault after using a stun gun on a black man in Virginia. Fairfax County police Officer Tyler Timberlake was trying to get the man into an ambulance to go to a detox center on Friday, according to body camera video shown at a news conference late on Saturday. Timberlake is seen striking the man with a stun gun and then getting on top of him, along with the officer wearing the body camera. Once Timberlake is on top of the man, he presses the stun gun into the back of his neck and fires again. \u201cTogether as a community, through our transparency, we will heal as a community,\u201d Fairfax County police chief Edwin C Roessler Jr said. \u201cThis is behavior we shall not tolerate.\u201d Roessler said someone had called police about a man walking down a street shouting that he needed oxygen. An officer who responded before Timberlake had tried to deescalate the situation, the police chief said, adding that it\u2019s unclear why Timberlake used his stun gun. Our correspondents have looked at how the world has reacted to the protests in the US \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t look like the president has improved his global standing over the last few weeks: The events of the past week in America have had reverberations around the world. For years, part of the daily work of the US state department was to issue denunciations of police brutality, suppression of dissent, and instability in far-flung corners of the globe. In recent days it has been the other way round. Friendly nations have expressed concern, less friendly governments have revelled in Washington\u2019s discomfort. In South Africa, where there have also been sporadic demonstrations, the ruling African National Congress party called for calm in the US. \u201cWe are convinced that America \u2013 a beacon of freedom for many worldwide \u2013 has the ability to directly focus on healing and peace and achieve an outcome that prioritises respect for and promotion of fundamental freedoms for all Americans,\u201d Naledi Pandor, the country\u2019s international relations minister, said. The Nelson Mandela Foundation was less restrained, arguing that systemic violence towards black Americans could justify a violent response. \u201cWhen communities are confronted by both resilient structural violence and attacks on their bodies, violent responses will occur,\u201d the foundation said in a statement. The reviews aren\u2019t great in China either: \u201cTrump is tearing apart America. He doesn\u2019t need to send the troops. This will hurt the US\u2019s international image,\u201d said a journalist based in Beijing who asked not to be named. \u201cAll of this is about the fight for justice, rights and equality. Whether it is Hong Kong or the US, people need to differentiate between violence and the fight for justice.\u201d \u201cYou can see an absolute absence of moral legitimacy in the activities of all great powers, from Putin in Crimea to Trump in Minnesota,\u201d said Liu Yi, editor of international affairs at Sanlian Life Weekly, a magazine. \u201cWhen Trump was showing his hypocrisy and arrogance in the Minnesota issue, Chinese nationalists got more legitimacy to say \u2018never criticise us again about Hong Kong\u2019.\u201d You can read the full article here: The army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, said the Pentagon did not want to deploy troops on the streets of Washington DC last week as protesters gathered on the streets. He said the Insurrection Act, which would have allowed Donald Trump, to deploy active military members in the protests was \u201cheavily discussed\u201d by the administration. \u201c[The soldiers] were on the outskirts cause we didn\u2019t want to do it. The department of defense didn\u2019t want to do it because we knew once we went to that escalation, it\u2019s very very difficult,\u201d McCarthy told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe did everything we could to not cross that line.\u201d McCarthy added that out of state national guard would start leaving the city later on Sunday. \u201cEffective 5pm this evening we will begin redeploying the out of state guardsmen starting with the state of Mississippi ... as well as the state of Florida, Utah and Indiana,\u201d McCarthy said. Thousands of people have attended an anti-racism protest in Milan. Children born of foreign parents in Italy are not automatically eligible for citizenship until they reach 18 after continuously living in the country, and some protesters wanted to bring attention to legal reform on the question. There have been complaints that the children of foreigners aren\u2019t considered Italians even though they have been born and raised in the country. According to the Associated Press, \u201corganizers on Sunday told participants that in Italy, the Black Lives Matter slogan means avoiding \u2018seeing black bodies as if they\u2019re foreigners\u2019 and not as citizens. The Guardian has published an editorial on the protests that have spread across the US \u2013 and the world \u2013 in the weeks since George Floyd\u2019s killing by police. George Floyd\u2019s name is now known around the globe; his death has sparked protests from Berlin to Mexico City. The extraordinary cruelty of his killing has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere. Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests. But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of David Dungay, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards. In Britain, they were cried out by Jimmy Mubenga as security guards pinned the deportee to his plane seat. You can read the full story here: New York governor Andrew Cuomo said during his daily press briefing on Sunday that poor management was to blame for incidents of looting over the last week in New York City. \u201cThe looting had nothing to do with protesting. Protesting is different,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou have looting, and you have protesting. You have apples, you have oranges. They\u2019re different. Well the night of looting was the fault of the police officers? No, it wasn\u2019t the fault of the protesters and it wasn\u2019t the fault of the police officers, I said it was the management and deployment of the police officers.\u201d Like Washington DC\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, Cuomo said defunding police would not be helpful. \u201cNo police? You get looting. That\u2019s what you get. Nobody wants that,\u201d he said. Chicago has now lifted its curfew. \u201cThe curfew is lifted effective immediately,\u201d wrote the city\u2019s mayor, Lori Lightfoot, on Twitter. \u201cI know this time in our city and our country has been difficult for us all, and I\u2019m grateful to our residents for working together to navigate this challenging time.\u201d It is estimated the largest protest in Chicago on Saturday drew around 20,000 people and proceeded peacefully, encouraging the mayor to lift the curfew. Crowds are beginning to gather in Washington DC for another day of protests. Meanwhile, the city\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, said there had been no arrests during Saturday\u2019s protests in DC. She also said she still believes she was correct to push back against Donald Trump\u2019s decision to bring the national guard and additional federal officers on to the streets of the capital. \u201cWhat we saw last week was basically an invasion of our city. Active-duty Army troops moved from all points around the country to threaten our autonomy,\u201d Bowser said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. \u201cWhat you saw \u2013 and I won\u2019t have it reduced to a spat \u2013 was how I have to defend our taxpayers.\u201d Despite widespread calls to defund police and make funds available to other sectors such as housing and healthcare, Bowser defended the city\u2019s decision to increase law enforcement funding by $45m under a proposed new budget. \u201cWe have invested not a penny more and certainly not a penny less than we need for safe neighborhoods,\u201d she said. Richard Luscombe has news of Joe Biden\u2019s plans for the week ... When Donald Trump spoke to George Floyd\u2019s brother Philonise last month, ostensibly to express his sympathies, it didn\u2019t go well. \u201cHe didn\u2019t give me an opportunity to even speak,\u201d Floyd said. \u201cI was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off, like \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d In Houston on Monday the Floyd family will get the chance to talk face-to-face with the man challenging Trump for the White House in November, the presumptive Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden. According to the New York Times, Biden will travel to Texas to meet the Floyd family ahead of Monday\u2019s public memorial service, and a private funeral the following day. Biden is not expected to attend either event, the newspaper says, because he does not want his presence to be a distraction. But as well as meeting with Floyd\u2019s family, Biden will record a video message to play at Tuesday\u2019s funeral. \u201cHe wanted to offer in-person condolences,\u201d the Times reported, citing people \u201cfamiliar with the matter.\u201d The trip to Texas will be Biden\u2019s first outside his home state of Delaware since the start of the pandemic lockdown, and his first public appearance since amassing enough delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination on Friday. On Wednesday, the day after his brother\u2019s funeral, Philonise Floyd plans to give congressional testimony to the House judiciary committee\u2019s hearing on police practices and law enforcement accountability. Ending curfew a first step in long journey, say rights advocates. Civil rights advocates in New York City called Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s decision to lift the 8 pm curfew \u201ca necessary step\u201d in a \u201clong journey\u201d stopping police violence, while insisting far more needed to be done for true reform. The New York Civil Liberties Union, Legal Aid Society, Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center, and Center for Constitutional Rights had previously threatened to sue if de Blasio extended this curfew beyond Sunday. There have been numerous accounts of New York Police Department members using excessive force at protests following the killing of George Floyd. After immense pressure from protesters and the threat of a lawsuit we had prepared to file today, Mayor de Blasio has lifted New York City\u2019s curfew, a blunt tool of state-sanctioned oppression used to silence legitimate protest. The City\u2019s focus should not be on silencing protest and resistance, but on ending anti-Black police violence and impunity,\u201d Black and LGBTQ-headed organizations, protesters, legal observers, and medical workers said in a joint statement. \u201cEliminating the curfew was a necessary step in stopping the cycle of police violence and silencing the mass of voices demanding recognition and dignity for Black Lives. No longer will the NYPD be able to use curfew enforcement as justification for their attacks and arrests on protesters, essential workers, journalists, and bystanders.\u201d The statement said that they are monitoring the situation as protests continue, and are \u201cready to sue if the mayor reinstates the curfew or considers other measures to restrict free speech.\u201d They said that state lawmakers must \u201cfully repeal\u201d a law that shields police misconduct records from the public. They also called for \u201ctruly independent investigations\u201d when a person dies or endures abuse during a police encounter -- not inquiries conducted by the police. They also said the New York City Council \u201cneeds to cut police funding, scale back police involvement in our schools, and divert resources toward services that will benefit the community.\u201d George Floyd\u2019s body has arrived in Houston ahead of a memorial service and burial in the coming days. Floyd, who was killed by police in Minnesota last week, spent most of his life in Houston where he had been a high-school football star. There will be a public viewing and memorial service in Houston on Monday before he is buried on Tuesday next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd. A memorial service for family was held on Saturday near his birthplace in North Carolina. \u201cAt the request of the family, his entry was made private. He was led to Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center by Houston Police Department,\u201d a statement on behalf of his family read. \u201cMr Floyd will be buried directly next to his mother on Tuesday.\u201d The Episcopal bishop of Washington DC, Mariann Budde, has renewed her criticism of Donald Trump in a sermon on Sunday. Budde said she was \u201coutraged\u201d last week when law enforcement used pepper spray and rubber bullets to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters from near the White House so the president could attend a photo opportunity at a local church. On Sunday, Budde contrasted Trump with Washington\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser. \u201cThe president of the United States threatened to use military force against American citizens. And then proceeded to use federal officers to disperse peaceful protesters outside of the White House,\u201d said Budde. \u201cThe African American mayor of this city stood her ground. She stood the ground for all of us. The debt to black America in this democracy continues.\u201d US attorney general Bill Barr says he does not believe there is systemic racism within US law enforcement. And yet we hear about incidents like the one below every day. Officials in Providence, Rhode Island, have apologised to a black firefighter after he said police drew guns on him as he sat in a car outside his fire station last week. In an interview that has been viewed more than a million times on social media, said he was in uniform and talking to a friend when two police officers approached with their guns drawn asking if he was armed. \u201cI was dressed in full uniform and had my radio in hand,\u201d Paci said in an interview with WPRI-TV. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m a firefighter, I\u2019m PFD, I\u2019m one of you don\u2019t shoot,\u2019 and they still kept approaching the vehicle with guns drawn.\u201d Providence\u2019s mayor, Jorge Elorza, called the incident \u201cdisturbing\u201d. Providence\u2019s police department said it is investigating the incident. \u201cNo one should have to experience something like this and we apologize on behalf of our city for the trauma it has caused,\u201d the Democratic mayor said in a statement. \u201cWe stand with Firefighter Paci and thank him for his unwavering dedication to a city that he protects everyday through his service.\u201d Paci said a Providence police sergeant visited the fire station to apologise for the incident. Thousands of people have attended a protest in Brussels that has taken in Belgium\u2019s colonial past. Members of the crowd chanted \u201cmurderer\u201d as protesters climbed a statue of King Leopold II and unfurled the the flag of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Leopold was king of the Belgians from 1865 to 1909 and effectively ran the Congo as his own private company, exploiting the region\u2019s natural wealth while brutalising its inhabitants. Alicia Garza, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter, has appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press to discuss calls to defund the police. She said that such calls do not mean abolishing law enforcement but rather investing money in other areas. \u201cWhen we talk about defunding the police, what we\u2019re saying is invest in the resources that our communities need,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much of policing right now is generated and directed towards quality of life issues ... But what we do need is increased funding for housing, we need increased funding for education, we need increased funding for the quality of life of communities who are over-policed and over-surveilled. \u201c... Black Lives Matter is not just a radical idea \u2026 everyone can agree that we don\u2019t have the things that we need to live well, and that we are using policing and law enforcement in a way that far exceeds its utility.\u201d Philadelphia has become the latest city to lift its curfew: The number of deaths from Covid-19 in America has reached 109,846, with confirmed cases now numbering 1,922,054, Johns Hopkins University data reveal. New York City, the center of America\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak, has suffered at least 21,294 deaths and 211,274 cases, according to the New York Times. As US coronavirus fatalities are nearing the grim milestone of 110,000, reopening efforts are expanding across America. Meanwhile, ongoing mass protests over the killing of George Floyd have challenged social-distancing guidelines. Questions over Covid-19 policy are perhaps most pressing in New York City, as it\u2019s expected to start reopening on 8 June. Construction and manufacturing, in addition to retail conducted on the curbside or through in-store drop-off and pick-up, are poised to be permitted. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates New York City\u2019s subways and buses, has announced a 13-point plan. It includes mandatory face coverings, and the provision of masks, as well as intensified cleaning and disinfecting efforts. Service will be increased to enable social distancing. Hand sanitizer will be at stations throughout the system, ABC 7 reports. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio urged every resident to get tested for Covid, especially those who attended recent demonstrations. A mobile testing program is expected to launch in the coming days. Meanwhile, public safety agencies are bracing for PTSD and trauma-related issues amongst first responders who fought the pandemic, ramping up access to mental health services, the New York Daily News reports. Black Lives Matters protesters in Bristol have pulled down a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston. Demonstrators in the British city attached a rope to the grade II listed statue on Colston Avenue on Sunday before pulling it to the ground as crowds cheered. They then jumped on it and rolled it down the street to the harbour before pushing it into the river Avon. The 18ft bronze statue, erected in 1895, has long been a focal point for anger at the city\u2019s role in the slave trade and the continued commemoration of those who were involved in it. A petition to remove it had garnered more than 11,000 signatures. It said: \u201cWhilst history shouldn\u2019t be forgotten, these people who benefited from the enslavement of individuals do not deserve the honour of a statue. This should be reserved for those who bring about positive change and who fight for peace, equality and social unity.\u201d Colston\u2019s company transported more than 100,000 slaves from West Africa to the Caribbean and the Americas between 1672 and 1689, cramming them into ships to maximise profit. The slaves, including women and children, were branded on their chests with the company\u2019s initials, RAC. Unhygienic conditions, dehydration, dysentery and scurvy killed more than 20,000 during the crossings and their bodies were thrown overboard. You can read the full story here: Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik offers a counterpoint to US attorney general William Barr\u2019s assertion that systemic racism does not exist in American law enforcement: When a black CNN reporter was arrested live on air last week while covering the protests in Minneapolis, it was met with denunciation that something like this could happen in the US. It was \u201ca sign of American disintegration\u201d, wrote the Washington Post. The head of civil liberties group PEN America called it a \u201cdystopian spectacle\u201d. On social media, the accompanying indignation to his arrest was that: \u201cThis is America, arresting journalists for doing their job doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201d But the list of things that don\u2019t supposedly happen in America continues to grow. Peaceful protesters don\u2019t get teargassed: this is America. Presidents don\u2019t threaten to unleash troops on those protesting against killing and oppression: this is America. For black and minority ethnic people, the country has always been the America of an immune police force, white supremacy and a legal system that protects only those who can afford it. The Trump administration is simply suspending convention, ditching the pretence of pious protocol and ritual that has always been central to the survival of the \u201cnot in America\u201d myth. This has always been America, what\u2019s different is that it no longer feels the need to hide its true nature. Since Donald Trump became president, non-Americans have taken to drawing tongue-in-cheek comparisons between America and Arab dictatorships \u2013 its fetishising of the military, its president\u2019s clumsy and vulgar stabs at religiosity, its centuries-old ethnic tension erupting in clashes \u2013 but even these jokes now wear thin. Because since George Floyd\u2019s death, since the government and institutions of sanctioned violence have bared their teeth, the US\u2019s flattering view of itself has taken such a battering that jokes are no longer needed to do the job. Those clutching their pearls at assaults on the media and police brutality hold dear the belief that America\u2019s inherent virtue will prevail, even as police officers hammer it with batons on mobile phone footage. American exceptionalism is the proverbial cockroach weathering a nuclear attack \u2013 it survives everything. It survives school shootings, the suspension of due process in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the torture and killing of millions of innocent civilians from Vietnam to Iraq. It is at this moment surviving despite the US having the highest coronavirus death toll in the world. You can read the full article below: Thousands of Black Lives Matter protesters have gathered outside the US embassy in London. Here\u2019s video of the demonstration: You can read more on the protests in London here: Admiral James Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander at Nato, has joined the growing list of retired US military leaders to condemn Donald Trump. The president has talked about \u201cdominating\u201d protesters over the last few weeks. During an appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Stavridis dismissed Trump\u2019s comments. \u201cThis is not a battlespace to be dominated. These are zones of protest to be protected,\u201d he said. He was also asked what advice he would give General Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, if Trump wants to invoke the Insurrection Act. \u201cAs an active-duty officer, he\u2019s really got two choices here,\u201d said Stavridis. \u201cOne is to follow the orders, and the other is to reach up on to his shoulder, grab those four stars and say \u2018Sir. I cannot execute that order. I believe it violates my conscience, my view. I gave you my best military advice. You\u2019ve rejected it.\u2019 That\u2019s a very hard place for any active-duty military officer to go. I hope General Milley doesn\u2019t have to hit that point.\u201d Barr denies White House protesters were peaceful. One of the most controversial moments of the protests over the last week came when law enforcement used pepper spray and rubber bullets to clear a crowd at Lafayette Square near the White House, so that Donald Trump could pose for a photo outside a local church. CBS\u2019s Margaret Brennan said three of her colleagues had been in Lafayette Square and the protest had been peaceful. \u201cThey were not peaceful protesters,\u201d said Barr, who has been accused for ordering the clearing of the crowd. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the big lies that the- the media is- seems to be perpetuating at this point ... Police have to move protesters, sometimes peaceful demonstrators, for a short distance in order to accomplish public safety, and that\u2019s what was done here.\u201d He also denied that law enforcement had used chemical irritants on the crowd because \u201cpepper spray is not a chemical irritant\u201d. Police issued a similar denial last week before going back on their initial statement. Brennan finished the interview by asking Barr if he would have done anything differently in hindsight. \u201cI haven\u2019t studied the events retrospectively in detail, but I think in general, you had the qualified law enforcement officials with shields warning and moving a line slowly. They had mounted officers moving slowly, directing people to move. And most people complied.\u201d Barr then agreed with Chad Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, that there is no systemic racism in US law enforcement. \u201cI think there\u2019s racism in the United States still but I don\u2019t think that the law enforcement system is systemically racist,\u201d said Barr. \u201cI understand the ... the distrust, however, of the African American community given the history in this country. I think we have to recognize that for most of our history, our institutions were explicitly racist. Since the 1960s, I think we\u2019ve been in a phase of reforming our institutions and making sure that they\u2019re in sync with our laws and aren\u2019t fighting a rearguard action to impose inequities.\u201d Barr added that he thinks policies to address racism within the police are working. \u201cI think the reform is a difficult task, but I think it is working and progress has been made,\u201d said Barr. \u201cI think one of the best examples is the military. The military used to be explicitly racist institution. And now I think it\u2019s in the vanguard of bringing the races together and providing equal opportunity. I think law enforcement has been going through the same process.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington has looked at how Donald Trump\u2019s policies have harmed efforts to reform the police: US attorney general says troops were only a last resort. The US attorney general, William Barr, has appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation to talk about the White House\u2019s response to protests against the death of George Floyd in Washington DC. He was first asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. \u201cI think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn\u2019t think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,\u201d he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. \u201cThe president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,\u201d he said. As protests following the killing of George Floyd sweep US cities on a scale not seen in decades, there is huge debate around what reforms police forces must make, amid surging support to defund them. Some police departments have taken steps to address long-criticized tactics and excessive use-of-force. Bystander video showed how now-fired Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck until he stopped moving. Minneapolis agreed on 5 June to bar chokeholds and neck restraints by police. The city council also agreed to a requirement that officers try stopping colleagues from engaging in improper use of force, reports the Associated Press. The reforms, part of an agreement between Minneapolis and Minnesota\u2019s Department of Human Rights, require court approval. But unlike the police department\u2019s present regulations \u2013 which already call for officers to try stopping misuse of force \u2013 this change would be enforceable in court, per AP. The Los Angeles Times reports more than one dozen California police agencies have recently announced that they would prevent officers from employing carotid neck restraints. California governor Gavin Newsom said that he\u2019s directing police agencies to cease training officers in carotid restraints. Dallas, Texas officials announced on 5 June that chokeholds \u2013 and any airway-restricting techniques \u2013 would be formally barred. The city also said it would implement by 12 June a mandate to warn people before shooting. Previously, police officials said they had enacted a policy mandating that officers intervene in situations with inappropriate use-of-force, reports the Dallas Morning News. The Reno, Nevada police department on 5 June announced immediate policy changes, such as barring tactics that restrict breathing and revamped guidelines on deescalation. The changes also include giving persons \u201cother warning options\u201d prior to using deadly force, AP reports. Chad Wolf, the acting homeland security secretary, says he does not belief there is systemic racism within US police. Wolf was asked the question on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, by host Martha Raddatz, who pointed out African Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans. \u201cI do not think that we have a systemic racism problem with law enforcement officers across this country,\u201d said Wolf. \u201cDo I acknowledge that there are some law enforcement officers that abuse their jobs? Yes. And again, we need to hold those accountable. And I would say that there are individuals in every profession across this country that probably abuse their authority and their power ... \u201cI think painting law enforcement with a broad brush of systemic racism is really a disservice to the men and women who put on the badge, the uniform every day. Risk their lives every day to protect the American people, to protect them so that they can go to school. They can have a business and come home safe to their families. So I think we need to keep that in mind as well.\u201d Florida congresswoman and former Orlando police chief, Val Demings, was also on the show and disagreed with Wolf\u2019s comments. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to solve some of America\u2019s toughest problems, we\u2019ve got to be painfully honest about what those problems are,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we know that we have been fighting systemic racism in this country for 400 years. We know that it has found its \u2013 or reared its ugly head in law enforcement agencies, in housing, in education, in \u2013 in too many other places. And so while I heard what the secretary said, we have a lot of work to do. And systemic racism is always the ghost in the room.\u201d Demings, who is a potential running mate for Joe Biden in November, spoke about her own experiences after a 27-year career as a police officer in Orlando. \u201cI\u2019ve worked beside some of the bravest men and women with hearts big as gold that America has to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cWas everybody perfect? Were we completely perfect? Of course not. But what I have seen across the nation involving law enforcement officers and their reaction, in many instances unprovoked, has been extremely troubling. And what we have to do as a nation is hold police accountable, provide the necessary oversight to do that, look at training standards, look at use of force policies, look at who we are hiring, look at diversity within those agencies, and come together and create legislation that will support initiatives like that.\u201d Donald Trump has said the national guard are withdrawing from Washington DC. \u201cI have just given an order for our National Guard to start the process of withdrawing from Washington, D.C., now that everything is under perfect control,\u201d wrote the president on Twitter. \u201cThey will be going home, but can quickly return, if needed. Far fewer protesters showed up last night than anticipated!\u201d The president also continued his tactic of positioning himself as a law and order candidate by saying Joe Biden would defund the police if elected president. \u201cNot only will Sleepy Joe Biden DEFUND THE POLICE, but he will DEFUND OUR MILITARY!,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHe has no choice, the Dems are controlled by the Radical Left.\u201d According to Reuters, Biden has in fact \u201ccalled for a $300m investment in policing, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities.\u201d However, Reuters also reported that Biden said he agreed with Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s plan to cut some of the city\u2019s police budget and reinvest it in areas such as health and education. Biden, however, added that such decisions should vary from community to community. You can read more about Trump\u2019s decision to embrace law and order \u2013 and the similarity to tactics used by Richard Nixon \u2013 below: Our correspondent in Rome, Angela Giuffrida, has news of protests in Italy: Demonstrators filled Rome\u2019s Piazza del Popolo on Sunday, joining protests taking place across the world against racism. People knelt down and remained there with their fists raised for eight minutes and 46 seconds in tribute to George Floyd, while chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. There were placards bearing messages in English, including \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cwe are all anti-fascist\u201d. Protesters also called for citizenship rights to be granted to migrants in Italy. \u201cThey die in our house and we don\u2019t even know their names: black lives matter,\u201d read one sign. The protest followed several smaller events in Rome and other Italian cities in recent days. Meanwhile, in the UK, protesters in Bristol have pulled down a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave trader: An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted between in the days following the death of George Floyd shows 80% of voters believe the US is out of control. \u201c[It\u2019s] one of the few things Americans can agree upon, and the one finding that we can definitively state given the tumult and torment of the past 12 days,\u201d said Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who helped conduct the poll, which was taken before job figures that were not as bad as some people feared were released last week. Joe Biden maintained his lead over Donald Trump (49% to 42%) among voters in the poll, but the president\u2019s approval rating remained steady in the mid-40s. \u201cThose are remarkable findings that speak to the power of our partisan silos,\u201d said Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies, which also helped conduct the poll. Biden led Trump among African Americans (82% to 9%), Latinos (57% to 33 %), women (56% to 35%), voters ages 18 to 34 (54% to 35%), whites with college degrees (52% to 39%), and those ages 65 and older (51% to 43%). Trump, meanwhile, led with all white voters (49% to 43%), men (50% to 42%) and whites without college degrees (55% to 37%). Trump still had better ratings on the economy compared to Biden (48% to 37%), while Biden held advantages in healthcare (49% to 34%) and uniting the country (51% to 26%). Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, is now on CNN. Carson says he is proud of those who peacefully protest and horrified by those looted after the killing of George Floyd. Carson is asked about his call to unite the nation, and whether Trump\u2019s demonising of his opponents on Twitter will help the US heal. \u201cI would ask you to reserve judgement until you hear from the president,\u201d he says. Jake Tapper then asks Carson if he believes systemic racism exists in the US. Carson says he grew up in a time of systemic racism and there are racists now but it is easier now to address the problem than in the past. He says there are \u201crogue\u201d police officers who are racist but most want to address the problem. He also says there are \u201canarchists\u201d who want to destabilise the US, presumably a reference to Trump blaming trouble at protests on Antifa. The former secretary state, and retired general, Colin Powell is on CNN\u2019s State of the Union show. He is asked about other generals who have criticized Donald Trump, such as James Mattis. \u201cYou have to agree with [the criticism], look at what Trump has done to divide us,\u201d says Powell. \u201cHe is being offensive to our allies ... so yes I agree with [Mattis and other generals who have criticized Trump] ... We have a Constitution. We have to follow that Constitution. And the president\u2019s drifted away from it. I\u2019m so proud of what these generals and admirals have done and others have done\u201d Powell then talks about the protests of the last few weeks. \u201cWe are at turning points,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Republican party and the president thought they were immune and could say anything. He lies, he lies about things and he gets away with things because people [in the Republican party] will not hold him accountable.\u201d Powell, who was secretary of state under a Republican, George W Bush, is asked if he will vote for Joe Biden in November. \u201cBiden is now the candidate and I will be voting for him,\u201d he confirms. \u201c...I think Trump has been not an effective president. He lies all the time. He began lying the day of the inauguration when we got into an argument about the size of the crowd that was there. People are writing books about his favorite thing of lying. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s in our interest.\u201d Powell says the president is doing nothing to heal the country at a time of civil unrest. \u201cHe is not in any way that I recognize. He is always shooting towards his base,\u201d says Powell. Jake Tapper ends the interview by asking Powell why he thinks it is important that Trump is not reelected. \u201c[Trump] lies all the time ... he began lying on inauguration day. Use your common sense, ask if this is good for your country before you ask if it\u2019s good for you. Look at these protests, embrace them rather than curse them. Make America great for all Americans.\u201d Black Lives Matter protests are building across the UK for a second consecutive day, including in Edinburgh. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has lifted a citywide 8 pm curfew that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police -- including numerous accounts of brutality against participants in demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd. De Blasio announced the change in a Tweet Sunday morning, which stated: \u201cNew York City: We are lifting the curfew, effective immediately. Yesterday and last night we saw the very best of our city.\u201d \u201cTomorrow we take the first big step to restart. Keep staying safe. Keep looking out for each other,\u201d de Blasio\u2019s post also said. The curfew, which initially was from 11 pm to 5 am but made earlier following looting, was originally poised to end Sunday night, in keeping with the city\u2019s gradual reopening. Police largely eased up on enforcing this curfew Saturday, as protesters continued to congregate after the deadline to return home. On 8 June, New York City is poised to enter \u201cPhase One\u201d of re-opening, which means that construction and manufacturing, as well as retail conducted on the curbside or though in-store drop-off and pick-up, will be permitted. Prague has witnessed its biggest public gathering in months after several hundred people marched through the city\u2019s medieval streets demonstrating against racism and the killing of George Floyd. Placard-carrying protesters chanting slogans including \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cGoerge Floyd, say his name\u201d congregated in the Czech capital\u2019s landmark Old Town Square before marching to the US embassy in the Mala Strana neighbourhood. Police officers wearing face-masks against the spread of Covid-19 escorted the marchers across the 600-year-old Charles Bridge, showing no reaction as demonstrators - many also wearing masks - shouted: \u201cNo justice, no peace. Fuck the police.\u201d Most of those present were white, including many foreign expatriates. The Czech Republic has a small ethnic minority population. Saturday\u2019s event - organised by a group called For Human Decency - had initially been cancelled amid continuing concerns about coronavirus but eventually went ahead following assurances about precautionary measures. It was the first demonstration staged in Prague since the pandemic prompted the authorities to declare a state of emergency and impose a nationwide lockdown in March. Public events of up to 300 people have been allowed since 22 May, as the lockdown has eased, with the requirement to wear masks outdoors lifted three days later. Gatherings of up to 500 will be permitted from Monday 8 June. Several European cities have seen mass gatherings in sympathy with similar protests in the US following the death of Floyd, an African-American man who died in Minneapolis on 25 May after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. But Saturday appeared to mark the first time capitals of former communist countries had seen such events, with the exception of Berlin, which was divided between the communist east and capitalist west during the Cold War. A similar demonstration was reported on Saturday in Warsaw. Last week, a protest was staged outside the US consulate in the Polish city of Krakow, where gatherers lit candles. On Sunday, demonstrators reportedly gathered outside the US embassy in Budapest for what was described as \u201can anti-racism solidarity\u201d protest. George Floyd\u2019s killing and the subsequent protests continue to be a powerful catalyst for conversations about race around the world. This morning in the UK, former Liverpool and England football John Barnes told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday that structural racism in Britain was just as bad as in the US. \u201c[The UK] hasn\u2019t got a problem like the US in terms of our policemen killing black people on the streets as we saw with George Floyd,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cHowever, in terms of the disenfranchisement of the inner cities, in terms of the black community not being given access to healthcare and so forth, jobs, housing, it\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d He said that people should be \u201cequally as outraged\u201d about structural inequalities as individual incidents: \u201cWhat we are witnessing in the US, which has outraged people, is the visible face of racism and the visible face of racism in terms of footballers being abused, the George Floyd situation and the police, it is an obvious and easy thing to be outraged about. We should be equally as outraged about the fact that our young blacks in inner cities aren\u2019t given an education, they aren\u2019t given housing and job promotion possibilities.\u201d \u201cThey were 48 minutes of mayhem that shook the republic,\u201d writes my colleague David Smith of US president Donald Trump\u2019s photo-op at St John\u2019s church in Washington DC, in a piece published today. With a bizarre pageant of riots shields, a Bible and a designer handbag, they also represented what could be Donald Trump\u2019s last best chance of clinging to power. Before sunset last Monday, the US president stood in the White House Rose Garden, threatened to turn the American military on the American people and declared: \u201cI am your president of law and order.\u201d Beyond the perimeter fence, park police and national guard troops fired teargas and chased away peaceful protesters so Trump could cross the road to the fire-damaged St John\u2019s church. Trump was joined by officials including his daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka, clutching a $1,540 handbag. The self-anointed strongman posed for the cameras while awkwardly holding aloft a Bible \u2013 or was it the Richard Nixon playbook? You can read the full story here: Hello, welcome to our live coverage of the ongoing protests against racism and police brutality in the US and around the world, now into their second week since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May. On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets, in big cities and small towns, from coast to coast, marking one of the the largest and widest mobilisations yet. You can read our wrap of the day here: The demonstrations have continued into the early morning in some places on the west coast including in Seattle, one of the few cities to witness clashes between police and protesters on Saturday. Officers are reported to have fired stun grenades to disperse protesters and say they were targeted with rocks, bottles and improvised explosives. Journalists at the scene say there is an uneasy standoff between the two lines now but no violent flare ups.",

Now that McGinn is fit again Villa can look forward to an injection of dynamism and thrust. With the form of Marvelous Nakamba having been one of the positives for Villa before the suspension of the league, they can expect to be strong in the centre. Another positive was the sharpness of Mbwana Samatta, the striker whose arrival in January offset the loss to injury of Wesley. The goalkeeper Tom Heaton, however, remains a key absentee and much will depend on the performances of his replacement. That could be \u00d8rjan Nyland, who did well throughout the Carabao Cup campaign, or Pepe Reina, who has recovered from a harrowing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/31/pepe-reina-coronavirus-ran-out-of-oxygen-fear-aston-villa\">case of coronavirus</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Recap\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>For a start, Villa need to stop conceding so many goals. That means eradicating the basic mistakes that have frequently sabotaged good work this season. It also means finding the right formula. Dean Smith had success when he switched to a back three in the new year but that proved temporary and he ended up reverting to a back four. Whatever system they use, Villa need at least one reliable central defensive partner for Tyrone Mings. Bj\u00f6rn Engels, though hardly infallible, has looked the most likely so far. Villa will also need to improve their attacking, particularly the service from the right to Samatta and McGinn. Villa collected eight points from their previous matches this season against the 10 teams they have left to face; they will probably need more than that to survive.</p> <p><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? </strong>Mostly. But anyone who saw the photograph in March of Jack Grealish wearing one slipper and one flip-flop as he stood forlornly on a Birmingham street contemplating his damaged Range Rover and flawed judgment will be aware that the club captain let the side down by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/29/police-investigate-after-jack-grealish-pictured-at-traffic-incident\">venturing outdoors</a> just hours after publicly calling for others to abide by lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/30/jack-grealish-apologises-for-stupidly-ignoring-lockdown-to-visit-friend-aston-villa\">He has apologised</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2b7a3ea51710446dfd4bd966bc4e102aff7c1cd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2b7a3ea51710446dfd4bd966bc4e102aff7c1cd2/201_0_2918_1751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mbwana Samatta scores for Villa in their 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on 1 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mbwana Samatta scores for Villa in their 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on 1 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Klein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Any unsung/community heroes? </strong>Not so much unsung as singing. Kortney Hause revealed his vocal talent by releasing his first single in April. The song, entitled Worth It, was not just a boon for lovers of R&amp;B but also for the NHS, to whom he donated all proceeds from sales. \u201cMusic has been a passion and a hobby of mine for many years,\u201d&nbsp;he said. \u201cIt felt like the right time to do my bit and help out.\u201d Grealish, meanwhile, gave money to Birmingham Children\u2019s hospital and raised over \u00a355,000 for the NHS by raffling off one of his Villa shirts.</p> <p><strong>Key player in the run-in? </strong>Grealish. He is not just Villa\u2019s most gifted player, he is one of the best in the league. Dismissed as an overrated bauble by people who do not pay enough attention, he is, in fact, a highly reliable and effective performer who works relentlessly and creates regularly despite constant attempts to take him down and rough him up. When he is on the pitch Villa always have a chance of scoring.</p> <p><strong>End-of-season-prediction</strong>&nbsp;With Grealish, Samatta and McGinn available to play together for the first time, Villa could yet fire their way to safety. They will survive.

What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? For a start, Villa need to stop conceding so many goals. That means eradicating the basic mistakes that have frequently sabotaged good work this season. It also means finding the right formula. Dean Smith had success when he switched to a back three in the new year but that proved temporary and he ended up reverting to a back four. Whatever system they use, Villa need at least one reliable central defensive partner for Tyrone Mings. Bj\u00f6rn Engels, though hardly infallible, has looked the most likely so far. Villa will also need to improve their attacking, particularly the service from the right to Samatta and McGinn. Villa collected eight points from their previous matches this season against the 10 teams they have left to face; they will probably need more than that to survive. Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? Mostly. But anyone who saw the photograph in March of Jack Grealish wearing one slipper and one flip-flop as he stood forlornly on a Birmingham street contemplating his damaged Range Rover and flawed judgment will be aware that the club captain let the side down by venturing outdoors just hours after publicly calling for others to abide by lockdown. He has apologised. Any unsung/community heroes? Not so much unsung as singing. Kortney Hause revealed his vocal talent by releasing his first single in April. The song, entitled Worth It, was not just a boon for lovers of R&amp;B but also for the NHS, to whom he donated all proceeds from sales. \u201cMusic has been a passion and a hobby of mine for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt like the right time to do my bit and help out.\u201d Grealish, meanwhile, gave money to Birmingham Children\u2019s hospital and raised over \u00a355,000 for the NHS by raffling off one of his Villa shirts. Key player in the run-in? Grealish. He is not just Villa\u2019s most gifted player, he is one of the best in the league. Dismissed as an overrated bauble by people who do not pay enough attention, he is, in fact, a highly reliable and effective performer who works relentlessly and creates regularly despite constant attempts to take him down and rough him up. When he is on the pitch Villa always have a chance of scoring. End-of-season-prediction With Grealish, Samatta and McGinn available to play together for the first time, Villa could yet fire their way to safety. They will survive. Just.

We need to adapt and be very smart, and that will inevitably mean some change. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m fearful of. We need to protect the sport and ensure its safe passage through 2020 and 2021 \u2013 when we hopefully win three World Cups [men, women and in wheelchair competition] at the end of next year.\u201d</p> <p>The importance of the 2021 World Cup in England was accentuated by the announcement last week that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/rugby-league-ashes-series-england-australia-cancelled-coronavirus\" title=\"\">the Ashes series this autumn has been cancelled</a>.

Warrington\u2019s work with dementia and St Helens\u2019 work with autism is outstanding. But lower down the ranks there are great examples of what Barrow does in the community. That\u2019s a strong town. Its whole community is built around the rugby league club.\u201d</p> <p>Rimmer is a proud Cumbrian and Barrow is his home club \u2013 for whom he played briefly in the late 1980s. \u201cMy dad would take me up to watch Barrow at home and I played there before going to Liverpool University where I also played. But the pinnacle of my playing career would be my four games [in the reserve grade] with Barrow. We drew one game 44\u201144 which gives an indication as to our level. But the game runs through my blood.\u201d</p> <p>He rose from being a development officer for Doncaster to the chief executive of Sheffield Eagles and a director of the Huddersfield Giants before joining the Rugby Football League. He was one of the first, when lockdown began, to take a pay cut and his approach has been matched across the sport.</p> <p>Rimmer smiles when I say he sounds surprisingly buoyant. \u201cI\u2019m always optimistic. I get out of bed every day optimistic. I\u2019ll never lose that.\u201d</p> <p>Rimmer hopes Super League will resume in August, with other tiers of the game to follow. When that blissful moment happens, he says: \u201cI really want us to punch the air and say: \u2018We\u2019re back!\u2019\u201d</p>",

We are not a shadow director as a governing body.\u201d Will all 34 clubs still be here in a year? \u201cThat\u2019s a very good question. I would like to think so but I\u2019m not at all reluctant to change. This crisis is moving very quickly so never say never to anything. We need to adapt and be very smart, and that will inevitably mean some change. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m fearful of. We need to protect the sport and ensure its safe passage through 2020 and 2021 \u2013 when we hopefully win three World Cups [men, women and in wheelchair competition] at the end of next year.\u201d The importance of the 2021 World Cup in England was accentuated by the announcement last week that the Ashes series this autumn has been cancelled. It was inevitable but the latest financial hit, estimated to be around \u00a31m, highlights the precarious position. Rimmer\u2019s previous answer would suggest some clubs could go under. \u201cIt\u2019s a fear,\u201d he says. \u201cThese days sport is a business. It\u2019s important to whole communities but each club has a responsibility to themselves. Neither I nor the rugby football league is solely responsible for their future.\u201d Which clubs are most in jeopardy? \u201cI don\u2019t see any Super League clubs being particularly in jeopardy right now. They\u2019re run by smart people and will dig a way out. The government funding gives them some confidence to plan. I would be fairly confident the majority of clubs are going to be fine.\u201d Wakefield and Salford, two Super League clubs, lose \u00a360,000 and \u00a370,000, respectively for each home game they cannot play. \u201cThere are bigger losses than that,\u201d Rimmer says. \u201cThose figures might not have that big an impact on the Premier League but in rugby league they\u2019re vast losses.\u201d Rimmer jokes about wearing odd socks as his lucky charm but he was persuasive and skilful in obtaining government support. He will also ensure the money is used prudently. Each club have to prove they have exhausted all other funding options. \u201cWe have the finances in place and we know all the clubs intimately. Most of the burden is prescribed to Super League clubs because their staff earn more and they\u2019re full\u2011time. But we will help the majority of the sport in one way or another.\u201d How many professional clubs are in a critical position? \u201cI would say about 10 clubs in the first instance require help. What those clubs have to prove is that they have a business plan which ensures they\u2019re sustainable. It\u2019s public money and a lot of responsibility comes with that, so we\u2019ll be very cautious about how we make those loans.\u201d Is \u00a316m enough to help rugby league recover from a devastating crisis? \u201cI think so. I\u2019m lucky enough to sit down with all of our tiers of rugby league and I always start with the same words: \u2018If we\u2019re going to find a way through this the solution will not be perfect. You all have to give a bit in order to make it work.\u2019 . This is our 125th year and it\u2019s not a year to go down. It\u2019s a year to come up fighting.\u201d The division between Super League clubs and the rest of rugby league has lessened this year. Does the sport now need just one governing body? \u201cOh, that,\u201d he says wryly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get involved with that. There\u2019s always speculation but I work regularly with Super League to promote the sport. Those conversations will continue.\u201d Perceptions of Rimmer have shifted during the crisis as his Super League critics have relied on his nous and expertise in dealing with the government. Rimmer must have noticed the change? \u201cPerhaps,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m always my own man and I have been all my life. I never get too carried away with the rare plaudits. Likewise I try not to get too downhearted about criticism. All I ever try to do is the right thing for the sport.\u201d Rugby league is different to most professional sports because its clubs remain rooted in their communities. \u201cAt every level,\u201d Rimmer stresses. \u201cLook at Super League. Warrington\u2019s work with dementia and St Helens\u2019 work with autism is outstanding. But lower down the ranks there are great examples of what Barrow does in the community. That\u2019s a strong town. Its whole community is built around the rugby league club.\u201d Rimmer is a proud Cumbrian and Barrow is his home club \u2013 for whom he played briefly in the late 1980s. \u201cMy dad would take me up to watch Barrow at home and I played there before going to Liverpool University where I also played. But the pinnacle of my playing career would be my four games [in the reserve grade] with Barrow. We drew one game 44\u201144 which gives an indication as to our level. But the game runs through my blood.\u201d He rose from being a development officer for Doncaster to the chief executive of Sheffield Eagles and a director of the Huddersfield Giants before joining the Rugby Football League. He was one of the first, when lockdown began, to take a pay cut and his approach has been matched across the sport. Rimmer smiles when I say he sounds surprisingly buoyant. \u201cI\u2019m always optimistic. I get out of bed every day optimistic. I\u2019ll never lose that.\u201d Rimmer hopes Super League will resume in August, with other tiers of the game to follow. When that blissful moment happens, he says: \u201cI really want us to punch the air and say: \u2018We\u2019re back!\u2019\u201d",

health restrictions continue to be eased.</p> <p>\u201cThey are designed to support business sticking with investment they had planned, and encouraging them to bring investment forward to support economic growth over the near term,\u201d Frydenberg said in a joint statement with the employment minister, Michaelia Cash.</p> <p>They said the move \u2013 to cost $300m over the budget cycle \u2013 would also help to improve cash flow for businesses by bringing forward tax deductions.</p> <p>\u201cHardworking Australian businesses can rest assured that the Morrison government will do all that is necessary to support them to bounce back stronger and get to the other side of this crisis,\u201d Frydenberg and Cash said.</p> <p>While the initial move to increase access to the write-off for assets of up to $150,000 was announced in March, it is unknown how many firms have taken up the scheme so far, because they will report the data in their 2019-20 tax returns.</p> <p>The government says it will need to legislate to give effect to the six-month extension.</p> <p>That stands in contrast to the homebuilder program, which will provide grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples intending to build a new home as a principal place of residence valued up to $750,000 including the land, or planning to renovate an existing property, with the upgrade valued at between $150,000 and $750,000.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/government-stimulus-measures-should-be-subject-to-scrutiny-labor-says\">Government sources confirmed on Sunday</a> that the homebuilder program would be rolled out within existing partnership agreements with the states, and would therefore not be legislated before the parliament.</p> <p>Labor has raised concerns, though, that the package will not do enough to support the building sector and does not include a program of social housing construction.</p> <p>A spokesman for Jason Clare, the shadow housing minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they want to avoid legislation on this because there are some pretty obvious holes in this package that should be subject to scrutiny.\u201d</p> <p>The government has also signalled that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/02/australias-arts-support-package-in-limbo-as-meeting-of-ministers-ends-in-stalemate\">a long-awaited rescue package for the arts and entertainment sector is imminent</a> and is also considering changes to the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p>During the parliament fortnight, the government is also expected to face questions about its plan to reintroduce childcare fees from 13 July amid concerns of a potential drop-off in attendance once the costs are back.</p> <p>The education minister, Dan Tehan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/australian-government-to-end-free-childcare-on-12-july-in-move-labor-says-will-snap-families\">announced on Monday that</a> the old childcare subsidy arrangements would return soon, because demand had been steadily increasing and the emergency relief package had \u201cdone its job\u201d.</p> <p>He revealed the government would stop paying the economy-wide jobkeeper wage subsidy to childcare services from 20 July, replacing this with a total of $708m in transition payments that he conceded may be less than the amount the sector would have received under jobkeeper.</p> <p>Tehan said the government would ease the previous activity test until 4 October in a bid to support eligible families whose employment had been affected by Covid-19.</p> <p>But Georgie Dent, the national campaign director of The Parenthood, said the advocacy group\u2019s recent survey of 2,200 families had found that 42% of respondents indicated at least one parent was earning less as a result of Covid-19.</p> <p>About a third of respondents reported they would need to reduce days or remove their children altogether if out-of-pocket fees returned to pre-Covid-19 levels.</p> <p>\u201cGiven families are already so squeezed financially it\u2019s awful to contemplate that getting back to work might not be possible simply because the cost of childcare is too high,\u201d Dent told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe announcement today indicates that the government either ignored what parents have said about the changes to their financial circumstances since Covid-19 or didn\u2019t believe them.</p> <p>\u201cIf a third of families are forced to reduce the number of days their children attend early education and care or remove them altogether, as they said they would be forced to if full fees returned, it will threaten the sector.\u201d</p>",

While the initial move to increase access to the write-off for assets of up to $150,000 was announced in March, it is unknown how many firms have taken up the scheme so far, because they will report the data in their 2019-20 tax returns. The government says it will need to legislate to give effect to the six-month extension. That stands in contrast to the homebuilder program, which will provide grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples intending to build a new home as a principal place of residence valued up to $750,000 including the land, or planning to renovate an existing property, with the upgrade valued at between $150,000 and $750,000. Government sources confirmed on Sunday that the homebuilder program would be rolled out within existing partnership agreements with the states, and would therefore not be legislated before the parliament. Labor has raised concerns, though, that the package will not do enough to support the building sector and does not include a program of social housing construction. A spokesman for Jason Clare, the shadow housing minister, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they want to avoid legislation on this because there are some pretty obvious holes in this package that should be subject to scrutiny.\u201d The government has also signalled that a long-awaited rescue package for the arts and entertainment sector is imminent and is also considering changes to the jobkeeper wage subsidy scheme. During the parliament fortnight, the government is also expected to face questions about its plan to reintroduce childcare fees from 13 July amid concerns of a potential drop-off in attendance once the costs are back. The education minister, Dan Tehan, announced on Monday that the old childcare subsidy arrangements would return soon, because demand had been steadily increasing and the emergency relief package had \u201cdone its job\u201d. He revealed the government would stop paying the economy-wide jobkeeper wage subsidy to childcare services from 20 July, replacing this with a total of $708m in transition payments that he conceded may be less than the amount the sector would have received under jobkeeper. Tehan said the government would ease the previous activity test until 4 October in a bid to support eligible families whose employment had been affected by Covid-19. But Georgie Dent, the national campaign director of The Parenthood, said the advocacy group\u2019s recent survey of 2,200 families had found that 42% of respondents indicated at least one parent was earning less as a result of Covid-19. About a third of respondents reported they would need to reduce days or remove their children altogether if out-of-pocket fees returned to pre-Covid-19 levels. \u201cGiven families are already so squeezed financially it\u2019s awful to contemplate that getting back to work might not be possible simply because the cost of childcare is too high,\u201d Dent told the Guardian. \u201cThe announcement today indicates that the government either ignored what parents have said about the changes to their financial circumstances since Covid-19 or didn\u2019t believe them. \u201cIf a third of families are forced to reduce the number of days their children attend early education and care or remove them altogether, as they said they would be forced to if full fees returned, it will threaten the sector.\u201d",

Loneliness, uncertainty and grief may be intensifying an already acute mental health crisis, and in the US there has been a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/mental-health/493125-increase-in-anti-anxiety-medication-antidepressants\">20% spike</a> in the number of prescriptions for antidepressant and anti-anxiety drugs during lockdown. Demand for key antidepressants is threatening to <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/health/mental-health-coronavirus-antidepressants-medication-supplies-uk-lockdown-rise-demand-2842273\">exceed supply</a> in the UK \u2013 where prescriptions have already <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/news-and-events/news-archive/2017-news-archive/antidepressants-were-the-area-with-largest-increase-in-prescription-items-in-2016\">more than doubled</a> over the last decade.</p> <p>I head the <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/psychedelic-research-centre\">Centre for Psychedelic Research</a> at Imperial College London, the first of its kind, supported by about \u00a33m in philanthropic donations. For 15 years, my research has focused on how drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT and MDMA work in the brain, and how they may be useful in treating disorders such as depression. Like the present pandemic, a psychedelic drug experiences can be transformative \u2013 of the individual \u2013 and of society. Both illuminate the extent to which the condition of the world we inhabit is dependent on our own behaviours. And these, in turn, are a consequence of how we feel, think and perceive.</p> <p>The Centre was founded in April 2019. A few months later, Johns Hopkins University in the US <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/05/us/johns-hopkins-psychedelic-research-center-trnd/index.html\">announced</a> a supersized version, floated by $17m. If you have read Michael Pollan\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/22/how-to-change-mind-new-science-psychedelics-michael-pollan-review\">How to Change Your Mind</a> or seen the <a href=\"https://goop.com/psychedelics-and-healing/\">first episode</a> of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Netflix series, The Goop Lab (titled The Healing Trip), you may be aware that such developments reflect a rising interest, and investment, in the mental health application of psychedelic drugs.</p> <p>One reason for this is that a decades-long struggle to resurrect medical research in the area is beginning to bear fruit. In London, we have spearheaded <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(16)30065-7/fulltext\">work</a> showing how psilocybin ( or \u201cmagic mushrooms\u201d) can be used to assist psychotherapy for difficult-to-treat depression, making a significant difference when conventional antidepressants and talking therapy have not. Right now, we are crunching data from a <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03429075\">much larger</a> depression trial that compares psilocybin-assisted therapy with a six-week course of a conventional antidepressant drug, a \u201cProzac-like\u201d selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Preliminary analyses indicate game-changing results.</p> <p>There hasn\u2019t been a breakthrough in mental healthcare for some time, and psychedelic therapy works very differently to current treatments. Conventional drug treatments have dominated psychiatry for decades, and although many people prefer psychotherapy, it is more expensive, harder to access and arguably no more effective than the drugs.</p> <p>These drugs haven\u2019t changed much since their discovery, and come with side effects that put people off taking them. Where SSRIs are concerned, their antidepressant action seems to rely on a moderation of the stress response \u2013 but it is a palliative rather than curative action, which requires having the chemical in the body for several months or longer.</p> <p>Psychedelic therapy is a much more comprehensive treatment package. It entails a small number of psychologically supported dosing sessions, flanked by assessment, preparation, and integration (talking through one\u2019s experience afterwards). Psychedelics appear to increase brain \u201cplasticity\u201d, which, broadly speaking, implies an accelerated ability to change.</p> <p>One view is that a psychedelic experience is a consequence of an especially intense surge of plasticity that opens a window of opportunity for lasting therapeutic change. The same windows may open up during other extreme states, such as experiencing trauma, stress-induced breakdown, a spontaneous spiritual experience or coming close to death. The difference with psychedelic therapy, however, is that the experience is carefully prepared for, contained and mediated. If not done this way, the use of psychedelics can be dangerous.</p> <p>The impact of successful psychedelic therapy is often one of revelation or epiphany. People speak of witnessing \u201cthe bigger picture\u201d, placing things in perspective, accessing deep insight about themselves and the world, releasing pent-up mental pain, feeling emotionally and physically recalibrated, clear-sighted and equanimous. This is very different from people\u2019s descriptions of the effects of SSRIs, where a contrasting feeling of being emotionally muted is not uncommon. It would be premature to disclose the findings of our head-to-head trial prior to proper scientific review, but on top of impressive tolerability and antidepressant effects with psilocybin-assisted therapy, we are seeing remarkable changes in patient-relevant outcomes. These include increased quality of life, \u201cflourishing\u201d (feeling well rather than just \u201cnot depressed\u201d), the ability to feel pleasure again and normal sexual functioning. The value of something new and different is often hard to gauge until it is placed alongside something more familiar, and our new study does this.</p> <p>Those driving efforts to get psilocybin therapy licensed hope to be able to market it across North America and Europe within the next five years. As was the case with medicinal cannabis, however, it is quite possible that use could begin to scale up prior to formal licensing. Before Covid-19, a small but buoyant market existed for plant-based psychedelic retreats or ceremonies in pockets of Europe, as well as Central and South America. There have been a number of initiatives to liberalise policies on psychedelic use in the US, and the most ambitious is the <a href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2020/05/dr-bronners-soap-company-donates-1-million-to-oregon-effort-to-legalize-psychedelic-mushrooms.html\">psilocybin service initiative</a> in Oregon, which aims to phase in legal, regulated psilocybin therapy through Oregon\u2019s health system, from this year. Whatever one\u2019s view on these developments, allying them with research is imperative if we are to advance scientific understanding, and ultimately inform and safeguard the individual.</p> <p>Despite this progress, the idea of \u201cpsychedelics for mental health\u201d will be petrol on flames for some. Stigma is attached to both mental illness and psychedelics, and so full entry into the mainstream won\u2019t go unchallenged (and rightly so). If the 1960s is anything to go by, there may be passions to temper at both ends of the spectrum, as psychedelics evangelisers could stoke as much trouble as opponents \u2013 which is why a dispassionate, scientific approach is so important.</p> <p>Like all tourism, the psychedelic variety will have taken a big hit in the pandemic, but it is unclear whether home use has been affected, either in prevalence or quality. \u201cHardly the best time for a trip,\u201d one might think \u2013 but psychedelics are sensitive to the slippery subtleties of context.

It understood that change occurs when people are moved to action. Students in northern US universities, although sympathetic to the plight of black southerners, remained passive supporters, so the SNCC organised \u201cfreedom buses\u201d for students to come and act as observers.&nbsp;</p> <p>These students witnessed lynchings, attack dogs mauling protesters and fire hoses dislocating bones, and they transformed into active anti-racists. Enraged by what they had witnessed, these students wrote home to their parents, often passive opponents of the \u201criotous\u201d civil rights protesters. On hearing of the injustices first-hand and in their children\u2019s voices, many thousands became aligned to the cause, and the entire political climate shifted in relation to the demands of southern freedom movements.&nbsp;</p> <p>In the wake of the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, we have statements of solidarity from politicians, corporations and even <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/uk-police-stand-with-those-appalled-by-george-floyd-death\">police forces</a>, but these are mere gestures. To be anti-racist means to involve yourself directly in the movement to end racism, to take action. The first step toward becoming an anti-racist is reckoning with the fact that racism is systemic. As the scholar and activist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/angela-davis\">Angela Davis</a> remarks: \u201cThere is an unbroken line of police violence in the US that takes us all the way back to the days of slavery.\u201d Race, as the Australian scholar Patrick Wolfe put it, is a \u201ctrace of history\u201d, a tradition travelling through several hundred years and in part facilitating the birthing of the global north and global south.</p> <p>The categorisations of race facilitated colonial conquests, enslavement and exploitative labour regimes \u2013 all engines of capitalism. Today, the political-economic setup of the global economy rests on the availability of a cheap, informal labour force, imperialist warfare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/22/this-changes-everything-review-naomi-klein-john-gray\">extractivism</a>, the mass incarceration of racialised people and mind-blowing inequalities in educational attainment, wages, housing and healthcare. This deep entanglement of accumulation, dispossession and violence is what is meant by the term \u201cracial capitalism\u201d. For example, in 2016 the Byron burger chain was happily employing migrant staff, some of whom worked 50 hours a week on minimum wage, until it facilitated a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jul/28/it-was-a-fake-meeting-byron-hamburgers-staff-on-immigration-raid\">Home Office raid</a> to have them deported. Staff reported that Byron entrapped them in a fake-meeting-cum-sting-operation. Racism and capitalism are inseparable.</p> <p>For these reasons, nearly all anti-racist mass movements worth their salt have recited tirelessly: ending racism, root and branch, would mean ending a global economic order predicated upon it. Anti-racism is anti-capitalist, and vice versa. There are no two ways around it. To be an anti-racist must demand a complete rejection of business as usual. An end to racism demands transformation of the global political-economic setup. This would mean paying workers fair wages across supply chains and ending the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/dec/27/uk-black-and-ethnic-minorities-lose-32bn-a-year-in-pay-gap\">ethnicity pay gap</a>, which flies in the face of the primary corporate objective of profit.</p> <p>So how can you go from being a passive non-racist to an active anti-racist? Anti-racism is the fight to build a mass-participating anti-racist movement in the workplace, the street and the community. Beyond a protest, a donation, a social media post and a difficult conversation, there\u2019s work to be done in tackling the many day-to-day issues underscored by racism. Learning is an essential part of this journey, so make a reading/listening/watching list and include the autobiography of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/13/assata-shakur-civil-rights-activist-fbi-most-wanted\">Assata Shakur</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/07/malcolm-x-man-behind-myth\">Malcolm X</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/08/from-emperors-to-inventors-the-unsung-heroes-to-celebrate-in-black-history-month\">Claudia Jones</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/germans-take-to-the-streets-to-celebrate-rosa-luxemburg-karl-liebknecht-berlin\">Rosa Luxemburg</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/04/your-silence-will-not-protect-you-by-audre-lorder-review\">Audre Lorde</a>.

Material changes require us to make movements from moments: this is a huge political moment, now we must build a huge political movement. We must all become anti-racist activists, black, white, brown \u2013 all of us. As activists we need to work together, outside the state agencies, which are some of the principal purveyors of systemic racism, to meet the needs of black and brown communities in Britain.&nbsp;</p> <p>Black and brown people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">four times</a> more likely to die from coronavirus than white people. Being an anti-racist activist means first of all taking up the fight for improved healthcare provisions and protective work equipment in these communities. Black and brown people are massively overrepresented in coronavirus-related searches, arrests and fines. To be an anti-racist means to fight against the sweeping new range of policing powers being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\">used disproportionately</a> against working-class racialised communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Criminalisation, gentrification, the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the closing of local public services: these are all arenas of anti-racist activism. So, find your local anti-racist organisation; if it doesn\u2019t exist then set it up. Every youth club, every school staying in the local authority, every saved estate, every anti-deportation and anti-raids group, every local police-monitoring group, will make concrete differences in improving the lives of racialised communities. When enough of these groups exist, are connected and can show solidarity with each other across cities and towns, then, and only then, will we begin to make inroads into tackling systemic racism.</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Joshua Virasami is an organiser and artist whose book How To Change It is published on 3 September</p>",

The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 17 points, or 0.27%, at 6,466 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.39% at 12,797 Franc\u2019e CAC 40 down 0.23% at 5,186 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.1% at 20,211 Dow Jones up 0.79% at 27,325 S&amp;P 500 up 0.19% at 3,200 Nasdaq down 0.3% at 9,784 It\u2019s been one of those days... Germany reported a record plunge in industrial production in April this morning and China released disappointing trade data over the weekend. Several UK companies have announced major job losses today, including BP, which is cutting its global workforce by 10,000 (reportedly about 2,000 in the UK). Oil prices climbed by more than 2% this morning following the extension of supply cuts by the Opec oil cartel and its allies, before falling back. Brent crude is now down 2.6% at $41.20 a barrel, while US light crude has lost 3.39%. In the UK, the 14-day quarantine has come into effect. The bosses of Ryanair and easyJet have expressed confidence that the new rules will either be struck down by the courts, or withdrawn by the UK government by the end of the month. Good-bye \u2013 we\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wall Street has opened higher. The Dow Jones has risen 161 points, or 0.6%, to 27,272 at the open, while the S&amp;P 500 added nearly 9 points, or 0.28%, to 3,20 and the Nasdaq rose almost 10 points, or 0.1%, to 9,824. Here is our story on the BP cutbacks, which come as global demand for oil has plunged as the Covid-19 pandemic forced countries around the world to go into lockdown. The oil giant BP plans to cut 15% of its global workforce \u2013 that\u2019s 10,000 jobs out of a total of 70,100, Reuters reports. It is thought that 2,000 of the cuts will fall in the UK. Chief executive Bernard Looney told employees about the cuts, which come in response to the coronavirus crisis, on a global online call. He said: We will now begin a process that will see close to 10,000 people leaving BP \u2013 most by the end of this year. All of the major European stock indices have reversed earlier declines and are now trading higher again, following last week\u2019s rally on economic optimism. They ended the week at three-month highs after much better-than-expected US jobs data. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 9 points, or 0.14%, at 6,493 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.37% at 12,895 France\u2019s CAC up 0.21% at 5,208 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.68% at 20,323 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 1.3% at 7,977 More job losses... BP intends to cut 2,000 jobs in the UK as part wider cutbacks, Reuters reports, citing a spokesman. Metro Bank has opened its first drive-thru branch in Wales to offer customers contact-free banking \u2013 in Cardiff on Newport Road. It is the bank\u2019s fifth drive-thru in the UK. The others are in England \u2013 Slough, Luton, Merry Hill and Southall. Oil prices have just turned negative, following earlier gains of over 2% after the Opec oil cartel and its allies extended production cuts to prop up the oil price. Brent crude has slipped 0.17% to $42.23 a barrel while US light crude is down 0.6% at $39.31 a barrel. The FTSE 100 index is now trading just under 9 points higher at 6,493, a 0.14% gain. Germany\u2019s Dax is flat while France\u2019s CAC 40 is down 0.32%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has advanced 0.67% while Spain\u2019s Ibex is up 1.16%, despite the dire economic forecasts from the Bank of Spain. Airline stocks easyJet and BA owner IAG are the two biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index. The bosses of EasyJet and Ryanair said they were confident of succeeding in their legal action to overturn the UK government\u2019s 14-day quarantine for air passengers arriving from abroad. The quarantine comes into effect today. The Bank of Spain estimates that the Spanish economy shrank by 16% to 21.8% in the second quarter, a massive drop in economic output. It expects a recovery in the second half of the year after the government began lifting coronavirus lockdown measures... but the Spanish economy is still on track to shrink by 9% to 11.6% this year, in its most likely scenario. Ouch. If there is a second Covid-19 wave which requires a further lockdown, the economy could contract by up to 15.1% in 2020. There are more comments from Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary on Reuters \u2013 he says that while Brits\u2019 bookings abroad are strong, the only notable weakness is inbound bookings into UK. O\u2019Leary also reckons that the three airlines\u2019 legal action against the UK government over the quarantine has a high likelihood of success. He expects the courts to strike the quarantine down unless the government quietly announces its withdrawal before the end of June. The pound is now down against the dollar, slipping 0.2% to $1.2636. BA owner IA is now the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index, up 5.4%, while easyJet is the third-biggest gainer, up 4.8%. The easyJet boss, Johan Lundgren, said that the legal case against the UK quarantine is strong. The airline has joined with BA owner IAG and Ryanair to bring legal action against the UK government over the 14-day quarantine, which comes into effect today. Lundgren told Sky News: We think that there\u2019s enough evidence and there\u2019s a strong case here that this should be challenged by the courts. This is something that has been rushed through. It\u2019 not in proportion. He said he hoped the threat of legal action would push the government to replace the quarantine with \u201ca targeted approach that is based on the solutions of air bridges\u201d, which allow people to travel freely between countries with low infection rates. EasyJet is planning to cut 4,500 jobs or 30% of its workforce because of the coronavirus crisis, and Lundgren said the quarantine would make things worse. When asked if the quarantine could lead to more job losses, he replied: I fear so...I think and I fear unless there is a change to this (the quarantine rule), that the aviation industry as we know it here in the UK will not be intact. In other corporate news, Morrisons said today that it will continue to pay its smaller suppliers for a further three months to help them through the coronavirus crisis. Up to 3,000 small suppliers including 1,750 farmers, stand to benefit, according to the supermarket group. The faster payment scheme applies to firms that have up to \u00a31m of turnover with Morrisons. The company started the scheme in March to help small firms and farmers who are struggling with cashflow because of the crisis. It ran until the end of May, and has now been extended to September. Morrisons has enjoyed a boost to sales from the Covid-19 lockdown in the first quarter, and said costs related to the pandemic should be offset by the government\u2019s business rates relief. Here is our story on Lookers. Here is our story on pub gardens in England possibly reopening from 22 June: Optimism has returned to many stock markets in Europe and Asia, continuing last week\u2019s rally, and stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. The FTSE 100 index in London is 0.28% ahead at 6,502 and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has gained 0.6%. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s CAC are still trading lower, down 0.18% and 0.3% respectively. Germany suffered a record decline in industrial production in April, according to data released this morning. Oil is still pushing higher, with Brent crude up 1.1%, or 48 cents, to $42.78 a barrel, while US crude is 0.94% ahead, or 37 cents, at $39.02 a barrel. Beauchamp adds: Also on the up this morning are oil stocks, after Opec+ extended their production cuts until the end of July. It looks like the oversupply story is being replaced by expectations of higher demand, or least by hopes that demand will not be as weak as previously feared. Overall, markets continue to look past all the bad data and concentrate on the good news, hence the strong reaction to Friday\u2019s job numbers. While this leaves indices vulnerable to a pullback, the strength of the bounce of the past month suggests that such weakness will be only temporary. Ahead of the open, we expect the Dow to start at 27,262, up 152 points from Friday\u2019s close. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, says: The surge in travel- and airline-related names comes on the day when the UK implements a quarantine for overseas travel, perhaps the very definition of shutting stable doors after the horse has bolted. With lockdowns easing across Europe and no sign of a second infection wave, this move has been staunchly opposed by airlines, and it looks like the market expects the restriction to remain in place for only a limited time. The government is reportedly ready to let beer gardens open from 22 June as part of plans drawn up by a group of ministers, dubbed the \u201cSave Summer Six\u201d, who are looking at ways to restart the hospitality industry earlier than initially planned, writes my colleague Rob Davies. The proposals, first reported in the Financial Times, would allow some of the 27,000 UK pubs that have outdoor space to serve customers for the first time in three months. Opening beer gardens before the end of the month would give struggling pubs a \u201cpsychological boost\u201d but most would still lose money, Wetherspoons founder Tim Martin said. UK airline and travel stocks are up, for once, despite the new quarantine rules. The cruise operator Carnival is the biggest riser on the FTSE 100 index, up 14%, while BA owner IAG is 6.9% ahead and easyJet has gained 5.5%. As reported earlier, Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary said the airline would fly through the 14-day UK quarantine, which he described as \u201crubbish\u201d. Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines \u2013 Ryanair, easyJet and IAG \u2013 have begun legal proceedings against the government over the quarantine rules, which they argue are illogical and unfair, and come months late. The German Dax and the French CAC 40 indices are now down just 0.07% and 0.1%, and the Stoxx Europe 600 index of Europe\u2019s leading shares is also broadly flat, down 0.08%. Sterling continues to climb against the dollar, lifted by further plans to ease the coronavirus lockdown in Britain. The pound is trading just below the $1.27 level it touched last week. Sterling has risen for seven days against the dollar, although analysts are warning that Brexit remains a big risk, as talks with the European Union are not exactly progressing. The pound has gained 2.8% against the dollar so far this month, as several economies are relaxing their lockdowns, weakening demand for the dollar, a safe-haven currency. According to the Sunday Times, Boris Johnson plans to ease planning restrictions that stop many pubs, cafes and restaurants from using outdoor areas, and also wants to make it easier to hold weddings outside. At the moment, couples cannot marry outside in England or Wales without a fixed shelter. Indoor weddings and funerals with up to 10 guests could also be permitted from early July. The UK and Italian stock markets have just turned positive, while shares in Germany and France are still in the red. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 11 points, or 0.18%, at 6,496 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 0.6% at 20,309 Germany\u2019s dax down 0.67% at 12,762 France\u2019s CAC down 0.47% at 5,173 The easyJet chief executive, Johan Lundgren, has warned that there could be more job losses at the budget carrier if the UK\u2019s new quarantine policy continues, according to Sky News. EasyJet currently intends to cut up to 4,500, or 30% of its global workforce, as it battles the coronavirus crisis which led to the grounding of planes around the world. The British luxury handbag maker Mulberry has also warned about job losses this morning. It intends to slash 25% of its global workforce and has kicked off a consultation process. Up to 470 jobs could be at risk across the organisation, from head office to manufacturing, retail, distribution and support. It currently employs 1,390 people worldwide, including 1,140 in the UK. The company says: Given the uncertainty as to the impact and duration of Covid-19 on the company and the wider economy, and the consequential effect on demand, we expect the recovery in our overall sales levels over the medium term to be gradual. The owner of Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and Chiquito restaurants has confirmed it is in talks with landlords about restructuring its leases, after reports that it plans to shut up to 120 sites with the loss of up to 3,000 jobs. The Restaurant Group announced last year that it would close more than 150 restaurants, including Chiquito and Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s outlets, as part of a major revamp over the next six years, following its \u00a3559m acquisition of Wagamama. It may now shut a further 120 Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s and Garfunkel\u2019s sites, while Wagamama, its airport outlets and pub operators are not affected. The company says: As is widely understood our industry is facing exceptional challenges in what is an unprecedented operating environment. The casual dining sector was already facing significant challenges prior to the onset of Covid-19, with overcapacity and significant cost pressures. In order to meet both the immediate challenges and to build a post-lockdown business with a sustainable future, we are in discussions with our landlords regarding potential restructuring options for our leisure estate. Our Wagamama, airport concessions and pub operations are not affected by these discussions. Back to the new UK quarantine rules, which come into effect today. The chief executive of London\u2019s Heathrow airport has warned of massive job losses \u2013 potentially in the millions \u2013 if the aviation sector does not get back on its feet soon. John Holland-Kay called for a government plan on how to reopen the economy and borders by the end of June. Air travellers arriving in the UK from abroad now have to self-isolate for 14 days, with the exception of key workers and diplomats. You can read more about the rules here. Holland-Kay told Sky News: We cannot go on like this as a country. We need to start planning to reopen our borders. If we don\u2019t get aviation moving again quickly, in a very safe way, then we are going to lose hundreds of thousands, it not millions of jobs in the UK just at the time when we need to be rebuilding our economy. Shares in the UK car dealership chain Lookers slumped nearly 16% in early trading and are now down 8.4% to 28.85p. The company announced that its auditor Deloitte would resign and postponed publishing its full-year results again, following an investigation into potential fraud inside the business carried out by another accounting firm, Grant Thornton. Lookers, which represents 31 car brands in the UK including Ferrari and BMW, said it expects its shares to be temporarily suspended from on 1 July until publication of the 2019 results. Last week it outlined plans to cut 1,500 jobs and close 12 showrooms. AstraZeneca said last week that it had doubled manufacturing capacity for a potential coronavirus vaccine it is developing with Oxford University to 2bn doses in two deals involving the Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates to ensure early supply to lower-income countries. We still don\u2019t know if the vaccine works, though, and won\u2019t know until August when human trials are due to finish, as AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot admitted. This morning, Oxford Biomedica, an Oxford University spin-out that specialises in gene therapy, said it had struck a manufacturing deal with a not-for-profit group backed by the UK government to help scale up production of the vaccine. The firm has agreed a five-year partnership with the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre \u2013 both are original members of the Oxford University manufacturing consortium for the potential coronavirus vaccine. This means Oxford Biomedica will also be producing the vaccine at a new manufacturing site, Oxbox, in Oxford, to help supply UK and European vaccine demand. AstraZeneca has taken over global responsibility for the manufacturing, development and distribution of the vaccine. In London, AstraZeneca shares are down 2.2% at \u00a382.40 after Bloomberg News reported on Sunday that the British drugmaker \u2013 which recently became Britain\u2019s biggest company by stock market value \u2013 had approached US rival Gilead Sciences about a potential merger of the two companies. Also weighing on the UK\u2019s blue-chip index, a City taskforce has warned that up to \u00a336bn worth of government-backed business loans could turn toxic by next year, as companies struggle to repay growing debts during the Covid-19 crisis. An interim report by the Recapitalisation Group, led by EY and lobby group TheCityUK, predicts that businesses will be saddled with \u00a397bn-\u00a3107bn worth of unsustainable debt by March 2021, writes our banking correspondent Kalyeena Makortoff. A third of that total will come from government-backed loans. And we\u2019re off. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 60 points, or 0.92%, at 6,424 Germany\u2019s Dax down about 1% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.6% Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. There was a massive surge in stocks on Wall Street and Europe on Friday after unexpectedly good news from the US jobs market. The unemployment rate took markets by surprise and dropped to 13.3% in May, rather than rising to close to 20%, as expected. The closely watched US non-farm payrolls data showed the economy added 2.5 million jobs last month, against expectations for 8 million job losses. The FTSE 100 rose to a three-month high on Friday, the S&amp;P 500 hit its highest level since late February and the Nasdaq set yet another record high, and is now up more than 12% this year. Asian markets rose today, lifted by Friday\u2019s sentiment and New Zealand\u2019s declaration that it has eliminated coronavirus. Japan\u2019s Nikkei is up 1.37% while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng is flat. However, European stocks are expected to fall back after last week\u2019s strong gains, as the US jobs boost fades. The FTSE 100 index in London is set to drop about 37 points at the open while Germany\u2019s Dax is seen opening 80 points lower. Chinese trade data were disappointing over the weekend and German industrial production fell more than expected. It posted a record monthly decline of 17.9% in April, according to official figures released this morning. Economists had expected a 16% drop. Meanwhile in China, exports fell 3.3% in May from a year earlier after a surprising 3.5% gain in April, and imports tumbled 16.7%, worse than April\u2019s fall of 14.2% and the sharpest decline since January 2016. Oil prices climbed by more than 2% this morning, after the Opec oil cartel agreed to extend production cuts. Brent crude hit $43.16 a barrel while US crude rose 1.6% to $40.18 a barrel, before falling back a bit. The new quarantine rules take effect in the UK today, which means people arriving from abroad by air will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines - BA\u2019s owner IAG, Ryanair and easyJet have launched legal proceedings against the government to try and overturn the quarantine rules. They argue that the quarantine comes several months late to stop coronavirus spreading and will kill off any nascent recovery in air travel. Ryanair\u2019s outspoken boss Michael O\u2019Leary said this morning that the Irish carrier, Europe\u2019s biggest budget airline, would not cancel flights to and from the UK in July and August because, he said, thousands of Britons are still booking holidays despite the quarantine. He told Reuters: The flights are full outbound of the UK. British people are ignoring this quarantine, they know it\u2019s rubbish. Ryanair is operating a thousand daily flights to points all over Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece from the 1st of July, the 2nd, the 3rd and every day and after that. Workers at Nissan\u2019s Sunderland factory return to work today, as the Japanese carmaker gradually raises its output towards about 28,000, the monthly total achieved on average last year. The plant was shut in April and May because of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is Britain\u2019s biggest single car factory and could potentially build 600,000 cars a year, but last broke through the 500,000 mark in 2016. Production this year will be the lowest in years even if it ramps up production again now.

      "body": "<p>British nationals who have spent months apart from non-EU spouses have expressed fears that their separation will become permanent as mass unemployment and furloughing as a result of the Covid crisis could leave them ineligible for visas.</p> <p>Vicky Scarth, 40, moved back to the UK from Sri Lanka last October to find work in order to sponsor her husband of three years, Vikum, to settle in Edinburgh with her and her six-year-old son. She secured a job that met the minimum income requirement of \u00a318,600 per year, but she was dismissed in February owing to the coronavirus outbreak and has been unable to find paid work since.</p> <p>\u201cI find myself in an impossible situation: I lost my job and can\u2019t get another one at the moment, and I don\u2019t have any childcare provision. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m on the outside looking in, completely disenfranchised,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI feel so angry that the power to decide what is right for my family has been completely taken away from me. Just because I married a Sri Lankan, I\u2019m treated with disdain by my government. All we want is to be together \u2013 we have the right to a family life.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Goodwin married a Zambian woman, Anita, eight years ago and relocated to Derby last year to begin working as an operations manager. He has since been furloughed and is concerned he will be unable to meet the financial threshold to settle his wife in the UK.</p> <p>He said: \u201cPaying for two households, with four children and two adults, is always difficult, but now it feels like I\u2019ve got a mountain to climb before they can come over. We\u2019re not criminals, we just want to live together as a family.\u201d</p> <p>Last month in <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2020-04-20/37494/\">response to a written parliamentary question</a> about whether the Home Office had considered suspending the minimum income requirement for visas during the coronavirus pandemic, the immigration minister Kevin Foster said there were \u201ca number of ways\u201d to meet the \u00a318,600 threshold. He suggested \u201cincome from the couple\u2019s investments, property rental or pension may also be taken into account, together with their cash savings.\u201d</p> <p>Caroline Coombs, from the campaign group <a href=\"https://www.reunitefamiliesuk.co.uk\">Reunite Families UK</a>, said these suggestions were \u201cabsurd\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cIt\u2019s like battling Goliath, honestly. These are the spouses and children of British citizens. The trauma of forced separation, particularly during a global pandemic, is incredibly challenging \u2013 and what\u2019s worse is, this isn\u2019t going away after lockdown.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople won\u2019t be able to get jobs, and for those who have managed to cling on to one, they\u2019re already working crazy hours to try to meet the requirements for their husband or wife to be with them. Even then, most people still can\u2019t raise the funds. The Home Office needs to bring in a blanket period of time to lower the income requirements, or get rid of them completely.\u201d</p> <p>Nineteen overseas visa application centres are due to reopen by the end of this week \u201cwhere local restrictions allow\u201d. But for spouses in countries where borders remain closed and flights grounded, the possibility of a reunion in the near future appears unlikely. </p> <p>Some couples say the lack of information has been a particular source of frustration. Owen Wibberley left South Korea in early March to begin a new job in Yorkshire, and applied for a spouse visa for his wife, Misun, to follow with their two young children, both dual British-Korean nationals.

      "bodyText": "British nationals who have spent months apart from non-EU spouses have expressed fears that their separation will become permanent as mass unemployment and furloughing as a result of the Covid crisis could leave them ineligible for visas. Vicky Scarth, 40, moved back to the UK from Sri Lanka last October to find work in order to sponsor her husband of three years, Vikum, to settle in Edinburgh with her and her six-year-old son. She secured a job that met the minimum income requirement of \u00a318,600 per year, but she was dismissed in February owing to the coronavirus outbreak and has been unable to find paid work since. \u201cI find myself in an impossible situation: I lost my job and can\u2019t get another one at the moment, and I don\u2019t have any childcare provision. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m on the outside looking in, completely disenfranchised,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so angry that the power to decide what is right for my family has been completely taken away from me. Just because I married a Sri Lankan, I\u2019m treated with disdain by my government. All we want is to be together \u2013 we have the right to a family life.\u201d Paul Goodwin married a Zambian woman, Anita, eight years ago and relocated to Derby last year to begin working as an operations manager. He has since been furloughed and is concerned he will be unable to meet the financial threshold to settle his wife in the UK. He said: \u201cPaying for two households, with four children and two adults, is always difficult, but now it feels like I\u2019ve got a mountain to climb before they can come over. We\u2019re not criminals, we just want to live together as a family.\u201d Last month in response to a written parliamentary question about whether the Home Office had considered suspending the minimum income requirement for visas during the coronavirus pandemic, the immigration minister Kevin Foster said there were \u201ca number of ways\u201d to meet the \u00a318,600 threshold. He suggested \u201cincome from the couple\u2019s investments, property rental or pension may also be taken into account, together with their cash savings.\u201d Caroline Coombs, from the campaign group Reunite Families UK, said these suggestions were \u201cabsurd\u201d. She said: \u201cIt\u2019s like battling Goliath, honestly. These are the spouses and children of British citizens. The trauma of forced separation, particularly during a global pandemic, is incredibly challenging \u2013 and what\u2019s worse is, this isn\u2019t going away after lockdown. \u201cPeople won\u2019t be able to get jobs, and for those who have managed to cling on to one, they\u2019re already working crazy hours to try to meet the requirements for their husband or wife to be with them. Even then, most people still can\u2019t raise the funds. The Home Office needs to bring in a blanket period of time to lower the income requirements, or get rid of them completely.\u201d Nineteen overseas visa application centres are due to reopen by the end of this week \u201cwhere local restrictions allow\u201d. But for spouses in countries where borders remain closed and flights grounded, the possibility of a reunion in the near future appears unlikely. Some couples say the lack of information has been a particular source of frustration. Owen Wibberley left South Korea in early March to begin a new job in Yorkshire, and applied for a spouse visa for his wife, Misun, to follow with their two young children, both dual British-Korean nationals. Misun\u2019s passport is currently being held at a closed visa application centre in Seoul. \u201cThe worst part is not knowing the result of the visa application,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have informed us that a decision has been made but not what the result is. If it has been rejected then we will have spent all this additional time separated for no reason. At least if they could tell us the result then we could make more concrete plans regarding housing and major purchases, but being in a total state of limbo is infuriating.\u201d Colin Yeo, an immigration lawyer, said the government\u2019s limited communication on the issue since the lockdown started was unacceptable. \u201cThe deafening silence from the Home Office is causing huge anxiety for affected couples at what is already a really worrying time. Families need to know whether they are going to have to separate or whether new rules will be introduced enabling them to stay together. We\u2019ve seen all sorts of other non-urgent policy immigration announcements recently, so it is baffling that families are being ignored in this way.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said it had taken a \u201ccompassionate and pragmatic approach\u201d to the spouse visa application process during the pandemic. \u201cFamily immigration requirements are being kept under review, including the minimum income requirement, and we will publish further guidance shortly,\u201d they said. \u201cSome visa application centres overseas have reopened with social distancing in place, meaning that passports can be returned and people can now supply biometric information or supporting documents for their visas.\u201d",

One week later, another 30 masks had washed up. \u201cAnd that\u2019s on an uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere.\u201d Curious to see how far the masks had travelled, he began checking other nearby beaches. \u201cWe\u2019re finding them everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cEver since society started wearing masks, the cause and effects are being seen on the beaches.\u201d While some of the debris could be attributed to carelessness, he speculated that the lightweight masks were at times also being carried from land, boats and landfills by the wind. \u201cIt\u2019s just another item of marine debris,\u201d he said, likening the masks to plastic bags or straws that often wash up on the city\u2019s more remote shorelines. \u201cIt\u2019s no better, no worse, just another item we\u2019re leaving as a legacy to the next generation.\u201d Still, given the likelihood that porpoises and dolphins in the region could mistake a mask for food, he was bracing himself for a grim find. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly getting them washing up dead and we\u2019re just waiting for a necropsy when we find a mask inside,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic has triggered the most widespread global economic meltdown since at least 1870 and risks fuelling a dramatic rise in poverty levels around the globe, the World Bank has warned. In a report the Washington-based organisation said the highest share of countries in 150 years would enter recessions at the same time. As many as 90% of the 183 economies it examined are expected to suffer from falling levels of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, even more than the 85% of nations suffering from recession during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Issuing the assessment in its half-yearly Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report, the organisation said the fall in world GDP would be the steepest since the second world war. Dramatically cutting its growth expectations, the World Bank said it expected global GDP to shrink by 5.2% this year, in an economic decline more than twice as deep as the recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. Sounding the alarm over the hit for poorer nations in particular, the body which provides loans and grants to developing and emerging economies to help tackle poverty, said it expected the first annual increase in net global poverty levels in more than two decades. Economic activity among advanced economies is anticipated to shrink 7% this year as domestic demand and supply, trade, and finance is severely disrupted by the spread of the disease and lockdown measures used to contain it. By contrast, nations where tough restrictions have not been used as much to tackle the virus and where government safety nets aren\u2019t as extensive, GDP levels are expected to shrink by 2.5%. The World Bank said this would mark the first annual decline for these countries as a group in at least 60 years. Incomes per head are expected to decline by 3.6% around the world, which the organisation warned would tip millions of people into extreme poverty this year. The World Bank warned last month that the pandemic would push 60 million people into extreme poverty this year, although it is understood that the body plans to drastically increase this estimate in a report due in a matter of weeks. Putting the scale of the current economic collapse in context, the World Bank said the Covid-19 crash was on-track to rank as the fourth-worst global recession out of 14 in the past 150 years. Since 1870, it has only been surpassed in terms of severity by crises at the outbreak of the first world war in 1914, the Great Depression in 1930-32 and after the demobilisation of troops following the second world war in 1945-46. \u201cThis is a deeply sobering outlook, with the crisis likely to leave long-lasting scars and pose major global challenges,\u201d said Ceyla Pazarbasioglu, vice president for equitable growth, finance and institutions at the World Bank. \u201cOur first order of business is to address the global health and economic emergency. Beyond that, the global community must unite to find ways to rebuild as robust a recovery as possible to prevent more people from falling into poverty and unemployment.\u201d Assuming lockdown measures are lifted from the middle of this year, global growth is forecast to rebound to 4.2% in 2021. However, the World Bank warned the risk from a more protracted pandemic, financial market upheaval and firms retreating from global supply chains could trigger an even bigger crash in world GDP this year of about 8%, followed by a sluggish recovery in 2021 of little more than 1%. Faced with the heightened risk of a prolonged and painful crisis, Ayhan Kose, the World Bank\u2019s prospects group director, said countries and organisations ought to stand ready to deploy further measures to support people and businesses. \u201cIf the past is any guide, there may be further growth downgrades in store,\u201d he said.",

If it fails, it\u2019s an NHS failure; if it works, it\u2019s a success for private enterprise. Dr Martin J Schwarz Oldham, Greater Manchester \u2022 You state that Serco wants to \u201ccement the position\u201d of the private sector in the NHS (NHS test-and-trace system \u2018not fully operational until September\u2019, 4 June). When I was a governor of an NHS trust, Serco provided our back-office functions. The service was so dire that the contract was not renewed. Ian Arnott Peterborough \u2022 Last Friday, I received a text from the North Bristol NHS trust informing me that my Covid-19 antibody test taken on the previous Monday was negative. This could have been useful were it not for the fact that I live in London and had taken no such test. Dr Richard Barras London \u2022 Alok Sharma, the business secretary, got his test results back in 24 hours (Report, 4 June). It\u2019s obvious we have a world-class system.

      "bodyText": "Lewis Hamilton has supported unequivocally the actions of protesters who pulled down the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol. Hamilton is the only black driver in Formula One and has been outspoken in his condemnation of the killing of George Floyd and his support for the Black Lives Matter movement. Hamilton also condemned the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, insisting the UK deserves better leaders. Last week Hamilton called out his fellow drivers for staying silent on the Floyd killing and then said he had been overcome with rage at events in the US. On Monday the six-time world champion posted on Instagram that he believed the protestors in Bristol had done the right thing and insisted Colston\u2019s statue should be left where it was after being thrown into the harbour. \u201cIf those people hadn\u2019t taken down that statue honouring a racist slave trader, it would never have been removed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s talks of it going into a museum.

Brawn also confirmed that F1 was proactively addressing diversity. The sport was committed to changing grassroots racing in order to encourage the entry of minority groups into F1. \u201cWe are looking at how we can have a really, really basic karting initiative to get kids involved at a very early stage,\u201d he said. \u201cF1 is a meritocracy but we can give greater opportunity to minority and ethnic groups to get involved in motor sport.

He asked Patel if she would back a desecration of war memorials bill. Patel replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I completely support the sentiment and the point [Gullis] has just made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Earlier she said the \u201chooliganism\u201d of a minority of people attending the protests at the weekend was \u201cutterly indefensible\u201d.

Like Patel and other government colleagues, he condemned the violence. But he was better at expressing what sounded like genuine commitment to the ongoing cause of building \u201ca better society\u201d.

Eshalomi said her son turned three yesterday. She said she did not want to have to wait until he was a teenager before there were changes in this country. Action was needed now, she said.</p> \n  <p>Patel said she had been clear about the level of injustice felt across the country. She went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m really really saddened that [Eshalomi] has effectively said that this government doesn\u2019t understand racial inequality.</p> \n   <p>Well, on that basis, it must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband\u2019s in order to advance her career.</p> \n   <p>A different home secretary recently characterised ... in the Guardian newspaper as a fat cow with a ring through its nose, something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously. [Patel was referring to <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/08/guardian-print-racist-cartoon-showing-priti-patel-bull-12366971/\">a Steve Bell cartoon.]</a></p> \n   <p>So when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance or social justice, I will not take lectures from the other side of the house.</p> \n   <p>I have already said repeatedly there is no place for racism in our country or in society. And sadly too many people are too willing, too casually, to dismiss the contributions of those who don\u2019t necessarily confirm to pre-conceived views or ideas about how ethnic minorities should behave or think. This ... in my view is racist in itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In some respects Patel\u2019s argument echoed that made by another BAME minister, the equalities minister <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, in a Twitter thread at the weekend. Here is one of her posts.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1269635715794690055\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I won\u2019t be bullied into silence because I\u2019m not conforming to the stereotype that all black people must be on the left or they are race traitors.

Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions.

And there are many, many examples throughout history \u2013 from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, protests on behalf of gay rights \u2013 men and women following these people have been prepared to break the law because they believe that the issue of justice, that they wanted to shine a light on, is a bigger project.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He called for more statues of people like slave traders to be removed.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m afraid the time has come in the United Kingdom to look at these statues and say is it now right to celebrate these people who murdered so many men, women and children.

It explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain.

We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%.</p> \n   <p>We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected. We found that while reported estimates vary between surveys because of differences in wording or in how the survey was completed, chronic loneliness does not seem to have changed significantly as a result of lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>People experiencing chronic loneliness or \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d were also likely to score less well on three of the key measures used to measure wellbeing (ie, happiness), as this chart shows.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6371344952cf91c777642e2013d393b84315c042/0_0_1278_1226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"959\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relationship between loneliness and wellbeing</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ONS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T11:03:24.412Z\">at 12.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede03b68f083999a26dc127\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:24:30.978Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/681f23f8b28bbd55d1120dcf6dbf5bc5746e0662/0_0_2333_3500/667.jpg\" alt=\"The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The empty plinth in Bristol this morning where the statue of Edward Colston stood until yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eddfb5c8f083999a26dc0e1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T09:21:14.070Z\">10.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Starmer's LBC phone-in - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Labour leader, at PMQs and elsewhere, <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> seems to be adopting a strategy of presenting himself as Westminster\u2019s responsible adult, or designated driver \u2013 the leader offering mainstream, sensible, evidence-based politics. He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan.</p> \n  <p>He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.</strong> Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that.</p> \n   <p>But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue.</p> \n   <p>A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum.</p> \n   <p>This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran.

      "bodyText": "Priti Patel, the home secretary, has said she backs the idea of a new law to make it easier to prosecute people who damage war memorials. She was speaking in the Commons during a statement on the Black Lives Matters protests and responding to the Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis who said residents in his Stoke-on-Trent North constituency were \u201coutraged\u201d at the Cenotaph graffiti and attempts to burn the Union flag. He asked Patel if she would back a desecration of war memorials bill. Patel replied: I completely support the sentiment and the point [Gullis] has just made. Earlier she said the \u201chooliganism\u201d of a minority of people attending the protests at the weekend was \u201cutterly indefensible\u201d. (See 5.16pm.) Patel said that she would not \u201ctake lectures\u201d from the opposition about racism because she had been a victim of it herself. (See 5.42pm.) She made the comment in response to claims that her hardline opening statement implied that she did not fully understand the anger felt by people about structural racism in Britain. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, adopted a more empathetic tone in his own statement about the protests. Like Patel and other government colleagues, he condemned the violence. But he was better at expressing what sounded like genuine commitment to the ongoing cause of building \u201ca better society\u201d. (See 4.45pm.) Sir Keir Starmer has said that it was \u201ctotally wrong\u201d for BLM protesters in Bristol to pull down the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol yesterday. The toppling of the Colston statue has emboldened those seeking to replace other monuments or names associated with the slave trade or imperialism. In Oxford the campaign to get rid of a statute of Cecil Rhodes has been revived. In Bristol the Colston\u2019s girls\u2019 school has taken down its own Colston statute, and the Colston Hall is removing external signage ahead of a formal name change later this year. (See 3.23pm.) That is all from me for today. There is more politics coverage on our UK coronavirus live blog, which has been covering Matt Hancock at the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. And for the latest on the Black Lives Matters protests in America, here is our US live blog. This is from the Labour MP Nadia Whittome on Priti Patel\u2019s response to Florence Eshalomi earlier. (See 5.42pm.) Dawn Butler, the former shadow women and equalities minister, has gone to the police after being threatened with a torrent of violent and racist abuse for defending the Black Lives Matter protests, my colleague Kate Proctor reports. Although Priti Patel\u2019s comments in her opening statement about understanding the \u201cdeep-seated desire for change\u201d felt by the BLM protesters were overshadowed by her uncompromising rhetoric about the \u201cthugs and criminals\u201d who were a minority at the demonstrations (see 5.16pm), a few minutes later she got the chance to powerfully state her opposition to racism. It came when she was responding to the Labour MP Florence Eshalomi, who suggested that Patel did not understand the anger felt by people, particularly the young, and their desire for action to tackle structural racism. Eshalomi said her son turned three yesterday. She said she did not want to have to wait until he was a teenager before there were changes in this country. Action was needed now, she said. Patel said she had been clear about the level of injustice felt across the country. She went on: I\u2019m really really saddened that [Eshalomi] has effectively said that this government doesn\u2019t understand racial inequality. Well, on that basis, it must have been a very different home secretary who as a child was frequently called a Paki in the playground, a very different home secretary who was racially abused in the streets or even advised to drop her surname and use her husband\u2019s in order to advance her career. A different home secretary recently characterised ... in the Guardian newspaper as a fat cow with a ring through its nose, something that was not only racist but offensive, both culturally and religiously. [Patel was referring to a Steve Bell cartoon.] So when it comes to racism, sexism, tolerance or social justice, I will not take lectures from the other side of the house. I have already said repeatedly there is no place for racism in our country or in society. And sadly too many people are too willing, too casually, to dismiss the contributions of those who don\u2019t necessarily confirm to pre-conceived views or ideas about how ethnic minorities should behave or think. This ... in my view is racist in itself. In some respects Patel\u2019s argument echoed that made by another BAME minister, the equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, in a Twitter thread at the weekend. Here is one of her posts. Here are more quotes from Priti Patel\u2019s opening statement. After a measured start, it soon ended up sounding like conventional Home Office hardlinerism. She told MPs: As the ugly tally of officer assaults show, some protesters regrettably turned to violence and abusive behaviour at the weekend. This hooliganism is utterly indefensible. There is no justification for it. There is no excuse for pelting flares at brave officers, throwing bikes at police horses, attempting to disrespect the Cenotaph or vandalising the statue of Winston Churchill, one of the greatest protectors of our freedoms who has ever lived. It\u2019s not for mobs to tear down statues and cause criminal damage in our streets, and it is not acceptable for thugs to racially abuse black police officers for doing their jobs. The criminals responsible for these unlawful and reckless acts are betraying the very cause they purport to serve. These protests are about injustice but by attacking our courageous police, they are acting in a wholly unjust way ... To the quiet law-abiding majority who are appalled by this violence and have continued to live their lives within the rules, I hear you. To the police who have been subject to the most dreadful abuse, you have my full backing as you act proportionately, fairly and courageously to maintain law and order. To the criminal minority who have subverted this cause with their thuggery, I simply say this: your behaviour is shameful and you will face justice. Here is a video clip from Priti Patel\u2019s opening statement. Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, is responding for Labour. He says he does not approve of the way the Edward Colston statue was torn down. But he says he is pleased to see it gone. He says we have heard many accounts of the damage done by racism. Now is not the time for \u201cdivisive rhetoric\u201d, he tells Patel. UPDATE: Here is more from Thomas-Symond\u2019s speech. He said: We cannot allow this moment of global demand for justice to pass without action and we on these benches will be at the forefront of calls for change. What is never the solution, though, is violence and vandalism. The vast majority of protesters are peaceful, but some of the actions we have seen from a minority are unacceptable. I condemn those who have attacked the police and I want to pay tribute to the police officers putting themselves in harm\u2019s way over the weekend. Patel says there were 200 protests over the weekend. In total, 137,500 people have attended protests, she says. Most were peaceful. But a minority of protesters were violent. In London 35 officers have been injured. The \u201cthugs and criminals\u201d are being arrested. Patel says 135 people have been arrested following the weekend protests. She says there is no excuse for what happened. It is not acceptable for criminals to tear down statues, or to racially abuse police officers, she says. She says she said she would back the police when she became home secretary. She says she could not be clearer: \u201cI want to see the violent minority responsible arrested and brought to justice.\u201d Patel says she was \u201csickened\u201d by George Floyd\u2019s death. She says she understands why people wanted to protest about it. Racism has no part in our society, she says. And she says the government understands the importance of the right to protest. In normal circumstances there would be no problem with a protest like this going ahead, she says. But these are not normal circumstances. Large gatherings are unlawful to stop the spread of coronavirus. The pandemic has already cost more than 40,000 lives. Protesting like this puts people\u2019s lives at risk. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has just started making her Commons statement on the Black Lives Matter protests. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has issued this statement about the weekend Black Lives Matter protests. As well as being well outside the remit of his Treasury brief, it is unusually well crafted (with vague echoes of Martin Luther King) and infinitely more empathetic than the line coming out of Downing Street today (see 10.50am and 1.46pm.) It will, for course, do nothing to quell speculation that he has ambitions to one day achieve an even more senior leadership post. Here is more on the campaign to get the statue of Henry Dundas taken down in Edinburgh. Dundas was a prominent opponent of the abolition of slavery. The statue has recently attracted protest grafitti. The lord mayor of Cardiff, Dan De\u2019Ath, has called for the statue of the former governor of Trinidad, Thomas Picton, to be removed from the city council\u2019s marble hall. In a letter to Cardiff council, De\u2019Ath wrote: Picton oversaw an authoritarian and highly brutal regime. Picton was placed on trial in 1806 for ordering the illegal torture of a 14-year-old mixed race girl. Picton was convicted but the conviction was later overturned. Picton was also accused of the execution of a dozen slaves and his fortune was due in a large part to the slave trade. I feel that it is no longer acceptable for Picton\u2019s statue to be amongst the \u201cheroes of Wales\u201d in city hall and I am calling on you to arrange for its removal from the marble hall. Asked about the letter, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said: I know the lord mayor of Cardiff very well, I know he will have thought carefully before he wrote such a letter and I hope and am confident that Cardiff council will respond to that in a careful and considered way and understanding the changed context in which we are living. Separately, more than 1,000 people have signed a petition demanding that a monument to Picton be removed from Carmarthen in south-west Wales. According to a snap YouGov poll, only 13% of people approve of the way the Edward Colston statue was taken down. But another 40% of people would like it to have been removed legitimately, the poll suggests. The dramatic toppling of a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston at a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol has reignited the campaign to remove a statue of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes at Oxford University, my colleague Aamna Mohdin reports. Several Conservative MPs from the Blue Collar Conservatism caucus at Westminster joined the effort to clean graffiti from the statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square. One of them was Peter Gibson MP. The slogan \u201cwas a racist\u201d was daubed on the plinth. While obviously disrespectful, and damaging to a much-loved national monument, this was not actually wrong. The historian Andrew Roberts is now seen as an establishment Tory, but he made his name in 1994 with a brilliant and iconoclastic book called Eminent Churchillians which included a chapter on Churchill and race. The opening paragraph was a cracker. It said: It was during the premiership of Winston Churchill 40 years ago that Britain took her first steps towards becoming a multi-racial society. This is not without a certain irony, as although racist views were almost universally held until around the end of the 1950s, Churchill was more profoundly racist than most. The Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has used a series of Instagram posts to back the toppling of the Edward Colston statue. It should be left in the water, and replaced with a memorial to the slaves he sold, Hamilton says. Back in the Commons, asked if she agrees that statues of white men who enslaved others should be removed, Priti Patel, the home secretary, said decisions like this should be taken democratically within the law. The music venue Colston Hall in Bristol has issued a statement today confirming its intention to change its name. The plan to abandon the Colston name (derived from Edward Colston) was originally announced three years ago, and a new name was due to be unveiled this spring, as part of a development of the building. The work has been held up because of the coronavirus crisis, the statement says. It goes on: We aim to announce a new name that is right for both the hall and the city in autumn 2020. There are a number of steps we need to take between now and then, but as a demonstration of our commitment, one of these will be removing the external signage from the building. And here\u2019s the start of a Twitter thread from the historian and broadcaster Kate Williams on the toppling of the Edward Colston statue. Colston\u2019s girls\u2019 school in Bristol, named after the slave trader Edward Colston, has removed its own statue of Colston from display, according to the Bristol Post. David Olusoga, the historian and broadcaster, has written a terrific article for the Guardian about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. Here is an excerpt. The fact that a man who died 299 years ago is today on the front pages of most of Britain\u2019s newspapers suggests that Bristol has not been brilliant at coming to terms with its history. Despite the valiant and persistent efforts of campaigners, all attempts to have the statue peacefully removed were thwarted by Colston\u2019s legion of defenders. In 2019, attempts to fix a plaque to the pedestal collapsed after Bristol\u2019s Society of Merchant Venturers, the high priests of the Colston cult, insisted on watering down the text, adding qualifications that, it was felt, had the effect of minimising his crimes. Yet what repulsed many about the statue was not that it valorised Colston but that it was silent about his victims, those whose lives were destroyed to build the fortune he lavished upon the city \u2026 Today is the first full day since 1895 on which the effigy of a mass murderer does not cast its shadow over Bristol\u2019s city centre. Those who lament the dawning of this day, and who are appalled by what happened on Sunday, need to ask themselves some difficult questions. Do they honestly believe that Bristol was a better place yesterday because the figure of a slave trader stood at its centre? Are they genuinely unable \u2013 even now \u2013 to understand why those descended from Colston\u2019s victims have always regarded his statue as an outrage and for decades pleaded for its removal? And here is the full article. Here is Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, explaining to ITV why, as a descendent of Jamaicans, he found the Edward Colston statue so offensive. But there is a difference between understanding why people wanted to tear it down and condoning that, he explains. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is taking questions in the Commons now. In response to the first question, from the acting Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, Patel rules out abandoning the \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d rule that prevents many migrants from accessing benefits as a visa condition. She claims other forms of support are available. Joanna Cherry, the SNP\u2019s justice and home affairs spokesperson, says this policy disproportionately affects BAME people. Patel says she does not accept it is discriminatory. And she claims a plethora of other forms of support are available. The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has a transcript of what happened at the No 10 lobby briefing, where the prime minister\u2019s spokesman repeatedly dodged questions about whether or not the PM favoured the removal of statues of people like Edward Colston. And here is the full statement from the Metropolitan police on the numbers of people arrested and officers injured in yesterday\u2019s protest in London. It says: A total of 36 people were arrested during protests on Sunday 7 June for offences including violent disorder, criminal damage and assaulting police. A large number of people joined demonstrations that were largely peaceful and left central London after the event. However, a number remained in the area around Whitehall and behaved antisocially before becoming violent towards officers. Police used a variety of tactics including containment to tackle several violent and antisocial groups before dispersing the final protesters at around 02:00hrs on Monday 8 June. By the early hours of today 35 officers reported suffering injuries. Two of these officers required hospital treatment, one after suffering a head wound and the second with a shoulder injury after a bottle was thrown. Investigations are under way into a number of incidents including criminal damage to a statue, and other sites and buildings of national importance - officers are seeking to identify those responsible. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman was asked about the PM\u2019s views on yesterday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. Here are the main points. The spokesman said Boris Johnson viewed the removal of the Edward Colston statue as a \u201ccriminal act\u201d. Asked about the PM\u2019s view of what happened in Bristol, the spokesman said: The PM\u2019s view is that in this country, where there is strong opinion, there is a democratic process which should be followed. People can campaign for the removal of a statue but what happened yesterday was a criminal act and when the criminal law is broken that is unacceptable and the police will want to hold to account those responsible. The PM absolutely understands the strength of feeling, but in this country we settle our differences democratically and if people wanted the removal of the statue there are democratic routes which can be followed. The spokesman refused to say whether Boris Johnson thought statues of other people involved in the slave trade should be removed. And although the spokesman criticised the way the Colston statue was taken down, he would not say whether or not the PM wanted it to be put back up. The spokesman said Johnson did not think the UK was a racist country. Asked if the PM thought it was, the spokesman said: The PM doesn\u2019t doubt that there continues to be discrimination and racism but does not agree that this is a racist country. We have made very significant progress on this issue but there remains more to do and we will not be complacent in our efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination where it happens. The spokesman said that Johnson had been briefed on the protests yesterday by Cressida Dick, commissioner of the Metropolitan police in London. And the spokesman said Priti Patel, the home secretary, had been getting daily briefings from the Met and other forces, including Avon and Somerset police. From Sky\u2019s home affairs correspondent, Mark White In Edinburgh a placard has been attached to the statue of the philosopher David Hume drawing attention to his racism. It features a Hume quote saying: \u201cI am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the whites.\u201d Hume was a leading philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment in the 18th century. He is still generally revered as a thinker, although increasing focus on his racist views has led to his reputation being reconsidered. These are from the Conservative MP Claire Coutinho on yesterday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police, has posted a video message on Twitter defending his officers\u2019 decisions not to intervene when Black Lives Matters protesters tore down the Edward Colston statue yesterday and dumped it in the water. He said that if the police had got involved, they would have provoked \u201ca very violent confrontation\u201d. He said: I wanted to speak to you about the policing of the protest in Bristol over the weekend. We went to lengths before the protests to caution people against attending because of the risk of spreading Covid. But as expected, people turned up and there was a crowd of over 10,000. Midway through the protest we saw CCTV images in our control room of people on top of the Colston statue. Within two minutes that statue had been pulled down. We had deployed officers to respond to take appropriate action but the commanders on the ground made the decision not to intervene. To arrest suspects would likely lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers and people who were not involved in damaging property being thrown into a very violent confrontation with the police that could have had serious ramifications for the city of Bristol and beyond. Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade? I think there would have been very serious implications and whilst I certainly do not condone crime or damage of any sort, I fully support the actions of my officers. They responded with common sense, sound judgment and in the best interest of public safety. In an interview with Emma Barnett on Radio 5 Live the former Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson said that the police should arrest those responsible for bringing down the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. What happened amounted to \u201cmob rule\u201d, he implied. He told the programme: Personally I\u2019m not going to shed a tear for that statue. Personally I regard the history surrounding it as completely disgusting, but \u2026 I find mob rule very disturbing indeed, and if we\u2019re going to let it go this time, where is it going to go next? Who is going to be taken on, what\u2019s going to be toppled, who is going to take these decisions into their own hands, regardless of the views of other people? Asked if those responsible should be arrested and punished, he said they should. He explained: Because otherwise, you\u2019re just giving the green light for the same sort of action and mob rule that anyone else wants to do, take the law into their own hands, and do as they please. I mean, that\u2019s the law of the jungle, isn\u2019t it? Avon and Somerset police have said they made a tactical decision not to intervene yesterday when the Edward Colston statue was toppled, dragged through the city and dumped in the water. No arrests were made but officers are now collating footage of people filmed taking part in the action. According to BBC Bristol, 17 people have already been identified by police in relation to the incident. Bristol city council says it is keeping all the signs left at yesterday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest in the city for display in the museum. We\u2019ve split our UK live blogs this morning to reflect the fact that there are two big stories running that have relatively little overlap. This blog will now be focusing predominantly on the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests, including Priti Patel\u2019s statement later in the Commons. And my colleague Matthew Weaver will be covering all the latest coronavirus developments on a UK coronavirus live blog. Here is David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, speaking on Good Morning Britain this morning about the pulling down of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol yesterday. While Lammy just about stayed within the parameters of the Labour line set out by Sir Keir Starmer on LBC (disapproval of the means used by the protesters, but support for their intent \u2013 see 10.21am), he sounded (understandably) far more supportive towards them. Here are two of his main points. Lammy said the people who pulled down the Edward Colston statue were following in the tradition of great civil rights protesters like Martin Luther King and the suffragettes. He explained: We have a tradition in our country of protest. We\u2019ve had great men and women, people like Emmeline Pankhurst and the suffragettes, who have faced imprisonment because of their protests. I\u2019m quite sure that those young people who brought that statue down knew that they would be facing the law. But that was a price that they were prepared to pay. And there are many, many examples throughout history \u2013 from Martin Luther King to Harvey Milk, protests on behalf of gay rights \u2013 men and women following these people have been prepared to break the law because they believe that the issue of justice, that they wanted to shine a light on, is a bigger project. He called for more statues of people like slave traders to be removed. He said: I\u2019m afraid the time has come in the United Kingdom to look at these statues and say is it now right to celebrate these people who murdered so many men, women and children. There may be a role for statues such as this in museums, where there is proper context \u2026 but when we put statues up, we are saying these are beloved figures. In the Commons this afternoon there will be an urgent question on the reproduction number, R, followed by a statement from Priti Patel, the home secretary, on public disorder. A petition to rename a street in Northern Ireland named after a prominent 19th century slavery advocate has gathered steam on social media. By Monday morning more than 620 people had signed the request on change.org asking authorities in Newry to rename John Mitchel Place, which honours a hero of Irish nationalism who went on to champion slavery in the United States. Newry also has a statue of Mitchel. \u201cIs a street named after a racist really the reflection we want shone on Newry in this modern, multicultural society?\u201d asked the petition organiser, Padraig Mac Cionnaith. Mitchel grew up in Newry and became a leader of Young Ireland, a group that campaigned against British rule. He was deported in 1848 to a penal colony in Australia and escaped to the US, where he urged Americans to take pride in slavery. Mac Cionnaith suggested authorities rename the street Equality Place or after the goalkeeper Pat Jennings or even Luv Bug, a Newry pop group which represented Ireland in the 1986 Eurovision. Several GAA sports clubs around Ireland are named after Mitchel. Several people on Twitter urged the clubs to change their name. Here are two contrasting Labour/left views on Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s comment about the toppling of the Colston statue. From Kerry-Anne Mendoza, editor of the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting website, the Canary From David Clark, a former special adviser to Robin Cook This is from Priti Patel, the home secretary. Patel\u2019s line about the demonstrations being \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d is a direct quote from what Boris Johnson said on this in his own tweet last night. More than 7m people in Britain have suffered from \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d, according to the Office for National Statistics. In a report out this morning, the ONS said that in the first month of the lockdown 7.4m people reported that within the past seven days their wellbeing had been affected by their being lonely. But levels of \u201cchronic loneliness\u201d \u2013 defined as when people say they are lonely often or always - were about the same as before the lockdown, the ONS said. It explained: From 3 April to 3 May 2020, 5.0% of people said they feel lonely \u201coften or always\u201d, around 2.6m people across Great Britain. Throughout this release we refer to this group as \u201cchronically lonely\u201d. During the same period, 30.9% of those asked said their wellbeing had been affected through feeling lonely in the past seven days, around 7.4m people across Great Britain. We refer to this group as \u201clockdown lonely\u201d. If we adjusted this to be representative of the entire Great British population this would be equivalent to 14.3%. We investigated measures of loneliness from a range of sources to see whether people are more or less lonely since the lockdown began, and who is most affected. We found that while reported estimates vary between surveys because of differences in wording or in how the survey was completed, chronic loneliness does not seem to have changed significantly as a result of lockdown. People experiencing chronic loneliness or \u201clockdown loneliness\u201d were also likely to score less well on three of the key measures used to measure wellbeing (ie, happiness), as this chart shows. As Labour leader, at PMQs and elsewhere, Sir Keir Starmer seems to be adopting a strategy of presenting himself as Westminster\u2019s responsible adult, or designated driver \u2013 the leader offering mainstream, sensible, evidence-based politics. He may be a disappointment to anyone yearning for some Corbynite passion and radicalism, but even supporters of Boris Johnson\u2019s government would have to admit that gravitas, experience and competence have not been its defining characteristics, and so Starmer has arguable spotted a gap in the market. In this, his first LBC phone-in, he was at it again \u2013 repeatedly stressing his desire for consensus and cooperation. He was strikingly non-partisan. He also sounded very different from his predecessor. During the Labour leadership contest he mostly played down the obvious differences between his politics and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s. But the gap between them is considerable, as was well demonstrated by what Starmer said about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol. It is hard to imagine Corbyn describing what happened as \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d. Here are the main points. Starmer said that, although the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol should have been removed years go, the manner in which it was pulled down was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d. Asked for his reaction to what happened yesterday, Starmer said: It shouldn\u2019t be done in that way. Completely wrong to pull a statue down like that. But, stepping back, that statue should have been taken down a long, long time ago. You can\u2019t, in 21st-century Britain, have a slaver on a statue. A statue is there to honour people. And you can\u2019t have that in 21st-century Britain. That statue should have been brought down properly with consent and put, I would say, in a museum. This was a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves, including women and children who were branded on their chests with the name of the company that he ran. Of the 100,000, 20,000 died en route and they were chucked in the sea. He defended the decision of the police in Bristol not to intervene. He said: I was very struck by Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was the police officer, the superintendent, on the ground who judged the situation. And he said he was really disappointed by the vandalism and the bringing down of the statue. But he didn\u2019t think it was the right thing to intervene, because it might make the situation worse. He said the Labour MP Barry Gardiner was wrong to attend a Black Lives Matter rally, in breach of social distancing guidelines. Asked about this, he said Gardiner was \u201cwrong to do it\u201d and that MPs had to lead by example. Starmer suggested that the government\u2019s 14-day quarantine scheme for new arrivals at airports should be replaced with a testing system for people coming to the country. He said the government\u2019s furlough system should be made more flexible, with increased support for workers in particular sectors. He said he considered \u201cthe leave/remain divide is over\u201d. He refused to back calls for the post-Brexit transition to be extended. But he said he wanted to avoid a no deal. International travellers arriving in Scotland will face fines of up to \u00a3480 or prosecution for failing to meet new rules on self-quarantine and location reporting being introduced today. The measures, introduced by the Scottish government to match similar rules announced for England last month, are less punitive than those for travellers arriving at English airports, ports and train stations. All overseas travellers from outside the common travel area with Ireland, the Channel Islands and Isle of Man whose destination is in Scotland will be expected to fill out an online form stating where they will self-isolate for 14 days. Under regulations being introduced in the Scottish parliament today, failing or refusing to fill out that form will incur a fixed penalty of \u00a360 from the Border Force rising to \u00a3480 for persistent refusals, while breaching the quarantine will result in a \u00a3480 fine. Persistent breaches could lead to prosecution and a maximum fine of \u00a35,000. In England and Northern Ireland, the first fine for failing to provide a self-quarantine address is \u00a3100 rising to \u00a31,000 for those who fail to self-isolate. In England, the maximum penalty for breaching the quarantine is \u00a310,000. There are no commercial flights operating from Welsh airports, and the Welsh government refers international travellers to the UK government\u2019s regulations. Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, said the lower fines reflected Scotland\u2019s different legal system, which required fines above \u00a3500 to follow prosecution by a procurator fiscal rather than be issued by police. The Scottish tourism industry has, alongside airlines, protested vigorously against the proposed regulations, arguing it will damage tourism and the recovery of their businesses. Nicola Sturgeon said last week her government had been checking its rules were compatible with European human rights legislation before introducing them. Yousaf said: We are, as a country and across the world, continuing to deal with unprecedented challenges that this pandemic brings. These public health measures will play an important part in helping to prevent further spread of the disease. These steps are aimed at protecting people and ensuring that we limit spread when our own infection rates are falling. However, they are temporary and will not be in place any longer than deemed necessary to protect public health \u2013 as such, they will be reviewed after three weeks. Q: You supported Jeremy Corbyn, and did not stand up for the Jewish community when he was Labour leader? Starmer says he reached out to the Jewish community as soon as he became leader. He is asking them to give him the space. I will kick antisemites out of the Labour party. Q: And you are not opposed to the Equality and Human Rights Commission investigation into Labour? No, says Starmer. He says he campaigned to set the EHRC up. He will read the report and implement its recommendations. Q: Are you called Keir after Keir Hardie (one of the Labour party founders)? Yes, says Starmer. But he says he cannot take credit for that; it was not his decision. And that\u2019s it. The phone-in is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What is your policy on Europe now? Starmer starts by saying he is determined to root out antisemitism in Labour. (The caller mentioned that she is Jewish.) He says the UK has left the EU. \u201cThe leave/remain divide is over,\u201d he says. He says the issue now is what the UK\u2019s relationship must be with the EU. Q: Do you want the transition to be extended? Starmer says the government says it can get a deal. Labour will hold them to that. Q: Sadiq Khan says there should be an extension. Starmer repeats the point about holding the government to account. It is important to avoid no deal. Q: So if we were facing no deal, you would extend? Starmer says Labour lost the election. It cannot decide this now. Q: How did you feel when you saw the video of George Floyd being killed? Starmer says he was \u201cgenuinely shocked\u201d. It was chilling, particularly the sight of the police officer apparently unmoved by what was happening. Q: What has happened to your constructive approach to the government? I\u2019m not seeing it. Starmer says he is trying to be constructive. He urges people to follow the government guidance. He is not seeking to undermine it at all. Labour has not been voting against the government on this. But he has also been pointing out areas where the government has got it wrong, such as on PPE, he says. He says he will continue to support the government where he can. In a crisis people do not want to see the opposition opposing the government for the sake of it. On Sunday trading, he says Labour will consider whether to back plans to relax Sunday trading laws. But he says that is not necessarily a Labour/Tory split. Q: What would Labour do for people who are shielding? Starmer says he supports extending the furlough system for workers who have to shield. The furlough system has been welcome, he says. But he says it now needs to be made more flexible. And he says the cut-off date of 10 June (the final date for new applications) should not apply to anyone who subsequently gets told they need to shield. Starmer says he has tried to cooperate with the government on getting pupils back to school. But the government has not welcomed his offer, he says. He says parents need reassurance. But he says he thinks children can go back to school safely. Q: What do you think of the decision to pull down the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol? Starmer says that \u201cshould not have been done in that way\u201d. Removing the statue like that was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, he says. But he says the statue should have been removed \u201ca long, long time ago\u201d. He refuses to criticise the police for not intervening, saying it was up to the commander on the ground to judge what action was best. Q: Should the Labour MP Barry Gardiner have attended a Black Lives Matter protest, flouting social distancing laws? No, says Starmer. He says MPs should follow the guidance. Q: If you were in power, what would you be doing to help the aviation industry? Starmer says he backs the furlough scheme, but it should be made flexible, sector by sector. He says he is constructive with the government. He wants to support them where possible. But they make it difficult, he says. He says the government did not introduce a quarantine system earlier. But now they are doing it late. And he says there are reports saying it is unworkable. He says he supports some measures. But there is \u201ca lot of inconsistency\u201d. Q: So what does Labour want? Starmer says it would be better to test people on arrival. But he says Labour has to choose in parliament between backing the quarantine system, and opposing it altogether. If they voted against it, there would be nothing in place. He does not favour that. Q: But how would testing on arrival work? There is not enough capacity. Starmer says that is a problem Labour has highlighted. But he suggests that people should be tested, with results produced within 24 hours. He questions whether that would be worse than the government\u2019s system. Q: Black people are not treated fairly in the criminal justice system. What would you do about that? Starmer says he ran the CPS for five years. There is no doubt that there is a problem. David Lammy, who is now shadow justice secretary, did a report for the government on this. Some of his recommendations have not been implemented. Q: What were they? Starmer says Lammy proposed much better training. And training is important too, he says. He says some of this is unconscious. Q: So do we have to wait for the next election? No, says Starmer. He says this should be a cross-party initiative. He says this is not the sort of change that should be reversed when a new government comes in. Q: Should officers take the knee at these protests? The caller (a police officer) says it would depend on the context. Not if the protest were violent. Starmer says he agrees. Sir Keir Starmer is starting the first of what will be a monthly phone-in on LBC. Nick Ferrari is presenting. Asked how much of a challenge it has been taking over as Labour leader, Starmer says the lockdown has made it unusual. He gave his acceptance speech from his living room, he says. Trust is everything, he says. He says he wants to listen - which is partly why he is doing the phone-in. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Matthew Weaver. Here is the agenda for what\u2019s coming up. 9am: Sir Keir Starmer hosts his new LBC phone-in. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics releases figures relating to loneliness during the pandemic. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily government briefings. 2.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, is due to take questions in the Commons. 2.45pm: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, gives evidence to the Commons procedure committee about Commons sitting arrangements post-coronavirus. After 3.30pm: MPs hold an emergency debate on the abolition of remote voting. 5pm: The UK government holds its daily briefing. Malthouse also defended the controversial new quarantine rules for travellers. It\u2019s clear from the science that we have a low infection rate it\u2019s even more important that you don\u2019t take the risk of reintroducing Covid-19. Asked to produce evidence that science backs the measures, Malthouse said: My understanding is that that that\u2019s been part of the Sage considerations \u2026 I\u2019m not a scientist but my understanding is that the science tells us that when our infection rate is low, that is the time at which you want to press home your advantage. Malthouse said it was important the quarantine rules were clear even if it meant forcing travellers from countries such as New Zealand, where there is no coronavirus, into 14 days\u2019 quarantine in the UK. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we don\u2019t take any risks about reintroducing new infection from overseas.\u201d The policing minister, Kit Malthouse, has condemned the tearing down of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol. Asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme whether the protesters\u2019 actions were right or wrong, Malthouse said: It was wrong and it was an act of criminal damage, and no doubt there will be a police investigation and prosecutions may follow. The argument about whether he should be there, memorialised in a statue, is separate from whether we allow groups of people just to go about doing as they wish. I know it\u2019s been a source of significant debate in the city for some time. But we can\u2019t condone these kinds of acts of criminal damage and vandalism and it shouldn\u2019t have happened. We have many statues across the United Kingdom, with figures from history who have good and bad attached to them. We can\u2019t just have a kind of arbitrary rule about who should or shouldn\u2019t go up, well, that\u2019s the point. Earlier, he told BBC Breakfast: \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is mobs just turning up and deciding to do whatever they feel like against the law.\u201d Malthouse stopped short of condemning Avon and Somerset police for failing to intervene to protect the statue. He told Today the force faced a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d. He added: \u201cNo doubt there will be a postmortem of the public order situation in Bristol and indeed elsewhere in the country to make sure that lessons can be learned.\u201d Lucy Moreton, professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, said Border Force staff were angered at the \u201cshambolic\u201d way the new quarantine rules had been implemented. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that technical papers explaining to staff what to check for only arrived on Friday and were still not available to those operating on the front line of the devolved administrations. Moreton said: The staff are really angry that this does appear to be very shambolic and they don\u2019t want to be blamed for that. She added that there was \u201cno provision to check the address\u201d that arrivals had given for where they would self-isolate and that the system was built on \u201ctrust\u201d. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has said the country \u201cis crying out for a leader that will seek to unite communities\u201d in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, she said: \u201cPeople are hurting so please let\u2019s seek to heal those divisions and unite people and then move forward as a country.\u201d Commenting on protesters pulling down the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, she said Vandalism is not acceptable but let\u2019s look into why that happened. People had called for many years for that statue to be removed. It was a visible symbol of slavery, nothing had happened so I will never condone vandalism but really we need to understand why that action was taken and try and do something about the discrimination that so many people in our society still feel and is very, very visible. Discussing the controversy over the statue of colonialist Cecil Rhodes in her Oxford East constituency, Dodds said: We have had a number of changes in the city over visible symbols of colonialism, we have had a lot of changes in our museums to recognise that and I think they have been very productive changes. They have led to a lot more people in the city understanding far better that appalling history of slavery and oppression. Dodds refused to say definitively whether the Rhodes statue should be removed. She said: My view is that it staying where it is without any other symbol there that would highlight what occurred during those awful times is not helpful.\u201d Some people want an opposing symbol there, you have others who want it to be removed \u2013 for me the critical thing is to listen to the black community within Oxford and those who are directly impacted by this. I am not going to seek to speak for them, I don\u2019t think that would be helpful. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary has warned that the new travel quarantine rules that come into force today will cause \u201cuntold devastation\u201d for the country\u2019s tourism industry. He told BBC Radio\u2019s 4\u2019s Today programme: What it is going to do is untold devastation, not just to the airlines but to British tourism. The thousands of hotels, the thousands of visitor attractions, restaurants in the next couple of months \u2013 July and August are the two key months for British tourism in the tourism industry. We\u2019re facing thousands of jobs losses because of a stupid, ineffective quarantine. He said Ryanair bookings were down about 50% on the same time last year but that outbound flights remained popular compared with inbound journeys, with European travellers being put off coming to the UK due to the restrictions to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Kit Malthouse, the minister for crime and policing, said protests over the weekend breach lockdown rules. Speaking on BBC Breakfast he said: We would point out to people that it is in contravention of the regulations to show up on these demonstrations and it does breach our individual responsibility towards our collective health. Asked if the lockdown regulations were now in ruins, Malthouse said: No I don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s worth remembering that the vast majority of the 65 million people in this country have been extremely compliant with the regulations. Feelings were running very high following that appalling event in the United States, and so I can understand why people might feel the need to come out onto the streets and express their frustration, anger about that event, and possibly wider issues, but we would stress to people that we do have to obey the rules. We have an individual duty towards our collective health and we have to restore that sense now, at this critical moment in our battle against this virus, just as we are starting to win. We can\u2019t see the infection rate rise again. Asked why most police officers were not wearing face masks, Malthouse said: It\u2019s for individual officers to make a dynamic risk assessment themselves about the posture they take, and about what they use the PPE. Obviously on that particular occasion officers decided, given the distance, between them and the crowds, certainly initially, that they didn\u2019t require a face mask. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said the \u201cscenes of lawlessness\u201d during anti-racist protests over the weekend were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d. Writing in the Telegraph she says: The police have our full support in tackling any violence, vandalism or disorderly behaviour. There is no excuse for throwing bikes at police horses and attacking officers. I\u2019m sure that many of those who protested peacefully will feel just as angry and frustrated by this thuggish behaviour, which does nothing but undermine their cause. Patel is due to answer questions in the Commons from around 2.30pm, according to Politico. The Police Federation, which represents all officers in England and Wales, has criticised Avon and Somerset police for its decision not to intervene in a protest in Bristol where a statue of a slave trader was torn down. John Apter, the federation\u2019s chairman, told BBC Breakfast: To have no police presence there I think sent quite a negative message. I understand there has been a lot of controversy about this statue for many years \u2013 so the question is why didn\u2019t those in the local authority consider taking it down long before rather than waiting for these actions? I am a police officer so I don\u2019t support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things. I understand the anger but not to have a police presence there was something \u2013 I have been a police officer for 27 years \u2013 that was a decision I have not seen taken before. Marvin Rees, the Labour mayor of Bristol, said he felt no \u201csense of loss\u201d after the city\u2019s statue to slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down during racial equality protests. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: As an elected politician, obviously I cannot condone the damage and I am very concerned about the implications of a mass gathering on the possibility of a second Covid wave. But I am of Jamaican heritage and I cannot pretend that I have any real sense of loss for the statue and I cannot pretend it was anything other than a personal affront to me to have it in the middle of Bristol, the city in which I grew up. Asked whether he wanted to see those involved with removing the statue charged, Rees added: That is up to the criminal justice system. I don\u2019t really intervene in criminal matters like that - that\u2019s not for me to go and be a cheerleader to the police in any criminal investigations. Rees warned that it would take more than the removal of a controversial statue to tackle racism that was \u201cstitched into the system\u201d. Welcome to our UK coronavirus live blog with all the latest on the pandemic and the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter protests. Boris Johnson, has claimed anti racist protests over the weekend were \u201csubverted by thuggery\u201d. Speaking after some protesters clashed with police in London, the prime minister said people had the right to protest but he suggested that engaging in violence was a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of the Black Lives Matter movement. The Metropolitan police\u2019s superintendent, Jo Edwards, said the \u201cscenes of violence and disorder\u201d were \u201centirely unacceptable\u201d. Meanwhile, controversial quarantine rules for new arrivals come into force today as Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines begin a challenge against the measures. And there is a report in the FT that the government is planning to allow pubs and restaurants to serve customers outside from 22 June.",

      "bodyText": "The latest job numbers in the United States are a warning that during this time we need to more than ever keep our heads and not fall for spin or conspiracy. When analysing Donald Trump, it is never clear if he is lying, ignorant or deluded. Given this is a man who recently said he had been to the bunker under the White House \u201ctwo and half times\u201d, it is probably best to assume it is a bit of all three. But when it comes to boasting of his own brilliance he is not all that unusual \u2013 he is just an extreme version of a politician. And so, when late last week the US Bureau of Labour Statistics (BLS) released the latest US jobs report showing unemployment had fallen, it was not surprising that Trump would boast about the figures \u2013 any politician would. And yet, given Trump also tweeted on Monday, \u201cI built the greatest economy in the World, the best the US has ever had. I am doing it again!\u201d, his bluster was couched in more delusion than most politicians would usually attempt. The latest job numbers from the US were good. But they also highlight how careful we need to be at times of crisis. In March I predicted that the Covid-19 crisis would destroy the scale of economic data. And so it has turned out. And with that destruction has come a need to look at economic data differently. The latest jobs figures showed that employment in the US surged 2.9% in May \u2013 the biggest one-month gain ever recorded going back to 1948. Little wonder that Trump would break out the \u201cWe\u2019re Number 1\u201d tweet. And yes, in normal times that would be amazing news. But normal has not only left the room, it has left the building and caught the last train for the coast. Employment grew 2.9% in May, but it fell 14.4% in April. And it is why sometimes looking at monthly growth can be a bit confusing: There can be a tendency to quickly look at the above graph and think it means that the job market has recovered \u2013 after all it has grown by so much in May! At such times it is worth looking at total employment. This is something that is normally rather pointless \u2013 it is mostly a straightish line from which you can barely discern any change. But as I say, the times they are no longer normal: In May the number of people employed rose by 3.8m, but that only means that instead of having the fewest people employed since July 1999, now there are only the fewest people working since December 2002. And of course the population of the US is much larger now. When we look at the percentage of adult Americans in work we see the true horror of the situation: May saw the biggest one month jump in the employment rate ever recorded, but anyone boasting about that is living in a demented dream world. Prior to April the lowest percent of adults employed in America since the second world war was 54.9%, way back in October 1949 \u2013 a time when just a third of women were in the labour force, compared with around 57% now. Now, even after the improvement in May, just 52.8% of Americans have a job. We are going to see the same type of thing occur here in Australia. When there are such wild falls, as for example in the retail sector, all it will need is for shops to re-open and we will see wild rises: Of course we cannot ignore the monthly figures but more than ever we need to look beyond the headline-grabbing numbers. Yes, monthly employment in the US rose by a historic amount, but the annual growth remains historically low: Context is going to be key. But what we should not do is start seeing conspiracy or manipulation. Many reports \u2013 such as in the Washington Post \u2013 revealed that the BLS had announced there was a \u201cmisclassification error\u201d in the latest figures. In their survey they counted people who were \u201cabsent from work due to coronavirus-related business closures\u201d as employed rather than unemployed. The BLS estimated this meant \u201cthe overall unemployment rate would have been about 3 percentage points higher than reported\u201d \u2013 so 16.3% instead of 13.3%. It is easy in the time of Trump to see political mischief and malfeasance everywhere. But this is not what has happened. What has happened is official statistical bureaus around the world are struggling mightily in this incredibly tough time to make sense of numbers from surveys of people who are also struggling mightily to work out if they are \u201cofficially\u201d employed, on leave, or unemployed even though they are not working and are not looking for work because they have a job to go back to once it re-opens. It would not be surprising if both here and in the US we see numerous revisions of economic data over the coming months. That does not mean the numbers are dodgy, but that we need to take more care than usual about jumping at shadows \u2013 whether it be massive falls or equally massive rises.

      "bodyText": "In Australia social gatherings are back on the agenda, intrastate travel is permissible; playgrounds have reopened, and so have restaurants. At the beginning of lockdown, we were told Shakespeare wrote King Lear while sheltering from a plague; we were told we would eat, and eat again; and we were told \u2013 many times \u2013 that life indoors would give us time to reflect. While isolation has not been positive or pleasant for many, it has led to some new discoveries, and rediscoveries. Here, writers share the lockdown habits they intend to keep. I started an album club Osman Faruqi A few weeks into lockdown, when I was craving social interaction and desiring the kind of light, fun discussions about pop culture I\u2019d normally have with friends at a pub, I threw out an idea on Instagram. I\u2019d always wanted to initiate an \u201calbum club\u201d. Just like a book club, but instead of reading something, the idea was we\u2019d all listen to an album and talk about our favourite and least favourite tracks, the cringiest lines, the themes, and share gossip about the artist. Our first session on Zoom had more than a dozen participants from all over the world. Some members were old friends, and some I\u2019d never met before. We spent nearly two hours talking about Dua Lipa\u2019s Future Nostalgia, but also getting to know each other by swapping lockdown stories from our various cities and countries. It was an experiment, but it worked and everyone loved it. We made them weekly, talking Madonna, FKA Twigs and Billie Eilish. When society started opening up again and people were no longer forced to video conference for human interaction, I felt a twinge of sadness that the album club might not have a place in a semi-normal world. But we\u2019re going to try and make it last. I recommend everyone who loves music give it a try. It\u2019s a fun excuse to hang out with your mates and talk about some bangers. I cultivated found-cuttings Izabella Antoniou Since lockdown started, my daily walks have become opportunities to feed my plant-lady lifestyle, by taking \u201cfair game\u201d cuttings from around my suburb. Plants overgrowing in parks or spilling over fences on to the footpath. I\u2019ve begun filling a grubby tote with whatever I know will survive the chop. My most ambitious addition thus far has been a gutter rescue frangipani branch. Beginning with a few succulents, my magpie brain has lead me to fill every windowsill with old pesto jars, fostering the new cuttings before they\u2019re ready to be planted. Found cuttings make great gifts and have brightened up my apartment in an affordable way. As long as you don\u2019t damage the original plant, I think it\u2019s a wonderful way to interact with, and benefit from your neighbourhood commons. Now I\u2019ve transformed into a snipper \u2013 scouting Google Map\u2019s \u201cgreen zones\u201d for my next addition \u2013 I don\u2019t see myself stopping. My sharehouse started holding family dinners Bec Zhuang Before lockdown, it was rare for my housemates and me to all be at home at the same time. We\u2019d rarely hang out, despite being childhood friends and literally living within metres of each other. Now our home offices have started to take shape, we\u2019ve made a habit out of sharing meals and cooking for each other. We\u2019ve introduced each other to new food and new recipes, and found ourselves coming together for house dinners every week or so; sharing a few bottles of wine and showing our love through a home-cooked meal.

      "bodyText": "Business groups have warned that introducing a law to prevent foreign takeovers that threaten national security could have a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on investment in the UK. The government is said to be considering new rules that would mean directors could be jailed or companies could be fined hundreds of thousands of pounds for failing to report attempted takeovers by foreign firms that could put national security at risk. The proposals come amid growing concerns over China\u2019s influence, and fears that British businesses are becoming more vulnerable to buyouts because of the pandemic and economic downturn. However, business groups have warned against using the proposed investment rules as a political tool. Roger Barker, head of corporate governance at the Institute of Directors, said: \u201cSafeguarding national security is the government\u2019s prerogative. However, to avoid a chilling effect on foreign investment in such a challenging economic environment, it\u2019s crucial that any interventions are based on legitimate principles that are implemented in an impartial and non-political manner \u2013 ideally in coordination with international partners.\u201d The proposed move comes as the UK clashes with Beijing over China\u2019s so-called security law that critics say tightens the country\u2019s grip on Hong Kong. Boris Johnson said he would offer Hong Kong residents a path to citizenship if Beijing pushed ahead with the law, while China accused the UK of meddling in its affairs. Johnson now plans to force UK companies to formally declare when a foreign company tries to buy more than 25% of their shares, purchase assets or intellectual property or gain \u201csignificant influence\u201d, according to the Times. The prime minister is also planning to include academic partnerships and research projects under the new rules, owing to worries about Chinese companies\u2019 links to British universities, the paper said. The Confederation of British Industry warned that curbing foreign investment would hurt UK businesses when they needed it most. \u201cForeign investment will be critical to economic recovery efforts, so it\u2019s important that the UK signals to the world that we are open for business,\u201d the CBI said. \u201cAll investment comes with risk, and any safeguards should be evidence-based and applied equally to all countries.\u201d On Monday, a City taskforce laid bare the financial burdens weighing on UK businesses because of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying that small and medium sized firms would be saddled with \u00a397bn to \u00a3107bn of unsustainable debt by March. The taskforce, led by EY and lobby group TheCityUK, is exploring a range of solutions that could involve domestic and international investors to support UK firms.",

As the 14-day quarantine period came into force on Monday, amid predictions from travel and aviation firms that it could devastate their industries, the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) set out enforcement guidance which stressed the often hands-off role for police in the process. Public Health England (PHE) staff will be primarily responsible for checking new arrivals are keeping to the guidelines, which requires them to remain indoors at one address, barring extreme circumstances. Any suspected breaches will be referred to a so-called triage centre run by Border Force with guidance from NPCC staff, who will then direct police to investigate as needed. The briefing for English police forces set out by the NPCC says that even if officers find someone is repeatedly not at the address they have given, or they are not known there, officers will take no immediate action but refer the matter to the triage centre. The guidance does lay out that officers can use \u201creasonable force\u201d to return someone to their quarantine address, or issue a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice, but stresses other options should be sought first. An NPCC spokeswoman said: \u201cPolice have a limited role in quarantine regulations.\u201d If there was a need for enforcement, she added, police would \u201cseek to establish the circumstances and we will continue our approach of engaging, explaining, encouraging and, only as last resort, enforcing\u201d.

      "body": "<p>What would the young Keir Starmer have made of his decision to condemn the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">Black Lives Matter</a> protesters who felled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">Bristol\u2019s statue of Edward Colston</a> yesterday? In his years as a barrister, the man who would be Labour leader worked to defend those who challenged the coercive force of the Thatcherite state, be it on protests or picket lines.</p> <p>His aim was to use the courts to protect the liberties that the governments of the day would not, and to muzzle the institutions that impinged upon them, most notably the police. Writing for the Trotskyist pamphlet&nbsp;Socialist Alternatives<em>&nbsp;</em>in 1987, he went as far as to ask \u201cthe question of the role the police should play, if any, in civil society\u201d.</p> <p>Activists on both sides of the Atlantic have asked the same thing in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Yet Starmer\u2019s decision to tell LBC that the action to fell Colston and dump him in the Avon was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d has led some on the left to ask the same question of the Labour party\u2019s new management as Starmer asked of the police 33 years ago: \u201cWho are they protecting, and from what?\u201d</p> <p>In some respects the Colston question was among the most straightforward Starmer could have expected to be asked this morning, during the first of the monthly phone-ins he is to subject himself to as part of his extended introduction to the British public.</p> <p>Would he argue that Colston deserved to stand? Of course not, and indeed he did not. \u201cWe can\u2019t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cA statue is there to honour people. This is a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves \u2026 He should not be on a statue in Bristol, or anywhere else.\u201d</p> <p>On that argument, none of Starmer\u2019s critics will disagree. What has caused consternation, however, is his suggestions that yesterday\u2019s scenes were \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, and that Colston \u201cshould have been brought down properly, with consent\u201d. He went on to say that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barry-gardiner\">Barry Gardiner</a>, the former shadow cabinet minister who took a knee outside Downing Street as part of an earlier BLM protest last week, had been wrong to attend the demonstration during lockdown.</p> <p>To condone any kind of illegality \u2013 even when it involves significant public support \u2013 is a difficult ask of most politicians. Even the most devoted supporters of the ends have found it necessary to question the means, as Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, did when he said that he could not condone the damage protesters had done to a statue that he described as a \u201cpersonal affront\u201d to his existence.</p> <p>But in going further, Starmer has \u2013 to some on the left, at least \u2013 situated himself as the heir to the Labour tradition of disappointment. In Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Diane Abbott and Ian Lavery, the last shadow cabinet had a leadership whose political lives had been largely lived unconstrained by the mores of electoralism. They were of the extra-parliamentary left.</p> <p>In 2015, Labour members elected Corbyn. Many people became Labour members precisely because they saw him as a man who would be more at home on a march than criticising one. The 2019 intake of Labour MPs are largely cast in that mould: 24-year-old frontbencher <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nadia-whittome\">Nadia Whittome</a>, among its most impressive performers, spoke for much of the Labour grassroots when she described the toppling of Colston\u2019s statue as an \u201cact of resistance\u201d to be celebrated.</p> <p>Starmer has supported the right of activists to peaceful protest and offered his solidarity, but was never likely to go that far. Answers like today\u2019s confirm in the minds of some activists that to be \u201cforensic\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d \u2013 the two watchwords of his leadership \u2013 is to care about process above all else. The same criticism has been levelled repeatedly over his approach to coronavirus: support the government until it becomes untenable. His internal opponents will file his comments on Colston next to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/edmiliband\">Ed Miliband</a> suggesting teachers were wrong to strike in 2011, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/16/neil-kinnock-arthur-scargill-miners-strike\">Neil Kinnock\u2019s failure</a> to stand foursquare behind Arthur Scargill and the miners in the absence of a national ballot on strike action.</p> <p>The irony is that Starmer was once one of those very critics. The blunt truth is that, in terms of his strategy for rebuilding Labour\u2019s standing in the country, his team have calculated people like his younger self, standing to his left, matter less than those standing to his right. He has control over the parliamentary party, a mandate from a clear majority of the membership and his favoured candidate in place overseeing Labour HQ. What he does not yet have, however, is a supportive public. Every intervention he makes serves the aim of establishing himself in the collective consciousness as a moderating influence \u2013 both on the government and the Labour party that&nbsp;once belonged to Corbyn.&nbsp;Expect Starmer to talk of supporting the police, not defunding them.</p> <p>Whether that gambit succeeds \u2013 and how history will judge its application to events such as this week\u2019s \u2013 is another question. But one answer is clear: Keir Starmer is not on the picket line any more.</p> <p>\u2022 Patrick Maguire is a political journalist and co-author of Left Out, an upcoming book on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour party</p>",

Yet Starmer\u2019s decision to tell LBC that the action to fell Colston and dump him in the Avon was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d has led some on the left to ask the same question of the Labour party\u2019s new management as Starmer asked of the police 33 years ago: \u201cWho are they protecting, and from what?\u201d In some respects the Colston question was among the most straightforward Starmer could have expected to be asked this morning, during the first of the monthly phone-ins he is to subject himself to as part of his extended introduction to the British public. Would he argue that Colston deserved to stand? Of course not, and indeed he did not. \u201cWe can\u2019t, in 21st century Britain, have a slaver on a statue,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cA statue is there to honour people. This is a man who was responsible for 100,000 people being moved from Africa to the Caribbean as slaves \u2026 He should not be on a statue in Bristol, or anywhere else.\u201d On that argument, none of Starmer\u2019s critics will disagree. What has caused consternation, however, is his suggestions that yesterday\u2019s scenes were \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d, and that Colston \u201cshould have been brought down properly, with consent\u201d. He went on to say that Barry Gardiner, the former shadow cabinet minister who took a knee outside Downing Street as part of an earlier BLM protest last week, had been wrong to attend the demonstration during lockdown. To condone any kind of illegality \u2013 even when it involves significant public support \u2013 is a difficult ask of most politicians. Even the most devoted supporters of the ends have found it necessary to question the means, as Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, did when he said that he could not condone the damage protesters had done to a statue that he described as a \u201cpersonal affront\u201d to his existence. But in going further, Starmer has \u2013 to some on the left, at least \u2013 situated himself as the heir to the Labour tradition of disappointment. In Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Diane Abbott and Ian Lavery, the last shadow cabinet had a leadership whose political lives had been largely lived unconstrained by the mores of electoralism. They were of the extra-parliamentary left. In 2015, Labour members elected Corbyn. Many people became Labour members precisely because they saw him as a man who would be more at home on a march than criticising one. The 2019 intake of Labour MPs are largely cast in that mould: 24-year-old frontbencher Nadia Whittome, among its most impressive performers, spoke for much of the Labour grassroots when she described the toppling of Colston\u2019s statue as an \u201cact of resistance\u201d to be celebrated. Starmer has supported the right of activists to peaceful protest and offered his solidarity, but was never likely to go that far. Answers like today\u2019s confirm in the minds of some activists that to be \u201cforensic\u201d and \u201cconstructive\u201d \u2013 the two watchwords of his leadership \u2013 is to care about process above all else. The same criticism has been levelled repeatedly over his approach to coronavirus: support the government until it becomes untenable. His internal opponents will file his comments on Colston next to Ed Miliband suggesting teachers were wrong to strike in 2011, and Neil Kinnock\u2019s failure to stand foursquare behind Arthur Scargill and the miners in the absence of a national ballot on strike action. The irony is that Starmer was once one of those very critics. The blunt truth is that, in terms of his strategy for rebuilding Labour\u2019s standing in the country, his team have calculated people like his younger self, standing to his left, matter less than those standing to his right. He has control over the parliamentary party, a mandate from a clear majority of the membership and his favoured candidate in place overseeing Labour HQ. What he does not yet have, however, is a supportive public. Every intervention he makes serves the aim of establishing himself in the collective consciousness as a moderating influence \u2013 both on the government and the Labour party that once belonged to Corbyn. Expect Starmer to talk of supporting the police, not defunding them. Whether that gambit succeeds \u2013 and how history will judge its application to events such as this week\u2019s \u2013 is another question. But one answer is clear: Keir Starmer is not on the picket line any more. \u2022 Patrick Maguire is a political journalist and co-author of Left Out, an upcoming book on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour party",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe ran out of bricks and compo today, so the rest is getting delivered tomorrow,\u201d Billy Kee says, instinctively slipping into industry jargon. He has not long got through the door at home in Leicestershire after an unusually early finish on the building site where for the past six months he has been working as a labourer and apprentice bricklayer.</p> <p>Since retiring from professional football aged 29 because of struggles with bulimia, anxiety and depression, Kee has traded clocking off at midday for marathon days and mortar mixes. It has been a rocky road since his last appearance for Accrington Stanley in the penultimate game of last season, a 5-1 home win against Plymouth that guaranteed the club\u2019s League One status in which he opened the scoring from the penalty spot. The final day brought a trip to Portsmouth but he did not play, despite travelling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/uncertain-times-lead-to-rise-in-mental-health-challenges-for-athletes\">Uncertain times lead to rise in mental health challenges for athletes | Jonathan Howcroft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI faked an injury because I didn\u2019t want to play any more. I had a little niggle in my knee but it wasn\u2019t as bad as I made it out to be. I didn\u2019t want to be there and I\u2019d just had enough because it broke me down so much and I couldn\u2019t cope any more.</p> <p>\u201cI went away for the whole summer, changed my number, switched my phone off and switched everything off because I didn\u2019t really want to be in this world any more. It took a good six months to get back to where I wanted to be.\u201d</p> <p>He enjoyed some downtime in America with his wife, Leigh, and their boys, Brady and Colby. He sought further support from the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, engaged with an eating\u2011disorder clinic and deactivated his social media accounts. Gone are the days when he would fall down a hole of Facebook feeds or fans\u2019 forums and four months ago he signed for seventh\u2011tier Coalville Town, allowing him to play part-time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bbb99f4c5174c28176ce0881b8e929e850f34c17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbb99f4c5174c28176ce0881b8e929e850f34c17/0_194_900_1124/801.jpg\" alt=\"Billy Kee on building site\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">When Billy Kee finishes work at the building site he is \u2018absolutely knackered and ready to have a couple of beers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Billy Kee</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYesterday I walked about 15 miles on the building site,\u201d he says, breaking into laughter. \u201cFinishing training at 12.30pm gave me too much thinking time but coming home from work now, you\u2019re absolutely knackered and you\u2019re ready to have a couple of beers, sit with the missus and the kids, have a bit of dinner and go to bed, and it\u2019s lovely. When I was in football, I don\u2019t think I ever went to bed before midnight. I was on edge and always overthinking. Now I go to bed every night at 10 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p> <p>Kee speaks with sincerity and his bravery has encouraged hundreds of others to seek help. He previously compared the gnawing thoughts to a \u201crat that runs around your head\u201d and, as I mention that description, he interjects. \u201cThat rat is still there \u2013 you just have to put it in a box sometimes. I don\u2019t think it is ever going to go away but I have to learn to live with it in the right ways. It\u2019s almost a case of training the rat now.\u201d</p> <p>Accrington have retired the No 29 shirt in honour of the striker who scored 83 goals in 243 appearances across two spells. In February, before victory against AFC Wimbledon, they presented him with a framed compilation of images \u2013 many from the 2017-18 season that culminated in Kee winning the League Two golden boot and Accrington celebrating promotion \u2013 that has pride of place on his living-room wall.</p> <p>He is grateful for the ceaseless support of Accrington\u2019s owner, Andy Holt, and the manager, John Coleman, and appreciative of gestures made by rival fans, notably when Ipswich supporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ASFCofficial/status/1185979686037446656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1185979686037446656%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishnews.com%2Fmagazine%2Fdaily%2F2019%2F10%2F20%2Fnews%2Faccrington-salute-ipswich-fans-for-billy-kee-solidarity-banner-1743803%2F\">held a banner</a> that read: \u201cBilly Kee: You Are Not Alone\u201d in October. \u201cIf we can talk about our issues, we can help each other.

Accrington trailed 2-1 but won two penalties in second-half stoppage time. Kee, the penalty-taker, declined to take either. Both penalties were saved, Accrington lost and for the next two days Kee struggled to get out of bed. He was not sleeping, began drinking and threatened to quit playing.</p> <p>\u201cBut within a year I won the league and I was on top of the world. And then the next year I was struggling again. I think that\u2019s mental health: you don\u2019t know where you stand with it; you are up and down, up and down. Seeking help, going to therapists, doctors and taking my different tablets to work out what is best for me has helped.\u201d</p> <p>Kee is enjoying life again. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because my family say I\u2019m a different person \u2013 that I\u2019m always happy, always chatting and I\u2019ve always got conversation.

I just try to put my energy into my kids and my family and become myself instead of trying to become somebody I\u2019m probably not.</p> <p>\u201cI like being at home with my family instead of travelling round the country, and I\u2019ve got my wife and kids all in one place and they haven\u2019t got to worry about changing schools again or when the next contract is coming. I\u2019m working hard just trying to get on with living a normal life now rather than living the dream of a footballer.\u201d</p> <p>Stepping away in January has given the former Burton and Torquay striker the freedom he craved. \u201cWhen it came to retiring, it was a huge relief because I could start living life how I wanted to, without the pressure from the fans, the managers, the relegations, the stress of scoring two goals one week and then not the next, and then having a drought. It\u2019s a lot of pressure and I couldn\u2019t hack that. If I didn\u2019t opt out of the football world this year, I don\u2019t know if I would have been alive now but I made that decision with my family to come out of it.\u201d</p> <p>We talk about other players to bravely speak out on depression, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2019/sep/04/kevin-ellison-morecambe-hated-players-depression-40-fifa-video-game\" title=\"\">including Kevin Ellison</a>, the Morecambe winger who for years suffered in silence. Kee hid his struggles for around six years before opening up three years ago.</p> <p>\u201cKev was the biggest, hardest person on the pitch, and he loves winding people up, but you would never understand what he was going through behind closed doors, and I think that is for everybody in football. It\u2019s so scary to speak out it\u2019s unreal, and you don\u2019t dare to because you never know what\u2019s going to happen next.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe ran out of bricks and compo today, so the rest is getting delivered tomorrow,\u201d Billy Kee says, instinctively slipping into industry jargon. He has not long got through the door at home in Leicestershire after an unusually early finish on the building site where for the past six months he has been working as a labourer and apprentice bricklayer. Since retiring from professional football aged 29 because of struggles with bulimia, anxiety and depression, Kee has traded clocking off at midday for marathon days and mortar mixes. It has been a rocky road since his last appearance for Accrington Stanley in the penultimate game of last season, a 5-1 home win against Plymouth that guaranteed the club\u2019s League One status in which he opened the scoring from the penalty spot. The final day brought a trip to Portsmouth but he did not play, despite travelling. \u201cI faked an injury because I didn\u2019t want to play any more. I had a little niggle in my knee but it wasn\u2019t as bad as I made it out to be. I didn\u2019t want to be there and I\u2019d just had enough because it broke me down so much and I couldn\u2019t cope any more. \u201cI went away for the whole summer, changed my number, switched my phone off and switched everything off because I didn\u2019t really want to be in this world any more. It took a good six months to get back to where I wanted to be.\u201d He enjoyed some downtime in America with his wife, Leigh, and their boys, Brady and Colby. He sought further support from the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, engaged with an eating\u2011disorder clinic and deactivated his social media accounts. Gone are the days when he would fall down a hole of Facebook feeds or fans\u2019 forums and four months ago he signed for seventh\u2011tier Coalville Town, allowing him to play part-time. \u201cYesterday I walked about 15 miles on the building site,\u201d he says, breaking into laughter. \u201cFinishing training at 12.30pm gave me too much thinking time but coming home from work now, you\u2019re absolutely knackered and you\u2019re ready to have a couple of beers, sit with the missus and the kids, have a bit of dinner and go to bed, and it\u2019s lovely. When I was in football, I don\u2019t think I ever went to bed before midnight. I was on edge and always overthinking. Now I go to bed every night at 10 o\u2019clock.\u201d Kee speaks with sincerity and his bravery has encouraged hundreds of others to seek help. He previously compared the gnawing thoughts to a \u201crat that runs around your head\u201d and, as I mention that description, he interjects. \u201cThat rat is still there \u2013 you just have to put it in a box sometimes. I don\u2019t think it is ever going to go away but I have to learn to live with it in the right ways. It\u2019s almost a case of training the rat now.\u201d Accrington have retired the No 29 shirt in honour of the striker who scored 83 goals in 243 appearances across two spells. In February, before victory against AFC Wimbledon, they presented him with a framed compilation of images \u2013 many from the 2017-18 season that culminated in Kee winning the League Two golden boot and Accrington celebrating promotion \u2013 that has pride of place on his living-room wall. He is grateful for the ceaseless support of Accrington\u2019s owner, Andy Holt, and the manager, John Coleman, and appreciative of gestures made by rival fans, notably when Ipswich supporters held a banner that read: \u201cBilly Kee: You Are Not Alone\u201d in October. \u201cIf we can talk about our issues, we can help each other. A lot of people don\u2019t know how to come out and be honest because a lot of us end up living a lie.\u201d Kee\u2019s mental health spiralled four years ago following a defeat at Cambridge, prompting his club to permit him some time off. Accrington trailed 2-1 but won two penalties in second-half stoppage time. Kee, the penalty-taker, declined to take either. Both penalties were saved, Accrington lost and for the next two days Kee struggled to get out of bed. He was not sleeping, began drinking and threatened to quit playing. \u201cBut within a year I won the league and I was on top of the world. And then the next year I was struggling again. I think that\u2019s mental health: you don\u2019t know where you stand with it; you are up and down, up and down. Seeking help, going to therapists, doctors and taking my different tablets to work out what is best for me has helped.\u201d Kee is enjoying life again. \u201cIt\u2019s weird because my family say I\u2019m a different person \u2013 that I\u2019m always happy, always chatting and I\u2019ve always got conversation. They just say I\u2019m a different person and back to the \u2018old Billy\u2019. If I said to my mum and dad or my wife that I wanted to go back to football tomorrow, they\u2019d put a stop to that because they know how I was.\u201d Does part of him miss it? \u201cI don\u2019t miss training every day and trying to have a body like a temple. I like to be who I am, have a beer with my mates and try to enjoy life. I do miss football but I don\u2019t miss the professional side of it. I just try to put my energy into my kids and my family and become myself instead of trying to become somebody I\u2019m probably not. \u201cI like being at home with my family instead of travelling round the country, and I\u2019ve got my wife and kids all in one place and they haven\u2019t got to worry about changing schools again or when the next contract is coming. I\u2019m working hard just trying to get on with living a normal life now rather than living the dream of a footballer.\u201d Stepping away in January has given the former Burton and Torquay striker the freedom he craved. \u201cWhen it came to retiring, it was a huge relief because I could start living life how I wanted to, without the pressure from the fans, the managers, the relegations, the stress of scoring two goals one week and then not the next, and then having a drought. It\u2019s a lot of pressure and I couldn\u2019t hack that. If I didn\u2019t opt out of the football world this year, I don\u2019t know if I would have been alive now but I made that decision with my family to come out of it.\u201d We talk about other players to bravely speak out on depression, including Kevin Ellison, the Morecambe winger who for years suffered in silence. Kee hid his struggles for around six years before opening up three years ago. \u201cKev was the biggest, hardest person on the pitch, and he loves winding people up, but you would never understand what he was going through behind closed doors, and I think that is for everybody in football. It\u2019s so scary to speak out it\u2019s unreal, and you don\u2019t dare to because you never know what\u2019s going to happen next. I never mentioned my bulimia until I retired because if I had, would I get another club? Maybe not, so it was always a big worry.\u201d A study by the PFA last month found 22% of its members felt depressed or had considered self-harm during the coronavirus pandemic and the union\u2019s director of player welfare, Michael Bennett, said there has been an increase in players reaching out. \u201cI\u2019ve seen more than 10 of my mates released in the last couple of weeks,\u201d Kee says. \u201cThese players are scared because they have families and mortgages to pay but it\u2019s good people are reaching out for help because it shows we\u2019re moving in the right direction. If there\u2019s any footballer going through all this, I\u2019d say don\u2019t be scared to opt out and go and do something else, because the PFA will help you.\u201d Every now and then on the building site, Kee bumps into Burton fans baffled as to why he has swapped scoring goals in front of thousands to shovel sand and mud. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand but I did it for myself and my family because otherwise if I kept playing I\u2019d lose my wife and my kids or I\u2019d probably lose myself, and I didn\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen your dream comes to an end, you need to go and live another dream and my next dream is to build a house and to live in it as a big, happy family.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

More than 400,000 workers were expected to return to work on Monday. Before the pandemic, New York City had the highest employment on record, with <a href=\"https://www.osc.state.ny.us/sites/default/files/reports/documents/pdf/2019-08/report-1-2020.pdf\">4.5 million people working</a> in the city each day.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, De Blasio also warned against complacency, and the risk of a new outbreak: \u201cWe got this far by doing it the right way, by doing the social distancing, the face coverings. We\u2019ve got to keep doing it at those work sites and everywhere if we expect to keep moving forward.\u201d</p> <p>New York City became the focal point of the US coronavirus outbreak this spring. More than 21,000 people citywide died of confirmed or probable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a>. The city\u2019s death toll accounts for roughly one in five of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/us-coronavirus-deaths-economy-reopen-protests\">110,000 coronavirus deaths</a> across the US.&nbsp;</p> <p>At its peak, the virus killed more than 500 people a day in New York City in early to mid-April, overwhelming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/new-york-coronavirus-elmhurst-hospital\">healthcare facilities</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/22/black-undertakers-struggle-pandemic-coronavirus\">funeral homes</a> and whole communities.</p> <p>By the first week of June, daily deaths had dropped into the single digits, and the number of people testing positive for the virus was down to 200-300 a day. In early April, more than 6,000 people a day were testing positive.</p> <p>In the past week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/04/we-are-not-the-problem-inside-the-george-floyd-protests-in-new-york-video\">waves of protest</a> against the killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> have washed across the city, and tens of thousands have gathered to demand police accountability. Floyd was killed by police during an arrest in Minneapolis, after an officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many public health experts worry the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/protests-police-covid-19-coronavirus-spread\">protests pit public health issues against one another</a>.

Dr Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist who had Covid-19 in March, is concerned the virus might spread during protests following Floyd\u2019s 25 May death. And the virus\u2019s toll in lives, despair and exhaustion weighs on him. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see how we recover,\u201d he said.</p> <p>A veteran Brooklyn nurse, Arlene Merteens, told the local news outlet <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/nurse-coronavirus-fear-second-wave-exhaustion\">Gothamist</a>: \u201cI know we have to go on. But I\u2019m so afraid of it, if we really do have a second wave, what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>As a small proportion of New Yorkers return to work, questions and challenges remain about how they will maintain distancing measures on usually crowded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/30/new-york-subway-system-mta-metro\">subway trains</a> and streets, and whether the city\u2019s character as an elbow-to-elbow city will return.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cAll eyes will be on New York City over the next couple months,\u201d said urban policy expert Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future.</p> <p>Some New Yorkers have drawn strength from crises past. New York City rebounded from a financial crisis in the 1970s, a crime peak in the 1990s and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep us down,\u201d said Carlo Scissura, president of the New York Building Congress, a construction industry group. \u201cWe may go down a little bit, but we go right back up.\u201d</p> <p>Edwin Arce, a Manhattan chef, said he thinks New Yorkers are up to the challenge. \u201cAs a city, we are ready to be back, start going out, living life with the new reality, though, of masks and 6ft [2-meter] separation,\u201d said Arce.</p> <p>The city has already reawakened somewhat as warm weather has drawn people outdoors, more restaurants have offered carryout service, and as thousands of people have marched in protest over the Floyd case.</p> <p>Subway ridership is ticking back up after plunging from 5.4m rides per weekday in February to under 450,000 in April, the city\u2019s transit agency says. Subway schedules are returning to normal, though riders will see signs showing how far apart to stand on platforms, how to wear masks, and the 1-5am shutdowns that began in May will continue so trains can be cleaned.</p> <p>Sam Solomon, a native New Yorker, said he wondered how \u201cnormal\u201d the new normal will be. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ever going to be like it was,\u201d said Solomon, who has a health-related job. \u201cAfter months of relative isolation, it\u2019s going to be an adjustment being around so many people.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",

      "bodyText": "After three bleak months, New York, the corner of the US hit hardest by the coronavirus, gradually began reopening on Monday in what was seen as a landmark moment in the crisis and a test of the city\u2019s discipline. With the virus in check, at least for now, many stores previously deemed non-essential were cleared to reopen \u2013 for delivery and pickup, though not browsing inside. Construction, manufacturing and wholesalers also received the go-ahead to resume. \u201cThis is a triumph for all New Yorkers that we\u2019ve gotten to this point,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said. More than 400,000 workers were expected to return to work on Monday. Before the pandemic, New York City had the highest employment on record, with 4.5 million people working in the city each day. However, De Blasio also warned against complacency, and the risk of a new outbreak: \u201cWe got this far by doing it the right way, by doing the social distancing, the face coverings. We\u2019ve got to keep doing it at those work sites and everywhere if we expect to keep moving forward.\u201d New York City became the focal point of the US coronavirus outbreak this spring. More than 21,000 people citywide died of confirmed or probable Covid-19. The city\u2019s death toll accounts for roughly one in five of the 110,000 coronavirus deaths across the US. At its peak, the virus killed more than 500 people a day in New York City in early to mid-April, overwhelming healthcare facilities, funeral homes and whole communities. By the first week of June, daily deaths had dropped into the single digits, and the number of people testing positive for the virus was down to 200-300 a day. In early April, more than 6,000 people a day were testing positive. In the past week, waves of protest against the killing of George Floyd have washed across the city, and tens of thousands have gathered to demand police accountability. Floyd was killed by police during an arrest in Minneapolis, after an officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes. Many public health experts worry the protests pit public health issues against one another. In all cases, communities of color and especially black Americans are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected if another Covid-19 outbreak occurs. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big test,\u201d said Dr Bruce Polsky, a city resident who is chairman of medicine at NYU Winthrop hospital in suburban Mineola. Months of social distancing, staying home, mask-wearing, hand-washing, shock and fear have made New Yorkers better prepared to keep the coronavirus under control, health experts said. However, some healthcare workers remain worried. Dr Ian Lipkin, a Columbia University epidemiologist who had Covid-19 in March, is concerned the virus might spread during protests following Floyd\u2019s 25 May death. And the virus\u2019s toll in lives, despair and exhaustion weighs on him. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see how we recover,\u201d he said. A veteran Brooklyn nurse, Arlene Merteens, told the local news outlet Gothamist: \u201cI know we have to go on. But I\u2019m so afraid of it, if we really do have a second wave, what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d As a small proportion of New Yorkers return to work, questions and challenges remain about how they will maintain distancing measures on usually crowded subway trains and streets, and whether the city\u2019s character as an elbow-to-elbow city will return. \u201cAll eyes will be on New York City over the next couple months,\u201d said urban policy expert Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future. Some New Yorkers have drawn strength from crises past. New York City rebounded from a financial crisis in the 1970s, a crime peak in the 1990s and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep us down,\u201d said Carlo Scissura, president of the New York Building Congress, a construction industry group. \u201cWe may go down a little bit, but we go right back up.\u201d Edwin Arce, a Manhattan chef, said he thinks New Yorkers are up to the challenge. \u201cAs a city, we are ready to be back, start going out, living life with the new reality, though, of masks and 6ft [2-meter] separation,\u201d said Arce. The city has already reawakened somewhat as warm weather has drawn people outdoors, more restaurants have offered carryout service, and as thousands of people have marched in protest over the Floyd case. Subway ridership is ticking back up after plunging from 5.4m rides per weekday in February to under 450,000 in April, the city\u2019s transit agency says. Subway schedules are returning to normal, though riders will see signs showing how far apart to stand on platforms, how to wear masks, and the 1-5am shutdowns that began in May will continue so trains can be cleaned. Sam Solomon, a native New Yorker, said he wondered how \u201cnormal\u201d the new normal will be. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ever going to be like it was,\u201d said Solomon, who has a health-related job. \u201cAfter months of relative isolation, it\u2019s going to be an adjustment being around so many people.\u201d",

Mr Johnson hankers for some semblance of normality and, perhaps believing his own propaganda, wagers that the risks of lifting restrictions prematurely are smaller than his own scientists predict.</p> <p>The prime minister seems hell-bent on meeting a deadline that possibly only he remembers setting. On March 19, Mr Johnson <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=659801458162939\" title=\"\">promised</a> the country from Downing Street that his government would \u201cget on top\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic within 12 weeks. That time frame means Britain is meant to have \u201cturned the tide\u201d by next Tuesday. It will not have escaped the prime minister\u2019s notice that while Britain\u2019s cases are going down, outside our borders <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-06-08-20-intl/h_a09c6d93908a5fac6c6b4071a3203a11?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_content=2020-06-08T16%3A30%3A06\" title=\"\">they are going up</a>.</p> <p>Mr Johnson wants to exploit this moment. He aims to contain the virus to a manageable level and can argue for a briefer lockdown than that needed for a more onerous suppression. The advantage is that economic activity can be restarted earlier because the virus is not having to be wiped out. The disadvantage is that the virus remains widespread. Given that there is still a very high number of UK cases \u2013 we are thought to have about five times that recorded in Italy \u2013 there is a <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-tony-blair-testing-lockdown-095841818.html\" title=\"\">question</a> of how the government\u2019s test-and-trace system will cope.</p> <p>The UK has not adopted the World Health Organization\u2019s approach and developed a case \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237475-covid-19-news-estimated-coronavirus-infections-have-fallen-in-england/\" title=\"\">finding and testing</a>\u201d system tasked with reaching out to the public and making it easy for them to have a coronavirus test performed if necessary. Instead of local surveillance to find the unseen cases silently spreading in the community, the government has given Serco a \u00a390m <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/revealed-serco-under-fire-over-fresh-90m-covid-19-contract/\" title=\"\">contract</a> to run call centres to field inquiries from people who we do not need to worry about: those who self-identify as being sick.</p> <p>In his rush to meet that target, Mr Johnson is gambling with the health of the nation. In prioritising wealth over health, he must explain why the public can go to pubs, but not attend the socially distanced funeral of relatives. They are still wondering why cleaners can come into their homes, but family members cannot. There is an added layer of suspicion: Downing Street appears to have <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/things-are-about-to-get-even-worse-for-boris-johnson-q08g30mbx\" title=\"\">calculated</a> that it is politically unsustainable for Britons to be locked up at home when Europeans sun themselves on beaches this summer.</p> <p>The prime minister has been emboldened to disregard the advice of his own advisers, which makes it harder to gain public consent for difficult trade-offs. Trust gives politicians licence to take the hard decisions to impose quarantines, shut down businesses and advise physical distancing. It also permits them the right to lift such restrictions. Mr Johnson\u2019s government now has the joint-lowest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/YouGov/status/1269931042728796161\" title=\"\">approval rating</a> worldwide for its management of coronavirus. The prime minister must not downplay the threat to life that easing the lockdown early will entail. He may reckon that it is better to avoid panic than be honest about the hazards ahead. But that would be misguided, especially as the scientists who counsel ministers fear a real risk of a second wave of infections. If they are right, Mr Johnson\u2019s actions would have not only sown confusion but also have cost lives.</p>",

On March 19, Mr Johnson promised the country from Downing Street that his government would \u201cget on top\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic within 12 weeks. That time frame means Britain is meant to have \u201cturned the tide\u201d by next Tuesday. It will not have escaped the prime minister\u2019s notice that while Britain\u2019s cases are going down, outside our borders they are going up. Mr Johnson wants to exploit this moment. He aims to contain the virus to a manageable level and can argue for a briefer lockdown than that needed for a more onerous suppression. The advantage is that economic activity can be restarted earlier because the virus is not having to be wiped out. The disadvantage is that the virus remains widespread. Given that there is still a very high number of UK cases \u2013 we are thought to have about five times that recorded in Italy \u2013 there is a question of how the government\u2019s test-and-trace system will cope. The UK has not adopted the World Health Organization\u2019s approach and developed a case \u201cfinding and testing\u201d system tasked with reaching out to the public and making it easy for them to have a coronavirus test performed if necessary. Instead of local surveillance to find the unseen cases silently spreading in the community, the government has given Serco a \u00a390m contract to run call centres to field inquiries from people who we do not need to worry about: those who self-identify as being sick. In his rush to meet that target, Mr Johnson is gambling with the health of the nation. In prioritising wealth over health, he must explain why the public can go to pubs, but not attend the socially distanced funeral of relatives. They are still wondering why cleaners can come into their homes, but family members cannot. There is an added layer of suspicion: Downing Street appears to have calculated that it is politically unsustainable for Britons to be locked up at home when Europeans sun themselves on beaches this summer. The prime minister has been emboldened to disregard the advice of his own advisers, which makes it harder to gain public consent for difficult trade-offs. Trust gives politicians licence to take the hard decisions to impose quarantines, shut down businesses and advise physical distancing. It also permits them the right to lift such restrictions. Mr Johnson\u2019s government now has the joint-lowest approval rating worldwide for its management of coronavirus. The prime minister must not downplay the threat to life that easing the lockdown early will entail. He may reckon that it is better to avoid panic than be honest about the hazards ahead. But that would be misguided, especially as the scientists who counsel ministers fear a real risk of a second wave of infections. If they are right, Mr Johnson\u2019s actions would have not only sown confusion but also have cost lives.",

As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. <br></p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the <strong>UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany</strong>, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.<br></p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll be closing this blog now, so to keep up with any major lines from the emergency debate and other UK news, do follow along on the global blog. In the meantime, here\u2019s are the key points from today\u2019s coronavirus briefing, where Hancock said the virus is \u201cin retreat\u201d. A further 55 people have died after contracting Covid-19 in UK, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 40,597. This is the lowest daily total of newly reported deaths since 22 March, but there is often a reporting lag over a weekend. The figures do not include all deaths across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. There were 138,183 tests carried out yesterday There were 1,205 new confirmed cases yesterday, the lowest since the end of March The number of Covid-19 hospital admissions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was 519 (down from 661 on 29 May) The number of people on ventilators on the UK as a whole is 516 Sage estimates the R rate is below 1 in all regions, and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital is falling in all regions Over a million test kits have been sent to 9,000 elderly care homes, Hancock said. The test results so far do not show a significant rise in positive cases, but homes are have been given the option to test when they prefer. From today, all remaining adult care homes in England will be able to order the whole care home testing service for residents and staff. This is over 6,000 further care homes, Hancock said. Valerie Vaz, shadow Leader of the House, has said parliament needs to restore a way for all MPs to participate as equals, instead with a two-tier system. She raised the a number of \u201cmyths\u201d Rees-Mogg has perpetuated, including the following: That physical parliament provides more efficient scrutiny: she countered it by saying there can only be 50 members in the chamber. That MPs are returning safely. Vaz raised the 400 member queue and 45-minute long queue. That the House does not work effectively on behalf of constituencies. She said MPs are working for their constituents as they always do. Line-by-line scrutiny of bills - she said the system has only just been set up, and select committees have been able to participate. Carmichael has said the lack of virtual votes for those living with a shielding partner or family member violates the principe of equality, saying those who do not understand this should read the \u201cconstitutional textbooks\u201d. Rees-Mogg has said MPs are key workers, and many of their constituents are continuing to take risks to work. Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine has said this is not about scrutiny or parliamentary proceeding, as important as they are: it is about public health. \u201cWe are in the middle of a pandemic\u201d, and risk taking the virus to constituents and others along the way. \u201cThat is much more important than the process by which we scrutinise the government.\u201d Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle has asked Rees-Mogg to stop \u201ccaricaturing\u201d MPs who are shielding or have vulnerable members of family as \u201cnot wanting to be here\u201d. Rees-Mogg has reiterated virtual provisions for those who are shielding, as well as proxy votes and pairing. He doesn\u2019t raise the issue of those with vulnerable family members. Carmichael has asked: If scrutiny of government was as important to the Leader of the House as he is making it out to be, shouldn\u2019t the PM have made the statement to parliament before broadcasting it? The question of virtual participation for both those who are shielding, and those who are living with someone who is shielding, has been repeatedly raised. Rees-Mogg has said those who are shielding can vote by proxy, which he adds is the \u201cmajority\u201d of those who would be excluded. Parliament has been compared to school, with Zoom being called a \u201cgood stopgap\u201d but not the sufficient. Carmichael has agreed he doesn\u2019t want it used indefinitely, but it is right for this moment. Covid-19 has been confirmed among prisoners in a new prison, the latest update from the Ministry of Justice reveals. As of 5pm on Sunday, 485 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus in 80 prisons, compared with 482 inmates in 79 prisons on Thursday. The number of infected staff rose less than 1% in the period to 954 across 105 prisons. The numbers are not live cases and include those who have recovered. There are about 79,800 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and about 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. The current regime, which has included a ban on family visits, reduced time spent out of cells to about 30 minutes a day, suspended prison transfers and forced new arrivals to be quarantined for 14 days, has been hailed a success by ministers as deaths and infection rates behind bars have been significantly lower than expected. Twenty three prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. Rees-Mogg has said parliament has a duty to meet in person, saying parliament was running \u201cat a snail\u2019s pace\u201d. Others have disputed this, including by commenting on the queuing system\u2019s inefficiency. He has said the ending of virtual proceedings is contrary to government guidance to others. It has been proposed that there is a second vote on virtual process, as those who were shielding could not vote. Carmichael has added in event that \u201cit all goes horribly wrong\u201d there will only be one person - Rees-Mogg - and one party responsible for that. Carmichael has said his objection is based on public safety, and is not a question of personal interest. He raises the issue of having to travel by plane, with people who may be going to Aberdeen for hospital operation, saying \u201cthe idea I might inadvertently transmit the virus makes my blood run cold\u201d. There is an emergency debate in the House of Commons over the return to physical attendance, following a call by Jacob Rees Mogg. Shetland MP Alistair Carmichael has been a vocal critic, raising the government\u2019s guidance that those who can work from home should. And that concludes today\u2019s government coronavirus briefing. Hancock said he hoped the government would be able to get to a position where people were able to go on holiday this summer. For those who aren\u2019t able to go abroad for a holiday, I know the impact that that will have this summer. I understand that. I just hope that we will be able to get to a position where people will be able to go on holiday - including domestically - safely, carefully and in a Covid-secure way. The Guardian\u2019s Haroon Siddique asks: If, as you and the prime minister say, the UK is not a racist country, which implies there is not structural racism in the UK, please can you explain why black, asian and minority ethnic people are disproportionately dying from Covid-19? Could you also explain why black people are being fined disproportionately under lockdown rules? Hancock responds that it\u2019s important to \u201cget the science right\u201d around this, and take into account a number of considerations such as occupation, levels of comorbidity, housing, and then act. The absolutely critical piece of work is to follow on from the PHE report that was published last week with the answer to the question objectively and based on the science why is that death rate higher and take into account all the considerations. As and when we find conclusions we will put them into place. The second question went unanswered. When asked why the government is enforcing two-metre distancing while other countries, such as France, use one metre, Hancock said: \u201cThe science is clear, the closer you are the more likely you are to pass on the virus. He added that some other countries are also insisting on two-metre distancing, and the two-metre rule is under review at all time. He said the \u201ccurrent working plan\u201d was for secondary schools to fully reopen in England from September at the earliest, despite concerns about the two-metre rule making that difficult. For both schools and the economy it was a matter of working out how to open in a way that does not lead to an increased spread of the virus. That is going to require ingenuity, you can already see the ingenuity in lots of areas of the economy - bars that have turned themselves into takeaways, all sorts of different ways that people are providing services and making their business work in a way that is consistent with social distancing. We\u2019ve got to be innovative, we\u2019ve got to be thoughtful about this. Hancock insisted it is safe for people to send their loved ones into care homes. With all of the measures that we\u2019ve put in place over the past few months, all of the billions of pounds extra that we\u2019ve put in, it\u2019s clear that the epidemic in care homes is coming under control. Even those care homes where there are cases have very strong infection control procedures in place. In fact, if you look at the proportion of people in the UK who have sadly died in care homes, it is significantly lower than in comparable countries across Europe. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a trade off [between Covid-19 safety measures and the economy],\u201d said Hancock. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have control of this virus the the economy will suffer yet more.\u201d The job of the government has been to get the infection rate down, and then hold it down while reopening normal activity, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s both on the economy front and the things that make life worth living, like being able to see your grandparents. That is a massive piece of work\u201d It\u2019s \u201csimplistic\u201d to suggest it\u2019s a trade-off between the economy and health, he said. The data showing declining deaths and infections means the virus is \u201cin retreat\u201d, Hancock said: It is clear coronavirus is in retreat across the country, but we must be vigilant and cautious, and we are taking a safety-first approach It means we can proceed with our plan, for instance looking towards the proposals next week to the retail sector, and people can have confidence taking their children to school in the three years that we\u2019ve opened so far. One question from the public asked about research from scientists that the R rate has risen above one in certain parts of the country. Hancock said if localised outbreaks are seen action will be taken in hospitals and care homes. \u201cWhere there are individual flare-ups and outbreaks, then we will take action,\u201d he said. But looking at all models, \u201cscientists\u2019 conclusion is that the R rate is below one in all parts of the country\u201d although that is under constant review, he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to be as localised as possible, but further measures are available,\u201d he said, such as testing the nearby community. To mark Carers Week, Hancock offered his thanks to carers across the country for their work. \u201cYour duty and your devotion to a job that you do with love in incredibly challenging circumstances are a huge inspiration,\u201d he said, saying those who have been separated from their loved ones will be reunited soon. From today, all remaining adult care homes in England will be able to order the whole care home testing service for residents and staff. This is over 6,000 further care homes, Hancock said. The social care task force will oversee the next phase of social care support, developing a system to keep staff and residents safe as the lockdown is eased, Hancock said. He said that as of Saturday, tests have been sent to all residents and staff in elderly care homes in England, regardless of whether they have had symptoms or not. Over a million test kits have been sent to 9,000 elderly care homes, he said. The test results so far do not show a significant rise in positive cases, but homes are have been given the option to test when they prefer. David Pearson, newly-appointed chairman of the social care tasforce said: The taskforce will bring together the concerted and determined actions of central and local government with care providers. Our focus will be on stopping infection whilst trying to ensure the wellbeing of all people who receive care and support, whether they live in care homes or at home. Social care has a crucial role to play in supporting the people who receive care and support and their carers, and our job is to harness our efforts as we go through the various phases of this pandemic and support social care in its crucial role. The over-80s are 70 times more likely to die from coronavirus than the under-40s, Hancock said. \u201cI know personally what an anxious time it is, and it has been, for anyone with a loved one in social care,\u201d he said. He said \u201cright from the start\u201d the government provided for care homes with financial support, testing and stronger links with the NHS. The number of people dying in care homes is also falling, Hancock said. Figures from the CQC show a 79% fall from the peak of the crisis in care homes week ending 24 April, to week ending 29 May, the latest the data was available. ONS data show care homes deaths accounted for 29.1% of all Covid-19 deaths. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is leading today\u2019s government coronavirus briefing, today focused on social care. He is joined by David Pearson, the new chair of the national Covid-19 social care support task force. The latest figures: There were 138,183 tests carried out yesterday There were 1,205 new confirmed cases yesterday, the lowest since the end of March The number of Covid-19 hospital admissions in England, Wales and Northern Ireland was 519 (down from 661 on 29 May) The number of people on ventilators on the UK as a whole is 516 Sage estimates the R rate is below 1 in all regions, and the number of Covid-19 patients in hopsital is falling in all regions People who think they have had the coronavirus are less likely to download a contact-tracing app, even if they have no proof that they ever contracted the virus, according to a study published this week. The finding highlights the potential long-term damage of the UK government\u2019s early policy of not testing to confirm self-reported Covid-19 infection, the authors, from Imperial College\u2019s faculty of medicine, say. In the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, the authors analysed results from a questionnaire of more than 10,000 NHS users, and found that, for the UK at large, \u201ca willingness for app-based contact tracing is 60% \u2026 substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for app-based contact-tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic\u201d. Two main failings have kept that number low. The first is the fact that people who think they have already had the coronavirus are significantly less likely (27%) to say they will install a contact-tracing app than those who do not think they have caught the infection. In the absence of widespread testing, however, it is difficult to know how many of those people have had the disease. It also remains unclear precisely how much protection having caught Covid-19 affords someone against becoming a carrier again in the future. People who confessed to not understanding the government\u2019s messaging around the coronavirus were also less likely to download the app, the researchers found, posing a problem for strategies that involve regular nuanced updates to what people can and cannot do. But by far the largest reason for not wanting to download the app was privacy concerns, cited by two-thirds of those who said they would not download the app. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has just updated MPs in parliament on the government\u2019s coronavirus plan. \u201cCoronavirus is in retreat across the land,\u201d he said. \u201cOur plan is working and these downward trends mean we can proceed with our plans.\u201d David Pearson, former chief of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services \u201cwho has decades of experience of leadership in both social care and public health\u201d, will lead the government\u2019s new social care task force. Work is under way to give local authorities and GPs access to the data they need to track the virus spread. The aim is for testing of symptomatic people to have a 24-hour turnaround, while testing of asymptomatic people will use routes that have a slower turnaround. He failed to explain what the government\u2019s plan will be if the R number goes back up above one. \u201cI spoke to Professor [John] Edmunds at the weekend ... he said that quite rightly a cautious approach is what is needed, but there is scope to be able to allow some opening up, according to the plan that we\u2019ve got.\u201d He said that according to the 10 models considered by Sage, the R rate is below one in all regions of the country, even though individual models might differ. If you\u2019re wondering why the daily Covid-19 death toll for England today (59) is higher than the total for the whole of the UK (55), it\u2019s down to different reporting methods, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Public Health England (PHE) - which collates the numbers for the UK-wide total - picks up records from several different sources, including the NHS England death reports. The use of different sources means that PHE will sometimes identify individual deaths a day or two sooner. This means some of the deaths recorded in the NHS England total today will have already been reported in the UK-wide (PHE) total, most likely in the last couple of days. DHSC confirmed that deaths are not double counted; they are only included in the total once. It also said reporting time lags vary slightly in individual cases, so there is not a systematic difference between the series, but on occasion the daily total for the new series will be a touch lower. The UK government now has the joint-lowest approval rating worldwide for its management of coronavirus, according to YouGov polling. Only 41% of Britons say the government is managing the outbreak well, versus 56% who say it is mishandling it. This gives a net score of -15, down from -6 the week previously, and on a par with Mexico. This means the British government\u2019s approval rating is now lower than Donald Trump\u2019s. His administration\u2019s response to the crisis currently generates a net score of -12, down from -7 the week before, with 41% of Americans saying the government is performing well compared to 53% who say it is performing poorly. YouGov surveys also found the UK continues to lag far behind most other countries when it comes to face mask usage. The number of people reporting to wear face masks remains unchanged from the previous week at 21%, although this may rise when face coverings become mandatory on public transport from 15 June. Jacob Rees-Mogg said he has sympathy with MPs unable to attend parliament due to parental responsibilities during the coronavirus crisis. Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, tabled a motion - which was subsequently passed by MPs - preventing the resumption of virtual voting. He told the Commons Procedure Committee: I think everyone has sympathy for people with parental responsibilities. It is such an important responsibility for all of us. As it happens, this evening, I shall be moving a motion on sitting Fridays and one of my children is going to have to come into the House of Commons and sit in my office whilst I\u2019m doing this because there is no-one else to look after her because ... my family are at home in Somerset, one child who\u2019s back at school. This is very complicated and I can sympathise with members, and I have some experience of it, inevitably. Former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have sent recorded messages to the husband of Good Morning Britain host Kate Garraway to as he recovers from coronavirus, Peter Mandelson has revealed. Derek Draper, 52, has been in hospital for 10 weeks battling Covid-19, with Garraway recently revealing she had been warned by doctors he may never fully recover. Last week, she said the illness had \u201cwreaked extraordinary damage\u201d on Draper, who is a former lobbyist and political adviser. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett, Lord Mandelson said Draper\u2019s fight with coronavirus had \u201cbrought an enormous lot of people back together again\u201d. Mandelson, who served as a minister in Labour governments under Blair and Brown, said: The whole experience, the whole dreadful, tragic experience of what\u2019s happened to him has actually brought an enormous lot of people, who knew him in the 90s and beyond, who knew him in New Labour and the government. It\u2019s brought an enormous lot of people back together again. He\u2019s been a hugely unifying figure, ironically, through this terrible, terrible tragedy. Both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have sent him recorded messages, as have done the rest of us. We\u2019re now giving him music, we\u2019re giving him photographs in order to stimulate a response, we\u2019ve all come together, and we just hope, and pray, he will come through it. Draper was taken to hospital on 29 March after struggling to breathe. Doctors eventually put him in an induced coma on 5 April. He was now testing negative for Covid-19, his wife said last week. Mandelson added: \u201cIt is just incredible what that virus has done to him, to his lungs, to his liver, to his kidneys, and there were many, many points along this journey when none of us thought that he could possibly make it.\u201d As the UK government\u2019s easing of lockdown restrictions is gradually introduced, new quarantine regulations mean that passengers arriving in Britain from Monday will need to stay at home for 14 days. At Heathrow airport there was some confusion, however, as the first passengers subject to the new restrictions landed. Travellers were asked to fill in the online forms but evidence to prove the information was correct was not required. Some passengers were surprised by the lack of physical screening for the virus. Fiona Gathright, 59, travelled from Washington DC and will be living in Bristol with her fiance, who had flown in from Hong Kong. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even do a temperature check at either end, not in Washington before we got on the flight and not in London when we got off the flight,\u201d she said. \u201cSomebody could have been on the flight with a 100-plus temperature and gotten off and gone on their merry way.\u201d There was also some uncertainty over the exact details of the quarantine. \u201cThey told me that we could go get groceries. That\u2019s my understanding anyway. But we had thought if we couldn\u2019t get food we could order stuff online,\u201d Gathright said. Others said they were told not to leave the house for food shopping unless necessary. The travellers were told to try to avoid public transport when heading to their final destination but this was not possible for many. BP has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs, representing about 15% of the oil group\u2019s 70,000 staff, by the end of the year. Bernard Looney, the chief executive, told employees that the job cuts were essential to enable the company to cope with a global collapse in demand for oil owing to the coronavirus pandemic. He said BP must reinvent itself and emerge from the crisis a \u201cleaner, faster-moving and lower carbon company\u201d. The London-headquartered group has not said how many jobs will be lost in the UK but it is thought the figure could be close to 2,000. Looney told staff in a company-wide email on Monday: You are already aware that, beyond the clear human tragedy, there has been widespread economic fallout, along with consequences for our industry and our company. The oil price has plunged well below the level we need to turn a profit. We are spending much, much more than we make \u2013 I am talking millions of dollars, every day. And as a result, our net debt rose by $6bn in the first quarter. A further 59 people have died in hospital in England after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total to 27,490. The patients were aged between 34 and 100, with three aged between 54 and 68 known to have had underlying health conditions. No deaths were reported in London hospitals for the second day in a row but NHS England said a \u201csmall number\u201d of people had died and these would be included in figures in the next few days. A further 55 people have died after contracting Covid-19 in UK, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 40,597. The rise is the lowest daily total of newly reported deaths since 22 March, according to PA analysis, but there is often a lag in the reporting of deaths over a weekend and the government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. A leading epidemiologist has said success in tackling Covid-19 relies on leaders being honest about their strategy. In an article for the Guardian, Liam Smeeth, dean of the Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: Public confidence is critical to beating this epidemic because the key tools \u2013 social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation \u2013 only work if people fully engage. Two factors have massively dented public confidence, threatening control efforts. First, the obvious lack of a clear long-term strategy, which creates the impression of a government that is not in control. Second, a series of political mishaps. The health secretary blaming PPE shortages on NHS staff. The prime minister\u2019s confused address to the nation on 10 May. And a top government adviser \u2013 Dominic Cummings \u2013 breaking the very spirit of collective action needed to defeat the epidemic. If we are to control this epidemic, we need the whole country to be united in a collective effort. To achieve this we need to restore trust in the government. A starting point would be an unequivocal apology for the mistakes made so far. For each major error we need a clear plan in place for how the negative impact will be mitigated. We then need a clear long-term strategy for minimising the future impact of the epidemic, covering the possibilities of us getting an effective or partially effective vaccine, or no vaccine at all. This strategy needs to be explained to the whole population, and as new measures are announced, they must be presented as part of this overall strategy. A further three people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths in the country to 1,401. Another 42 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 14,438. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d that exam regulator Ofqual should put in place contingency plans for next summer\u2019s exams to account for a possible second wave of Covid-19 infections. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One: I think it is essential that Ofqual draws up plans in the event that there can\u2019t be exams next year because we are in a second spike. And the fact is also that young people and teachers will have lost quite a lot of teaching time so there has to be a real discussion about what those exams will look like. The students might need to have greater choice in the questions they answer. Because education has been so disrupted, it is absolutely right that Ofqual should plan for education not as normal. Bousted called on the UK government to follow the example of the devolved administrations in coming up with ways of teaching in different formats to tackle the spread of Covid-19, including the wider use of buildings to allow for physical distancing, as well as forms of long-distance learning. Dentists have called for key worker status and access to the government PPE supply chain, as one industry survey suggests only around one third of surgeries have opted to open today (36%). In an open letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the British Dental Association (BDA) said that \u201csince lockdown, support from across government for our members has been far too limited. That cannot continue\u201d. One dentist has described the return to work as \u201cnerve-wracking\u201d. Roy Woodhoo, 36, at Woodford Green Dental Care, told the PA news agency he has been \u201cfrustrated\u201d he has not been able to help patients for weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients calling up since the beginning of lockdown and it\u2019s been frustrating in that we have not been able to help them as much as we could,\u201d he said. The BDA previously warned there will be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for the industry, with patients likely to see a \u201cskeleton service\u201d today. A polling of 2,053 surgeries found that more than 60% of practices estimate they will be able to treat less than a quarter of the patient numbers they saw prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Just one third of practices said they had enough PPE to provide face-to-face care, and only 15% reported they would be able to offer a full range of treatment. Chair of the BDA, Mick Armstrong, said surgeries are \u201coperating at a fraction of their pre-pandemic capacity\u201d and asked the health secretary to \u201ctake responsibility to avert the existential crisis facing a service struggling with sky-high costs and radically reduced patient numbers\u201d. He added: For years, communities from Cornwall to Cumbria struggled to get appointments but were ignored. Without action from this government access problems - on an unprecedented scale - are going to be visited on millions of patients, in every part in England. A department of health and social care spokesman said: \u201cThe safety of patients and those working in dental practices will be our top priority. We are working around the clock to make sure frontline healthcare staff have the PPE they need and have made further supplies available to the dental sector via wholesalers last week.\u201d The luxury British brand Mulberry is planning to cut at least 25% of its global workforce of almost 1,400 to reduce costs as sales have suffered because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company, which employs 1,140 staff in the UK, is seeking to make the cuts across its entire business, from head office and retail to manufacturing and distribution. Mulberry has launched a consultation with the 470 staff whose jobs are at risk, a third of its workforce, with the aim to cut \u201capproximately\u201d a quarter of its global workforce. Downing Street has dismissed suggestions the system of quarantine for passengers arriving in the UK could be replaced by coronavirus checks at airports. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said people needed to self-isolate for 14 days as it could be a \u201csignificant number of days\u201d after becoming infected before they developed symptoms. The spokesman said: They could potentially have a test at the border, that test could say that they were negative for coronavirus and then a few days later they may start to develop symptoms and by that point they might have already been spreading the virus. This is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ve taken over the blog from Matthew for the rest of the day - please do get in touch with any questions or suggestions: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people\u2019s movements preventing an estimated 3.1 million deaths by the beginning of May, and 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say. Outbreak modellers at Imperial College London said that lockdown slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81% and lowered the reproduction number, R, of the epidemic below 1 in all countries they observed. When R is less than 1 the epidemic is in decline because, on average, each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other. As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate. The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans. Some 5.1% of the UK population was infected, according to a report published in Nature. \u201cOur model estimates that we are very far away from herd immunity,\u201d said Axel Gandy, a professor of statistics at Imperial and co-author on the study. Herd immunity is achieved when enough people are immune to a virus that outbreaks die out naturally. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe upwards of 70% of the population would need to be resistant for herd immunity to kick in. \u201cIt tells us we need to be very careful and not to release too much in one go because then you have no control,\u201d Gandy said. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully and do things slowly, so we can backtrack should they not work.\u201d The Downing Street lobby briefing is over. Here are some of the main lines. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman claimed there had been a \u201cgood level of compliance\u201d with the quarantine rules being introduced today. The spokesman played down the prospect of all EU countries being exempted from the quarantine rules from July. According to a report in the Sun, the PM would like all EU countries to be subject to an exemption from mid-July. The spokesman refused to confirm that. He just reminded journalists that the PM last week confirmed that the government was looking at setting up \u201cair corridors\u201d (exemptions) for particular countries The spokesman said that it was still the government\u2019s intention for non-essential shops to open from next Monday, subject to this being deemed safe. The final decision has not yet been taken, the spokesman said. He also said that he expected this to be a decision that would apply England-wide. The spokesman claimed that the Covid alert level was still moving down from 4, its current level, to 3. But he did not contest claims that moving to level 3 is no longer a precondition for lockdown measures being eased, as the government said when the alert level system was first announced. The spokesman played down a Financial Times report saying pubs and restaurants might be allowed to serve people outdoors from 22 June. The spokesman said that the plan was still for to happen from July. The spokesman said that Boris Johnson was \u201cworking as normal\u201d when asked if it was true that he needed long naps during the day. The claim was made in a Sunday paper, which suggested Johnson has not recovered fully from coronavirus. Asked about this, the spokesman said that Johnson was working as usual and that another story in the Sunday papers was about the PM playing tennis. When it was put to him that perhaps he needed the naps after playing tennis, the spokesman said: \u201cThe PM is working as normal.\u201d Matt Hancock would take the government press conference this afternoon at 5pm, the spokesman said. Second home owners in Wales may get the chance to take a holiday in their properties this summer, the Welsh first minister has said. Mark Drakeford revealed the Welsh government was discussing the possibility of people being able to use self-contained accommodation - but he said that local communities would have to support such a move. The first minister said: There is a distinction to be drawn between people who have their own kitchen and their own bathroom....That will be different, I think, to someone travelling to stay somewhere where they are sharing kitchens, showers, toilets, where inevitably the level of risk will be greater. Drakeford said that once a visitor arrived at, for example, a self-contained cottage, they would be governed by the Welsh advice not to travel more than five miles from their base. He acknowledged there had been concern from communities in parts of north-west and south-west Wales who worry that an influx of visitors could lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be with community consent,\u201d he said. Drakeford also said the possibility that pubs and restaurants could re-open in some way if the number of cases continued to fall would be discussed this week. He said: This will be on the list [of restrictions to discuss] with many other things. Whether it will be possible to do something at the end of this three-week cycle I can\u2019t make any promises about that. It will depend on whether the number of new cases in Wales continues to fall and whether that creates any additional headroom for us. Without public faith in government actions, the UK will never beat Covid-19, warns Liam Smeeth, dean of the Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Public confidence is critical to beating this epidemic because the key tools \u2013 social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation \u2013 only work if people fully engage. Two factors have massively dented public confidence, threatening control efforts.

If we are to control this epidemic, we need the whole country to be united in a collective effort. To achieve this we need to restore trust in the government. A starting point would be an unequivocal apology for the mistakes made so far. Addressing those who have been shielding because of a pre-existing health condition, Sturgeon said shielding \u201cremains necessary\u201d and should continue until 31 July. However, the first minister said she hoped to be able to move to a \u201ctailored position\u201d where individuals would be given more specialist advice on how to protect themselves from the virus. From 18 June, Sturgeon said, those who were shielding, unless they live in care homes, would be able to leave their home for daily exercise, but they woujld not be able to take part in sports or meet those from other households in the way other Scots have been able to. Sturgeon said she expected the measures to be put in place for the shielded group next week. They would be kept \u201cunder review\u201d before 31 July, she added. Sturgeon said at the briefing that she was \u201chopeful\u201d that if the suppression of the virus continued in the same way that it had in recent days, the review on 18 June would enable Scotland to move to the second phase of the coronavirus recovery. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has announced that no one has been recorded to have died in Scotland from confirmed Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, for the second day running. Sturgeon said this was very welcome news but cautioned against assuming the crisis was over. That result only included people with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases, but it meant the total deaths by that measure remained at 2,415. \u201cThis is, of course, the second day in a row that no deaths have been registered in the preceding 24 hours. This is very encouraging,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how long I have hoped to report such a development and I know all of you have longed to heare that, but even so we must exercise caution.\u201d Sturgeon said it was still \u201chighly likely\u201d more Covid cases would emerge in the next few days since recorded cases often fell over the weekend. The number of positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours grew by 18 to total 15,639 since the outbreak began; there were 1,042 patients in hospital, an increase of 40 from yesterday, with 24 people in intensive care, down by one. More courts and tribunal buildings are to reopen in England and Wales as the lockdown eases. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland praised the judiciary and court staff for ensuring that \u201cjustice has not stood still\u201d in recent months, as he said the latest move would give people confidence that justice could \u201ccontinue to be done in a way that is safe\u201d. A total of 16 more buildings across England and Wales have been assessed as suitable for socially-distanced hearings, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. This means that 184 court and tribunal buildings were open for essential face-to-face hearings, it added. In echoes of the Nightingale hospitals set up to help treat Covid-19 patients, the MoJ said work had started to identify suitable public venues such as civic centres to act as Nightingale courts, enabling more work to be carried out, such as full hearings, or allowing victims and witnesses to attend remotely, while maintaining physical distancing. Many hearings, where possible, both in the civil and criminal courts, have been conducted remotely since lockdown measures were imposed at the end of March. Sportspeople in Northern Ireland are returning to training after the lockdown eased significantly, PA reports. The main outdoor athletics track reopened, while large retailers like car showrooms and Debenhams in Belfast were also given the go-ahead to resume trading. People queued for entry to the department store selling clothes and furniture in a city centre which has been largely empty for weeks barring recent anti-racism rallies. Mary Peters Track, named after the Olympic gold medal-winning pentathlete from the city, is Northern Ireland\u2019s pre-eminent venue for athletes. Kerry Woods, a director at Athletics Northern Ireland, said: \u201cIt has been a very difficult time for our athletes, to try and find an alternative venue. It has been very challenging for a lot of them. We are delighted to have it back and up and open.\u201d Only 12 are allowed at the same time, with a maximum of six sportsmen and women and coaches working together. Sand pits for long jump remain closed, and athletes have to take their own equipment and use hand sanitisers. Normally at this time of year up to 28,000 people would use the south Belfast venue. The Scottish Tories have called on Nicola Sturgeon to sack her health secretary, Jeane Freeman, after it emerged that 18,000 shielding people with underlying health conditions were wrongly told they could leave their homes today. Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Tory leader, said it was the latest in a series of incidents where Freeman or her officials had allegedly blundered. Those included failing to disclose Scotland\u2019s first outbreak at a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February, and failing to test hospital patients being discharged into care homes. In an intervention demonstrating the temporary truce between the Scottish National party and Tories has now ended, Carlaw said his party had identified eleven times where Freeman had been lucky to remain in post. That included the disclosure at the weekend that hospital staff are still not being routinely tested for Covid-19. \u201cThe misplaced loyalty shown by the first minister to her health secretary is having a negative impact on the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cA litany of problems had built up before, not least infection deaths of children at the SNP\u2019s flagship hospital in Glasgow [the Queen Elizabeth], and the continued unacceptable delays of the new Sick Kids in Edinburgh. \u201cThese have been compounded by a dismal performance during the pandemic too. Nicola Sturgeon has to take the blinkers off and find someone who can actually get on top of these problems.\u201d The Daily Record reported today that nearly 18,000 shielding people were sent letters in April on behalf of the then chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, telling them they could stop shielding today, 8 June. Officials had miscalculated when those people began their 12 week long period of shielding: on Wednesday last week they were sent a further letter saying they needed to continue shielding until 18 June. A law graduate has set up a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for a possible private prosecution against Dominic Cummings for alleged breach in the lockdown rules. Mahsa Taliefar has raised more than \u00a31,350 towards a target of \u00a3300,000 for a legal fighting fund. She says any money not used for the legal action will be donated to the development charity Vision Aid Overseas. Taliefar says she has been subjected to misogynistic abuse since launching the appeal. In a message to her social media followers she said: \u201cI find that totally unacceptable given that the campaign has nothing to with my gender or looks. Many of Cummings supporters have also aggressively told me to \u2018move on\u2019 but we should not until he does so.\u201d She added: \u201cThis campaign is not politically motivated but simply holding those who refuse to apologise for [allegedly] breaking the law accountable.\u201d Separately, a campaign for a new investigation into Cummings over alleged breaches of the lockdown rules has been launched by lawyers with the backing of health workers and some families of coronavirus victims. The law firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, which specialises in human rights and civil liberties, said the move was part of a \u201ccitizens\u2019 bid\u201d for a thorough investigation into Cummings over his trips to Durham and Barnard Castle. One of the firm\u2019s partners, Mike Schwarz, says a three-day investigation by Durham police last month was flawed after it found that no further action was required. For the latest reaction to the Black Lives Matter protests across the UK, please go to our politics live blog: Passengers arriving at Stansted Airport on a flight from Eindhoven in the Netherlands have been sharing views on new quarantine measures with PA. Shopkeeper Netti Rexhmet, 32, who runs an off-licence in Chigwell in London, said the rule will prevent him from working for a fortnight. Speaking as he walked through arrivals on Monday, he said: We haven\u2019t got any other options, it\u2019s Government law so I shall do it. For me, I wouldn\u2019t want to do it. I\u2019d like to be open. I\u2019ve got things to do, you have to live now, you have to pay. Ali Gurlek, 30, a software developer from London who spent the weekend visiting friends in the Netherlands, said measures lacked \u201ccommon sense\u201d. He said: Now we\u2019re going to use public transport. If we have it then it\u2019s going to spread that. It doesn\u2019t look very common sense. Kamil Farah, 24, from East Ham, London, said: I don\u2019t want to do it but I have to for the better good. There\u2019s a lot of people dying and a lot of things happened this year. Opening beer gardens before the end of the month would give struggling pubs a psychological boost but most would still lose money, JD Wetherspoon\u2019s founder, Tim Martin, has said. The government is reportedly ready to let pub beer gardens in England reopen from 22 June as part of plans drawn up by a group of ministers, dubbed the \u201cSave Summer Six\u201d, who are looking at ways to restart the hospitality industry earlier than initially planned. The proposals, first reported in the Financial Times, would allow some of the 27,000 pubs that have outdoor space to serve customers for the first time in three months. Martin, the chairman of JD Wetherspoon, said: \u201cFew pubs will be able to make a profit using outdoor space only but partial reopening will provide a psychological boost to a beleaguered industry. \u201cIt will signal the intent of the government to make progress towards normality, which will be welcome.\u201d Almost 700 of Wetherspoons\u2019 867 pubs have a beer garden, roof terrace or patio and the company has previously set out plans for a coronavirus pandemic-era pub involving bar staff wearing goggles and protective screens between tables. Welcome to our UK coronavirus live coverage today, where controversial quarantine rules for new arrival have come into force. Britain\u2019s three biggest airlines have begun a challenge against the measures. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary has warned that the new rules will cause \u201cuntold devastation\u201d for the country\u2019s tourism industry. He told BBC Radio\u2019s 4\u2019s Today programme: What it is going to do is untold devastation, not just to the airlines but to British tourism. The thousands of hotels, the thousands of visitor attractions, restaurants in the next couple of months \u2013 July and August are the two key months for British tourism in the tourism industry. We\u2019re facing thousands of jobs losses because of a stupid, ineffective quarantine. He said Ryanair bookings were down about 50% on the same time last year but that outbound flights remained popular compared with inbound journeys, with European travellers being put off coming to the UK due to the restrictions to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival.",

A review is imperative if we are to avoid a repeat of the conditions seen during the first wave of the pandemic,\u201d said Dr Rinesh Parmar, the DAUK chair.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow is precisely the time to hold a rapid, focused inquiry into the provision of PPE to healthcare workers. There may be a second wave, and it may be soon. We know there has been an inadequate supply of out of date and perishing stock; we know our standards have fallen short of World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Control guidance. It would be unconscionable to ask our NHS and care sector to face that second wave without learning lessons from the first.\u201d</p> \n<p>The three applicants claim the government has breached article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which obliges ministers to take action to save lives and to instigate an inquiry where avoidable deaths have occurred.</p> \n<p>In a 10-page reply, solicitors in the government legal department said ministers did not need to hold the sort of inquiry the applicants are seeking. The Health and Safety Executive and coroners are already investigating cases where lack of PPE was apparently implicated in a health worker\u2019s death and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/inquests-nhs-staff-deaths-ppe-shortages\">HSE may launch prosecutions</a>, they said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fbb96cc0-be99-47f0-8544-bb0a39f4fbe1\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

The Guardian revealed in April that the specialist in neurorehabilitation at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading had emailed hospital managers asking for PPE but had his requests turned down.</p> \n<p>The DHSC\u2019s refusal to order an investigation into PPE will disappoint senior doctors, growing numbers of whom want the government to commission a wide-ranging public inquiry into all aspects of its preparations for and handling of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe list of those calling for an immediate public inquiry reads like the great and the good of the worlds&nbsp;of medicine and public administration,\u201d said Maugham.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut government, I believe, is too much concerned with managing public perceptions of its handling of the crisis \u2013 even if that means we fail to learn the lessons that will minimise future loss of life.\u201d</p> \n<p>In their letter government lawyers also contend that \u201copening an immediate public inquiry may not be an effective way to learn urgent lessons \u2026 [and] risks diverting attention from the [government\u2019s] response [to coronavirus]; slowing down government action; and potentially risking lives \u2026 It might carry serious risks.\u201d</p> \n<p>A DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cWe cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d</p>",

They want to compel ministers to hold an independent inquiry into PPE and ensure staff in settings looking after Covid-19 patients will be able to obtain the gowns, masks, eye protection and gloves they need if, as many doctors fear, there is a second wave of the disease. About 300 UK health workers have so far died of Covid-19, and many NHS staff groups and families claim inadequate PPE played a key role in exposing them. The case is being brought against Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, by the Doctors\u2019 Association UK (DAUK), the Good Law Project headed by Jolyon Maugham QC, and the charity Hourglass, which campaigns on issues involving care homes. They are paying for the lawsuit through crowdfunding, which has so far raised more than \u00a341,000. They launched their legal action after government lawyers said an inquiry was unnecessary and would distract the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and other key bodies involved in arranging the supply of PPE or guidance about what kit should be used. \u201cWe are appalled at the government\u2019s refusal to urgently commission an independent public inquiry to examine all the facts from the planning to the procurement to the provision of PPE and learn lessons. A review is imperative if we are to avoid a repeat of the conditions seen during the first wave of the pandemic,\u201d said Dr Rinesh Parmar, the DAUK chair. \u201cNow is precisely the time to hold a rapid, focused inquiry into the provision of PPE to healthcare workers. There may be a second wave, and it may be soon. We know there has been an inadequate supply of out of date and perishing stock; we know our standards have fallen short of World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Control guidance. It would be unconscionable to ask our NHS and care sector to face that second wave without learning lessons from the first.\u201d The three applicants claim the government has breached article 2 of the European convention on human rights, which obliges ministers to take action to save lives and to instigate an inquiry where avoidable deaths have occurred. In a 10-page reply, solicitors in the government legal department said ministers did not need to hold the sort of inquiry the applicants are seeking. The Health and Safety Executive and coroners are already investigating cases where lack of PPE was apparently implicated in a health worker\u2019s death and the HSE may launch prosecutions, they said. Michael Tun, whose father, Dr Peter Tun, died of Covid-19 earlier in the pandemic after trying in vain to get PPE for his unit, is backing the legal challenge. The Guardian revealed in April that the specialist in neurorehabilitation at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading had emailed hospital managers asking for PPE but had his requests turned down. The DHSC\u2019s refusal to order an investigation into PPE will disappoint senior doctors, growing numbers of whom want the government to commission a wide-ranging public inquiry into all aspects of its preparations for and handling of the pandemic. \u201cThe list of those calling for an immediate public inquiry reads like the great and the good of the worlds of medicine and public administration,\u201d said Maugham. \u201cBut government, I believe, is too much concerned with managing public perceptions of its handling of the crisis \u2013 even if that means we fail to learn the lessons that will minimise future loss of life.\u201d In their letter government lawyers also contend that \u201copening an immediate public inquiry may not be an effective way to learn urgent lessons \u2026 [and] risks diverting attention from the [government\u2019s] response [to coronavirus]; slowing down government action; and potentially risking lives \u2026 It might carry serious risks.\u201d A DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cWe cannot comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d",

Almost all those who were appalled by Edward Colston being dumped in the river had cheered when the statue of Saddam Hussein had been torn down. Nor was anyone calling for Colston to be reinstated on its plinth. Quite the reverse in fact, as many people in Bristol and elsewhere were rethinking the importance of figures with a murky colonial past in their cities. It was almost as if the protesters had done everyone a favour. They had got rid of a statue no one wanted and allowed the politicians to sound high-minded about the way in which it had been done. In Westminster they call that a win-win.",

He said: \u201cWe must capitalise on this moment of change and that\u2019s why I have now tasked City Hall officials to work on an urgent new action plan to be developed with community groups and the police, but all public bodies need to change.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe plan will look to improve trust and confidence as well as transparency, and is intended to cover how our communities can better scrutinise policy and tactics that are still a source of concern in 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the West Midlands, where BLM protests closed part of the M6 on Sunday night, the police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, said he would convene a meeting of community leaders on Thursday to hear concerns that would be passed on to police.</p> \n<p>A public order policing expert warned of the risk of serious rioting if police were pressured into taking a heavier hand with protesters. Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, said: \u201cThe potential as we move on is for widespread rioting and what we are trying to avoid at the moment is a major escalation of public discontent, which is quite clearly there given the levels of mobilisation that are going on.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose levels of mobilisation are very much about police action towards the black community. If we are to ignite a situation where police action is seen to be acting disproportionately again towards that community we are in very dangerous territory indeed.\u201d</p> \n<p>After police stood by and watched the statue toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">statue of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/fall-of-bristols-colston-statue-revives-rhodes-campaign-in-oxford\">the colonialist Cecil Rhodes</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happened in Bristol is the catalyst for this protest,\u201d said Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a global surge against anti-blackness which has allowed us to rejuvenate that debate. It\u2019s what we saw with Colston \u2013 it was Black Lives Matter who took down that statue of a slave owner. We\u2019re reaffirming our demands to Oxford that they should themselves take this down as a matter of principle and matter of urgency.\u201d</p> \n<p>The campaign group\u2019s demand was backed by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. She said: \u201cThe statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. That\u2019s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.\u201d The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she was not endorsing vigilante action, but urged Oriel College \u201cto think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it\u201d. Thames Valley police said they supported the public\u2019s right to peaceful protest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec5ef09e54105d35c2fb3c5a7bc53830e95df2a3/0_364_6336_3802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An empty plinth in Bristol after the statue of Edward Colston was thrown in the harbour.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as the action in Bristol, tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday.

I went both on Saturday and Sunday. It was incredible to see so many people calling for justice, but it\u2019s been disappointing to see politicians focus on violence.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe way the right has reacted to the protest has been ridiculous, especially their defence of these racist statues and the policing. They are proof of how much these protests are needed in the first place.\u201d</p> \n<p>New BLM protests and coordinated actions are planned for at least 25 cities across the UK this week, with concerns voiced by the anti-racism campaign group Hope not Hate<strong> </strong>that supporters of a rightwing group that has previously clashed with anti-fascist campaigners are planning to travel to London on Saturday to confront demonstrators.</p> \n<p>Organised by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/03/crystal-palace-urged-to-condemn-democratic-football-lads-alliance\">Democratic Football Lads Alliance</a>, a network that emerged after the 2017 terrorist attacks, supporters from areas including Sunderland, Yorkshire, the West Midlands and East Anglia intend to surround and protect war memorials and other statues in central London.

The initiative from Sadiq Khan to apply pressure on the Metropolitan police, the UK\u2019s largest force, over the use of stop and search, Tasers and other practices comes amid concerns about the spread of coronavirus in crowds, and fears of violence as it emerged that far-right groups were planning counter-demonstrations. Steps to address anger over systemic racism, brought into sharp focus after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, contrast with UK ministers\u2019 rhetoric and pressure from Tory backbenchers for police and prosecutors to crack down on disorder. Boris Johnson acknowledged the \u201cincontrovertible, undeniable feeling of injustice\u201d behind the BLM protests, in an article for the black newspaper the Voice, in which he also strongly condemned those who have flouted social distancing to attend them. He wrote that he would not support such action \u201cfor the obvious reason that we risk a new infection at a critical time and just as we have made huge progress\u201d, adding that: \u201cThose who attack public property or the police \u2013 who injure the police officers who are trying to keep us all safe \u2013 those people will face the full force of the law.\u201d On Monday, the home secretary, Priti Patel, repeated her condemnation of \u201cvandalism\u201d by \u201cthugs and criminals\u201d following 200 BLM protests over the weekend, during which demonstrators toppled a statue of a 17th-century slave trader in Bristol and daubed graffiti on a statue of Winston Churchill in the capital. She said 137,500 people attended the protests and there were 135 arrests, with 35 police officers injured in London. Tory backbenchers urged Patel to ensure those who took part in disorder in London at the weekend would \u201cface the full force of the law\u201d.

Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said it was \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d for protesters to pull down a statue of Edward Colston and dump it in the harbour in Bristol \u2013 putting him at odds with some MPs on the left of his party \u2013 while emphasising the monument should never have been there in the first place. Khan said the focus should be on rooting out systemic racism, discrimination and inequality from society as he called for \u201ca clear commitment to change\u201d. While the Labour mayor cannot order the Met to curtail stop and search or the use of Tasers, he wields political influence over the force, and the Met\u2019s strategy often influences other forces. Home Office data shows black people in England and Wales were 9.5 times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched in 2017-18. Met police officers were four times more likely to use force against black people compared with white people, according to Scotland Yard data from 2018. Figures last week revealed officers enforcing the coronavirus lockdown were more than twice as likely to issue fines to black people as to white people. After discussions with community leaders Khan has asked two of his deputies to take the measures forward. He said: \u201cWe must capitalise on this moment of change and that\u2019s why I have now tasked City Hall officials to work on an urgent new action plan to be developed with community groups and the police, but all public bodies need to change. \u201cThe plan will look to improve trust and confidence as well as transparency, and is intended to cover how our communities can better scrutinise policy and tactics that are still a source of concern in 2020.\u201d In the West Midlands, where BLM protests closed part of the M6 on Sunday night, the police and crime commissioner, David Jamieson, said he would convene a meeting of community leaders on Thursday to hear concerns that would be passed on to police. A public order policing expert warned of the risk of serious rioting if police were pressured into taking a heavier hand with protesters. Clifford Stott, a professor at Keele University who has advised the Home Office on public order strategy, said: \u201cThe potential as we move on is for widespread rioting and what we are trying to avoid at the moment is a major escalation of public discontent, which is quite clearly there given the levels of mobilisation that are going on. \u201cThose levels of mobilisation are very much about police action towards the black community. If we are to ignite a situation where police action is seen to be acting disproportionately again towards that community we are in very dangerous territory indeed.\u201d After police stood by and watched the statue toppled in Bristol, the focus will shift on Tuesday to Oxford, where hundreds of students and residents are expected to attend a protest calling for the removal of Oxford University\u2019s statue of the colonialist Cecil Rhodes. \u201cWhat happened in Bristol is the catalyst for this protest,\u201d said Femi Nylander, an organiser for Rhodes Must Fall in Oxford. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a global surge against anti-blackness which has allowed us to rejuvenate that debate. It\u2019s what we saw with Colston \u2013 it was Black Lives Matter who took down that statue of a slave owner. We\u2019re reaffirming our demands to Oxford that they should themselves take this down as a matter of principle and matter of urgency.\u201d The campaign group\u2019s demand was backed by the Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. She said: \u201cThe statues of white supremacists and slave merchants should not still be standing in our cities. That\u2019s why the statue of Cecil Rhodes must come down.\u201d The MP for Oxford West and Abingdon said she was not endorsing vigilante action, but urged Oriel College \u201cto think about what message this statue sends in 2020, and to remove it\u201d. Thames Valley police said they supported the public\u2019s right to peaceful protest. As well as the action in Bristol, tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday. In London, where an estimated 10,000 demonstrated outside the US embassy, protesters were criticised for spraying the word \u201cracist\u201d on a Churchill statue. One protester, 17-year-old Edan from north London, said she was energised by the protests and hoped to see more. \u201cI thought the protest was amazing. I went both on Saturday and Sunday. It was incredible to see so many people calling for justice, but it\u2019s been disappointing to see politicians focus on violence. \u201cThe way the right has reacted to the protest has been ridiculous, especially their defence of these racist statues and the policing. They are proof of how much these protests are needed in the first place.\u201d New BLM protests and coordinated actions are planned for at least 25 cities across the UK this week, with concerns voiced by the anti-racism campaign group Hope not Hate that supporters of a rightwing group that has previously clashed with anti-fascist campaigners are planning to travel to London on Saturday to confront demonstrators. Organised by the Democratic Football Lads Alliance, a network that emerged after the 2017 terrorist attacks, supporters from areas including Sunderland, Yorkshire, the West Midlands and East Anglia intend to surround and protect war memorials and other statues in central London. The group was urged on by the former leader of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson (whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), who released a video angrily denouncing the defacement of the Churchill statue. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to remove text describing the Democratic Football Lads Alliance as \u201cfootball fans\u201d.",

On Saturday the Guardian updated its database and found the number of deaths had risen to 434, and later that morning the Department of Corrective Services in Western Australia confirmed that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/09/black-lives-matter-protesters-referred-to-our-count-of-432-aboriginal-deaths-in-custody-its-now-437\">40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 9 June. Top stories A man has driven his car into a crowd of Black Lives Matter protesters in Seattle and opened fire. A demonstrator who confronted him was shot and wounded but is now in a stable condition in hospital. In Virginia, a self-described Ku Klux Klan leader has been charged with assault after driving his car into a group of protesters. At Capitol Hill in Washington, Democrats took a knee to honour George Floyd before unveiling a police reform bill designed to prevent future deaths in custody. The lawmakers knelt in Emancipation Hall for eight minutes and 46 seconds to recognise the length of time a police officer had his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. Australia\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests highlighted the deaths of 432 Aboriginal people in police custody. Shockingly, that number has now risen to 437. Many signs at rallies referred to the 432 deaths that are known to have happened since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody delivered its final report in 1991, based on a Guardian Australia investigation called Deaths Inside. On Saturday the Guardian updated its database and found the number of deaths had risen to 434, and later that morning the Department of Corrective Services in Western Australia confirmed that a 40-year-old Aboriginal man had died in custody at Acacia prison, near Perth. As of today, based on reports that have reached us from families and other sources, including coronial reports, we can say that number is now at least 437. In Sydney, prisoners at Long Bay have used their bodies to spell out BLM after police used teargas to break up a fight. Helicopter footage from above the prison showed inmates lying down along the fence line, surrounded by dozens of officers in riot gear. The government will end free childcare on 12 July in a move Labor say will \u201csnap\u201d families. The policy was part of the emergency relief package introduced at the height of the pandemic, which the education minister, Dan Tehan, claims has \u201cdone its job\u201d. Labor and the Greens have warned that the reintroduction of fees may push childcare out of the reach of struggling families. The government will also no longer pay the jobkeeper wage subsidy to childcare services from 20 July, a move that has sparked opposition claims of a broken promise. Scott Morrison said last week the scheme had been legislated to apply for six months \u201cand people can count on that\u201d. Australia A study published in the Journal of Australian Indigenous Issues has found that 75% of Australians hold an implicit bias against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The study is based on more than 11,000 unique responses to an implicit association test over 10 years. The Coalition will extend a tax incentive for small businesses by six months as part of a smaller package of stimulus measures. The policy allows small businesses to instantly write off the value of assets worth up to $150,000 per item. Police in NSW took more than a year to investigate the potentially illegal strip search of a 19-year-old woman. The police said the investigation concluded in November, and one of the officers had resigned, but Lucy Moore was never told about the outcome. The world Covid-19 restrictions have been dropped in New Zealand after Jacinda Ardern declared the country coronavirus-free. The prime minister said she \u201cdid a little dance\u201d when she heard there were no cases of coronavirus left in the country. The UK health secretary has hailed a coronavirus retreat after deaths in the country decreased. Matt Hancock says the number of deaths have fallen to the lowest daily total since 22 March. Prince Andrew\u2019s lawyers have accused the US of misleading the public over the Jeffrey Epstein case after the Department of Justice demanded he cooperate with the investigation. The London-based criminal law specialists Blackfords said the DoJ had ignored offers of assistance from the prince and broke its own confidentiality rules. Recommended reads Lockdown could be a frustrating and worrying experience, but for some the change to their pace of life was rewarding. Twelve writers document the lockdown habits they intend to keep, from growing houseplants to holding a flatmates\u2019 picnic. Osman Faruqi started an album club, with his first Zoom session spent discussing Dua Lipa\u2019s Future Nostalgia with a dozen people from all over the world. Andrew P Street learned to love doing his laundry. And Natalie Parletta let her hair go grey: \u201cFor me, it means no more regular trips to the hairdresser to hide the dreaded regrowth, no more chemicals and no more exorbitant fees. Freedom!\u201d Greg Jericho writes about Donald Trump\u2019s empty boasts about the US economy. \u201cWhen Trump tweeted on Monday, \u2018I built the greatest economy in the World, the best the US has ever had.

Our financial situation is not one with a huge amount of wriggle room.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump plans to start holding campaign rallies in person again in the next two weeks, despite the coronavirus pandemic continuing in the US and experts warning about the public health dangers of crowding at events. The president has not held an election rally since 2 March in Charlotte, North Carolina, as cases of coronavirus in the US began to increase. Trump\u2019s campaign advisers are still determining where the rallies will take place and what safety measures will be implemented, depending on the type of venue chosen, Politico reported on Monday, adding that campaign manager Brad Parscale is expected to present Trump with possibilities within the next few days. Aides describe Trump as champing at the bit to get out and start campaigning again ahead of the 3 November US presidential election. An official, confirming Politico\u2019s report, said safety measures for attendees were still being worked out. In a statement, Parscale predicted Trump rallies will surpass those of his Democrat rival for the White House, Joe Biden, whose campaigning has also been sharply curtailed due to the virus in recent months, but who is leading the president in several recent polls. Trump is under pressure to reverse his tumbling prospects for re-election, and is counting on a rebound in the US economy, which was rocked by the global pandemic. He also is grappling with mass protests that erupted after George Floyd died on 25 May after a white police officer knelt on his neck. Experts have warned of the risks of protesters contracting Covid-19, as social distancing has often fallen by the wayside during demonstrations and marches, as well as police and demonstrators often being seen not wearing masks. There is a lower risk of spreading the virus person to person outdoors, and there is no word yet on whether Trump will resume rallies at indoor or outdoor venues. Trump has already sparked a row over his assertion that he will seek a new state to host this summer\u2019s Republican national convention after North Carolina refused to guarantee the event could be held in Charlotte without size restrictions because of ongoing concerns over the pandemic. The president has lobbied for a full-scale convention without face coverings, despite the threat of the virus. Trump has already veered into electioneering during recent work trips and during previous coronavirus briefings and now wants to get back on the road as a candidate.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s retailers suffered a second successive slump in monthly sales during May as the coronavirus shutdown took its toll on the high street. Price cutting by furniture and homewares shops, which were among the worst hit, failed to entice customers to open their wallets, leaving last month\u2019s sales figures down by 5.9% compared with the same month last year. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said there were some glimmers of hope last month, which figures from Barclaycard supported, but the outlook remained grim for many retailers even as the lockdown began to ease. From 15 June, most shops will be allowed to re-open, though a demand by ministers that they require customers to maintain physical distancing has thrown the sector into confusion and sparked demands in some quarters for a relaxation of the distancing rule from 2 metres to 1 metre. Last month the BRC warned that shops face a \u201cfight for survival\u201d in the coming months as they try to restore their fortunes with tough new physical distancing and health and safety requirements. Its latest monthly health check of the retail sector found May\u2019s decrease was the second worst decline on record after April\u2019s 19% collapse. Across the industry, the falling demand for petrol and the temporary closure of many retail outlets meant most retailers remained stuck in reverse gear last month. There was an uplift for supermarkets and local convenience stores, which enjoyed a second month of soaring sales as shoppers focused on food and were reluctant to travel far to find it. Analysis of those shops allowed to stay open throughout lockdown found that in May, like-for-like sales increased 7.9% from May 2019. Office supplies, fitness equipment and bicycles all performed well, thanks to strong online sales, and DIY was boosted by the reopening of garden centres, the BRC said. Helen Dickinson, the BRC\u2019s chief executive said: \u201cSales in May demonstrated yet another month of struggle for retailers across the country, despite an improvement on the previous month. \u201cNonetheless, as the sun came out and restaurants lay dormant, food sales rose with consumers taking to their local parks for beers, BBQs and picnics. Clothing and beauty sales improved slightly on April, as people left their homes to meet outside with friends and family.\u201d Echoing the BRC\u2019s retail sales report, Barclaycard said consumer spending fell 26.7% in May, compared with the same month a year earlier. While consumers spent 24.5% more at supermarkets, pushing up the amount spent on its list of essential items by 0.9%, this was not enough to overcome a 36.9% drop in sales of non-essentials. Barclaycard, which says it uses data from almost half of the nation\u2019s credit and debit card transactions, said declines at department stores and in clothing sales of 44.5% and 42.4% respectively added to the decline in non-essential items. However, May\u2019s figures were an improvement on April when spending on non-essential items contracted by 47.7%.",

class=\"block-title\">Lockdowns reduced infection rate by 81%, study finds</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people\u2019s movements preventing an estimated 3.1m deaths by the beginning of May, with 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say.</p> \n  <p>Outbreak modellers at Imperial College London said that lockdown slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81% and lowered the reproduction number, R, of the epidemic below 1 in all countries they observed.</p> \n  <p>When R is less than 1 the epidemic is in decline because on average, each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other. As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. </p> \n  <p>The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.</p> \n  <p>The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans. Some 5.1% of the UK population was infected, according to a report <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">published in Nature</a>. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur model estimates that we are very far away from herd immunity,\u201d said Axel Gandy, a professor of statistics at Imperial and co-author on the study. Herd immunity is achieved when enough people are immune to a virus that outbreaks die out naturally. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe upwards of 70% of the population would need to be resistant for herd immunity to kick in. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt tells us we need to be very careful and not to release too much in one go because then you have no control,\u201d Prof Gandy said. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully and do things slowly, so we can backtrack should they not work.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T15:11:40.880Z\">at 4.11pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ede31e98f083999a26dc398\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-08T12:53:36.098Z\">1.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Authorities in <strong>Pakistan</strong> have stepped up efforts to enforce protocols after the number of coronavirus infections surpassed 100,000. </p> \n  <p>Official statistics released today showed 103,671 confirmed cases and 2,067 from Covid-19.

British households are expected to rack up debts worth a combined \u00a36bn because of the coronavirus crisis, as millions of people fall behind on credit card payments, council tax and utility bills. Sounding the alarm as the economic fallout from the health emergency mounts, the StepChange debt advice charity said 4.6m households risked building up dangerous levels of debt because of the pandemic. The charity warned that debts racked up during the crisis would stifle the country\u2019s economic recovery and that debt advisory services would be deluged once the reality of people\u2019s situations began to hit home in the coming months. Infections globally have passed 7 million and deaths have passed 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Covid-19 infections now stand at 7,085,894, while the official death toll is at 405,168. Over half of pregnant women hospitalised for coronavirus in UK were BAME, a study has found. The research looked at data for 427 pregnant women admitted to 194 obstetric units in the UK with a positive Covid-19 infection between 1 March and 14 April. A Brazilian senator has called for an inquiry into Covid-19 data, after Brazil shared contradictory figures on deaths and infections. The discrepancy prompted criticism from across the political spectrum, and a leading newspaper has reported the health ministry slashed the number of deaths it reported by 857 because president Jair Bolsonaro wanted less than a thousand deaths a day. South Africa has passed 1,000 deaths and 50,000 cases. The grim milestones were passed just a week after the country further eased lockdown restrictions. At 50,879 the number of detected infections is the worst in Africa, and two-thirds are in the Western Cape province. South Africa ranks second in terms of deaths at 1,080 after Egypt. Antiracist protesters should wear masks, says Tedros. The director general of the WHO has called on people attending antiracism protests to wear masks, as he warned that the biggest threat in the ongoing coronavirus outbreak \u201cwas now complacency.\u201d The UK has recorded its lowest daily death toll since 22 March. A further 55 people have died after contracting Covid-19 in UK, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 40,597. This is the lowest daily total of newly reported deaths since 22 March, but there is often a reporting lag over a weekend. The figures do not include all deaths across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. A study has found that more than half of pregnant women recently admitted to UK hospitals with coronavirus were from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background. The peer-reviewed research, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at data for pregnant women admitted to 194 obstetric units in the UK with a positive Covid-19 infection between 1 March and 14 April. It found that of the 427 pregnant women in hospital during that period, 233 (56%) were from BAME backgrounds, of which 103 were Asian and 90 were black. The high proportion of pregnant women from BAME groups remained after excluding major urban centres from the analysis. Researchers, led by Professor Marian Knight from the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, said the findings now require \u201curgent investigation and explanation\u201d. The study also found: 70% were overweight or obese 40% were aged 35 or over 34% had underlying health conditions Five of the women died \u2013 including three as a direct result of complications linked to coronavirus \u2013 while 41 (10%) needed respiratory support in a critical care unit, the study found. The coronavirus has been reported in at least 188 countries. Here are a few countries that have not reported any cases so far, courtesy of Al Jazeera: Kiribati Marshall Islands Micronesia Nauru North Korea Palau Samoa Solomon Islands Tonga Turkmenistan Tuvalu Vanuatu In what could pose a serious issue for the UK\u2019s contact tracing plans, a study has found people who think they have had coronavirus are less likely to download a contact-tracing app, even if they have no proof that they ever contracted the virus. The finding highlights the potential long-term damage of the UK government\u2019s early policy of not testing to confirm self-reported Covid-19 infection, the authors, from Imperial College\u2019s faculty of medicine, say.

Brazil\u2019s health ministry slashed the number of new Covid-19 deaths it reported on Sunday by 857 because far-right president Jair Bolsonaro wanted less than a thousand deaths a day, a leading newspaper has reported. Bolsonaro has sought to control information Brazilians receive about the pandemic which has killed 36,455 people and infected 691,758 here, according to John Hopkins University figures. On Sunday the health ministry said 1,382 deaths had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, but later corrected it down to 525. On Monday the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported that the correction was ordered because Bolsonaro wanted the number of deaths at less than a thousand a day. He has vociferously attacked social isolation and notoriously quipped \u201cso what?\u201d to the rising death toll in April. To accommodate him, the health ministry separated out all the deaths reported over 24 hours \u2013 as it had been doing for months \u2013 and began including only deaths that had actually occurred during the last day. The correction came two days after the Ministry stopped releasing accumulated cases and deaths in a daily bulletin and wiped a government site clean of data \u2013 a move also reportedly ordered by Bolsonaro that provoked widespread condemnation. Leading Brazilian media organisations are teaming up to provide a daily count at 8pm each day, and the National Council of State Health Secretaries is also updating numbers each day. On Monday WHO executive director Michael Ryan said Brazilians needed to understand where the virus was, how to manage risk and that the WHO hoped communication would be \u201cconsistent and transparent\u201d, Reuters said. The health ministry said this week it will launch an interactive site with Covid-19 data. On Monday it had \u201ccorrected duplications and updated data released about cases and obits from Covid-19 last Sunday.\u201d It cited discrepancies that were corrected in two states but did not explain what happened or why. Brazil has drawn further criticism for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic after sharing contradictory figures on deaths and infections, intensifying a scandal over the country\u2019s Covid-19 data. A senator called for a congressional inquiry and the discrepancy prompted criticism from across the political spectrum after initial health ministry data on Brazil\u2019s number of cases and death toll was contradicted by numbers uploaded to the ministry\u2019s online data portal. On Monday, the ministry said in a statement the discrepancy was predominantly due to mistakes in the numbers from two states that were later corrected. It explained that the later, lower daily death toll of 525 was the correct one. Senator Eliziane Gama, leader of centrist party Citizenship, asked the Senate to open an inquiry into the numbers, while the WHO stressed the importance of \u201cconsistent and transparent\u201d communication from Brazil. It ranks second in confirmed cases, behind the United States, and its death toll last week surpassed Italy\u2019s. The discrepancy followed recent decisions to remove from a national website a trove of data about the country\u2019s outbreak, and to push back the daily release of new numbers late into the evening and after the country\u2019s main television news program. Brazil could see Covid-19 deaths rise to 165,960 by August, above the forecast for the United States which has 100 million more people, according to a new projection by the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The updated forecast suggests Brazil\u2019s epidemic could become the most lethal globally. For Carlos Machado, head of research at the National School of Public Health, part of the respected public institute Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the lack of dependable data in Brazil is dangerous. \u201cNot having updated and reliable data during a pandemic of this proportion is like driving in the dark,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we do not have a vaccine, information is the best weapon we have.\u201d \u201cBy changing the numbers, the ministry of health covers the sun with a sieve,\u201d Rodrigo Maia, speaker of the lower house, said on Twitter. \u201cThe credibility of the statistics needs to be urgently recovered. A ministry that manipulates numbers creates a parallel world in order not to face the reality of the facts.\u201d According to the council, Brazil had recorded 680,456 cases of Covid-19 and 36,151 deaths from the disease by the end of Sunday afternoon. Senior Greek officials have expressed concern at an increase of coronavirus cases a week before the country is set to launch its holiday season. Of 97 new cases recorded since Thursday, nearly a third had been foreigners arriving from abroad, said a health ministry statement. Two deaths were recorded over the same period to Monday, AFP reports. \u201cWhoever thinks that we\u2019re rid of the virus is wrong,\u201d said Nikos Hardalias, the deputy minister for civil protection. \u201cWe have to be vigilant and respect the measures to prevent the propagation of the virus.\u201d From 15 June, the two main airports of Athens and Thessaloniki in the north will be able to receive visitors from around 30 countries, mostly in the European Union. Regional airports are due to open on 1 July. Greece has so far recorded 3,049 cases of coronavirus and 182 deaths since the end of February, according to ministry figures. Of the 97 most recently recorded cases, 29 of them were in the northeast region of Xanthi, which was hit by the virus in April. The ministry has announced that it will resume the publication of daily figures on the coronavirus situation in the country. It had stopped last week as the numbers of new cases each day fell below five. Greece has been gradually opening up again since 4 May after a strict, six-week shutdown to try to contain the outbreak there. Cafes and bars have been open again for two weeks, but social distancing measures are not often respected. Last weekend, officials closed a bar on the island of Mykonos where social distancing was being ignored and fined the owner 20,000 euros. A reader has written in to highlight the situation in Bolivia\u2019s hospitals. A state of national emergency in the country\u2019s ICU wards was declared by doctors in the Bolivian Society of Critical Medicine and Intensive Care late on Sunday night. The Society has warned of a probable dire scenario in coming weeks, local sources report. Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan and his family have recovered from the coronavirus, AFP reports. \u201cWe have just received the results of our repeat tests,\u201d Pashinyan, 45, said on Facebook. All of his tests and those of his family were negative, he added. The Armenian leader announced on 1 June that he and his family had tested positive for the virus and he would be working from home. The announcement came nearly a month after Armenia lifted a state of emergency imposed in March to slow the spread of the virus. The Caucasus nation of some three million people has struggled to contain the pandemic. As of Monday, health officials have registered 13,325 cases and 211 deaths. Pashinyan acknowledged last week that the country\u2019s health care system was overwhelmed and he has previously admitted his government failed to enforce anti-virus measures. Conspiracy theories and disinformation on social media undermined government efforts to fight the outbreak, analysts have said. For those of you who are just waking up and joining the blog, welcome \u2013 here\u2019s a quick round-up of what you\u2019ve missed. Infections globally have passed 7 million and deaths have passed 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Covid-19 infections now stand at 7,068,144, while the official death toll is at 404,304. South Africa has passed 1,000 deaths and 50,000 cases. The grim milestones were passed just a week after the country further eased lockdown restrictions. At 50,879 the number of detected infections is the worst in Africa, and two-thirds are in the Western Cape province. South Africa ranks second in terms of deaths at 1,080 after Egypt. Antiracist protesters should wear masks, says Tedros. The director general of the WHO has called on people attending antiracism protests to wear masks, as he warned that the biggest threat in the ongoing coronavirus outbreak \u201cwas now complacency.\u201d Switzerland has approved a Bluetooth contact-tracing app. The contact-tracing app, which aims to prevent a second wave of infections, is optional and no personal data or location information is used. The UK has recorded its lowest daily death toll since 22 March. A further 55 people have died after contracting Covid-19 in UK, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 40,597. This is the lowest daily total of newly reported deaths since 22 March, but there is often a reporting lag over a weekend. The figures do not include all deaths across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. A study has found European lockdowns reduced infection rate by 81%. Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people\u2019s movements preventing an estimated 3.1m deaths by the beginning of May, with 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say. Philippines has ruled out reopening of schools without vaccine. Classes are to resume at the end of August and teachers will use distance learning methods via the internet or TV broadcasts where needed. However, with millions of Filipinos living in deep poverty, many do not have access to computers and the internet at home. South Africa has passed the grim milestone of 1,000 coronavirus deaths, as infections spiked to over 50,000. This comes just a week after the continent\u2019s worst-hit country further eased lockdown restrictions, official statistics showed. The number of detected infections was 50,879 - the worst in Africa. South Africa ranks second in terms of deaths at 1,080 after Egypt. Around two-thirds of South Africa\u2019s infections are found in the Western Cape province, a popular tourist destination home to the coastal city of Cape Town. The country has since May been gradually easing tight restrictions imposed in March. It is now allowing some school children to return to classes and the majority of businesses to operate. More than a half of all cases have been recorded in the last two weeks, president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday. \u201cAs we watch the number of infections rise further - probably far faster than most of us imagined - we should be concerned, but not alarmed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is because we have the ability... to limit the impact of the disease on our people,\u201d he said. Swiss lawmakers have given the go-ahead to the country\u2019s Bluetooth contact-tracing app aimed at stopping a second wave of Covid-19 infections. The app is optional and no personal data or location information is used. The National Council voted in favour of the SwissCovid app by 156 votes to 22, allowing it to be rolled out to the general public. The smartphone application uses Bluetooth wireless technology to register other phones that come into close proximity. It works by tracing people who may unwittingly have been in prolonged contact with someone who later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The test phase was launched in mid-May. Health minister Alain Berset said it should not extend beyond the end of June, adding that the test period was needed to find and fix any defects. Some 1,660 people have died in Switzerland - a country of 8.5 million people - out of nearly 30,900 infected with the virus. Qatar will use a four-phase plan to lift coronavirus restrictions in its cities starting on 15 June, when some mosques will be allowed to reopen, government spokeswoman Lulwa Rashed al-Khater has announced. She told a news conference the second phase of easing the lockdown would start on 1 July, the third on 1 August and the fourth on 1 September. The second phase will allow a partial opening of restaurants and the third will permit the resumption of flights from low-risk countries and the reopening of shopping malls and markets with limited capacity. The fourth will allow wedding parties, business gatherings such as exhibitions, and the reopening of theatres and cinemas, she said. Qatar reported 1,368 new coronavirus cases and 3 deaths on Monday, bringing the total to 70,158 cases including 57 deaths. The UK parliamentary debate is wrapping up - here are some closing comments: Labour MP Chris Bryant says parliament is behaving in a way that \u201cwe would not expect from other employers\u201d and that parliament should be setting an example. Lib Dem MP Alistair Carmichael (who called for the debate) says this debate is about \u201cequality of participation and access\u201d, and accuses Speaker of the House Jacob Rees-Mogg of abandoning this principle. He adds it is an \u201cerror of judgement of potential catastrophic magnitude\u201d, and says Rees-Mogg may ultimately be responsible for it. Back to the UK emergency debate for a minute - Labour MP Chris Bryant has claimed a third of MPs are not currently able to participate in physical debates, for personal shielding reasons or other. He underlines the House of Commons \u201cmust be free or it is nothing\u201d, and that MPs must all be equally free - not for themselves, but for the communities they represent. Earlier, Bryant had raised the issue of there being \u201ctwo different categories of people who can self-certify\u201d with different proxy voting rights. Rees-Mogg had replied that his point will be taken under consideration. Nearly 270 Rohinga migrants have been detained in Malaysia. This update has just come through from AFP: More than 260 Rohingya arrived by boat in Malaysia on Monday, officials said, despite authorities\u2019 efforts to fight the coronavirus by stopping entry of the Muslim minority. Fears have been growing in recent months that large numbers of the migrants from mostly Buddhist Myanmar are trapped at sea as countries that traditionally allowed them in turn their boats away. On Monday a coastguard vessel spotted a suspected migrant boat off the northwest island of Langkawi, and was set to push it out to international waters, authorities said. But as the coastguards approached, 53 Rohingya jumped into the sea and were detained. On inspecting the boat, authorities found another 216 Rohingya and the body of a dead woman, according to a statement from a task force overseeing maritime patrols. \u201cInvestigations also revealed the boat was intentionally damaged and... could not be repaired,\u201d the statement said, adding this \u201cresulted in the push-back effort being halted\u201d. Food and water were provided to the migrants and the boat was taken to Langkawi, where all 269 were detained, it said. Authorities did not say where the vessel started its journey, or how long it had been at sea. In the UK parliamentary debate, Labour MP Angela Eagle has accused Jacob Rees- Mogg of acting by \u201cdiktat\u201d in his decision on the ending of hybrid parliament. She also makes reference to the proroguing of parliament last year, and says those who cannot take part in proceedings are \u201cwatching in frustration\u201d. Eagle says she is acting as a voice for those who cannot attend due to shielding, or caring for a vulnerable household member, and raises the worry of passing the virus to others. She says Rees-Mogg needs to understand that in a democracy, constituents all have the same right to see their MP represent them. \u201cIt\u2019s his duty to facilitate it.\u201d The WHO has warned against complacency, saying the coronavirus pandemic situation is worsening around the globe, AFP reports. The WHO said it had recorded its highest daily tally of new infections, with Covid-19 raging in the Americas. And as mass protests for racial justice sweep across the United States and beyond, the United Nations\u2019 health agency urged anyone demonstrating to do so safely. The novel coronavirus has killed more than 403,000 people out of at least seven million infected since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. After East Asia, Europe became the epicentre of the disease, but has now been overtaken by the Americas. \u201cAlthough the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening,\u201d WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news conference in Geneva. \u201cMore than 100,000 cases have been reported on nine of the past 10 days. Yesterday, more than 136,000 cases were reported - the most in a single day so far.\u201d He said that almost 75% of Sunday\u2019s cases came from 10 countries - mostly in the Americas and South Asia. Tedros said that in countries where the situation was improving, \u201cthe biggest threat is now complacency\u201d, adding that \u201cmost people globally are still susceptible to infection\u201d. \u201cMore than six months into this pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal,\u201d he said. Turning to the wave of protests sparked by killing of George Floyd, Tedros encouraged active surveillance of the virus to ensure it does not rebound, especially in the context of mass gatherings. He underlined the WHO \u201cfully supports\u201d the movement against racism, but encourages protestors to demonstrate safely. Hello, I\u2019ll be running the blog for the next few hours. As always, do feel free to message me with any stories I might have missed, as well as comments and feedback on coverage. You can reach me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti or by email. I\u2019ll also be keeping one eye on the remainder of the UK parliament\u2019s emergency debate on the return to physical parliamentary proceedings, and posting any major lines that emerge. India has taken a significant step towards loosening its lockdown, reopening places of worship, restaurants and shopping malls, despite coronavirus cases continuing to soar and experts warning the country was far from hitting its peak, writes Hannah Ellis Petersen, the Guardian\u2019s South Asia correspondent. Over the weekend India overtook both Italy and Spain to register the fifth highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, 257,000, with cases climbing by more than 9,000 each day. The death toll from Covid-19 stands at 7,135. The easing of India\u2019s lockdown of its 1.3 billion people, which has been in place since 24 March, went ahead as scheduled on Monday. While it is acknowledged to have slowed the spread of the virus, it has had a brutal impact on India\u2019s poor, particularly tens of millions of migrant workers. Shopping malls and restaurants opened their doors, and mosques, temples and gurdwaras began welcoming back worshippers, with strict limits on congregation numbers and physical distancing measures in place. In Delhi, the 400-year-old Jama Masjid mosque, one of the biggest in India, is planning to limit worshippers to just three visits a day, instead of the usual five. I know many people are wondering when they can get back out to the raves. However, judging from this experiment with social distanced raving in the Netherlands, you might prefer to brock out in your front room for a little while yet. At least half of Singapore\u2019s newly discovered coronavirus cases show no symptoms, the co-head of the government\u2019s virus taskforce told Reuters on Monday. The city state has one of the highest infection tallies in Asia, with more than 38,000 cases, because of outbreaks in cramped dormitories housing thousands of migrant workers. It reopened schools and some businesses last week after a near two-month lockdown, but many residents are still required to work from home and mix socially only with their families. The latest finding about asymptomatic cases of coronavirus was seen as reinforcing the decision to ease lockdown restrictions very gradually. \u201cBased on our experience, for every symptomatic case you would have at least one asymptomatic case,\u201d said Lawrence Wong, adding that the discovery was made in recent weeks as Singapore ramped up testing. \u201cThat is exactly why we have been very cautious in our reopening plans,\u201d Wong said. On Monday, the ministry of health reported 386 new cases, bringing the total confirmed number of cases in the country to 38,296. Just two were \u201cin the community\u201d - Singapore\u2019s euphemism for citizens and better-paid migrant workers - while 384 were work permit holders living in dormitories. So far, 25,368 people who had tested positive have recovered and been discharged, the ministry said. Another 2,634 were being isolated and cared for at community facilities, while 269 confirmed cases were still in hospital. Singapore\u2019s coronavirus death toll so far is 25. About 200 people protested in Nairobi on Monday over police brutality and the deaths of 15 people at the hands of police enforcing Kenya\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Kenya\u2019s independent policing oversight authority (IPOA) reported last week it had received 87 complaints against police since the dusk-to-dawn curfew and heightened security measures were imposed on 27 March, AFP reports. Some 15 deaths and \u201c31 incidents where victims sustained injuries\u201d have been \u201cdirectly linked to actions of police officers during the curfew enforcement\u201d, it said. Kenya\u2019s police force is often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings, especially in poor neighbourhoods. The crowd in the Mathare neighbourhood on Monday was composed mostly of young people and mothers carrying signs with the names of friends, neighbours and sons killed in police operations in recent years. \u201cI am here to protest for our youth who have died in the hands of the police without any wrongdoings and we are saying enough is enough. As mothers, many of our youths have been killed while being labelled as thieves,\u201d Mathare resident Rahma Wako told AFP. In April, Human Rights Watch (HRW) accused the police of imposing the coronavirus curfew in a \u201cchaotic and violent manner from the start\u201d, sometimes whipping, kicking and teargassing people to force them off the streets. It described the case of 13-year-old Yassin Hussein Moyo who died in Nairobi on March 31 after being shot while standing on his balcony as police forced people into their homes on the street below. Other cases include a tomato seller who died in western Kakamega after being hit by a teargas canister, and four men who were beaten to death in different parts of the country. The migrant rescue group Sea-Watch has said it has resumed operations in the Mediterranean, after a three-month break while most of Europe was in lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus. Its rescue vessel, Sea-Watch 3, has left the port of Messina, in Sicily, and was on its way towards the waters off the Libyan coast where many people smugglers operate, the NGO said on Twitter. A new boat funded by the German Protestant Church, the Sea-Watch 4, will also set sail for Libya \u201cin a few weeks\u201d from the port of Burriana, near Valencia, it said. Everyone on board the Sea-Watch 3 underwent a 14-day quarantine and a test for the new coronavirus before the boat\u2019s departure from Messina, said the group. The Sea-Watch 3 will be the first NGO rescue boat operating in the area for more than two months. The World Bank has warned that the coronavirus pandemic has triggered the most widespread global economic meltdown since at least 1870 and risks fuelling a dramatic rise in poverty levels around the globe, writes Richard Partington, the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent. In a report the Washington-based organisation said the highest share of countries in 150 years would enter recessions at the same time. As many as 90% of the 183 economies it examined are expected to suffer from falling levels of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, even more than the 85% of nations suffering from recession during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Issuing the assessment in its half-yearly Global Economic Prospects (GEP) report, the organisation said the fall in world GDP would be the steepest since the second world war. Dramatically cutting its growth expectations, the World Bank said it expected global GDP to shrink by 5.2% this year, in an economic decline more than twice as deep as the recession triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. Nearly 6,000 more confirmed cases of coronavirus have been detected across Africa in the past 24 hours, the Africa Centres for Disease Control reported on Monday. According to the latest update from the African Union\u2019s health agency, 189,434 had tested positive for the virus across the continents 54 countries by Monday afternoon, an increase of 5,960 since Sunday. Africa\u2019s death toll reached 5,175 after 134 more deaths were reported. Africa CDC said 82,888 people had been confirmed as having recovered from the virus. Conservationists have warned that the coronavirus pandemic could spark a surge in ocean pollution \u2013 adding to a glut of plastic waste that already threatens marine life \u2013 after finding disposable masks floating like jellyfish and waterlogged latex gloves scattered across seabeds, writes Ashifa Kassam. The French non-profit Op\u00e9ration Mer Propre, whose activities include regularly picking up litter along the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, began sounding the alarm late last month. Divers had found what Joffrey Peltier of the organisation described as \u201cCovid waste\u201d \u2013 dozens of gloves, masks and bottles of hand sanitiser beneath the waves of the Mediterranean, mixed in with the usual litter of disposable cups and aluminium cans. The quantities of masks and gloves found were far from enormous, said Peltier. But he worried that the discovery hinted at a new kind of pollution, one set to become ubiquitous after millions around the world turned to single-use plastics to combat the coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s the promise of pollution to come if nothing is done,\u201d said Peltier. In France alone, authorities have ordered two billion disposable masks, said Laurent Lombard of Op\u00e9ration Mer Propre. \u201cKnowing that \u2026 soon we\u2019ll run the risk of having more masks than jellyfish in the Mediterranean,\u201d he wrote on social media alongside video of a dive showing algae-entangled masks and soiled gloves in the sea near Antibes. The group hopes the images will prompt people to embrace reusable masks and swap latex gloves for more frequent handwashing. \u201cWith all the alternatives, plastic isn\u2019t the solution to protect us from Covid. That\u2019s the message,\u201d said Peltier. The director general of the World Health Organization has called on people attending antiracism protests to wear masks, as he warned that the biggest threat in the ongoing coronavirus outbreak \u201cwas now complacency.\u201d Speaking at the UN health agency\u2019s regular coronavirus briefing, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that more than 100,000 new cases a day of coronavirus had been reported on nine of the past ten days. \u201cAlthough the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening,\u201d Tedros said, with nearly three quarters of cases reported on Sunday were detected in ten countries, concentrated in the Americas and south Asia. Elsewhere, signs were more positive, he said. In these countries, the biggest threat now is complacency. Results from studies to see how much of the population has been exposed to the virus show that most people globally are still susceptible to infection. We continue to urge active surveillance to ensure the virus does not rebound, especially as mass gatherings of all kinds are starting to resume in some countries. On the antiracism protests taking place around the world, Tedros said: WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds. We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely. As much as possible, keep at least one metre from others, clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest. The UK has reported 55 more coronavirus-related deaths, the lowest number since 22 March, AFP reports. It is the lowest daily total since the country went into lockdown on March 23, although figures on Mondays are usually low due to weekend reporting practices. With 40,597 deaths among people testing positive for coronavirus, The UK is the hardest hit nation in Europe and second in the world behind the US. Scotland, which has seen 2,415 deaths after positive tests, recorded no new fatalities for the second day in a row. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the figures showed coronavirus was \u201cin retreat\u201d in Scotland. She was now \u201coptimistic\u201d the country could move to the second phase of its four-part plan to ease lockdown measures when they are reviewed next week. Living in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life. Perhaps this time away from normality will help us reflect on how we were living before and make new plans for the future: to discard some old habits and build some new ones. If you feel as if you have learned something about yourself over the last few weeks and hope to change your life, we want to hear from you. Maybe you want to spend more time in nature, pay more attention to your neighbours, reassess your relationship, change you job, be more creative, keep better contact with old friends, spend less money (or more), or worry less. Whatever is on your mind, we want to know. Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel, has said his government is hitting \u201cthe emergency brake\u201d on its easing of coronavirus restrictions, as increases in the number of cases apparently began to accelerate in the country. The resumption of rail travel was delayed, for a third time, while the reopening of theatres, musical performances and other cultural venues, which had been scheduled for the 14 June, was pushed back at least a week. Netanyahu said that experts had showed him and other ministers that there had been a \u201csteep increase in morbidity\u201d. Although Israel is regarded as having done well in tackling its outbreak, about 800 infections were detected in the last week, as opposed to about 300 in the preceding two weeks combined. \u201cIt could be that we are already seeing the doubling of the rate of infection within ten days. I very much hope not,\u201d Netanyahu said, according to the Times of Israel. \u201cWhat we decided to do, first of all, is to hit the \u2019emergency brake.\u2019 We stopped all moves to ease restrictions that we were going to apply in the coming days. We will check this again next week.\u201d He added that \u201cthe main thing that all the experts emphasized is that we must keep the three rules: Wearing masks, keeping two meters\u2019 distance and hygiene \u2013 washing hands. I ask you, for our economy, for our health and for the lives of us all \u2013 please follow the rules.\u201d Hospitals in Pakistan have warned they are running out of beds to treat coronavirus patients, as the number of confirmed cases in the country passed 100,000, AFP reports. In recent weeks, however, the country of more than 210 million has reported a sharp rise in new infections, and on Monday the government said more than 100,000 cases and 2,000 deaths had now been recorded. Last week a leaked government report suggested there were nearly 700,000 infections in Lahore alone. Doctors at several main hospitals in the historic eastern city told AFP they were running out of beds, ventilators and other vital equipment. \u201cAs the cases increase, more health care workers are also falling victim to the virus,\u201d said Farooq Sahil, a doctor at Services Hospital Lahore. Khizer Hayat, chairman of the Young Doctors Association of Punjab, said facilities across the province needed help. \u201cHospitals are running out of beds; there aren\u2019t enough ventilators given to us,\u201d he told AFP. In the southern port city of Karachi, health centres are turning away the sick, with a large sign near the entrance of the Indus hospital stating there was no room for coronavirus patients. Asad Umar, the head of the national coronavirus task force, has announced that a package to relieve pressure on hospitals would include 1,000 new beds in major cities. After 15,000 people in Berlin and 25,000 in Munich joined antiracism protests over the weekend, the German government has called on demonstrators to stick to coronavirus distancing rules. In some cases, protesters were closely packed together despite German requirements for people to stay 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart. On Monday, Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said \u201cit is good if people take to the streets in Germany as well with a clear statement against racism.\u201d But he added: \u201cThe pictures that in some cases emerged over the weekend were not good. Both things must be possible: to demonstrate peacefully, which is a fundamental right, and keep to the (social distancing) rules.\u201d He said many demonstrators \u201ccreated a big risk for themselves and others.\u201d Germany has been widely praised for its adroit handling of the pandemic. Moldova\u2019s former health minister has described the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak as out of control, as a record number of cases were recorded in the country in the first week of June, the Associated Press reports. Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe and plagued by corruption and political turmoil, confirmed 1,449 new cases of coronavirus last week, nearly 300 more than the previous week, according to data from the ministry of health. It was the fourth consecutive week with more than 1,000 new cases. During the first week of June, Moldova also suffered 46 coronavirus deaths, including two medical workers, compared to 45 deaths a week earlier. Since its first confirmed case on March 7, the country of 3.3 million people has registered 9,700 cases of the coronavirus and 346 deaths. Ala Nemerenco, health minister under a previous government, criticised the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an epidemiologist, a virologist, or even a doctor to understand that the situation has gotten out of control,\u201d Nemerenco said in a Facebook post in reference to the rising number of cases. Regarding difficulties in reaching the Covid-19 centre at the Moldexpo exhibition hall because of heavy traffic, she said that \u201ceverything that happens demonstrates disorganisation and chaos, which can\u2019t lead to any good.\u201d Belgium has reported 122 new infections in the last 24 hours and 11 fatalities, compared to 156 confirmed cases and 15 deaths the day before, writes Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief. The continued downward trend has allowed the government to allow restaurants and bars to reopen after nearly three months in lockdown. The prime minister of the Dutch-speaking Flanders region, Jan Jambon marked the moment by inviting photographers to a chicken restaurant close to Brussels\u2019 EU quarter where he enjoyed lunch. The European health regulator has confirmed it has received an application from the US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc for approval of its antiviral drug, remdesivir, as a potential Covid-19 treatment in Europe. \u201cThe assessment of the benefits and risks of remdesivir is being performed under a reduced timeline and an opinion could be issued within weeks,\u201d the European Medicines Agency said in its statement. Iranians have been urged to wear face masks in public areas by the country\u2019s health ministry, following warnings that it could face a new wave of coronavirus infections. Last week, health officials said there could be a second, stronger wave of the virus if people flouted physical distancing rules. On Monday, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur reported that the death toll from Covid-19 in Iran had reached 8,351 after 70 people died in the previous 24 hours. The total number of positive cases in the country now stands at 173,832 after 2,043 new infections were reported. Jahanpur said: \u201cEveryone should wear masks when attending public places like shops or any other places where fully observing social distancing is not possible.\u201d Restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus were imposed by Iran in mid-April, but the government began easing them after the daily number of deaths and infections fell over concern about the economic impact of the crisis. However, restrictions have since been reimposed in some provinces after localised outbreaks. A month-long coronavirus lockdown is to be lifted in Moscow after mayor Sergei Sobyanin declared the pandemic was on the wane. His comments came shortly after Russia announced the partial reopening of its borders allowing people who needed to work, study, get medical treatment or look after relatives to travel abroad for the first time since late March. \u201cThe pandemic has slowly but steadily been on the wane for several weeks,\u201d Sobyanin wrote on his personal blog on Monday. \u201cMoscow can practically get back to its usual rhythm of life.\u201d The country has reported 476,658 cases of coronavirus \u2013 the third highest tally in the world \u2013 but new cases in Moscow have more than halved to around 2,000 a day. Nationally, 5,971 deaths of those who tested positive for the virus have been reported, stirring debate about the way in which authorities count fatalities. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has appeared on state television attending the politburo of the ruling Workers\u2019 party. Neither Kim nor the officials at the meeting wore face masks, while the coronavirus pandemic was not mentioned in the media report. KCNA said that instead the meeting \u201cdiscussed in depth some crucial issues arising in further developing the self-sufficient economy of the country and improving the standard of people\u2019s living\u201d. The footage comes weeks after it reported that Kim had attended the completion of a fertiliser plant north of Pyongyang, following speculation that the dictator was gravely ill. Brazil\u2019s government has released two contradictory sets of figures for the latest tally of coronavirus infections and deaths. Initially, data sent to journalists by the health ministry on Sunday said Brazil had a total death toll of 37,312 and a total of 685,427 confirmed cases, the news organisation Reuters reported. The figures showed that in the previous 24 hours the country had registered 1,382 new deaths and 12,581 new cases. But later on Sunday evening the government updated the figures on its online data portal without publishing a cumulative total, putting the day\u2019s death toll at 525 and new cases at 18,912. The health ministry did not respond to questions about the different numbers, Reuters said. The latest controversy over the government\u2019s published statistics comes as it removed months of national data on the epidemic from public view over the weekend, which critics claimed was an attempt at hiding Brazil\u2019s soaring death toll. It followed a move last week to push back the release of the daily tally from around 5pm to around 10pm, after the country\u2019s main television news program has aired. Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people\u2019s movements preventing an estimated 3.1m deaths by the beginning of May, with 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say. Outbreak modellers at Imperial College London said that lockdown slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81% and lowered the reproduction number, R, of the epidemic below 1 in all countries they observed. When R is less than 1 the epidemic is in decline because on average, each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other. As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate. The model shows that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people had become infected, but some nations were hit far harder than others. According to the model Belgium had the largest number of cases per capita with 8% of the population infected, compared with only 0.46% of Norwegians and 0.85% of Germans. Some 5.1% of the UK population was infected, according to a report published in Nature. \u201cOur model estimates that we are very far away from herd immunity,\u201d said Axel Gandy, a professor of statistics at Imperial and co-author on the study. Herd immunity is achieved when enough people are immune to a virus that outbreaks die out naturally. In the case of Covid-19, scientists believe upwards of 70% of the population would need to be resistant for herd immunity to kick in. \u201cIt tells us we need to be very careful and not to release too much in one go because then you have no control,\u201d Prof Gandy said. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully and do things slowly, so we can backtrack should they not work.\u201d Authorities in Pakistan have stepped up efforts to enforce protocols after the number of coronavirus infections surpassed 100,000. Official statistics released today showed 103,671 confirmed cases and 2,067 from Covid-19. Increased testing in the country has led to record numbers of recorded infections over the last 10 days. Pakistan lifted its lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus last month, putting protocols in place for the reopening of markets, industries and public transport, including mandatory wearing of masks and social distancing. But planning minister Asad Umar \u2013 in charge of the national response to the pandemic \u2013 told a press conference over the weekend that many markets and shops had been closed because of non-compliance over the last few days. \u201cFirst we educated the masses about the protocols, then we warned them, and now, in the last meeting with the prime minister in the chair, we directed administrations to crack down on places protocols are not being followed,\u201d he said.

Punters betting on volatile financial markets during the Covid-19 crisis have won more than half of the revenues earned by the online trading platform Plus500, sending the company\u2019s shares down by nearly 8%, writes Simon Goodley for the Guardian\u2019s business desk. The firm \u2013 which operates like a bookmaker and allows traders to place wagers on stock, currency and commodity market movements \u2013 said its second-quarter revenues had surged to $249m (\u00a3197m), only for that figure to be slashed to about $102.5m because of payouts to customers who had placed winning bets. Online trading firms tend to experience increases in demand during periods of financial market volatility, such as those fuelled by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike many of its rivals, Plus500 does not generally hedge the bets it takes. This means it loses money when its customers win, and vice versa, which has contributed to a history of fluctuating fortunes for the business. David Zruia, interim chief executive of Plus500, said: We have consistently stated that customer trading performance is subject to significant market movements and is therefore likely to fluctuate. This is magnified during periods of heightened market volatility, such as those we are currently experiencing and given the growing scale of the business. Nonetheless, we continue to expect this performance to revert to a medium-term historical level of near zero and our outlook for the year remains unchanged. Police officers in Bangladesh have turned to yoga to improve their health and help with their breathing as they continue to police the country through its coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. Shama Makhing, a yoga instructor who led some 100 officers in stretching and breathing exercises in Dhaka early on Monday, said the ancient practice from India would support the officers physically and mentally. \u201cThey cannot skip duty,\u201d Makhing told AFP. \u201cTherefore it is important for the policemen to be fit. Yoga \u2026 can help with their breathing.\u201d On Monday, Bangladesh reported 2,735 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, out of 12,944 samples tested in the last 24 hours in labs across the country. So far, 68,504 cases have been recorded since the beginning of the outbreak, of which 14,560 have recovered. Forty-two more deaths were reported in the past 24 hours, taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 930. On 14 March, Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, ordered the country into Covid-19 lockdown, saying \u201cextraordinary decisions\u201d needed to be taken as the country struggled with a \u201chealth, social and economic crisis\u201d. The Moroccan authorities had taken their own extraordinary decision the day before, when they ordered the shutdown of the border crossings that connect the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla with the rest of the country. With the only land borders between Africa and Europe closed, many citizens from both continents found themselves trapped. Three months on, more than 500 Moroccans remain in limbo, far from home and with few \u2013 if any resources \u2013 with which to support themselves. Many sleep each night at the gates of the border and few maintain the safety distances mentioned in Covid-19 protocols. Jes\u00fas Blasco de Avellaneda spoke to those who are trapped in Melilla. South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has said he is worried about the continuing spread of the coronavirus, even as schools reopened in the country. In his weekly presidential address on Monday, Ramaphosa said that it was clear that the caseload in South Africa was rising fast, with more than half of new cases since the start of the outbreak recorded in the past two weeks. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, quoted him as saying: Like many South Africans, I too have been worried as I watch these figures keep rising. As we watch the number of infections rise further - probably far faster than most of us imagined - we should be concerned, but not alarmed. During the course of this coming week, we can expect that the total number of cases will pass the 50,000 mark and the number of related deaths will reach 1,000. We need to focus our attention on ensuring that we adhere to social distancing practices because it is through close contact between people that the virus will be spread Small fishing boats, fish markets and female workers are among the categories worst affected by the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis on the world\u2019s fisheries, research has found, writes Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. Supply chains around the world have been disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, and artisanal fishing \u2013 small boats \u2013 has borne the brunt, according to the annual report on fisheries by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). While industrial fishing had fallen only by about 6.5% in April owing to the crisis, a large proportion of small vessels around the world have been in effect confined to port, and their markets are uncertain. In parts of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, more than 90% of small-scale fishing fleets have had to stop fishing, owing to a lack of markets and falling prices. The closure of restaurants, hotels and catering has cut off markets for small boats, and led to falling prices, and the resulting disruption has led to an increase in waste, according to an appendix to the annual report, published on Monday for World Oceans Day. Some of these effects are hard to quantify as yet. The main report was prepared before the coronavirus crisis hit, so the appendix contains only preliminary information rather than extensive research, but it indicates a growing difficulty for many small fishing fleets around the world. Restrictions on international travel imposed by Russia are to be eased, the prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said on Monday, as he announced a rollback of coronavirus measures. The city of Moscow will also roll back curbs imposed over the virus from Tuesday, including cancelling a digital pass system for residents and a self-isolation regime, the Tass news agency reported separately, according to Reuters. Muscovites will be able to go out for walks whenever they want from Tuesday, Tass said, and restaurants and cafes in the Russian capital will be allowed to open their summer verandas from 16 June. Russia continues to report thousands of new infections daily, with its nationwide tally now at 476,658, the third-highest in the world, but the number of cases in Moscow, the original epicentre of the virus, has fallen sharply. On Monday, the anti-coronavirus crisis centre reported 8,985 new coronavirus cases across the country; 3,293 new patients (36.6%) have no symptoms of Covid-19. Russia closed its borders on 30 March, after grounding all international flights and asking citizens to stay at home to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Italy is facing is worst recession since the second world war, with the eurozone\u2019s third largest economy set to shrink by 8.3% this year as a result of the coronavirus crisis, according to by the National Institute of Statistics. The country, one of the first in Europe to be hit by the Covid-19 outbreak, imposed a strict lockdown for more than two months in an effort to curb mounting deaths and transmission of the coronavirus. The institute (ISTAT) said it forecast a rebound of 4.6 percent next year, the French news agency AFP reported. But others fear the lockdown fallout will be even worse. The Bank of Italy has forecast a drop in GDP of between 9.2% and 13.1%, while the European Commission expects it to fall by 9.5%. The American investment bank Goldman Sachs is even gloomier, saying Italy\u2019s economy will shrink 14%. Italy has suffered the fourth highest Covid-19 death toll of any country in the world so far, with 36,455 deaths recorded as of Saturday. As of the latest update on Sunday, health authorities had detected 234,998 cases of coronavirus infection. Here\u2019s a summary of the key stories so far today: New Zealand has declared itself Covid-19-free. The country\u2019s government will lift all Covid-19 restrictions except stringent border controls at midnight on Monday, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, adding that she \u201cdid a little dance\u201d when she heard there were no cases of coronavirus left in the country. For the past 10 days, a lone woman aged in her 50s, who lived in Auckland, was the last person in New Zealand known to be suffering from Covid-19. On Monday, health officials said, she had reported 48 hours symptom-free and was considered recovered. Infections globally have passed 7 million and deaths have passed 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. Covid-19 infections now stand at 7,031,249, after another rise in cases from Brazil. The south American country has 691,758 confirmed cases and 36,455 deaths, though its government has stopped releasing relevant data. The US is the worst-affected country, with 1,942,363 confirmed cases and more than a quarter of the world\u2019s deaths: 110,514. There are 16 countries with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. Ryanair boss: Britons know quarantine rules are rubbish. The Ryanair boss Michael O\u2019Leary has said he will not cancel flights despite the government\u2019s new quarantine rules for travellers arriving in the UK, because \u201cBritish people are ignoring this quarantine. They know it\u2019s rubbish.\u201d O\u2019Leary\u2019s comments come after Ryanair, easyJet and IAG, the owner of British Airways, started legal action against the government in an attempt to overturn new rules requiring all passengers arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days, which came into effect on Monday. Philippines rules out reopening of schools without vaccine. \u201cIt is a challenging task for us at the department of education to prepare our schools in a different set-up but we are committed to our duty to make education available and thriving, even in the most difficult time,\u201d Leonor Briones, the education secretary, said. Classes are to resume at the end of August and teachers will use distance learning methods via the internet or TV broadcasts where needed, Briones added. However, with millions of Filipinos living in deep poverty, many do not have access to computers and the internet at home. Poland has ordered the temporary closure of 12 coalmines after a major outbreak of coronavirus among miners in the country\u2019s southern coal-mining regions. According to Polish media, coalminers account for up to 20% of all coronavirus cases in Poland. On Saturday, the health ministry announced 576 new cases of coronavirus, the highest daily total since the pandemic began. Of these, around 60% were workers at a single mine in the coal region of Silesia. The mines will be closed from Tuesday, and miners will receive their full salaries during the three-week closure. At least half of Singapore\u2019s coronavirus cases show no symptoms, the co-head of the government\u2019s virus taskforce told Reuters. \u201cBased on our experience, for every symptomatic case you would have at least one asymptomatic case,\u201d Lawrence Wong said, adding that the discovery was made in recent weeks as Singapore ramped up testing. Wong said that while asymptomatic cases had fewer opportunities to spread the virus as they were not coughing or sneezing, there have been cases of asymptomatic transmission in Singapore, especially between patients living in close quarters. Saudi virus cases top 100,000 with new spike ahead of the hajj. The total number of infections rose to 101,914 \u2013 the highest in the Gulf \u2013 while the death toll climbed to 712, the health ministry said.The kingdom has seen infections spike as it eases stringent lockdown measures, with the number of daily cases exceeding 3,000 for the second day in a row on Sunday. Concerns are growing about the true extent of the coronavirus outbreak in Afghanistan, where nearly half off all tests are coming back positive, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. On Monday, the health ministry reported 575 new cases from 978 tests, bringing the total number of infections to 20,917. Seven patients died overnight, pushing the total Covid-19 death toll to 369. There have been 2,171 recoveries. The ministry has so far tested 48,305 suspected patients of whom around 44% were positive. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, pledged on Saturday that 14 new testing labs would be launched in Afghanistan. Last week, the International Rescue Committee warned about the low capacity of testing and said the Afghan health ministry had the capacity to test 2,000 suspected patients each day, but were receiving between 10,000 and 20,000 samples each day. Most of the new cases were recorded in Kabul, with 193 new cases and seven deaths confirmed in the capital. Kabul, recorded its worst day of the crisis on Sunday after 23 patients died of Covid-19. Over the weekend, Kabul\u2019s governor, Mohammad Yaghoub Heidari, warned that the actual number of infections may be much higher than official figures show. \u201cThe number of infections is more than what we imagine, in Kabul, it may be more than a million as testing capacity is too low\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cThere is a catastrophe going on in Kabul,\u201d Heidari said. Since Saturday, masks must be worn in public places, two-metre physical distancing must be maintained and gatherings of more than 10 people should be avoided, the health ministry announced. Elderly people have been advised not to leave their homes and workplaces must be disinfected. Herat recorded 151 new cases out of 176 tests. Health officials in the western province said on Monday that 15 suspected patients with Covid-19 symptoms died in the last 24 hours, which are not included in the ministry\u2019s update. Herat borders Iran, which has been badly hit by the pandemic. Afghanistan\u2019s first confirmed case of the virus was reported in the province after thousands of Afghan migrants returned from Iran in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The total number of infections in Herat is 3,866 with 66 deaths. Helmand province recorded its worst day of the crisis after 39 new cases confirmed on Monday and 4 patients died overnight, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 112 with six deaths. Helmand recorded its first death from Covid-19 on Saturday. AFP has more details on the Philippine government\u2019s decision not to allow children back to school until a vaccine is available for the coronavirus. The French news agency reports that officials making the announcement have suggested that lessons may have to be broadcast on television. It comes after the president, Rodrigo Duterte, said last month that even if students could not graduate, they needed to stay out of school to fight the spread of the disease. \u201cWe will comply with the president\u2019s directive to postpone face-to-face classes until a vaccine is available,\u201d the education secretary, Leonor Briones, said in a statement on Monday. Classes are to resume at the end of August and teachers will use distance learning methods via the internet or TV broadcasts where needed, Briones added. However, with millions of Filipinos living in deep poverty, many do not have access to computers and the internet at home. \u201cThe teacher and the school will have to adjust... depending on the availability of communication,\u201d Briones said in a press briefing.

Poland has ordered the temporary closure of 12 coal mines after a major outbreak of coronavirus among miners in the country\u2019s southern coal-mining regions. According to Polish media, coal miners now account for up to 20% of all coronavirus cases in Poland. On Saturday the health ministry announced 576 new cases of coronavirus, the highest daily total since the pandemic began. Of these, around 60% were workers at a single mine in the coal region of Silesia. It is believed that an increase in testing is partly responsible for the sudden surge in cases. The mines will be closed from Tuesday, and miners will receive their full salaries during the three-week closure, deputy prime minister Jacek Sasin said on Monday. Poland implemented an early and strict lockdown, and avoided the huge death toll of many western European countries. So far, it has had 26,561 confirmed cases and 1,157 deaths. However unlike most other countries in the region, Poland has not seen a flattening of the curve, causing fears of a spike in cases as life gradually returns to normal. In recent weeks, many restrictive measures have been lifted, with bars, restaurants and hotels all reopened. The Ryanair boss, Michael O\u2019Leary, has delivered his withering verdict on Britain\u2019s quarantine rules, which came into force today: \u201cBritish people are ignoring this quarantine. They know it\u2019s rubbish.\u201d More here: The Philippines has reported 579 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 today, and eight deaths. Malaysia has reported seven new confirmed cases, and no deaths. Earlier this year, as countries enforced strict social-distancing rules to slow the spread of coronavirus, Nicaragua\u2019s Sandinista rulers organized a string of pro-government rallies and marches under the banner \u201cLove Walk in the Time of Covid-19\u201d. Among those who joined one of those crowds in Managua was Dr F\u00e9lix Bravo, a doctor in the country\u2019s public health system, whose loyalty to the Nicaraguan government apparently outweighed the World Health Organization\u2019s warnings against large gatherings. A month and a half later, Bravo was dead. Here\u2019s Wilfredo Aburto Miranda on Nicaragua\u2019s coronavirus experience: Poison centres have had their day-to-day experience turned upside down by the pandemic, just like medical centres of every other kind, but the impact has varied across countries. In the US, says Julie Weber, the president of the American Association of Poison Control Centers, there has been a clear increase in cases. Calls relating to cleaning materials and disinfectants were up 20 and 16% respectively during the first three months of 2020, compared to the same period last year. And that was before the president suggested in April his dangerous and medically unfounded advice that injecting disinfectant might be a solution to being infected with coronavirus. Elsewhere, the volume of cases has remained constant or even fallen. Inquiries to the UK\u2019s National Poisons Information Service were down by 13% in March and April over last year. In Bordeaux, France, toxicologist Magali Labadie reports a rise in cases of people rubbing bleach into their bodies \u2013 \u201cthe patients turned completely red!\u201d \u2013 washing their hands in methylated spirits, causing irritation of the skin, or drenching their homes so thoroughly in bleach that it has provoked asthma attacks. Laura Spinney reports on coronavirus and poison: At least half of Singapore\u2019s newly discovered coronavirus cases show no symptoms, the co-head of the government\u2019s virus taskforce told Reuters on Monday, reinforcing the city-state\u2019s decision to ease lockdown restrictions very gradually, reports Reuters. Singapore has one of the highest infection tallies in Asia, with more than 38,000 cases, because of mass outbreaks in dormitories for its migrant workers. It reopened schools and some businesses last week after a near two-month lockdown. \u201cBased on our experience, for every symptomatic case you would have at least one asymptomatic case,\u201d said Lawrence Wong, adding that the discovery was made in recent weeks as Singapore ramped up testing. Wong did not reveal the number of asymptomatic cases in Singapore, which has recorded 6,294 virus infections over the last two weeks, with the vast majority among migrant workers. Wong said that while asymptomatic cases had fewer opportunities to spread the virus as they were not coughing or sneezing, there have been cases of asymptomatic transmission in Singapore, especially between patients living in close quarters. He said the discovery of the level of asymptomatic carriers prompted the government\u2019s plans for a gradual lifting of curbs that require many people to still work from home and mix socially only with their families. \u201cPeople have commented \u2013 why are we not reopening the economy faster?\u201d Wong said. \u201cWe have to take a more cautious approach \u2026 there are still asymptomatic cases which we may not have detected circulating in the community.\u201d This Monday means a return to school for pupils in many countries around the world - and the start of Matura exams, the equivalent of A-levels and essential for university qualification, in Poland. New Zealand Rugby have announced that when their domestic club competition gets under way on Sunday it will be with completely open stadiums and no limit on crowd numbers, after the country was declared Covid-19-free earlier today and the decision was taken to move to alert level 1 from midnight local time tonight, about four hours from now. \u201cIt is a testament to all New Zealanders that we are in a position to lift restrictions on mass gatherings and it\u2019s a massive boost for Investec Super Rugby Aotearoa,\u201d said the NZR chief executive, Mark Robinson. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly proud, and grateful, to be the first professional sports competition in the world to be in a position to have our teams play in front of their fans again. It\u2019s going to be a very special and unique competition and it\u2019s fitting that New Zealanders now have a chance to be part of it.\u201d The first game will be in Dunedin on Saturday 13 June, between the Highlanders and the Chiefs. \u201cThe world will be watching, and we will be ready to put on a show,\u201d said the Highlanders chief executive, Roger Clark. \u201cOur players, coaches and staff have been working overtime to get Investec Super Rugby Aotearoa ready and to now be able to share the competition with our members and our fans will be a very special occasion.\u201d Here are updated maps and graphs representing the spread and effect of Covid-19 globally: And in the United Kingdom: China has said today that senator Rick Scott should present the evidence for his accusation that Beijing is trying to slow down or sabotage the development of a Covid-19 vaccine by western countries. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the remarks during a daily briefing on Monday, responding to the Republican senator\u2019s comments during an interview with the BBC. Scott declined to give details on the evidence when asked during the interview but said it had come through the intelligence community. Malls and temples reopened in several cities across India on Monday despite the country recording a record daily number of new coronavirus infections, with the pandemic expected to ravage the country for weeks to come, AFP reports. After a 10-week lockdown, the government has risked lifting some restrictions in a bid to ease the devastating blow to the economy dealt by the coronavirus. But the number of new cases rose by 9,983 to 256,611, according to government figures announced on Monday, putting the country of 1.3 billion on course to overtake Britain and Spain among nations with the highest number of infections. The reported death toll of 7,135 is much lower than reported in other badly hit countries, but the epidemic is only expected to peak locally in July, according to health experts. Still, in the capital Delhi, shopping malls, restaurants, temples and mosques were allowed to reopen for the first time since 25 March. The response was tentative, however, and only a trickle of people returned to some places of worship. Businessman Mohit Budhiraja, wearing a mask and carrying sanitiser, went to his local temple in eastern Delhi for the first time since the lockdown. \u201cIt felt like something was missing when I couldn\u2019t come to the temple for all these weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope things improve, but now I will come every day.\u201d Many temples set up sanitisation tunnels at their entrances and barred worshippers from bringing offerings. \u201cPeople are having their temperature tested twice before they get in,\u201d said Ravindra Goel, a trustee of the Jhandewalan temple, one of the oldest in Delhi. The 400-year-old Jama Masjid mosque \u2013 one of the biggest in India \u2013 planned to allow the faithful in just three times a day instead of the usual five. Delhi is one of India\u2019s worst coronavirus hotspots, accounting for more than 27,600 cases and 761 deaths \u2013 although the real figures may be much higher. Mumbai, which accounts for around a fifth of India\u2019s cases and where hospitals have been overrun, was more cautious. Roadside shops were allowed to reopen, but malls, restaurants and hair salons remained shuttered. The Indian government says the tough lockdown it ordered on 25 March has limited the spread of the coronavirus. But it is now braced for a major hit to the economy, with millions of labourers now jobless. Rating agencies have said the economy could contract by more than 5% this year, after average growth of about 7% over the past decade. Children in South Africa began returning to classrooms on Monday as part of a gradual loosening of restrictions imposed under a months-long Covid-19 lockdown in the continent\u2019s most industrialised nation, reports Reuters. The reopening of schools had been delayed after teachers\u2019 unions urged school staff to defy the government order to do so last week, saying schools lacked sufficient health and hygiene measures to keep educators and pupils safe. South Africa has counted nearly 50,000 cases of coronavirus \u2013 the most of any country in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 along with almost 1,000 deaths. Education minister Angie Motshekga said on Sunday that stronger efforts to equip schools over the past week meant 95% of South Africa\u2019s primary and secondary schools were able to host classes. \u201cThe golden rule is there will be no school that will resume if not ready to do so,\u201d Motshekga said. Initially, only pupils in grades 7 and 12 will return to class, with other years phased in gradually. The government will find alternative arrangements for pupils at schools unable to open on Monday, she said. Many of South Africa\u2019s state-operated schools are in poor shape, particularly in rural areas, and analysts say that a quarter of them have no running water, making hand-washing nearly impossible. Others have been vandalised or hit by arson attacks during a nationwide lockdown imposed by the government in March. Government officials, however, worry further delaying a return to classrooms would mean a generation of school children risks losing a key part of their education, and the future opportunities it brings. If you would like a brief break from coronanews, these have been the most popular other stories on The Guardian over the weekend: According to ABS-CBN, the education secretary of the Philippines has confirmed the government\u2019s intention to outlaw face-to-face education until a vaccine against coronavirus is discovered and distributed. \u201cIt is a challenging task for us at the Department of Education to prepare our schools in a different set-up but we are committed to our duty to make education available and thriving, even in the most difficult time,\u201d Leonor Briones said.

Thanks! Here\u2019s a summary of the key coronavirus points so far today. Infections globally have passed 7 million and deaths have passed 400,000. Covid-19 infections now stand at 7,015,079, after another rise in cases from Brazil. The south American country now has 691,758 cases and 36,455 deaths. The US is the worst-affected country, with 1,940,468 confirmed cases and more than a quarter of the world\u2019s deaths: 110,503. There are 15 countries with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. New Zealand has declared itself Covid-19-free. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said all coronavirus restrictions, except those at their international border would be lifted at midnight on Monday night. She said she \u201cdid a little dance\u201d when she heard there were no cases of coronavirus left in the country. For the past 10 days, a lone woman aged in her 50s, who lived in Auckland, was the last person in New Zealand known to be suffering from Covid-19. On Monday, health officials said, she had reported 48 hours symptom-free and was considered recovered. UK travel quarantine laws come into force. Most people arriving in Britain from Monday will have to self-isolate for two weeks under a new coronavirus restriction that will apply those coming in by plane, ferry or train. The measures apply to both residents and foreign nationals with some exceptions. Travellers will have to provide details of their journey and the address where they will self-isolate and will face fines of up to \u00a31,000 if they do not follow the rules. Tokyo\u2019s red-light district workers to be tested for Covid-19. Health authorities are to ask people working in host clubs and similar establishments to be tested regularly for Covid-19 after evidence that the virus is spreading among people who work in the capital\u2019s night-time economy. The city reported 14 new infections on Sunday, six of which involved people working in clubs where employees pour drinks and talk to customers in close proximity. Vietnam reports two imported cases of Covid-19. Both infections were in Vietnamese citizens returning from Mexico who were quarantined on arrival, its health ministry said.The south-east Asian country has gone 53 days without a domestically transmitted infection and has a total of 331 cases, with no deaths, the ministry said. More than 90% of the confirmed cases have recovered. Mexico deaths near 14,000. The country\u2019s health ministry reported on Sunday 3,484 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 188 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 117,103 cases and 13,699 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is significantly higher than the confirmed cases. The head of Mexico\u2019s Social Security Institute, Zoe Robledo, a close aide to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said on Sunday he had tested positive for the coronavirus and would continue to work remotely. Poland reports virus spike linked to mine. Most of the hundreds of new cases reported by the health ministry were linked to a coal mine in the country\u2019s south. The 1,151 new cases \u2013 576 of them registered Saturday and 575 on Sunday \u2013 marked the EU country\u2019s highest consecutive two-day total thus far. Nearly two-thirds of those newly infected in Poland, which depends on coal to generate around 80% of its power, are employees of the Zofiowka mine and their family members, according to the health ministry. Saudi virus cases top 100,000 with new spike ahead of the hajj. The total number of infections rose to 101,914 \u2013 the highest in the Gulf \u2013 while the death toll climbed to 712, the health ministry said.The kingdom has seen infections spike as it eases stringent lockdown measures, with the number of daily cases exceeding 3,000 for the second day in a row on Sunday. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year\u2019s hajj, scheduled for the end of July, but have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. Health authorities in Tokyo are to ask people working in host clubs and similar establishments to be regularly tested for Covid-19 after evidence that the virus is spreading among people who work in the capital\u2019s night-time economy. The city reported 14 new infections on Sunday, six of which involved people working in clubs where employees pour drinks and talk to customers in close proximity. \u201cWe want to make sure that people do not catch or transmit the virus also in night-time entertainment districts,\u201d Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, said on Sunday, according to the Kyodo news agency. On Saturday, Tokyo reported 26 new infections, a dozen of which were men in their 20s and 30s who work at the same host club in Kabukicho, a red-light district of more than 4,000 bars, restaurants, cafes, pachinko parlours and commercial sex establishments. Four of the remaining cases are also thought to be connected to the city\u2019s huge night-time economy. The number of cases traced to host clubs \u2013 where women pay to talk to male employees over drinks and snacks \u2013 and similar establishments in Tokyo has risen since Japan lifted its seven-week state of emergency at the end of May, raising fears of a second wave in the city. The economy minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said the government would release guidelines on containing the spread of Covid-19 in entertainment districts at the weekend. Media reports said the measures could included regular Covid-19 tests for employees at clubs where social distancing and other preventive measures are difficult to implement. \u201cWhat we sell here is us, ourselves,\u201d a woman who works at a \u201cgirl\u2019s bar\u201d in Tokyo told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. \u201cSo wearing a mask would show disrespect towards our customers.\u201d Other clubs, however, say they have taken measures such as ensuring adequate ventilation, providing hand sanitiser and checking customers\u2019 temperatures at the door. Employees must wear a face covering and maintain a distance of at least one metre from customers. Many bars and restaurants closed during the state of emergency or reduced their business hours in response to a request from Koike, who does not have the legal powers to force them to close. Others, though, have remained open, complaining that they will not be able to survive a prolonged shutdown. The number of daily infections is falling throughout Japan, with 36 reported on Sunday to being the country\u2019s total to 17,864, while no new deaths were recorded for the first time in three months. Tokyo, which has the highest number of infections at nearly 5,400, is gradually easing restrictions on businesses, with cinemas, gyms and cram schools and other facilities reopening last Monday. But a day later, Koike issued an alert, reminding Tokyoites to avoid the \u201cthree Cs\u201d \u2013 crowded and confined spaces, and close human contact \u2013 an approach that some experts have credited with Japan\u2019s success at containing the outbreak. Restaurants have been urged to close at 10 pm \u2013 two hours later than during the state of emergency \u2013 but restrictions have yet to be lifted on nightclubs and live music venues. In case you missed it, New Zealand is Covid-free, with no active cases in the country. All coronavirus restrictions will be lifted from midnight on Monday, except the border, which remains closed. You can read our full story here, and below is the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, making the announcement, including describing how she did a \u201clittle dance\u201d in celebration. And just while I\u2019m on newspaper front pages, here\u2019s the New York Times\u2019 international edition for Monday: A quick look at the UK newspaper front pages, shows they are dominated by Black Lives Matter marches. The Guardian carries a big picture of the statue of the 17th century slave trader, Edward Colston, being dumped into Bristol Harbour, with the headline: \u201cGovernment accused of \u2018ignorance\u2019 on UK racism\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Martin Farrer writes that the Mail quotes the home secretary, Priti Patel, calling the race protests, \u201cLawless &amp; reckless\u201d, while the Mirror has \u201cThe march for change\u201d. The Times leads with \u201cLaws to curb Chinese takeovers\u201d and at the Telegraph they\u2019ve plumped for \u201cQuarantine won\u2019t work, Home Office concedes\u201d. The FT goes with \u201cShipping industry warns of trade logjam as crews remain stranded\u201d. The Express has \u201cBoris battle plan to save 3m jobs\u201d. And the i has \u201cStay at home warning for northern cities\u201d. Most people arriving in Britain from Monday will have to self-isolate for two weeks under a new coronavirus restriction that will apply those coming in by plane, ferry or train. The measure, which applies to both residents and visitors with some exceptions, aims to prevent a second wave of contagion from abroad. The aviation sector fears it will be hard hit, and British Airways and budget carriers EasyJet and Ryanair have launched joint legal proceedings against the government over what they called a \u201cdisproportionate and unfair\u201d step. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the new rules made sense because \u201cthe proportion of infections that come from abroad increases\u201d as Britain\u2019s own caseload drops. Travellers will have to provide details of their journey and the address where they will self-isolate and will face fines of up to \u00a31,000 if they do not follow the rules. Exemptions are being made in several cases \u2013 including for truck drivers, \u201cessential\u201d healthcare workers and people travelling from Ireland who have been there for at least two weeks. The government is pushing ahead with a gradual lockdown easing that will see retail reopen on 15 June, and restaurants and bars begin limited service in early July. Britain\u2019s death toll stands at 40,625 according to Johns Hopkins university figures, trailing only that of the United States (110,514). Japan\u2019s economy is fairing better than feared but still in recession Japanese growth figures were better than initially feared in the first quarter, according to official data published on Monday, but the world\u2019s third-top economy was still deep in recession. Gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.6% in the January-March period compared to the previous quarter. Authorities had initially reported a 0.9% contraction. Economists had expected the revision, with the market forecasting a 0.5% contraction. The figures confirmed that Japan was suffering its first recession \u2013 defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction \u2013 since 2015. Japan has reported just over 17,000 Covid-19 cases and around 900 deaths. Moving back to the Americas: Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei said on Sunday that 18 employees at his office and on his security detail have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, so he will work remotely and the presidential offices will be disinfected, Reuters reports. \u201cI and the vice president will carry out our activities remotely. We\u2019re healthy. We\u2019ve been tested. We don\u2019t have coronavirus,\u201d Giammattei said in a televised address. The Central American country has registered 7,055 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 252 fatalities from the pandemic. Hi \u2013 this is Alison Rourke picking up our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. You can get in touch with me via email on alison.rourke@guardian.co.uk. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. I\u2019ll be heading over to our live US coverage now. Thanks for following along and, as always, to those of you who took the time to get in touch on Twitter and via email. That press conference is over now. On the trans-Tasman bubble with Australia, Ardern says she doesn\u2019t want to give New Zealand business owners a false start \u2013 and she does not have a date at this time. Speaking as New Zealand declares itself free of coronavirus, Director-General of Health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, says that this week anyone crossing the border into New Zealand will be tested twice in a two week period. There will also be surveillance testing of anyone working at or around the border, he says. Community based testing will continue, with a focus on anyone with symptoms. Dr Bloomfield says that he is confident community transmission of the virus has been eliminated, Stuff.NZ reports. \u201cThere was no better plan than eliminating the virus,\u201d he said. New Zealand Director-General of Health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield says the country will keep an eye on whether mask-use will needed, but at the moment, because of the lack of community transmission, the government does not recommend the use of masks generally. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, speaking just now at a press conference, says she \u201cdid a little dance,\u201d when she heard the country was Covid-19 free. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: Hours after New Zealand\u2019s health officials announced there were no active cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand for the first time since 28 February, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, announced that her government would abandon all restrictions except border controls from midnight tonight. The removal of all domestic restrictions is happening a couple of days sooner than the government initially flagged it might. From tonight, all remaining rules about physical distancing and gathering sizes will end. \u201cWe are ready,\u201d Ardern told reporters at a news conference in Wellington that is ongoing. She praised New Zealanders for having \u201cunited in unprecedented ways to crush the virus.\u201d New Zealand recorded less than 1,500 cases of Covid-19; 22 people died. But Ardern warned that elimination was not \u201ca point in time,\u201d and she was cautious about saying the crisis was over for New Zealand. \u201cWe almost certainly see cases here again,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is not a sign that we have failed; it is a reality of this virus.\u201d Strict border controls will remain in place; only New Zealanders and their families are currently allowed to enter the country and must stay in government-run quarantine for a fortnight. The head of Mexico\u2019s Social Security Institute (IMSS), Zoe Robledo, a close aide to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, said on Sunday he had tested positive for the coronavirus and would continue to work remotely, Reuters reports. \u201cI want to announce that today I tested positive for Covid-19,\u201d Robledo said on Twitter, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Medical experts would continue to follow his case and check on his contacts, Robledo added. The 41-year-old Robledo is one of the most prominent public figures of the administration, and his announcement may renew concerns that the president is also at risk of contagion. Lopez Obrador has spent the week touring southern Mexico in spite of the fact that coronavirus cases and fatalities have continued to hit new highs in the past few days. Michael Baker and Nick Wilson, professors of public heath at the University of Otago in New Zealand, outline five ways the country can keep its cases at zero, after it reported on Monday that the last coronavirus patient had recovered: According to our modelling at the the University of Otago, it is now very likely (well above a 95% chance) New Zealand has completely eliminated the virus. This is in line with modelling by our colleagues at Te P\u016bnaha Matatini (a research centre based at University of Auckland). It is also the 17th day since the last new case was reported. New Zealand has a total of 1,154 confirmed cases (combined total of confirmed and probable cases is 1,504) and 22 people have died. Today\u2019s news is an important milestone and a time to celebrate. But as we continue to rebuild the economy, there are several challenges ahead if New Zealand wants to retain its Covid-19-free status while the pandemic continues elsewhere. It remains important that good science supports the government\u2019s risk assessment and management. Below, we recommend several ways people can protect themselves. But we also argue New Zealand needs an urgent overhaul of the health system, including the establishment of a new national public health agency for disease prevention and control. Read more about what New Zealand can do to remain Covid-19-free here: Australia said on Monday China remains unresponsive to its weeks-long pleas to ease tensions between the two trading partners that escalated after Canberra called for an international enquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus, Reuters reports. Australia has insisted the call for an independent investigation into the pandemic, which it says most likely originated in a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, was not politically targeted at Beijing. China accused Australia of playing \u201cpetty tricks\u201d and the Chinese ambassador to Australia warned Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products if Australia pursued the inquiry. China has also since suspended beef imports from four of Australia\u2019s largest meat processors and imposed hefty tariffs on imports of barley, although both sides say those moves are unrelated to the spat over the pandemic. Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham, who has been requesting discussions with his Chinese counterpart for weeks, said Beijing has been ignoring Canberra\u2019s pleas. \u201cUnfortunately, our requests for a discussion have so far been met negatively,\u201d Birmingham told Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) radio on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s disappointing.\u201d China is by far Australia\u2019s biggest export market, taking more than 30% of Australia\u2019s exports by value. Vietnam ratified a free trade agreement with the European Union on Monday that will cut or eliminate 99% of tariffs on goods traded between the Southeast Asian country and the bloc, and provide Vietnam with a much-needed post pandemic boost, Reuters reports. Deputies in the National Assembly, which nearly always ratifies government proposals, voted by over 94% in favour of the European Union Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). The EVFTA, expected to take effect in July, is the European Union\u2019s second deal with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian nations (ASEAN) after Singapore, and one of few with a developing country. The World Bank said in May the EVFTA could boost Vietnam\u2019s gross domestic product and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively by 2030 and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty. Honduras has extended a curfew by one week through June 14 in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, security ministry spokesman Jair Meza said on Sunday. Meza made the announcement on national television even as the Central American country is about to begin the gradual re-opening of its economy on Monday.

Here are the 15 worst-affected countries worldwide \u2013 these are also the fifteen countries with over 100,000 confirmed cases: US: 1,940,468 (Deaths: 110,503) Brazil: 691,758 (Deaths: 36,455) Russia: 467,073 (Deaths: 5,851) United Kingdom: 287,621 (Deaths: 40,625) India: 257,486 (Deaths: 7,207) Spain: 241,550 (Deaths: 27,136) Italy: 234,998 (Deaths: 33,899) Peru: 196,515 (Deaths: 5,465) France: 191,102 (Deaths: 29,158) Germany: 185,750 (Deaths: 8,685) Iran: 171,789 (Deaths: 8,281) Turkey: 170,132 (Deaths: 4,692) Chile: 134,150 (Deaths: 1,637) Mexico: 117,103 (Deaths: 13,699) Saudi Arabia: 101,914 (Deaths: 712) The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide passed 7 million on Monday, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who rely on official government data. The current figure stands at 7,006,436. At least 402,699 people have lost their lives in just over six months of the global pandemic so far. The US is the worst-affected country, with 1,940,468 confirmed cases and more than a quarter of the world\u2019s deaths: 110,503. There are 15 countries with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. The true death and cases figures are likely to be higher, due to differing testing rates, definitions, time lags and suspected underreporting. The New York Times reports that as many as 400,000 New York City workers may return to jobs starting Monday, as restrictions are eased into Phase 2 in the city, which is the last part of New York State to meet the criteria for Phase 2: Exactly 100 days since its first case of coronavirus was confirmed, New York City, which weathered extensive hardship as an epicenter of the worldwide outbreak, is set to take the first tentative steps toward reopening its doors on Monday. Getting here took the sacrifice of millions of New Yorkers who learned to live radically different lives. More than 205,000 have been infected, and nearly 22,000 have died. As many as 400,000 workers could begin returning to construction jobs, manufacturing sites and retail stores in the city\u2019s first phase of reopening\u2014 a surge of normalcy that seemed almost inconceivable several weeks ago, when the city\u2019s hospitals were at a breaking point and as many as 800 people were dying from Covid-19 on a single day. Poland saw a record spike in new confirmed coronavirus cases over the weekend, with most of the hundreds of infections reported by the health ministry linked to a coal mine in the country\u2019s south. The 1,151 new cases - 576 of them registered Saturday and 575 on Sunday - marked the EU country\u2019s highest consecutive two-day total thus far. Nearly two-thirds of those newly infected in Poland, which depends on coal to generate some 80% of its power, are employees of the Zofiowka mine and their family members, according to the health ministry. Zofiowka, in the city of Jastrzebie-Zdroj, is owned by the state-run JSW mining group - the largest producer of coking coal used in steel production in the European Union. Poland, a country of 38 million people, has so far reported 26,561 cases of Covid-19, including 1,157 deaths and 12,855 recoveries. Meanwhile in Australia, the temporary free childcare system will end on 13 July , the government has announced. The system, introduced at the height of the pandemic, was due to expire in late June, but the government had previously kept the door open to extending it depending on the health and economic situation. In recent times, though, the government had signalled it would expire soon because of increases in childcare attendance. The education minister, Dan Tehan, said the temporary early childhood education and care relief package had \u201cdone its job and would be turned off on 12 July\u201d. Here is how New Zealanders want their country to change after Covid-19: Kiwis are celebrating on Twitter: As New Zealand declares it has zero remaining cases of coronavirus, Professor Michael Baker, Professor of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington has said in comments provided by the country\u2019s Science Media Centre, regarding the expected move to Level 1 restrictions: It is a real achievement that New Zealand may shortly be moving to Level 1 and removing the remaining physical distancing restrictions. This event, when it happens, is a statement that we have achieved the goal of eliminating the Covid-19 virus from this country. This is, however, only the first battle in what will be a long-term war against this virus ... This risk will rise again in New Zealand as we gradually increase the numbers of incoming travellers. It will also rise during the coming winter when coronaviruses are more transmissible. Now is also the time to review the national and local response to this pandemic and consider what changes are needed to get us through the next one to two years or longer of this pandemic. New Zealand has no active diagnosed cases of Covid-19 for the first time since 28 February, health officials say. It has now been 17 days since the country last recorded a new case of the coronavirus. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce in two hours that her government will abandon on Thursday all remaining Covid-19 restrictions on the country except strict border controls, which will remain in place. Ardern locked down the country on 25 March when case numbers were low, with restrictions gradually easing since. Fewer than 1,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in New Zealand, and 22 have died. New Zealanders have eagerly awaited status reports on the last person confirmed to have the virus, who has been the sole remaining sufferer in New Zealand for the past ten days. In a statement today, the Ministry of Health said the woman \u2013 in her 50s and based in Auckland \u2013 had recovered. \u201cThe Ministry has been notified by Auckland Regional Public Health that its remaining case has been symptom free for 48 hours and is regarded as recovered,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe person has now been released from isolation.\u201d Japan\u2019s economy shrank less than initially estimated in the first quarter but the broad impact from the coronavirus crisis is still expected to send the country deeper into recession, Reuters reports. A series of recent April data including exports, factory output and jobs figures suggested Japan is facing its worst postwar slump in the current quarter as the outbreak forced people to stay at home and businesses to close globally. The world\u2019s third-largest economy shrank an annualised 2.2% in January-March, revised data showed on Monday, less than the 3.4% contraction indicated in a preliminary reading and compared with a median market forecast of a 2.1% drop. The revised data confirmed Japan had slipped into recession for the first time in four and a half years, after a 7.2% contraction in October-December, pressured by last year\u2019s sales tax hike and the US-China trade war. Recessions are defined as two straight quarters of contraction. On quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy contracted 0.6% in the first quarter compared with an initial reading of a 0.9% decline. Confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Panama reached 16,425 on Sunday, up 421 from the previous day, and deaths climbed by seven to 393, the health ministry said. Director of Epidemiology Lourdes Moreno gave the Central American country\u2019s latest data at a news conference. Vietnam on Monday reported two new coronavirus infections, both of which were imported cases involving Vietnamese citizens returning from Mexico who were quarantined on arrival, its health ministry said. The Southeast Asian country has gone 53 days without a domestically transmitted infection and has a total of 331 cases, with no deaths, the ministry said. Over 90% of the confirmed cases have recovered. Brazil has registered 37,312 total coronavirus deaths while total cases in the country reached 685,427, according to the health ministry on Sunday. Unlike in the previous day, the government released cumulative figures on Sunday and not a tally of deaths and new infections in the last 24 hours. On Saturday the Latin American nation had registered 35,930 total coronavirus deaths and 672,846 confirmed cases. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported on Sunday 3,484 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 188 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 117,103 cases and 13,699 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is significantly higher than the confirmed cases. UK universities have been told to expect a sharp fall in the number of new international students coming next year, including a loss of up to \u00a3460m (US$585m) in income from students from east Asia. A new survey of international students by the British Council has found that nearly 14,000 fewer students from eight countries \u2013 including China, Singapore and Malaysia \u2013 are likely to come to the UK in 2020/21 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The decline of 20% in students from east Asia would amount to a 12% fall in overall international student numbers, causing a \u00a3460m loss of income from tuition and living expenses such as accommodation. The number of coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia surpassed 100,000 on Sunday, the health ministry said, amid a new surge in infections just weeks ahead of the start of the hajj, AFP reports. The total number of infections rose to 101,914 \u2013 the highest in the Gulf \u2013 while the death toll climbed to 712, the ministry added. The kingdom has seen infections spike as it eases stringent lockdown measures, with the number of daily cases exceeding 3,000 for the second day in a row on Sunday. On Friday, the kingdom announced a renewed lockdown in the city of Jeddah, gateway to the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, to counter the jump in cases. The kingdom has said it will continue to suspend the year-round \u201cumrah\u201d pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina over fears of the coronavirus pandemic spreading in Islam\u2019s holiest cities. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year\u2019s hajj, scheduled for the end of July, but have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. Last year, some 2.5 million faithful travelled to Saudi Arabia from across the world to take part in the hajj, which all Muslims must perform at least once in their lives if able.

The known number of people who have lost their lives in just over six months of the coronavirus pandemic has passed the sombre milestone of 400,000. More than a quarter of these deaths are in the US alone. Cases meanwhile are approaching 7 million, with 6,981,701 currently confirmed. Meanwhile Saudi Arabia has become the 15th country to count more than 100,000 cases, with 101,914 confirmed infections, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: Global deaths pass 400,000. According to Johns Hopkins University figures, known coronavirus deaths worldwide currently number 401,564. The sombre milestone comes as cases approach 7 million, with 6,973,195 currently confirmed. The US, with the highest deaths and infections globally, has 1,931,850 confirmed cases and 110,141 deaths. Brazil is next highest, with 672,846 cases and 35,930 deaths. US death toll is approaching 110,000, according to the CDC. The centre reported 1,920,904 cases of the coronavirus, an increase of 29,214 cases from its previous count, and said Covid-19 deaths in the US had risen by 709 to 109,901. India has recorded nearly 10,000 new cases. India on Sunday registered 9,971 new coronavirus cases, taking the country\u2019s tally to 246,628 cases, with 6,929 deaths. The case numbers lags behind only the US, Brazil, Russia, UK and Spain. The country is preparing to reopen malls, restaurants, hotels and places of worship on Monday. France has registered 13 new deaths. The country\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by 13 on Sunday to reach 29,155, while the number of confirmed cases increased by 343 to 153,977. The number of people in hospital and ICU has continued to decline. Canada has reported 722 new cases. Canada has confirmed 722 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total to 95,057.
