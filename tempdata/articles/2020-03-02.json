      "bodyText": "Joe Biden\u2019s decisive victory in South Carolina on Saturday night has teed up a major showdown in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, as the race speeds towards the critical Super Tuesday vote and the former vice-president\u2019s centrist rivals ponder whether to step aside. On Sunday evening, the first of them did: campaign officials confirmed to the Guardian that Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was out. Biden delivered a landslide in the first southern state to vote, establishing himself as the main rival to frontrunner Bernie Sanders\u2019 progressive campaign. At a victory party in the state capital, Columbia, the former vice-president issued a thinly veiled dig at his opponent, a self-declared democratic socialist, as he urged voters to rally behind a \u201ca lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat\u201d. He continued the charge on Sunday with appearances on major news shows in which he touted his legislative record in the Senate and the White House, repeating the same message: \u201cThe people aren\u2019t looking for revolution. They\u2019re looking for results.\u201d With less than 48 hours before the Super Tuesday ballot, in which 14 states and two other constituencies will decide more than a third of all the presidential delegates, Biden\u2019s campaign still faces an uphill battle against Sanders. The Vermont senator has raised vastly more money, crisscrossed the country to rally and spent more on TV advertising. Biden had focused almost entirely on South Carolina, appealing for support among black voters who make up a majority and who eventually carried him to victory after significant losses in the other early states. Sanders came a distant second but still holds a small lead in the national delegate count after victories in New Hampshire and Nevada. He shot back at Biden on Sunday, describing himself as \u201can existential threat to the corporate wing of the Democratic party\u201d. \u201cFor too long the Democratic party and leaders have been going to rich peoples\u2019 homes raising money and they\u2019ve ignored the working class and the middle class,\u201d Sanders told ABC\u2019s This Week. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, he criticised Biden\u2019s campaign for taking support from a super pac fundraising committee and mega-rich donors. Saturday\u2019s result also raised questions about the future of other centrist candidates. Buttigieg initially told NBC News he planned to continue fighting, as \u201cEvery day we are in this campaign is a day that we have reached the conclusion that pushing forward is the best thing we can do for the country and for the party\u201d. In the early evening, however, came the news that he was gone. It is unlikely the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar will drop out before Tuesday, which is when her home state takes to the ballot box in a race that has also been targeted by Sanders. Sanders is polling ahead in the delegate-heavy states of California and Virginia and is running close to Biden in Texas and North Carolina. Despite this, Biden predicted he would see a strong showing on election night. \u201cI feel good about where we are,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s not for me to tell any other candidate they should get out of the race. They\u2019ll know whether or not they remain viable, whether they have a chance. I\u2019m confident that the primaries that are coming up and the ones that follow are going to whittle that field.\u201d Speaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Biden said he hadn\u2019t had any conversations with other candidates but: \u201cI think everyone knows it\u2019s going to be much more difficult to win back the Senate and keep control of the House if Bernie\u2019s at the top of the ticket.\u201d Super Tuesday also marks the first time the billionaire Mike Bloomberg will appear on the ballot. Despite two poor debates and Biden\u2019s surge, the former New York mayor has shown no signs of leaving the race, having invested $500m of his personal fortune. Bloomberg has bought a three-minute primetime advertising slot to be broadcast on two TV stations on Sunday, where he will make a presidential style address touting his leadership experience and criticising the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Biden reiterated on Sunday that he planned to push for the nomination if no single candidate secures the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to win the party\u2019s presidential candidacy outright.

Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep or close the conversation; let them know that they can ask more questions later at any time. Set a calm, reassuring tone. Have these conversations sooner rather than later, so that you are your child\u2019s trusted source of information. Be honest but maintain appropriate boundaries; reassure your child that you are OK and have support from others to they don\u2019t feel responsible for or worry about you. Let them know, if you seem stressed or upset, that you will feel better again soon and that emotional states are transient. What: Keep it simple and factual, and focus on positive messages.

      "bodyText": "A nursing home in Washington state is being closely monitored after five residents and a staff member tested positive for the coronavirus, one man died and more than 50 others showed respiratory symptoms, according to state health officials. The first coronavirus death in the US was confirmed in Washington state on Saturday. The second death was a man in his 70s with an underlying health condition who died at the nursing home. The other cases include a woman in her 80s, a woman in her 90s and a man in his 70s. All three have underlying health conditions, and were reportedly in \u201ccritical condition.\u201d The US has confirmed approximately 60 cases of the severe respiratory illness. The World Health Organization has reported that 85,000 people have been sickened and more than 2,800 have died worldwide. The vast majority of cases have been in China but the virus is spreading, seriously affecting international travel, business and sporting and cultural events. Most coronavirus infections result in mild symptoms but some can lead to pneumonia. Older people, especially those with chronic illnesses, are vulnerable. Officials think the virus spreads mainly through coughs or sneezes. The Washington state nursing home, Life Care Center of Kirkland, has about 108 residents and 180 staff members. Officials reported that about 27 residents and 25 staff members had respiratory symptoms or had been hospitalized with respiratory conditions including pneumonia and were being tested for coronavirus. It was not immediately clear when those test results would be released. The cases confirmed include a woman in her 40s who worked at the center and was in \u201csatisfactory condition\u201d as of Saturday. A woman in her 70s, a resident, was reported in serious condition. The Life Care Center announced it would not allow visits from families, volunteers or vendors and was putting a hold on admissions. Ellie Basham, the executive director, said in a statement on Sunday any residents with symptoms were in isolation and all associates must be screened before work. If they have symptoms they are sent home. \u201cWe are following the infection control recommendations from the [federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], including proper hand-washing techniques and wearing masks, gowns and gloves when caring for any symptomatic patients,\u201d Basham said. Dr Jeff Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King county, said on Saturday officials were investigating the situation at the facility and \u201cwould not be surprised to find additional cases\u201d. A team of about 10 officials from the CDC traveled to Washington state to work with local health experts. \u201cWe are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people, as we would be wherever people who are susceptible might be gathering,\u201d said Duchin. More than two dozen firefighters and police officers in Kirkland who have responded to calls at the Life Care Center over the last few weeks have been placed under quarantine, according to the city government. They are either at home or at a fire station. \u201cNone of them are presenting any symptoms and we hope they will be tested and cleared soon,\u201d city manager Kurt Triplett said. A group of about 16 nursing students and one faculty member from the Lake Washington Institute of Technology visited the Life Care Center late last week, Dr Amy Morrison, president of the college, said in a statement. As of Saturday evening, school officials were awaiting instructions from public health officials. \u201cThe safety of our students, faculty and staff is our priority, so as a precautionary measure, we are disinfecting the college campus tomorrow,\u201d Morrison said. Over the last few days, local officials reported four coronavirus cases in King county, which includes Seattle, including the man in his 50s who died. The patient, who was not immediately identified, was the first reported US death associated with the coronavirus. He was chronically ill and had no history of travel to affected areas or contact with a known Covid-19 case, officials said. Health officials said on Saturday they did not see any connection between the man who died and the nursing facility, but they were still investigating how those patients contracted the virus. On Sunday, state health officials reported two new cases in King county. A man in his 60s with underlying health conditions was reported to be in \u201ccritical but stable condition\u201d while another man in his 60s, also with underlying health conditions, was in critical condition. One unidentified Washington state patient reportedly works for the US Postal Service. According to Kiro 7, a local news station, the man worked at a Seattle Network Distribution Center and no mail was sent out from the facility. Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency in response to the new cases, saying state agencies should use \u201call resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak\u201d. In January, Washington state reported the first case of coronavirus in the US when a man in his 30s was admitted to a hospital in Everett after returning from central China. He has since recovered. As of Sunday, 12 people in Washington state had tested positive, officials said.",

If it is felt that the opposition have moved it out of the blue or that they\u2019ve been moving them too often, occasionally that the member be no longer heard would be moved. Instead now it\u2019s just become how this place operates.

Not only did the treasurer poke fun at elements of eastern customs and religions, he also shat all over the idea of having a statement outlining what your government is doing to protect and support some of the most vulnerable members of society.</p> \n  <p><strong>Andrew Leigh</strong> has some things to say about it, ahead of national accounts:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>According to its latest annual report, <a href=\"https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2019-10/p2019-25128-tsyar-2018-19_0.pdf\">Outcome 1</a> of the Australian Treasury is \u201cto improve the wellbeing of the Australian people\u201d. Treasury has included wellbeing in its mission statement <a href=\"https://treasury.gov.au/publication/treasury-annual-report-2001-2002/part-1-overview\">since John Howard\u2019s era</a>, so it\u2019s bizarre that the treasurer is now rejecting his own department\u2019s mission.</p> \n   <p>As the shadow treasurer has noted, measuring wellbeing is now an accepted part of how many countries do their budgets, taking account of indicators such as child poverty and mental health. As we teach students in first-year economics, economics isn\u2019t about maximising money, it\u2019s about maximising wellbeing.</p> \n   <p>But instead, the treasurer decided to attack Treasury\u2019s wellbeing approach! On the way through, he managed to offend New Zealanders. He offended the millions who practice meditation. And he offended Hindus, with the Hindu Council of Australia describing his comments as \u201cbrazen, racist and Hindu-phobic\u201d. NSW Liberal party member <strong>Dhanya Mani</strong> said he \u201cturned a key part of my identity into a racist punchline\u201d.</p> \n   <p>Here\u2019s the bizarre thing. Since 2013, growth has slowed. Wage growth is the worst on record. Business investment is at its lowest level since the 1990s recession. Household spending is growing at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. The Liberals\u2019 promise of surpluses every year have turned into six deficits. So you\u2019d think that the treasurer would be happy to add alternative metrics.

first up before the legal and constitutional affairs Senate estimates this morning. <br></p> \n  <p>Commissioner Reece Kershaw has just given an opening statement and attempted to explain why the AFP decided not to investigate allegations against Angus Taylor. </p> \n  <p>You\u2019ll remember, of course, that the AFP decided not to investigate Taylor following revelations in the Guardian that he used a false document to launch an attack on City of Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore for her travel-related carbon emissions. </p> \n  <p>Kershaw said police had taken into account the recent findings of had John Lawler, who reviewed how the agency handled sensitive investigations, including leaks, in the wake of the controversial ABC raids. <br></p> \n  <p>One of Lawler\u2019s findings was that the AFP should consider the harm from any alleged offences when deciding whether or not to investigate.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn deciding not to pursue the matter we have taken on board certain elements of the framework set out in Mr Lawler\u2019s review report,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provided clearer detail about our considerations in determining that the matter should not be pursued.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI want to express once again my utmost confidence in the AFP officers who investigate a range of complex matters in a challenging environment, and do so to a high standard.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Labor senator <strong>Kristina Keneally</strong> is immediately on the attack on the Taylor issue. She asks about comments from the AFP\u2019s deputy commissioner Ian McCartney that there was a \u201clow level of ongoing harm\u201d in the Taylor matter. Kershaw said the decision was objective and considered. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHarm was part of it and also so was the apology that was made as was the significant level of resources and operational priorities,\u201d he said. <br></p> \n  <p>Keneally asks whether the AFP interviewed Moore. </p> \n  <p>\u201cMy information was that there was no interview,\u201d Kershaw says. <br></p> \n

Estimates continues \u2013 we will bring you anything we miss early tomorrow morning. Keep those tips and messages coming \u2013 we appreciate it. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy, as well as the Guardian brains trust dedicated to the estimates hearings today. If you need me before tomorrow, you\u2019ll catch me here and here. Apologies if I don\u2019t get back to you immediately, I sometimes run a little behind in replying, but I do read the messages. I\u2019ll see you back here early tomorrow. In the meantime, sneeze into your elbows, stop touching your face, wash your hands and take care of you. As seen by Mike Bowers: The department of home affairs is reviewing the number of Indigenous Australians in immigration detention following a high court ruling. The high court found last month that Aboriginal Australians are not aliens for the purpose of the constitution and cannot be deported, prompting the immediate release of Brendan Thoms, whose case was considered by the court. The department said it was currently negotiating with another 23 people to establish whether they met the test of indigeneity as set out by the high court. The department would be unable to detain them further if they met the test, secretary Mike Pezzullo said. \u201cThere would be an absence of power to detain people in those circumstances ... we\u2019re working on that as quickly as possible,\u201d he said. Here\u2019s what the National Archives told me when I asked about it: Under the Archives Act 1983: A record is a document, or an object, in any form (including any electronic form) that is, or has been, kept by reason of: (a) any information or matter that it contains or that can be obtained from it; or (b) its connection with any event, person, circumstance or thing. A Commonwealth record is a record that is the property of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth institution. Under section 24.1 of the Archives Act 1983 it is an offence to destroy a Commonwealth record without the permission of the National Archives. The National Archives provides permission to destroy Commonwealth records through instruments known as records authorities issued under section 24(2)(b) of the Archives Act 1983. Without knowing the nature of the records contained in the notebooks, and the context of their creation, it is not possible to determine whether the destruction of the notebooks was allowable under the Archives Act. We have an update on the senior departmental officer who destroyed her notebooks, which included notes on a hastily convened meeting in relation to the sports grants Nicole Rose, the head of Austrac, made headlines over the weekend, with questions over her qualifications for the role. She has answered some questions about that story in estimates: Rose: To circumvent the enormous amount of work that it was taking my staff to answer, I provided a CV to the journalist and that has been put in the paper. Nothing in there is a surprise to anyone I work with or any of my employers. Louise Pratt: So that is a diploma of what? Rose: Hotel school diploma in hotel business and management. Pratt: Thank you. And when did you complete that qualification? Rose: I can\u2019t recall. Pratt: And that is your tertiary qualification? Rose: I could go into the two university degrees I started and did not complete but did not think that was thoughtful for a CV. THE TIMING Disability advocates expressed concern last year that the royal commission could not guarantee anonymity to people who wanted to make confidential submissions to the inquiry. Under current law, the commission can only provide confidentiality while the royal commission is ongoing \u2013 and advocates have argued that this situation has prevented some people from taking part. The Greens senator Jordon Steele-John told Senate estimates on Monday that there had been a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on potential witnesses and that he was extremely concerned the government had not acted on this issue. \u201cI\u2019m particularly concerned as you can imagine because we are now three hearings in to this royal commission process,\u201d Steele-John said. \u201cAnd we have now a schedule for the royal commission out to June.\u201d The chair of the royal commission, Ronald Sackville first raised this issue in a public hearing in November, he said. Officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet confirmed that Sackville this month formally requested the government legislate to address the issue. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told Senate estimates he would take on notice whether the government intended to heed his request. The commission is due to release its interim report by 30 October. Justin Hayhurst, the first assistant secretary of PMC\u2019s international division, has answered a string of questions about the Trump administration\u2019s request for assistance from Australia about the Barr inquiry into the origins of the Mueller inquiry on Russian interference in the US election. Penny Wong wants a note Hayhurst says that he found shortly before 19 December, a read-out of the call between Donald Trump and Scott Morrison. Morrison was the only Australian official on the call, so the note is based on what Morrison told his staff and department. Mathias Cormann explains the government has claimed public interest immunity on the basis releasing the note could harm Australia\u2019s foreign relations, but promises to come back with more specifics. Hayhurst tries to refer most questions to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the basis they are responsible for Australia\u2019s input into the inquiry. Although foreign minister Marise Payne is the decision-maker, Hayhurst reveals Morrison \u201chas been consulted on a decision in relation to the inquiry \u2013 in relation to the release of material\u201d. The committee then goes on break \u2013 bit of a cliffhanger really! That would be the \u2018back in black\u2019 meme The moody black and white smug one. They didn\u2019t want it. They probably have the mugs Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick is asking about the PMC\u2019s handling of FOI requests, after a leaked information commissioner report revealed in 2017-18 only 35% were answered within statutory time limits. Stephanie Foster suggested the poor result was caused by 87 requests lobbing in two days before the Christmas New Year shutdown, causing \u201csome strain\u201d. The OAIC report will be published shortly, but Foster runs through the main recommendations: An all staff statement, to note the pro disclosure emphasis in act. The objects of the act be promoted through FOI training, and in inductions and refreshers. Develop and provide administrative access to information. Within three months, we review and update our FOI processing to address findings. Improve search and retrieval timeliness, by escalating sooner when there is a delay of documents from another section. \u201cAll of those things are in place,\u201d she said, boasting that \u201ca range of documentary and behavioural changes\u201d have occurred since 2017-18. Since the \u201cvery bad time\u201d when the department was not meeting its obligations, there have been \u201cvery high levels\u201d of meeting timelines. This calendar year, the department claims it is 100% compliant, with no overdue requests. Last financial year, 90.2% of requests were met in time, which Foster describes as \u201chuge progress in two years\u201d. Back in environment estimates, the Department of Awe (agriculture, water and the environment) has clarified an earlier statement that a staff member had been seconded to the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA). We posted about this earlier. Dean Knudson, deputy secretary leading the environment protection group, this morning described the arrangement as a secondment after being questioned by Greens Senator Larissa Waters. Knudson said he had since received information that it was not a secondment \u2013 the person in question had taken leave without pay from the department. This is also how the Minerals Council has described the arrangement. Knudson said: \u201cThey have sought outside employment with the MCA. Part of the conditions of that are that the individual will have no access to departmental systems and (be) bound by confidentiality. \u201cTheir pay and conditions (are) up to the MCA. The role that individual takes is up to their discussions with the MCA. But we do understand that the work includes the MCA submission on the EPBC (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act) review.\u201d Waters earlier said it was perverse that a staff member from the department could be writing submissions on revising environment laws on behalf of the lobby group for \u201cbig coal, big gas and big oil\u201d. So Scott Morrison\u2019s department didn\u2019t learn about Scott Morrison\u2019s Hawaiian holiday until the Australian Federal Police contacted them about planning. That was on November 11. Acting arrangements were decided on December 9, just a few days before the trip began on December 15. He was due to return on December 23. That confirms what was reported at the time \u2013 that Morrison only returned to the bushfire crisis one day earlier than planned. Question time ends. Three minutes of Michael McCormack was still too much Michael McCormack though. Madeleine King to Josh Frydenberg: Can he confirm that since he became treasurer economic growth has almost halved, wages growth has stalled further, business investment and productivity have declined, underemployment has increased and household debt and net debt have reached record highs and all this happened before the bushfires and coronavirus. Frydenberg: I can confirm that ... this year the Australian economy is going to grow according to the IMF faster that continue United States, Japan, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany. I can confirm that under this government the minimum wage has gone up every year. The real minimum wage has gone up every year whereas under those opposite it did not. I can confirm that under this government we have passed through the parliament more than $300bn worth of tax cuts. Including ensuring that those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 pay a marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. I can confirm that for the first time in 11 years under this government the budget is back in balance. I can confirm for the first time in more than 30 years that welfare dependency is down to a record low and I can confirm to this House that the current account is in surplus for the first time in more than 40 years. But I had a bit of spare time on the weekend and I got to read \u2013 I got to read an excerpt from Samantha Maiden\u2019s new book. I got to read an excerpt from Samantha Maiden\u2019s new book. Tony Burke is up in a flash to ask about relevance. Tony Smith tells Frydenberg to stay on the question. Frydenberg: The key point is that to strengthen the economy, to deliver higher wages, to deliver more growth, to deliver more jobs, to deliver more debt you need to lower taxes and those opposite took to the last election $387bn in higher taxes that the member for Rankin and the member forMcMahon cooked up and on the weekend there was some very clear evidence that Labor elders like Bill Kelty didn\u2019t think much of it. We\u2019re none the wiser about what a cryptic handwritten note that has emerged during the Angus Taylor grasslands affair actually means. To recap: energy minister, Angus Taylor asked for at least one meeting with departmental officials in 2017 about the protection of native grasslands, known as a listing, at the time a company part-owned by Taylor was under investigation for illegally clearing grasslands. Illegal land-clearing carries a maximum penalty of over $1m. But there were no notes taken at that meeting by any of the bureaucrats present. A handwritten record of a conversation between senior departmental officer and someone in the minister\u2019s office, written a few weeks later is intriguing. \u201cHeads up. Minister keen to see Angus Taylor\u2019s requests accommodated.\u201d So what did Taylor ask for? The question was asked multiple times. According to Dean Knudson the deputy secretary, that question has been answered in the past. The note related to the concerns raised by farmers about the communications surrounding the grasslands listing, he said. Another put it this way: \u201cThere was an interest from Minister Frydenberg [then environment minister] to put better information into the farming community about the grasslands listing. The minister\u2019s staffer also asked for information regarding what would be needed to change the thresholds [that determined whether the grasslands were protected or not]. But they insisted this was not what Taylor was asking for. Thirty months on, the Jamland case is still \u201cbeing actively managed\u201d and the department is \u201cclose to closing it\u201d but because it is still an active case, the department cannot comment on it. Nor can we FOI the case file while it\u2019s an ongoing matter. We\u2019ve tried. \u201cThere is no pressure from the government in relation to this case at all,\u201d said Knudson. Christian Porter looks stressed enough about Covid-19 in this dixer to maybe consider eating a carb. That\u2019s pretty serious guys. Clare O\u2019Neil to Josh Frydenberg: Can the treasurer confirm that recent data showed that in the December quarter construction work fell by 3 per cent and capital expenditure fell by 2.8 per cent. Can he also confirm that this was before the outbreak of coronavirus? Frydenberg can not confirm those things, as he just ignores them, but he can confirm that everything is fine. (Insert this is fine gif here.) This is fine (not actually fine) I am offended that neo-Nazis think its fine to meet in suburban garages and practice their hate, but sure. Go off, Connie. The Australian security intelligence organisation (Asio) chief Mike Burgess is up before the legal and constitutional affairs estimates, speaking about rightwing extremism. Burgess delivered a speech last week identifying right wing extremism as a growing security threat. Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells is offended by Burgess\u2019 use of the term \u201crightwing\u201d. \u201cI am concerned about this and concerned about the use of terminology of \u2018right\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2019Right\u2019 is associated with conservatism in this country and there are many people of conservative background who take exception with being charred [sic] with the same brush.\u201d \u201cI think that you do understand that your comments, particularly when you refer to them solely as \u2018rightwing\u2019, has the potential to offend a lot of Australians.\u201d She tries to describe rightwing extremists as being actually of the left. Burgess says his intention was not to offend any \u201cinnocent people\u201d in his remarks. Earlier, Labor senator Kristina Keneally asked Burgess whether Asio has any plans to set up a dedicated centre to investigate and disrupt rightwing terror, similar to those that exist in nations like Germany. Burgess says: \u201cI and ASIO have no plans to set up a form of dedicated centre. My organisation focuses on the threats we are able to identify and need to investigate, and that drives where our resources go. As I said the other night, this one is a growing concern for us but it ... is not currently my principal concern.\u201d Burgess is also asked why no rightwing extremists have been listed as designated terror groups, and whether they are sophisticated enough to know how to avoid such a listing. \u201cSenator obviously we constantly review prescription of certain groups. Obviously when we do that we are mindful of the intelligence that we have, the legal threshold for which we can do so, and the purpose that would allow us to achieve by listing such organisations. whilst its constant review I can\u2019t go into detail of those particular matters.\u201d He says he does not believe the groups are sophisticated enough to know how to avoid prescription. So there you have it. The declaration that the budget was back in the black, when it wasn\u2019t, was based on predictions that were credible, as opposed to Labor\u2019s predictions which weren\u2019t credible. I predict the back-peddling come May will make Markus St\u00f6ckl look slow, but again, that\u2019s just a prediction. I\u2019ll let you know if it was credible or not. Anthony Albanese asks Scott Morrison if he stands by \u201chis 2019 statement that he, and I quote, \u2018Brought the budget back to surplus next year\u2019.\u201d Morrison starts with an attack on \u201cObi-Swan\u201d and his \u201cpadawan\u201d Jim Chalmers. Is that a Star War? He\u2019s pulled into line on relevance: Mr Speaker the point I was making is that the budget that was handed down by the Treasurer for 2019-20 was based on the assumptions of the economy at that time. And the assumptions of the economy at that time, which were very credible assumptions, as opposed to the assumptions that were made by the previous Labor party when they were in government and forecast surpluses were based on pure fantasy. Our surpluses, the surpluses that we forecast at the last budget, were based on the outlook that was a very credible and a very sensible outlook at that time. Now, Mr Speaker, the challenges we now face that have emerged in literally just the last few weeks, will definitely have a significant impact and they are being evaluated by Treasury as we move towards the next budget but this is what the Australian people will know. That the actions of our government will always put jobs first, will always put those businesses first, will always put that investment first and the reasons we worked so hard to bring the budget to a balance, which we achieved last year, Mr Speaker, the balance we achieved last year means we can now confront the challenges of bushfires, of coronavirus, of floods and of drought. That\u2019s why the Australian people trusted us at the last election. Those opposite thought the best antidote to what the country was going to face was higher taxes and higher spending. That was rejected by the Australian people at the last election. This leader of the Labor party still clings to those policies and that\u2019s why the Australian public don\u2019t trust him with the economy any more than the last bloke. Terri Butler gets kicked out and Peter Dutton pipes up with \u201cthank goodness for that. Much more pleasant\u201d. Joanne Ryan to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Today the prime minister\u2019s own department told the Senate that Mr Gaetjens wasn\u2019t aware of the 136 emails and 28 colour-coded spreadsheets that passed between his office and the office of Senator McKenzie and further didn\u2019t interview anyone in the prime minister\u2019s office. Isn\u2019t his defence of the corrupt sports rorts scheme based on an ill-informed sham report by his former chief of staff? Morrison: No. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the whole answer. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: My question is to the treasurer and I refer to his earlier answer about Alinta energy. Can the treasurer explain why he\u2019s protecting the privacy of his company but not protecting the privacy of over 1 million Australians? Frydenberg: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and again I can read from the Treasury statement which says, \u2018We can confirm that Alinta energy is engaging instructively with the Foreign Investment Review Board ... Activities will be completed by December 2020. Whilst the Foreign Investment Review Board is engaging with Alinta it would not be appropriate to comment further.\u2019 Mr Speaker, those opposite will know that the head of the Foreign Investment Review Board is David Irvine, the former head of Asio, former ambassador to China and a distinguished Australian and public servant. Australians trust him to get these measures right. The walking book of country homilies gets summoned to the despatch box and a little light goes out of every member\u2019s eyes. Today\u2019s homespun bullshit includes this line: As I travel throughout the country I see a resilience in our people unmatched anywhere in the world. Look. Regional and rural Australians have had it very tough. But they haven\u2019t faced ongoing war. Or ebola. Or crippling and systemic poverty. They haven\u2019t been colonised. They haven\u2019t been abused or in some cases killed, for who they are, or the religion they practice. If you see a resilience in Australian people \u201cunmatched\u201d anywhere in the world, then you haven\u2019t actually opened your eyes to what is happening in the world. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: When did the prime minister first become aware the foreign investment conditions he imposed on Alinta energy as treasurer which were meant to protect the privacy of over 1 million Australians were not being enforced? Josh Frydenberg gets the call up. After some back and forth about relevance, he gets to this: In relation to the specific issue and the specific matter that was raised by the member opposite, this is what the Treasury statement said: \u2018It is not the practice of treasurer to comment on matters which may involve a foreign investor applicant or compliance matters. This is due to protected information, privacy provisions contained in the foreign acquisition and Takeovers Act and which recognise that information provided to Treasury can be commercially sensitive.\u2019 I think that makes it very clear. Josh Frydenberg, using his \u201cshiz is serious\u201d voice, once again outlines the government\u2019s plans for an economic stimulus in response to the Covid-19 impact. He actually looks quite exhausted. Facing a recession on your watch as treasurer will probably do that to a person. Frydenberg: Clearly the trade tensions between the United States and China had an impact on the global economy including here in Australia. The ongoing drought, Mr Speaker, and, of course, the flood and the fires and now the coronavirus. Now, the spread of the coronavirus is clearly \u2013 it\u2019s still evolving but the economic impact of the coronavirus will be much more significant than both Sars and Mers before it. And we know that because China is a bigger part of the global economy since that time. In fact, the Chinese economy is four times the size it was at the time of Sars, Mr Speaker. In terms of Australia\u2019s economic relationship with China, it\u2019s a lot greater than \u2013 greater today than it was at the time of Sars. Our two-way trade with China is worth more than $200bn a year and indeed about a third of our exports go to China. China is the number one source of international students to Australia. And that market is worth more than $12bn a year. In terms of tourism, China is the number one source of international tourists to this country and that market is worth more than a billion dollars a year. Now, at the same time, we are seeing as a result of the spread of the coronavirus disruption to international supply chains and disruption to international students and tourists coming to this country. But our response, our fiscal response, will be responsible. It will be considered and it will be targeted. There won\u2019t be the reckless and wasteless that we\u2019ve seen from those opposite when it comes to economic shocks. What we will see is we\u2019ll see responsible, considered and a targeted response focusing on ensuring that businesses and those affected as stronger when they come out. And we continue to see strong employment growth across the Australian economy. David Littleproud, in response to a question from Mike Kelly, admits there are some problems with the administration of the relief payments for businesses in response to the bushfires \u2013 but he blames the states: We\u2019ll work with them to make sure they can streamline the process in administering that is their role, that is their responsibility. But the federal government will not turn their back an any state or territory, we\u2019ll help them to do this better because it needs to be done better. No one is walking away from that. We work hand in hand with every level of government in making sure we support farmers, small business and particularly those Australians that have lost it all. We have gone almost halfway through question time without Michael McCormack I thought the hour seemed lighter. Josh Frydenberg takes a dixer, confirming a stimulus is coming in response to coronavirus. Notably, he gets through the whole dixer without an attack on the wellbeing budget. That\u2019s how bad shiz is. Frydenberg: Mr Speaker, the spread of the coronavirus is a global health crisis with a significant economic impact on major economies around the world. Here in Australia we are seeing disruption to supply chains. We are seeing disruption to our tourism markets and we are seeing obviously disruption to international students not being able to get to Australia to start their course. We\u2019ve also seen significant volatility in credit and equity marks both here and globally, and we\u2019ve seen the International Monetary Fund downgrade their forecasts for global growth. But Australia will meet these challenges posed by the spread of the coronavirus because we have prepared economically we approach the challenge ahead of us from a position of economic strength. ... Now, our fiscal response will be considered, it will be responsible and it will be targeted. In stark contrast to the reckless spending that we have seen from those opposite. Mr Speaker, the Australian people can trust us to manage the economy to steer it through this very challenging period. (That \u201creckless spending\u201d was the $900 or so each eligible Australian received from the government during the GFC. Australia avoided going into recession. But there is no quarter being given here.) Susan Templeton to Scott Morrison: Why has the prime minister broken his promise of immediate support for bushfire-affected communities given that fewer than 20% of applications for small business grants and fewer than 5% of applications for small business loans have been approved? Morrison: Over $167m has been paid to families and individuals in direct support in response to the bushfire crisis, $145m paid to more than 121,000 eligible individual disaster recovery payment and disaster announce and $27.1m has been made for impacted children as at 1 March. $7.1m has been paid to volunteer firefighters. $47m has been paid in primary producer grants and there\u2019s some 767 grants that have been approved. ... I am also concerned about the progress of the small business grants and some just over three weeks ago I invited the leader of the opposition to submit any proposals that he had to see to how he thought that system should be changed. I haven\u2019t received any. ... I would welcome any proposals. What I have done is just over a week ago I had the opportunity to talk to the state member for Bega and the state member for Bega has raised I think some important suggestions that can increase the access to the small business grants. Those issues were raised also with the minister responsible for emergency management and the head of the national bushfire recovery agency Andrew Colvin. I met with Andrew Colvin last week and the minister and we are currently in the process of looking to rephrase and to revise how those grants are being constructed. We will be doing that to ensure that we\u2019re backing those businesses in that can see where they have a future where they, not just over the next three months but over the next 12 months. That\u2019s what we\u2019re applying to do. The New South Wales is working to deliver those arrangements. They have heightened those issues because they\u2019re the ones who are processing those applications and I look forward to us being able to deliver a better program and when the leader of the opposition would like to submit his proposals as I invited him I\u2019d be happy to receive it. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I ask can he confirm that he is the only permanent member of the cabinet office policy committee? Morrison: I refer the member to my earlier answer. Cabinet committee have various memberships. What matters is who attends those meetings and on the matters which have been recently before the government committees those meetings were attended by myself... Tony Burke jumps up on relevance. Tony Smith allows Morrison to continue, given the \u201cimputations\u201d in the previous question. Morrison: The cabinet office policy committees meet together on a regular basis to focus on key challenges and issues facing the Australian people. And as the conveyor of that committee, I bring in to that cabinet office policy committee, members of the cabinet, of the executive and members of the government, Mr Speaker. The policy committee has been dealing with issues like getting electricity prices down, dealing with the issues of how we manage plastics waste, ensuring how we can get focused on the energy needs of Australia into the future, how with can focus on meeting the damage and challenges of the drought. These cabinet office policy committees have been crucial mechanisms used for the government to come together, to pull together the experience and the learnings and the wisdom of those who sit on the government benches to focus on the issues that are most important to the Australian people. And what the Australian people are getting a lesson from, from the opposition at the moment, is they are more interested in the trivial politics of Canberra than the serious issues that are confronting the Australian people. And the first question is on the cabinet of one: Anthony Albanese: Today the minister representing the prime minister told the Senate that the cabinet office policy committee is made up of just one permanent member, the prime minister. Can the prime minister advise in relation to this one-man cabinet committee do the committee\u2019s discussions take long? Is there a lot of disagreement in this committee and are the meeting of this committee held in the prime minister\u2019s head? Isn\u2019t this just an abuse of the cabinet designed to hide government documents? Scott Morrison: I can confirm that the governance committee of cabinet regularly has attending its meetings myself, the attorney gGeneral, the deputy prime minister and the treasurer, Mr Speaker. Labor\u2019s Penny Wong has asked about the cabinet office policy committee which appears to have only one member: Scott Morrison. This is the committee responsible for Morrison\u2019s policy deep-dives. Mathias Cormann confirms Morrison is the only \u201cpermanent\u201d member but others attend meetings. Officials confirm this includes at times other cabinet members, public servants and stakeholders (ie not everyone is a cabinet member). Stephanie Foster and Cormann suggest the committee informs directions that inform further work, but decisions are taken by the expenditure review committee or cabinet itself. Cormann argues this is \u201cgood process\u201d to get the \u201cbroadest possible input\u201d to government decision-making. Cormann accuses Wong of \u201cconfected outrage\u201d. \u201cNothing about anything you\u2019ve raised is concerning,\u201d he said. Wong suggests this is a cabinet committee of one that gets the benefit of cabinet confidentiality, even if no other cabinet members are present and non-parliamentarians are. Wong labels this an \u201cabuse of cabinet in confidence\u201d. She said: \u201cYou use these conventions to cover up blatant political decision-making ... [it\u2019s] Yet another Morrison government cover-up.\u201d Prime Minister and Cabinet has confirmed there has been no inquiry or referral of energy and environment minister, Angus Taylor to the ministerial conduct committee. Greens senator Larissa Waters asked whether the grasslands affair, which involves Taylor\u2019s request for departmental briefings on the listing of native grasslands as endangered, had been referred. Guardian Australia has reported extensively on the affair, which involved a special briefing for Taylor at a time when a company associated with his family, Jamland was under investigation for clearing native grasslands. No notes were taken. \u201cThat\u2019s because there were no facts that warrant such a course of action,\u201d Matthias Cormann, representing the prime minister said. Parliament has now passed legislation that may dramatically reduce the number of Centrelink recipients accused of owing a future welfare debt. In a move that appears long overdue, the aim of the legislation is to reduce welfare overpayments by helping people to correctly report their work income. From 1 July, about 1.2 million welfare recipients will now be able to report their fortnightly employment income to Services Australia using the details on their payslips. Previously they were forced to estimate the income they would receive in advance \u2013 which, aside from the other issues around robodebt, lead to many people being issued debts. We explained the changes here. \u201cBy taking the guesswork out of reporting the government will have much more accurate information to process payments, reducing the chances of under- and over-payment,\u201d said the social services minister, Anne Ruston. Social service groups, Labor and the Greens backed the changes, but pointed to the botched robodebt scheme as evidence that policy would need to be carefully implemented. It\u2019s Anthony Albanese\u2019s birthday. Question time starts with birthday wishes for the opposition leader. Question time is about to begin. What a time to be alive. Larissa Waters has asked the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet officials to confirm Scott Morrison has not asked for an investigation about possible breaches of ministerial standards regarding the Angus Taylor grassland controversy and various grants programs including the urban congestion fund and female facilities and water safety stream. No, there have been no investigations \u2013 beyond the one reported into Bridget McKenzie\u2019s handling of community sport infrastructure grants. In relation to Taylor, Mathias Cormann explains that is because \u201cthere is nothing at all in the public domain that would warrant that course of action\u201d. Waters is then forced to withdraw a remark about Taylor so the hearing can continue. Greg Hunt on Australia\u2019s response to Covid-19: What we announced on Friday is that as part of the work of Coag, we\u2019re constantly reviewing primary care, aged care, hospitals and the medical stockpile. We\u2019re continuing to do that. I met this morning with the head of the TGA, Professor John Skerritt, who is reviewing all of the medicines requirements in Australia. It was actually very comforting. He has a team within the TGA that is looking at medicines and all medical equipment in Australia. They already have that role, but they have stepped that up, and what he was finding in terms of medicines was stronger than I had hoped, which was very good. And in terms of personal protective equipment, we have a national stockpile which has 20 million, but we\u2019re always looking to add to those 20 million masks and other items. Mathias Cormann has come back into the estimates hearing with new information from former sports minister Bridget McKenzie, who advised him that the brief approving the third round of sports grants \u201cwas signed by her on the 4th of April \u2013 no ifs, no buts\u201d. This is to refute suggestions from Labor that McKenzie can\u2019t have signed the round 3 brief on 4 April, because she sent the proposed list to Scott Morrison on 10 April and Sports Australia on 11 April. PMC official Stephanie Foster told the committee the brief was not equivocal, it was a \u201cdecision brief\u201d with a list of projects. You might remember last week the federation chamber was shut down by the government in a bid to stop Labor shutting down members from speaking. That is in response to the government not allowing debate on issues such as sports rorts and Angus Taylor. Tony Burke spoke about this in the parliament a short time ago: On indulgence \u2014 this is not the first time that you\u2019ve given a report of that nature. I think it\u2019s important to advise the House that the fact that the conduct continued was not a rejection of the reports that you\u2019ve given. There is a very specific context that has led to those motions being moved in the Federation Chamber, and it goes to what happens in this chamber. It has become the practice in a way that it never used to be \u2014 in particular, the leader of the opposition, when moving suspension motions, is not allowed to deliver a speech anymore. That the member be no further heard is moved immediately. Certainly when I first arrived \u2014 and as I saw under the Howard government, the Rudd and Gillard governments, the Turnbull government and the Abbott government \u2014 the question is whether or not leave is granted. If leave is not granted, then ordinarily the suspension debate takes place. If it is felt that the opposition have moved it out of the blue or that they\u2019ve been moving them too often, occasionally that the member be no longer heard would be moved. Instead now it\u2019s just become how this place operates. In those circumstances, the opposition has no way of pushing back other than to move resolutions of that form. I don\u2019t want to delay the House any further but, given the seriousness of the report \u2014 and it\u2019s not the first time that you as the Speaker have reported that\u2014 it should be made absolutely clear that if the House returns to its ordinary procedures and way of operating, then we will not see that again in the Federation Chamber. But if we continue, this term, to have a situation which has no parallel in this chamber, then the sorts of reports that have been given just now by the Speaker will refer to events that will occur again. A Liberal party donor that received $5.5 million under the $220m regional jobs and investment packages program has only created 18 jobs as a result of the grant, despite the department being told that it would create 200 positions. Last week, bureaucrats revealed that they had not been present when a ministerial panel decided to award donor Nolan Meats the grant, even though it was ineligible under the department\u2019s guidelines because it was a registered training organisation. Nolan meats made a $3000 donation to the Queensland LNP during the assessment process, and despite its project being ranked 48 out of 62 in the Wide Bay Burnett region, successfully secured funding. Labor senator Tony Sheldon questioned bureaucrats from the department about the jobs claim, saying there were serious questions to answer about the decision.\u201cWe find that the department is still in a situation where there was an expectation of 200 jobs that still haven\u2019t materialised,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cThis is an extremely serious matter. In the two years since the grant was awarded only $1.1 m was provided to Nolan Meats creating just 18 full time jobs.\u201d He asked minister Anne Ruston if she believed that $61,000 per job was good value for taxpayers. The minister said she would get more detail about the project. Rachel Bacon from the department said that the Nolan project was still under way.\u201dThat $1.1m payment was against the first contracted milestone ... and the project still has further to run,\u201d she said. She said the projects still had until the end of the year to deliver the jobs claimed. \u201cWe will obviously look at that in the context of evaluations when the project is completed.\u201d After repeated questioning about the jobs claim, Ruston said \u201cthe project still has some time to run.\u201d On the conflict of interest of ministerial panel member John McVeigh, whose brother had a contract with Nolan Meats, Ruston told the hearing that \u201cthe minister recused himself on the grounds that he believed he had a conflict of interest, which was the appropriate thing to do.\u201d Bacon said that the project was reassessed after the relevant minister at the time - Fiona Nash \u2013 expressed a \u201cstrong preference\u201d in having the project declared eligible because its training functions were \u201cincidental\u201d to the project. \u201cThere was an interest in this project, so we took it upon ourselves to commission the merit assessment ... to better advise the minister,\u201d Bacon said. When asked if the department had ever advised the minister\u2019s office to fund the project, department secretary Simon Atkinson said he would not make advice public as it wanted to be consulted for future decisions. The number of times this happens, over issues which have been in the media for months, is ridiculous. The Prime Minister and Cabinet estimates breaks for an hour. Still with PMC, in finance estimates, the Green senator Janet Rice wants to know whether the secretary of the department, Phil Gaetjens, declared any conflicts of interest before doing his report into possible breaches of ministerial standards with sports grants. PMC official Stephanie Foster replies: \u201cNo, he did not. Did not\u201d. Rice persists. The secretary declared no conflict before he investigated, despite the fact Gaetjens was formerly Scott Morrison\u2019s chief of staff?, Rice wonders. Finance minister Mathias Cormann objects to the question. He notes that about half the current heads of commonwealth departments have spent time as staffers in ministerial offices, some Labor, some Liberal. On the matter of whether or not the Morrison government is over-reacting, Peter Dutton tells Neil Mitchell: No, I don\u2019t think we are. I think when we look at all of the international advice and we look at the advice that we\u2019re getting from doctors here, I think our response has been prudent. I think it\u2019s been measured. I think it\u2019s been based on all of the facts that are available to us. We\u2019re starting with the number one priority of keeping Australians safe and I think if you start with that as your priority \u2013 there is going to be a lot of hurt within small businesses, within the business community, and the economy otherwise; the prime minister has already indicated that the government\u2019s considering ways in which we can support those industries or across the economy as well; so there are different phases of our response \u2013 but again, I think we\u2019re as well-placed in the world as anybody. Peter Dutton has all but ruled out Australia \u201cclosing its borders\u201d in response to Covid-19 (coronavirus). A pandemic declaration basically means \u2013 it\u2019s out there, you can\u2019t stop it, so there is no point in closing the borders. Plus, it is here already. Dutton was asked on Melbourne radio 3AW about border protection in the face of a virus and said: I think it\u2019s very unlikely that we close borders, Neil, but in the end, as I say, we rely on the best medical advice in the world and that has been available to us so far. We\u2019ve made the right judgements. We\u2019ve made, I think, the right calls and we\u2019ll continue to do that, but we\u2019ve done it based on the medical advice. There is a very, very high level of preparedness. We have one of the strongest border protection systems in the world. We\u2019re an island nation. We have the ability to deal with these threats and these pandemics and for a long time the agencies right across the federal government, but the state governments as well have been planning about they respond to such an incident. Over in environment estimates, the committee has heard that a department staff member has been seconded to work for the Minerals Council, and the department is \u201cpursuing\u201d a similar secondment with environment group WWF. Larissa Waters, the Greens Senate leader, has issued a statement describing the arrangement with the Minerals Council as \u201chighly improper\u201d. She says it \u201chands the playbook on environment protection\u201d to a mining lobby group that is pushing for conservation laws to be weakened. There is some dispute about the nature of the arrangement with the Minerals Council. Dean Knudsen, deputy secretary of the environment protection group, described it as a secondment, following questioning by Waters. The Minerals Council says this is incorrect \u2013 that the employee was hired on a fixed-term contract after taking leave without pay from their government role. Guardian Australia has established that discussions with WWF about its potential secondment began after it became aware of the Minerals Council appointment. Both the Minerals Council job and potential WWF appointment involve helping the organisations respond to a review of national environment laws, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, being run by businessman Graeme Samuel. In a statement, Waters says: It\u2019s perverse that someone from our environmental regulator could be writing submissions on revising environment laws for big coal, big gas and big oil who already undermine our democracy with their massive donations. The special arrangement for the Minerals Council risks disadvantaging the best interests of protecting our water, our environment and communities. \u2018Nothing to see here\u2019 seems to be the running theme ahead of estimates. And then the departmental officials are questioned. Phil Gaetjens will be appearing in front of the Senate inquiry into the administration of the sports grants on March 16. Stay tuned for that one. Estimates, as seen by Mike Bowers: Mathias Cormann later accused Janet Rice of wanting to \u201cget on the evening news\u201d with Penny Wong: Executives from the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development say they cannot recall if they liaised with then minister Bridget McKenzie about a controversial $150m sports fund that was announced in the 2019-20 budget. Under questioning from Labor senator Murray Watt, senior bureaucrats from the department refused to reveal whether they were involved in policy work for the $150m female facilities and water safety stream program. Dr Rachel Bacon, from the department, said she would need to check her records as she could not recall whether discussions were had between the department and the minister\u2019s office in the lead-up to the budget. \u201cI can\u2019t recall, I would have to check,\u201d Bacon said. \u201cWe do need to go back and look at the records from last year ... I can\u2019t recall the form that these records took.\u201d Social services minister Anne Ruston said it would be \u201cunusual\u201d had this not occurred. But department secretary Simon Atkinson said that if the discussions had informed the budget decision, then this information may not be released, because \u201cit could potentially reveal the deliberations that took place in the cabinet.\u201d The FFWSS fund was announced by the Coalition less than two months before the election and was all allocated during the election campaign, despite the government indicating that details about the program would be made later in 2019. Bacon said that she was expecting the department would provide advice to government on the guidelines for the program after the budget. However, administration for the program was transferred to the Department of Health on 21 August, before these guidelines were developed. Everything is totally normal and fine: Alice Workman had a tidbit in Strewth last week that the AFP categorised the alleged hacking of Greg Hunt\u2019s Twitter account (after it \u201cliked\u201d a porn tweet) as more important than the document saga: The CCPM lists the Taylor \u2018fraud\u2019 investigation as an \u2018essential\u2019 priority \u2014 the same classification (and the second highest) given to the 2018 inquiry into the porn tweet \u2018liked\u2019 by Hunt\u2019s official Twitter account. (Spoiler: Hunt cried hack but the AFP concluded no offence was made.) The Hunt probe was rated as a \u2018very high\u2019 impact investigation with a \u2018high\u2019 value to the AFP and \u2018critical\u2019 to the client. Taylor\u2019s was just a \u2018high\u2019 impact inquest of a \u2018medium\u2019 value that was \u2018significant\u2019 only to the client. A whopping $0 in the budget was assigned to the six-week scrutiny, along with a team of two to five officers. AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw admitted last week he was \u2018not aware the minister was interviewed, or even offered an interview\u2019 before police dropped its investigation. Asked if there is any chance Phil Gaetjens would re-open his inquiry, given some of the extra information that the Senate inquiry into the sports grant affair has revealed, Stephanie Foster says she doesn\u2019t know. Mathias Cormann says he sees no reason to re-open an inquiry based on Labor\u2019s political motivations: If Scott Morrison found the cure for cancer, you would accuse him of putting doctors out of work,\u201d he tells Wong. In finance estimates, picking up from my last post, Penny Wong wants to know whether it is a criminal offence for a minister to backdate a brief. Stephanie Foster from PMC says: I genuinely don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll seek advice. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, wants that question binned on the basis that officials shouldn\u2019t be asked to give legal advice. The Liberal senator James Paterson, chairing the hearing, allows the question to stand on notice. A bunch of questions from Wong now about the inquiry by Phil Gaetjens, the secretary of PMC, into the ANAO report on the sports grants, and possible breaches of ministerial standards. If you\u2019ve been following the sports grants controversy, you\u2019ll remember the Gaetjens report. Morrison sought this report as part of considering whether Bridget McKenzie should remain on the frontbench. The evidence is Gaetjens spoke to McKenzie as part of his inquiry. Foster says she spoke to the CEO of Sports Australia. Nobody in the prime minister\u2019s office was interviewed as part of the Gaetjens process. Foster tells the hearing no one was interviewed in the PMO because \u201cthe secretary was not tasked with reviewing the administration of the grants program\u201d. He was looking at breaches of ministerial standards. Just for the record, the Gaetjens report has not been released. The prime minister read out sections of the secretary\u2019s findings at a press conference on the day McKenzie departed the frontbench. Wong wants all the documents. Transcripts, emails, all the things. Foster signals this is cabinet-related material. \u201cWe will not be releasing cabinet documents,\u201d Cormann tells Wong. Wong is back to cover-ups. \u201c136 emails is not providing information, it is running the program,\u201d says Penny Wong to Mathias Cormann. Cormann responds that in the Morrison government they \u201ctalk to each other\u201d and that maybe Wong\u2019s government should have talked to each other more. Wong responds that Labor has been out of government for a long time, so Cormann responds with something like \u201cmaybe if more people had spoken to Bill Shorten\u201d. Wong: You can always tell when we are getting close to something Mathias, because all you do is talk about us. PM&amp;C departmental deputy secretary Stephanie Foster just told Penny Wong she was \u201cunable to assist\u201d with an inquiry (related to the colour coded electorate grants) and that causes Wong to put down her pen, pause, cross her arms and lean back. She is now in an argument with Mathias Cormann, where she is referring to him as \u201cMathias\u201d. It turns out that no one from the prime minister\u2019s office was interviewed for the report that Phil Gaetjens (PM&amp;C departmental head) prepared on the sports grant affair. Murph will have more for you on that exchange very soon. Still with PMC in the finance committee, Penny Wong is now on to the date of the brief that was sent to Scott Morrison on 10 April, outlining the sports grants Bridget McKenzie intended to approve. The brief was dated 4 April. Wong wants to know whether the brief was backdated. (Background: Curiously, the brief was not sent to Sports Australia until the morning the federal election was called, which was some days after 4 April. I think it was 11 April, from memory). The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, says in response to the question about backdating: To my knowledge, absolutely not. Wong asks why the brief was sent to Morrison on the 10th if Mckenzie was the decision-maker. Cormann said the brief would have been sent for announcement purposes and \u201cassociated logistics\u201d. Wong wants the brief. She wants to see it. Stephanie Foster from PMC takes that question on notice. Wong asks Foster whether has she seen it. She wants to know if the language in the brief suggests a decision has already been made or whether any final decision is pending Morrison\u2019s approval. Foster isn\u2019t entirely sure, but she thinks the language in the brief suggests a decision \u201chas been made, I believe senator\u201d. Penny Wong\u2019s systematic dismantling of the PM&amp;C officials and Mathias Cormann over the sports grant affair brings to mind this piece of advice from Sun Tzu: \u201cThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\u201d The senator did not come to play today. Cormann doesn\u2019t seem to have his same fighting spirit. But the slight air of ennui which cloaked Wong at her last estimates appearance is gone. The senator has her eye on her mission. The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has shot down any prospect of re-opening the Angus Taylor investigation. \u201cThe matter is finalised. Full stop,\u201d Kershaw said. The issue has dominated this morning\u2019s Senate estimates hearing. Earlier, Greens senator Nick McKim became frustrated at the lack of investigative action and suggested the AFP was running a \u201cprotection racket\u201d for Taylor. McKim had been pressing Kershaw on why the AFP didn\u2019t interview Taylor, despite Taylor having clearly signed a document containing false information. \u201cThis is Alice in Wonderland stuff,\u201d McKim said. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think there\u2019s a protection racket being run here on Mr Taylor\u2019s behalf here.\u201d The comment provoked an angry response from Liberal senators. Marise Payne, the foreign minister, says: \u201cIf you\u2019re impugning the Australian Federal Police, I would suggest you think very carefully about that.\u201d McKim responds: \u201cWell, I have thought very carefully about it and I stand by my comment.\u201d Sarah Henderson, the Victorian Liberal senator, described McKim\u2019s suggestion as outrageous and \u201cappalling\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s an outrageous statement to suggest that the AFP is in any respect running a protection racket ... I would ask that Senator McKim withdraw,\u201d Henderson said. Over in legal affairs estimates, things are going JUST GREAT for the AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw: Kristina Keneally: Commissioner, do you know who downloaded the document Minister Taylor relied on to cite the incorrect costs in the City of Sydney\u2019s annual report? Kershaw I personally don\u2019t know, no. KK: Did the AFP reach a conclusion? Kershaw: Again, I think we\u2019ve been very clear on our process, on the letter, the decision that\u2019s been made, um, you know, I just go again that going down these lines we could probably be here all day, asking all these questions, and you\u2019re going to get probably the same answer from me, which is \u2018I\u2019ll have to take that on notice\u2019. KK: Do you know if the document was doctored or altered? Kershaw : Again, I\u2019ll have to take that on notice. KK: Do you know who altered or doctored the document? Kershaw: : I\u2019ll take that on notice. PMC is now fronting the finance committee. Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, has kicked off the hearing with full force. Wong is chasing details of correspondence between the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie and Scott Morrison about sports grants on April 10, 2019. She wants officials to tell her precisely what material was logged on the departmental document management system. They tell her they aren\u2019t prepared to answer the specific questions Wong wants answered. Wong dials it up immediately. \u201cWell, Ms Foster, I want [that information].\u201d Stephanie Foster from PMC says: \u201cWe will see what records exist.\u201d Wong: \u201cI want them today Ms Foster.\u201d Wong dials it up again, blasting the process as \u201ccorrupt\u201d. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, at the table, says Wong is \u201cclose to the line\u201d with this commentary. He wants her to withdraw. Wong withdraws. Another official from PMC appears at the table and indicates PMC does not have records of the email from McKenzie to Morrison on 10 April. Wong congratulates the official for her candour. The economy is going to be the underlying issue for the next few months \u2013 and beyond \u2013 as the government tries to work out what it is going to do about it\u2019s promised \u2013 nay, claimed \u2013 surplus in the face of growing economic instability. The ABC had an interesting piece on what Westpac\u2019s chief economist, Bill Evans, thinks needs to happen: The bottom line is that a country that is running unemployment well above its NAIRU [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment], and is well below its inflation targets, should not have the luxury of a fiscal surplus. It\u2019s clearly saying that the policy settings are inappropriate. I believe that we will start to see the government reviewing that issue over the next few months. And, as you know, we\u2019ve been strongly of the view that they should be bringing forward the tax cuts \u2014 and what we\u2019ve seen of the last month only makes that a stronger argument, not a weaker argument. Those comments were made ahead of the expectation the RBA would be dropping rates this week, as it attempts to navigate the impact of the coronavirus spread. Labor\u2019s Anthony Albanese and Brendan O\u2019Connor have held a press conference with MPs representing bushfire-affected regions to call for a wage subsidy to small businesses, citing the slow processing of claims for federal grants and loans. Under the plan, small businesses would receive a payment equivalent to the rate of Newstart for every full-time employee, essentially helping them with their wage bill to keep more people in work in areas now suffering economic aftershocks. After Cyclone Yasi, Labor extended similar payments for six months (26 weeks). Albanese and O\u2019Connor cited reports that just 20% of businesses who applied for grants have received them, and less than 5% who applied for loans. In the roll-call of MPs: Fiona Phillips says Dive Jervis Bay was not able to hire skippers due to the evacuation and closure Mike Kelly said in Merimbula a survey of 140 businesses found none had yet received federal assistance Susan Templeman said businesses \u201cdidn\u2019t burn down ... but they might as well have\u201d given the downturn Albanese suggests small businesses are \u201cworried that the spotlight is on others\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that coronavirus is now grabbing the headlines and they will be left behind. Albanese calls for bipartisanship, suggesting Labor will work with the government to get this idea up. They\u2019ve been ahead of the curve so far on bushfire assistance \u2013 time will tell if the Coalition copies their homework again. It is all coronavirus and estimates today, but Labor\u2019s Deborah O\u2019Neil is also trying to shine a light on Alinta Energy: In 2017 the then treasurer Scott Morrison signed off the deal for the purchase of Alinta Energy by Chow Tai Fook, a Chinese company. One of the conditions that was put forward to Mr Morrison for tick off by the Foreign Investment Review Board was that privacy of Australians was paramount. I have spoken to a whistleblower who knows what\u2019s going on inside Alinta. This is a company that has failed to comply with the Foreign Investment Review Board conditions of sale and purchase. The man who was ultimately responsible for making sure that compliance occurred in a timely way for Australians was none other than Mr Morrison, our prime minister. When Australians need him to stand up for them he is missing in action. He was missing in action over the summer. He was missing when he was the treasurer and failed to protect Australians\u2019 identities. This is a very serious failing by a treasurer who was more interested in getting the job of prime minister than looking after 1.1 million Australians who use Alinta Energy. Sussan Ley was talking about this during the summer holidays \u2013 and now she is getting it off the ground: Australia\u2019s largest manufacturer of rigid plastic products will invest $500 million into transforming the economy around plastic waste, keeping plastics in Australia for reuse, rather than sending them overseas. I am delighted to announce that Pact Group will partner with government and industry to invest in existing and new facilities for sustainable packaging, reuse and recycling initiatives over the next five years as well as investing further in innovation, technology and research to use more recycled content. As a result, Pact will have 30 per cent recycled content across its product portfolio by 2025 and keep nearly two billion plastic containers out of landfill. Pact\u2019s announcement at the National Plastics Summit today follows announcements from major brands McDonald\u2019s and Nestl\u00e9, with McDonald\u2019s committing to phase out plastic cutlery by the end of 2020, removing 585 tonnes of plastic waste per annum. This adds to McDonald\u2019s previous commitment to phase out 500 million straws every year and takes the total annual plastic reduction to 860 tonnes. Nestl\u00e9 is partnering with waste management company IQ Renew in a trial that will see soft plastics collected from over 100,000 homes, diverting tonnes of soft plastic otherwise headed for landfill. No one tell the IPA though - it also includes a plan to help \u201csupport households in sorting soft plastics which are poorly sorted at present and which have significant recycling potential.\u201d Penny Wong has entered estimates \u2013 she is facing off against the prime minister and cabinet departmental head (and former Scott Morrison and Peter Costello chief of staff) Phil Gaetjens over #sportsrorts. Anthony Albanese and Brendan O\u2019Connor, along with Fiona Philips and Mike Kelly, whose electorates were impacted by the bushfires, are calling for more economic support for small and medium sized businesses, in the recovery period. Anthony Albanese: This is not business as usual. This is not business as usual. And I reject the idea that this is business as usual. ... In terms of the response, this was a national crisis that requires national leadership. We make no apologies for what we did during that crisis and say it required a national response. I think that was correct. We did not try to politicise it and we do not want to politicise it now. What we are saying is that [in] the recovery period, it is important that, [among] the feedback that I have had from businesses is that they are very worried that now that the spotlight is on other issues, their issues will be forgotten. Further to the download revelations, Christopher Knaus says: The AFP is still being asked about the Angus Taylor investigation (or lack thereof). We have already learned police did not interview City of Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore or Taylor before abandoning the investigation. Labor senator Kristina Keneally is now asking what police did to test Taylor\u2019s claim that he downloaded the false document from the City of Sydney\u2019s website in September. Keneally asks whether police examined Google Analytics, showing that the annual report in question was only downloaded 13 times in the four-day window relevant to Taylor\u2019s defence. She asks whether the AFP examined City of Sydney metadata, which shows the reports did not change from the accurate versions since they were first uploaded. Reece Kershaw, the AFP commissioner, is also asked if police interviewed staff at the City of Sydney council, the Daily Telegraph journalists to whom the false figures were leaked, staff at the federal environment department, staff in Taylor\u2019s office, or Josh Manuatu, a former Taylor staffer. Kershaw takes all of Keneally\u2019s questions on notice. Back in finance estimates, we\u2019ve gone from connectivity to coffee. There have been questions to officials about the recent refurbishment of coffee facilities in the building. (Background: On the top floor of the parliament (in the press gallery, actually) there used to be a coffee cart. That\u2019s gone now, and there has been a substantial refurbishment to create a permanent cafe-style presence, (which some people complain about because the coffee joint is right in front of some heavily trafficked lifts, which seems somewhat suboptimal from a design point of view). We\u2019ve just completed a deep dive into coffee stats. DPS officials have just told the hearing in 2018/19, 85,000 coffees were sold at the old cart, for revenue of $330,000 (a fact that tells me I am in the wrong business). Business is, reportedly, booming in the refurbished joint (booming, I tell you), with \u201cwell over\u201d 100,000 coffees sold this financial year. Officials have been asked to detail the costs of the refurbishment. The DPS folk say the estimate by the quantity surveyor came in at $538,000 (which is extraordinary .. this is a modest coffee outlet, not a suburban house). But good news, officials report. The total delivered cost was $391,000 \u201cwith rounding\u201d. Not sure how much rounding. (That is still an eye popping amount of cash for a modest hole-in-the-wall cafe. Just quietly). Back in legal affairs estimates, Kristina Keneally is asking about the City of Sydney analytics, which show the downloads of the the annual report from its servers. Angus Taylor said, in his statement, that his office accessed the report on September 9, 2019. Here is the download list for the days leading up to September 9 September 6: Twice September 7: 0 September 8: Once September 9: 10 times Sigh. As a Queenslander, I feel the need to point out that not all Queenslanders feel this way. We also learned just how bad 2019 was, and how the trend for warming is only going up: Andrew Johnson: \u201cThe observations the Bureau has taken are well and truly on the record. 2019 was a very difficult year \u2013 national average the hottest and most driest we\u2019ve seen since records began being kept at the beginning of the 20th century.\u201d Marielle Smith: Would the BoM say there is a trend to warmer and drier years? AJ: \u201cCertainly yes.\u201d MS: Will this trend continue for the foreseeable future? AJ: \u201cBased on current trajectories of global emissions \u2013 that trend is likely to continue.\u201d Gerard Rennick and Craig Kelly might have decided to start donning tinfoil hats when it comes to BoM data, but thankfully, there are still plenty of people who understand weather and climate are two different things and that it can be an imperfect science, but the best one we have at the moment. In environment estimates, Labor senator Marielle Smith is asking about the pressure BoM was under during the bushfires: MS: Was there a spike of activity to the BOM app during the bushfire crisis? BoM: Dr Andrew Johnson: \u201cI\u2019m not sure about the spike of activity into the app but I\u2019m sure there was a spike of engagement with the Bureau and the community during the bushfire crisis. We received nearly 4,5000 media requests and did many, many, many radio crosses and other engagement with the community. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all that our statistics with the app increased. I know, as of last week, nearly six-and-three-quarter million Australians had the app on their mobile device. Just within the last seven months or so we\u2019ve had nearly 900,000 new users so once could extrapolate that was driven by the severe weather at the backend of 2019. So the hole-in-the wall coffee cart turned kiosk that lives at the end of the press gallery hallway in parliament house cost something in the range of $390,000. THAT\u2019S A HOME. Why did it cost so much? Who knows. It took forever to build and we were all very fine with the coffee cart. But not only did it cost the better part of an apartment to build, it is also designed so the queue forms across the lifts. There are only a handful of places to get coffee in this building, so the queues are loooooooong during sitting weeks. Which means there are scores of people standing around in front of elevators as people are rushing around. It\u2019s a complete and utter fricking disgrace. The business indicators are not looking so good. The Australian stock market has dropped more than 2 points on the back of the coronavirus spread. Covid-19 is different to some of the other pandemics we have seen, as it is impacting end-to-end supply chains. So it is not just a case of people not going out and buying/travelling \u2013 it is also a case of not being able to get goods in and out of countries, and that includes parts. This has some way to play out. Hello good people of blogs. I\u2019m watching finance estimates this morning. At the moment the Labor senator Kimberley Kitching is attempting to terrorise officials in the Department of Parliamentary Services about poor morale in the organisation. In between those questions, which officials are pretty unhappy about, there are also questions about connectivity in the building. (Background: I love this building. We are very privileged to work here. But the lack of reliable connectivity in this building drives us all bonkers, just quietly. Calls drop out. All the damn time. Which is a problem, obviously, if you need to make calls.) Back to the hearing: Kitching asks the Senate president Scott Ryan whether we are \u201cstill on track for better connectivity by October\u201d. Ryan says, after a slight hesitation: \u201cThat\u2019s my advice.\u201d There is then talk about a much-improved antenna. PRAISE GOD. Thank you for listening. Josh Frydenberg\u2019s almost-daily attack on the \u201cwellbeing\u201d budget last week are continuing to rub. Not only did the treasurer poke fun at elements of eastern customs and religions, he also shat all over the idea of having a statement outlining what your government is doing to protect and support some of the most vulnerable members of society. Andrew Leigh has some things to say about it, ahead of national accounts: According to its latest annual report, Outcome 1 of the Australian Treasury is \u201cto improve the wellbeing of the Australian people\u201d. Treasury has included wellbeing in its mission statement since John Howard\u2019s era, so it\u2019s bizarre that the treasurer is now rejecting his own department\u2019s mission. As the shadow treasurer has noted, measuring wellbeing is now an accepted part of how many countries do their budgets, taking account of indicators such as child poverty and mental health. As we teach students in first-year economics, economics isn\u2019t about maximising money, it\u2019s about maximising wellbeing. But instead, the treasurer decided to attack Treasury\u2019s wellbeing approach! On the way through, he managed to offend New Zealanders. He offended the millions who practice meditation. And he offended Hindus, with the Hindu Council of Australia describing his comments as \u201cbrazen, racist and Hindu-phobic\u201d. NSW Liberal party member Dhanya Mani said he \u201cturned a key part of my identity into a racist punchline\u201d. Here\u2019s the bizarre thing. Since 2013, growth has slowed. Wage growth is the worst on record. Business investment is at its lowest level since the 1990s recession. Household spending is growing at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis. The Liberals\u2019 promise of surpluses every year have turned into six deficits. So you\u2019d think that the treasurer would be happy to add alternative metrics. It just goes to show: any time the Liberals have a choice between policy and point-scoring, they\u2019ll choose point-scoring every time. Senator Kristina Keneally has just asked whether the AFP considered that Angus Taylor\u2019s wife, Louise Clegg, planned to run for the City of Sydney lord mayorship in its investigation of the doctored document scandal. The question prompts outrage. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson describes it as a \u201cdisgraceful\u201d political attack. The chair, Amanda Stoker, asks her how it\u2019s relevant. Keneally responds: I think it\u2019s quite relevant. We have a federal minister who used a doctored document to attack not only his political rival in terms of policy terms, but also potentially his wife\u2019s rival in political terms. The police have decided to discontinue the investigation, not to proceed to an investigation, it\u2019s well within my rights to ask these questions. Over in legal affairs estimates, Nick McKim asks AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw whether or not the AFP even considered ringing Angus Taylor \u201cand ask him if he\u2019d done it. Isn\u2019t that the first thing you\u2019d do?\u201d Apparently not, according to Kershaw, who has a little laugh and says \u201cthat is not what we do\u201d. The bells are ringing for the start of the House sitting. Huzzah. From the home affairs minister\u2019s office: Eight potential illegal immigrants have been returned to Indonesia after a people-smuggling vessel targeting Australia was intercepted by Australian authorities. All eight people on board were safely turned back to Indonesia. Minister for home affairs Peter Dutton said this interception and turnback reaffirmed that the Morrison government remains steadfastly committed to stamping out people smuggling and stopping people risking their lives at sea. \u201cWe will not tolerate a return to past circumstances where more than 1,200 people died at sea attempting illegal and dangerous journeys to Australia.\u201d \u201cIllegal maritime travel to Australia is as pointless as it is dangerous. There is zero chance of illegal migration to Australia,\u201d Dutton said. Since the implementation of Operation Sovereign Borders in 2013, Australia has returned 873 people from 38 people-smuggling ventures to their country of origin or departure. The House is still sitting as normal. Adam Bandt has a plan for today: Greens leader Adam Bandt will introduce a bill into the House of Representatives this morning, seconded by the member for Warringah Zali Steggall OAM, to formally declare a climate emergency, require every government department to be guided by the declaration and mandate the establishment of a \u201cwar cabinet\u201d to tackle the crisis. It is up to the government to decide when the bill is debated \u2013 and it probably won\u2019t be any time soon. Anthony Albanese and Brendan O\u2019Connor have called a doorstop for 10.30am. In Finance and Public Administration, Scott Ryan is giving an update on the cyber attacks against the parliamentary network. MPs were asked to not use their personal emails (outside of the internal secure email system) for seven days recently, as part of the defence against \u201calmost daily\u201d cyber attacks. Over in the legal and constitutional affairs estimates, Kristina Keneally is still trying to ascertain from the AFP how a \u201cpolitically motivated attack\u201d on a local government officer was designated a \u201clow-order issue\u201d (that would be the Angus Taylor issue). It is also national accounts week, with the latest figures to be released on Wednesday. That\u2019s the December quarter \u2013 so it will be before the bushfires really took hold. Today you\u2019ll get the business indicators which feed into them, so you\u2019ll get an idea. The market is also bracing for a rate cut from the RBA tomorrow, given the bushfires and coronavirus \u2013 it had been expected in June, but things are not great on the economic front. If that happens, rates will be at a new historic low of 0.5%. The Australian federal police is first up before the legal and constitutional affairs Senate estimates this morning. Commissioner Reece Kershaw has just given an opening statement and attempted to explain why the AFP decided not to investigate allegations against Angus Taylor. You\u2019ll remember, of course, that the AFP decided not to investigate Taylor following revelations in the Guardian that he used a false document to launch an attack on City of Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore for her travel-related carbon emissions. Kershaw said police had taken into account the recent findings of had John Lawler, who reviewed how the agency handled sensitive investigations, including leaks, in the wake of the controversial ABC raids. One of Lawler\u2019s findings was that the AFP should consider the harm from any alleged offences when deciding whether or not to investigate. \u201cIn deciding not to pursue the matter we have taken on board certain elements of the framework set out in Mr Lawler\u2019s review report,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provided clearer detail about our considerations in determining that the matter should not be pursued. \u201cI want to express once again my utmost confidence in the AFP officers who investigate a range of complex matters in a challenging environment, and do so to a high standard.\u201d Labor senator Kristina Keneally is immediately on the attack on the Taylor issue. She asks about comments from the AFP\u2019s deputy commissioner Ian McCartney that there was a \u201clow level of ongoing harm\u201d in the Taylor matter. Kershaw said the decision was objective and considered. \u201cHarm was part of it and also so was the apology that was made as was the significant level of resources and operational priorities,\u201d he said. Keneally asks whether the AFP interviewed Moore. \u201cMy information was that there was no interview,\u201d Kershaw says. Keneally: \u201cHow do you make a determination of harm and a decision not to continue to an investigation without speaking to the victim?\u201d Kristina Keneally is straight out of the blocks this estimates hearing. Her office looked into border control numbers in the lead-up to the election campaign. You may remember all the \u201cwarnings\u201d from Peter Dutton and co that people smugglers were chomping at the bit for Labor to win an election. From Keneally\u2019s office: Documents obtained under freedom of information laws show a dramatic drop in Australian Border Force Cape Class patrols right in the middle of last year\u2019s federal election. The data in these documents shows the ABF Cape Class fleet \u2013 made up of eight vessels \u2013 only patrolled Australian waters for a total of 14 days during April 2019. Based on the data in these FOI documents, the number of Cape Class patrol days in the lead-up to and over the 2019 federal election were: \u00b7 February 2019: 102 patrol days \u00b7 March 2019: 127 patrol days \u00b7 April 2019: 14 patrol days \u00b7 May 2019: 122 patrol days Based on these numbers, prior to the election being called, there were patrols protecting Australia\u2019s borders until the Morrison government went to the polls. Peter Dutton\u2019s Department of Home Affairs must explain why these statistics show such a dramatic drop in the number of Cape Class patrol days. Looks like Australia is getting serious about creating its own recycling industry (finally). From Scott Morrison\u2019s speech this morning: Through months of consultation with industry, consumers, retailers and brand-owners, the one issue everyone comes back to is the need to increase demand for recycled products. Different countries have tried this in different ways but, true to our principles, my government will not take a top-down, tax and punish approach. We want to encourage and incentivise the best. We want to support recycled products to compete in the market. We want to see industry step up and be part of the solution. And government must be part of the solution as well. That\u2019s why I am pleased to announce the first of a number of measures my government will take to build demand for these products. We will be changing the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to make sure every procurement undertaken by a commonwealth agency considers environmental sustainability and use of recycled content as a factor in determining value for money. We\u2019ve used commonwealth procurement policy to energise our Indigenous businesses and had tremendous success \u2013 and we will do the same with Australian recycled product. Happy estimates week! It is just the House sitting this week, with senators ready to do their thing in the estimates hearings. Environment, DPS and Prime Minister and Cabinet and Home Affairs is up today, which is always a fun mix. Speaking of home affairs, Peter Dutton was on Sky News this morning, talking about these comments from NZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern, regarding Australia\u2019s deportation policy \u2013 in terms of deporting Kiwis who have committed crimes, even if they have spent their entire lives in Australia: \u201cI\u2019m not asking that Australia stops the policy,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have deported more than 2,000 individuals, and among them will be genuine Kiwis who do need to learn the consequences of their actions. \u201cBut among those 2,000 are individuals who are too young to become criminals on our watch, they were too young to become patched gang members, too young to be organised criminals. \u201cWe will own our people. We ask that Australia stops exporting theirs.\u201d Dutton says the comments were \u201cregrettable\u201d and he suspects the NZ PM may have been grandstanding for her domestic audience. Not that it matters \u2013 Australia has no plans to change its policy. New Zealand takes into account how long a person has been in the country before making deportation decisions. If you are considered to have strong ties to the nation, it doesn\u2019t deport you. Ardern said that could change. One to watch. In PM&amp;C, Phil Gaetjens is up, so #sportsrorts will get another run \u2013 with government senators doing all they can to shut it down. AFP are also up, which means Angus Taylor will also get a run. We\u2019ll have all of that and more. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin with you. You also have beginning of a cold Amy, who has had half a coffee, so let\u2019s see how that goes. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start your week.</p> \n<p>Pete Buttigieg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/pete-buttigieg-drops-out-of-20202-race-to-be-democratic-presidential-nominee\">has pulled out of the race </a>to be the Democratic party\u2019s US presidential campaign nominee after a poor showing in the South Carolina primary at the weekend. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana had never held any non-state office but his charismatic campaign style and centrist message helped him upset the odds to claim the Iowa caucus last month. However, he failed to maintain momentum in Nevada and his performance in the first southern contest sealed his fate. Speaking to supporters in South Bend on Sunday night, he called for the party to work together against Donald Trump. Buttigieg\u2019s departure \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/tom-steyer-drops-out-south-carolina\">and that of billionaire Tom Steyer on Saturday </a>\u2013 clears the way for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/01/super-tuesday-biden-sanders-south-carolina-buttigieg-bloomberg\">a showdown between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden </a>in tomorrow\u2019s Super Tuesday contests after the former vice president established his standing with a landslide victory in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina contest.</p> \n<p>Buttigieg, the first openly gay person to run for a presidential nomination, had cast himself as an outsider in the race, describing his campaign from the relative obscurity of Indiana\u2019s fourth-largest city as \u201caudacious\u201d.

The bulk of deaths are still confined to China, where another 42 were recorded on Monday, but the outbreak is spreading steadily, with Indonesia confirming its first two cases today. Australia confirmed its first human-to-human transmission. The second US victim was, like the first, in Washington state. Officials said a 72-year-old man with some pre-existing respiratory problems had died in a nursing home <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/coronavirus-washington-state-nursing-home-lockdown\">which has been placed in lockdown</a> after several other residents tested positive, as well as one member of staff.

The EU ambassador to the UK, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, said Brussels and the embassies of member countries would step up efforts to help those on the margins of society.

Landlords are warning that crucial affordable housebuilding is in jeopardy unless the government funds a bailout to pay for work that it is believed will cost at least 25 times more than the \u00a3400m earmarked by ministers.

Dave Penman, the head of the senior civil servants union, the FDA, said No 10 had \u201cripped up the rule book\u201d that ensured the ministers do not attack government officials. It came as another allegation of bullying by home secretary Priti Patel emerged in the wake of the resignation of Home Office permanent secretary Philip Rutnam.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Fill your own \u2013 </strong>Marks &amp; Spencer is extending its \u201cfill your own\u201d trial scheme after research showed that 75% of consumers are trying to reduce the amount of packaging they use.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Mayor Pete\u2019 calls for unity to defeat Trump Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories to start your week. Pete Buttigieg has pulled out of the race to be the Democratic party\u2019s US presidential campaign nominee after a poor showing in the South Carolina primary at the weekend. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana had never held any non-state office but his charismatic campaign style and centrist message helped him upset the odds to claim the Iowa caucus last month. However, he failed to maintain momentum in Nevada and his performance in the first southern contest sealed his fate. Speaking to supporters in South Bend on Sunday night, he called for the party to work together against Donald Trump. Buttigieg\u2019s departure \u2013 and that of billionaire Tom Steyer on Saturday \u2013 clears the way for a showdown between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden in tomorrow\u2019s Super Tuesday contests after the former vice president established his standing with a landslide victory in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina contest. Buttigieg, the first openly gay person to run for a presidential nomination, had cast himself as an outsider in the race, describing his campaign from the relative obscurity of Indiana\u2019s fourth-largest city as \u201caudacious\u201d. But his campaign floundered in the last two contests where he struggled to win over minority voters. * * * Death toll mounts \u2013 The global death toll from the coronavirus passed 3,000 overnight as cases spiked again in South Korea and the Unites States confirmed a second person had died. The bulk of deaths are still confined to China, where another 42 were recorded on Monday, but the outbreak is spreading steadily, with Indonesia confirming its first two cases today. Australia confirmed its first human-to-human transmission. The second US victim was, like the first, in Washington state. Officials said a 72-year-old man with some pre-existing respiratory problems had died in a nursing home which has been placed in lockdown after several other residents tested positive, as well as one member of staff. The promise of stimulus from central banks has helped stocks bounce back in Asia overnight but Wall Street\u2019s best recognised trader thinks the markets are in for more wild days. The UK now has 36 confirmed cases of the virus. A patient in Essex who tested positive is the second to do so without having recently travelled abroad. Boris Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting today to review the next steps aimed at containing the virus, which his health secretary, Matt Hancock, said could include closing schools and locking down entire cities. * * * This is Europe \u2013 The European Union has pledged to help Europeans \u201coutside the mainstream\u201d remain in the UK after Brexit amid concerns that thousands of people such as prisoners, Roma and the elderly will fail to apply to the Home Office to stay. The EU ambassador to the UK, Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, said Brussels and the embassies of member countries would step up efforts to help those on the margins of society. The story comes as we launch a new series, This is Europe, examining the stories that transcend the continent\u2019s borders. Our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, explains that while Britain is leaving Europe, the Guardian is not. * * * Grenfell warning \u2013 Social housing landlords are facing a bill of \u00a310bn to replace Grenfell-style flammable cladding on flats, the Guardian has been told. Landlords are warning that crucial affordable housebuilding is in jeopardy unless the government funds a bailout to pay for work that it is believed will cost at least 25 times more than the \u00a3400m earmarked by ministers. The National Housing Federation chief executive, Kate Henderson, said the \u201cpotential costs of this huge programme of work are spiralling. * * * Patel row deepens \u2013 Boris Johnson is giving ministers a free rein to smear senior civil servants, a union leader has claimed. Dave Penman, the head of the senior civil servants union, the FDA, said No 10 had \u201cripped up the rule book\u201d that ensured the ministers do not attack government officials. It came as another allegation of bullying by home secretary Priti Patel emerged in the wake of the resignation of Home Office permanent secretary Philip Rutnam. * * * Fill your own \u2013 Marks &amp; Spencer is extending its \u201cfill your own\u201d trial scheme after research showed that 75% of consumers are trying to reduce the amount of packaging they use. The retailer said its pilot scheme for 44 products at a store in Southampton had been a success and will be expanded this month to include a second store in Manchester city centre. M&amp;S said 25 of its 44 \u201cfill your own\u201d products, including basmati rice, porridge and milk chocolate raisins, were outselling the packaged alternatives. Today in Focus podcast A terrorist attack in Hanau was the latest incident of far-right violence in Germany. It\u2019s a growing problem, says the Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann. Also today: Amy Hodge on her series of films on Europe after Brexit. Lunchtime read: \u2018Warhol was fashion, but bigger and better\u2019 As a new exhibition on the work of Andy Warhol opens at the Tate Modern next week, we look at the pop artist\u2019s enduring influence on the world of fashion. Simon Chilvers explains Warhol\u2019s obsession with Levi 501s (he wore them under his tux to a White House reception), how he pioneered the suit-jacket-and-jeans look and became synonymous with image (\u201cWarhol was fashion, but bigger and better,\u201d says one observer). Sport Pep Guardiola wondered whether Manchester City\u2019s run of domestic trophies would ever be bettered after he saw them beat Aston Villa 2-1 to win the Carabao Cup for a third season in succession. Perhaps avoiding a trouncing was Villa\u2019s trophy, writes Jonathan Liew. Wolves took Spurs\u2019 top-six place in the Premier League with a 3-2 comeback win at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, while Carlo Ancelotti was sent off after VAR ruled out a last-ditch winner in Everton\u2019s 1-1 draw with Manchester United. In La Liga, second-half goals gave Real Madrid a 2-0 victory over Barcelona in the Cl\u00e1sico and put them top of the table by a point. A third tournament half-century from Nat Sciver led the way as England sailed through to the semi\u2011finals of the Women\u2019s T20 World Cup after beating West Indies by 46 runs.

Health experts had warned that community spread was inevitable in Australia, especially as countries such as Iran and Italy continue to see a spike in cases.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/what-happens-if-coronavirus-spreads-in-australia\">What happens if coronavirus spreads in Australia?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said anyone who had been in close contact with the man in the past 14 days would be tested and told to isolate themselves. A close contact is someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes with someone who has tested positive for the virus, or been in the same closed space for at least two hours without protective gear with the person while infectious.</p> <p>\u201cOur public health units and infectious disease units will contact all of those individuals and ascertain if they are well,\u201d Chant said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a list of all the patients this person has worked with but it would be not surprising that this healthcare worker would have been in contact with people over 65.\u201d</p> <p>She said importation of cases from Iran had been \u201csignificant\u201d, with foreign travellers arriving from Iran banned from entering Australia. \u201cIn relation to this healthcare worker, it raises a question: was there a case that was missed?\u201d Chant said. \u201cThere is always a possibility there is a case or cases out there we have missed. I am reassured there is not widespread transmission \u2013 we have tested over 3,500 people and we continue to see high rates of testing.\u201d</p> <p>New coronavirus cases in Australia could not be prevented, the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said earlier on Monday as the federal government raised its travel advice to Italy. Travellers have been urged to exercise a high degree of caution across all of Italy, and to reconsider travel to 10 virus-affected towns in the north which have been isolated by the Italian authorities.

      "bodyText": "Australia now has 30 patients who have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including the first confirmed cases of community transmission. On Monday afternoon the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, said a 41 year-old NSW woman caught the disease and that her case could be traced back to her 43-year-old brother who had returned from Iran. More concerningly, the minister said a 53-year-old health worker had been diagnosed with the virus. Hazzard said the infected man had been \u201cworking in a healthcare setting\u201d in NSW directly with patients and had not travelled overseas for three months. \u201cNSW health has begun work to determine what contact there may have been to have given him transmission of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking all the necessary steps to find out how the individual managed to acquire the virus.\u201d Previously, all people with coronavirus in Australia caught the disease by travelling to an infected country, or through direct contact with a family member who had travelled. Health experts had warned that community spread was inevitable in Australia, especially as countries such as Iran and Italy continue to see a spike in cases. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said anyone who had been in close contact with the man in the past 14 days would be tested and told to isolate themselves. A close contact is someone who has been face to face for at least 15 minutes with someone who has tested positive for the virus, or been in the same closed space for at least two hours without protective gear with the person while infectious. \u201cOur public health units and infectious disease units will contact all of those individuals and ascertain if they are well,\u201d Chant said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a list of all the patients this person has worked with but it would be not surprising that this healthcare worker would have been in contact with people over 65.\u201d She said importation of cases from Iran had been \u201csignificant\u201d, with foreign travellers arriving from Iran banned from entering Australia. \u201cIn relation to this healthcare worker, it raises a question: was there a case that was missed?\u201d Chant said. \u201cThere is always a possibility there is a case or cases out there we have missed. I am reassured there is not widespread transmission \u2013 we have tested over 3,500 people and we continue to see high rates of testing.\u201d New coronavirus cases in Australia could not be prevented, the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said earlier on Monday as the federal government raised its travel advice to Italy. Travellers have been urged to exercise a high degree of caution across all of Italy, and to reconsider travel to 10 virus-affected towns in the north which have been isolated by the Italian authorities. Any health or aged-care workers returning from Italy or South Korea should not attend work for 14 days, he said. \u201cAs we said, we are in a position where we\u2019re going to expect to see more cases in Australia. We are prepared, and we are preparing for an greater numbers,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of preparation underway across the health sector and we are in very good situational preparation. But this is pretty much as we expected.\u201d The health minister. Greg Hunt, offered his condolences to the family of 78-year-old West Australian man James Kwan, a pioneer in the tourism industry, who along with his 79-year-old wife fell ill on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Both were placed in isolation units at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital. Kwan died on Sunday. \u201cIt was obviously deeply saddening and tragic for the Kwan family but for many others who would have been affected along the way,\u201d Hunt said. The passengers were quarantined on the ship for 14 days, during which time the virus spread. Australia\u2019s evacuees were sent to Howard Springs in the Northern Territory to undergo testing. Hunt said that although the death was \u201cunfortunate\u201d, older people were more susceptible and that \u201cour response with the Diamond Princess was exemplary\u201d. \u201cWe brought these people home, we have quarantined them and a number of them have developed the disease, whereas they may have been led into the community and infected people on a plane,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have protected the Australian community but anyone who became unwell at Howard Springs in Darwin was given the most high-level Medivac back to their home state, put in the best possible care.

Sanders and Biden set for Super Tuesday clash Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has ended his improbably strong run for the Democratic presidential nomination. The first openly gay candidate for president had started the primary season well, with a narrow victory in the chaotic Iowa caucuses, but his campaign floundered as the race reached the more diverse states of Nevada and South Carolina. With Buttigieg and the billionaire Tom Steyer both dropping out, Super Tuesday is shaping up as a showdown between the progressive frontrunner, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden, who won big in South Carolina on Saturday. Among the 14 states set to vote on Tuesday is the nation\u2019s richest and most populous, California, where Sanders is winning by at least one metric: donations from tech workers. Bloomberg upset? Tuesday also marks Mike Bloomberg\u2019s official entry into the race, with the possibility that he could split Biden\u2019s moderate vote. Protesters turned their backs on the former New York mayor in Selma on Sunday, while Lucia Graves explains why his record on women could derail his 2020 bid. Covid-19 claims second US victim as global death toll tops 3,000 The global Covid-19 death toll has passed 3,000, with the coronavirus claiming its second US victim: a man in his 70s who died on Saturday at a Washington state nursing home where several other patients and staff have been infected. New York state, Rhode Island and Chicago have all confirmed their first cases of the disease. Environmental activists have expressed concern that a pandemic could disrupt crucial climate talks, while Wall Street\u2019s best known trader has predicted further chaos in the stock market. Pence defends Don Jr. Donald Trump\u2019s notional coronavirus tsar, his vice-president, Mike Pence, on Sunday defended the president\u2019s son\u2019s claim that Democrats want \u201cmillions\u201d to die of the disease, saying Trump critics ought to \u201cturn down the volume\u201d. Surviving coronavirus. A Wuhan resident, Tiger Ye, describes his experience of contracting Covid-19 and coming through it: \u201cI thought I may have to say goodbye to this life forever.\u201d Israel returns to the polls for third election in a year Israelis began voting on Monday in the country\u2019s third election in less than a year, amid a continuing stalemate between Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s ruling, rightwing Likud party and the centre-right Blue and White party led by his rival Benny Gantz. The results in elections last April and again in September were both too close to call, leaving Israel in a prolonged political crisis with its leader facing an imminent criminal trial. Oliver Holmes explains the situation. Corruption charges. Since the last election, Trump unveiled his controversial new plan for the Middle East, while Netanyahu was formally charged with corruption. Whether either development will affect the outcome remains to be seen. Cheat sheet The US-Taliban peace deal signed on Saturday is already facing opposition from the Afghan government over a clause agreeing to the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners. But the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, insisted the deal was \u201cour path forward\u201d. More than 180 children have been detained in Chile, some for as long as four months, after taking part in the anti-government unrest that has rocked the country since last October. North Korea fired two short-range projectiles on Monday, the first such launch for more than three months by the Pyongyang regime, which recently declared an end to its moratorium on long-range missile testing. Public Enemy have fired one of their founder members, Flavor Flav, after more than 35 years, over a dispute about the group performing at a Bernie Sanders rally.

Opinion With Covid-19 spreading to every continent, there will soon be no avoiding discussing the coronavirus outbreak with your children, says Amy Coopes.

Paying countries with life-sustaining ecosystems such as the Amazon rainforest billions of pounds a year for the services those ecosystems provide for the world was proposed during negotiations on a Paris-style UN agreement on nature in Rome last week. Conservationists hope the eventual agreement will provide an accessible, science-based global goal on biodiversity loss, equivalent to targets to limit global heating, following warnings from scientists that humans are driving the sixth mass extinction event in Earth\u2019s history. Delegates from more than 140 countries were responding for the first time to a draft 20-point agreement that includes proposals to protect almost a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. During the talks at the Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in Rome, several African and Latin American countries expressed the need for financial support to protect life-supporting ecosystems and develop mechanisms to share profits from discoveries linked to their genetic resources, such as new drugs. The negotiating team for Brazil, led by Leonardo Cleaver de Athayde, was particularly robust about the need for financial payments for ecosystem services. Small-scale schemes to protect ecosystems already exist under the UN climate convention, with countries with large forests receiving payments to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation. When asked whether obtaining sufficient financial backing from developed nations for so-called mega biodiverse countries would be the key sticking point in the agreement, senior UN officials cautioned that negotiations were ongoing but said the targets would not be implemented without resources. Francis Ogwal, a co-chair of the negotiations, said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about biodiversity, it\u2019s not just biodiversity, it\u2019s our life on this planet.

For the second week running, Serie A\u2019s Sunday schedule was reduced to two games, with the rest postponed amid disagreement over the appropriate response to Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreaks. This time, the cancellations included the Derby d\u2019Italia.</p> \n<p>No other match could capture the imagination like that one: Juventus taking on Internazionale in the first season when both have truly contested the title against one another for almost two decades. But the four teams who did take the field entertained us instead by combining for 16 goals.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/01/chaos-in-italy-as-more-serie-a-matches-suspended-over-coronavirus\">Chaos in Italy as more Serie A matches suspended over coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some were magnificent. The scores were level in Lecce when Josip Ilicic <a href=\"https://youtu.be/A2xCYRgixV4?t=114\">beat a man in midfield</a>, exchanged a one-two with the wing-back and then took out another pair of defenders with his through-ball for Papu G\u00f3mez. After the Argentinian\u2019s shot was blocked, Ilicic arrived first to the rebound, shifting the ball across his body with his right boot and picking out the bottom corner with his left.</p> \n<p>There were fewer stages to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/u0qDV1rRsF0?t=34\">Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s opener in Sardinia</a>, but it was sensational all the same. Running on to Christian Oliva\u2019s long pass, the Brazilian tamed it on his thigh and then floated a half-volley over Pau L\u00f3pez despite the keeper being barely a step off his line. Not every strike was so deliberate. Atalanta were irresistible in the second half away to Lecce, accelerating from 2-2 at the interval to win 7-2, but their opener was a bizarre own goal that came off the side of Giulio Donati\u2019s head. Roma, similarly, took their first step towards a 4-3 victory at Cagliari when Luca Pellegrini sliced a clearance into the path of Nikola Kalinic five yards out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"006057be231ecfccea8bf13815341be0fedcf33c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/006057be231ecfccea8bf13815341be0fedcf33c/0_148_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duv\u00e1n Zapata strikes for Atalanta, who have now scored 70 goals in 25 Serie A matches.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duv\u00e1n Zapata strikes for Atalanta, who have now scored 70 goals in 25 Serie A matches.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Lezzi/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was good and bad on the pitch.

A sixth, Verona v Sampdoria, scheduled for Monday, was added to the list one day later.</p> \n<p>What provoked the late change of heart?

      "bodyText": "Atalanta and Lecce did their best to pick up the slack on a weekend missing its headline act. Cagliari and Roma, too. For the second week running, Serie A\u2019s Sunday schedule was reduced to two games, with the rest postponed amid disagreement over the appropriate response to Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreaks. This time, the cancellations included the Derby d\u2019Italia. No other match could capture the imagination like that one: Juventus taking on Internazionale in the first season when both have truly contested the title against one another for almost two decades. But the four teams who did take the field entertained us instead by combining for 16 goals. Some were magnificent. The scores were level in Lecce when Josip Ilicic beat a man in midfield, exchanged a one-two with the wing-back and then took out another pair of defenders with his through-ball for Papu G\u00f3mez. After the Argentinian\u2019s shot was blocked, Ilicic arrived first to the rebound, shifting the ball across his body with his right boot and picking out the bottom corner with his left. There were fewer stages to Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s opener in Sardinia, but it was sensational all the same. Running on to Christian Oliva\u2019s long pass, the Brazilian tamed it on his thigh and then floated a half-volley over Pau L\u00f3pez despite the keeper being barely a step off his line. Not every strike was so deliberate. Atalanta were irresistible in the second half away to Lecce, accelerating from 2-2 at the interval to win 7-2, but their opener was a bizarre own goal that came off the side of Giulio Donati\u2019s head. Roma, similarly, took their first step towards a 4-3 victory at Cagliari when Luca Pellegrini sliced a clearance into the path of Nikola Kalinic five yards out. There was good and bad on the pitch. Off it, this season is threatening to get ugly. The decision to postpone five games in the north of Italy was made by Lega Serie A \u2013 the governing body for Italy\u2019s top flight \u2013 on Saturday. A sixth, Verona v Sampdoria, scheduled for Monday, was added to the list one day later. What provoked the late change of heart? On Thursday the Lega had announced that those original five games \u2013 Juventus v Inter, Udinese v Fiorentina, Milan v Genoa, Parma v Spal and Sassuolo v Brescia \u2013 would go ahead as scheduled, behind closed doors. The government\u2019s ban on mass public gatherings in regions where cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed ran through 1 March. Lobbying efforts to make a special case for the Derby d\u2019Italia \u2013 seizing on the fact that initial legislation introduced in Piedmont only extended to 29 February \u2013 were unsuccessful. Inter rejected a proposal to delay the game by one day, and believed the matter to been settled. Saturday\u2019s decision to impose a longer postponement provoked an angry back-and-forth between their CEO Beppe Marotta \u2013 formerly of Juventus \u2013 and the president of the Lega, Paolo Dal Pino. The latter insisted his role was to look out for the league\u2019s best interests, which could not be served by having such a prestigious game \u2013 set to be broadcast to more than 200 countries \u2013 played before an empty stadium.

      "bodyText": "How does the coronavirus spread? The Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak is a new illness and scientists are still assessing how it spreads from person to person, but similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection. For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. Viruses can also be spread through droplets landing on surfaces such as seats on buses or trains or desks in school. However, whether this is a main transmission route depends on how long viruses survive on surfaces \u2013 this can vary from hours to months. There is anecdotal evidence that the virus can be spread by people before they have symptoms. Some other illnesses such as flu can be passed from one person to another before symptoms occur \u2013 but the extent to which this is happening with the new coronavirus is not well understood yet. How to protect yourself and others Wash your hands: wet your hands with clean, running water and apply soap. Lather your hands, including the backs, between your fingers, and under your nails and scrub for at least 20 seconds. Rinse. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the bin and wash your hands. If you do not have a tissue to hand, cough or sneeze into your elbow rather than your hands. Face masks offer some protection as they block liquid droplets. However, they do not block smaller aerosol particles that can pass through the material of the mask. The masks also leave the eyes exposed and there is evidence that some viruses can infect a person through the eyes. Seek early medical help if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share your travel history with healthcare providers. If visiting live markets in affected areas avoid direct, unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces that have been in contact with animals. If you have returned from an affected area in the last two weeks, stay indoors and avoid contact with other people for 14 days. This means not going to work, school or public areas. If you have returned from an infected area and develop a high temperature, cough, runny nose, sore throat or difficulty breathing do not leave your home until you have been given advice by a doctor.",

That was actually slightly better than had been the case for most of last year. And then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/markets-fall-coronavirus-china-economy\">over the weekend</a> the index for February was released, revealing an absolute collapse in the purchasing intentions of the sector \u2013 down to a record low of 35.7:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"China purchasing managers indexes\">  <iframe title=\"China purchasing managers indexes\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/yLcuJ/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The fall was below the previous record that occurred during the GFC. And the non-manufacturing PMI \u2013 which mostly covers the purchasing intentions of those in the services and construction sectors \u2013 also fell off a cliff.</p> <p>And down as well went the share market:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"ASX200 index\">  <iframe title=\"ASX200 index\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nrbmP/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Last month the news was about record highs; now, in the space of a week, nearly nine months\u2019 worth of value has been wiped away<a href=\"xhttp://www.theguardian.com\">.</a></p> <p>Last week the market was quite sure the Reserve Bank would not cut the cash rate from 0.75% to 0.5% on Tuesday; now there is an outside chance of a double cut to 0.25%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\">  <iframe title=\"Market expectations of the RBA cash rate\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cyLbt/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>That would be a stunning move.</p> <p>The last time the Reserve Bank cut by more than 25 basis points was in February 2009 when it cut the rate from 4.25% to 3.25% in response to the ongoing GFC.</p> <p>For the RBA to cut to 0.25% in one go \u2013 a rate below which the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, admitted was effectively zero \u2013 would mean not only uncharted territory but also a real sense that action needs to come quickly, and that the government is unlikely to provide enough fiscal stimulus in time.</p> <p>Back during the GFC the advice from Treasury, having studied what happened in the 1990s recessions, was \u201cgo hard, go early, go households\u201d. But the management of the Treasury and PM&amp;C is rather different now, and we also have a government in place which has spent the better part of a decade criticising the ALP for its stimulus during the GFC.</p> <p>Well, time moves fast, and now it is time for Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison to step up.</p> <p>Yesterday the yields for Australian government bonds also fell \u2013 reaching record lows in the morning before recovering slightly in the afternoon off the news that the US Federal Reserve was expected to cut its target rate by 0.5% points.</p> <p>Even still, the outlook is pretty grim. The five-year and two-year bond yields were both at 0.44%, a sign that traders believe there are few good signs to come.</p> <p>And the reality is that, even before the coronavirus things were pretty poor.</p> <p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5625.0?OpenDocument\">new capital expenditure figures</a> out last week showed even though investment in the mining sector for the first time since March 2013 was above what it had been a year earlier, overall investment was down:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Private new capital expenditure - annual growth\">  <iframe title=\"Private new capital expenditure - annual growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/u6os9/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Most concerning is that new investment in the non-mining sector was falling.</p> <p>Given the mining sector is likely to be hit mightily from China\u2019s falling manufacturing and construction sectors, the lack of good news in the non-mining sector does not bode well.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s figures also contained the first estimate for investment in the 2020-21 financial year. Given these estimates were made well before the coronavirus, they are laughably out of date, but even here we see that the non-mining sector was projecting a slowdown:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"First estimate for new capital expenditure in the following financial year\">  <iframe title=\"First estimate for new capital expenditure in the following financial year\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wCzLr/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>For the first time in five years the first estimate for future investment in the non-mining sector is below that of the previous year. Given the news has only got worse in the months since these estimates were made at the end of last year, that is decidedly not good.</p> <p>Yesterday we also saw the first lot of data that will feed into tomorrow\u2019s GDP figures.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/5676.0Main%20Features1Dec%202019?opendocument&amp;tabname=Summary&amp;prodno=5676.0&amp;issue=Dec%202019&amp;num=&amp;view=\">business indictors</a> showed a sharp fall in mining profits \u2013 down 8% in the December quarter in seasonally adjusted terms (the biggest fall for two and a half years). Even in the less erratic trend terms, mining profits were down 2.3%, and they rose a mere 0.1% in the non-mining sector (the worst result for three years):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Gross operating profits - quarterly growth\">  <iframe title=\"Gross operating profits - quarterly growth\" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/p8t8h/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The horror show that has been the retail sector was also on display, with income from sales down in both volume and dollars:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Retail industry sale income - annual growth\">  <iframe title=\"Retail industry sale income - annual growth \" aria-label=\"Column Chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/J2Yhp/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The sector is as bad now as it has been any time this century.</p> <p>At the moment there is no good news, and much of it is very bad. But we should not lose sight of the fact that prior to the coronavirus, the economy was already in a bad state and in desperate need of stimulus. The government, however, refused to step in and instead kept talking up the need for a surplus.</p> <p>Such talk is now out of date, but will this government be strong enough to respond, like the Rudd government in 2008-09, and finally provide stimulus that is fast and targeted enough to work?</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia</p></li> </ul>",

And then over the weekend the index for February was released, revealing an absolute collapse in the purchasing intentions of the sector \u2013 down to a record low of 35.7: The fall was below the previous record that occurred during the GFC. And the non-manufacturing PMI \u2013 which mostly covers the purchasing intentions of those in the services and construction sectors \u2013 also fell off a cliff. And down as well went the share market: Last month the news was about record highs; now, in the space of a week, nearly nine months\u2019 worth of value has been wiped away. Last week the market was quite sure the Reserve Bank would not cut the cash rate from 0.75% to 0.5% on Tuesday; now there is an outside chance of a double cut to 0.25%. That would be a stunning move. The last time the Reserve Bank cut by more than 25 basis points was in February 2009 when it cut the rate from 4.25% to 3.25% in response to the ongoing GFC. For the RBA to cut to 0.25% in one go \u2013 a rate below which the governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, admitted was effectively zero \u2013 would mean not only uncharted territory but also a real sense that action needs to come quickly, and that the government is unlikely to provide enough fiscal stimulus in time. Back during the GFC the advice from Treasury, having studied what happened in the 1990s recessions, was \u201cgo hard, go early, go households\u201d. But the management of the Treasury and PM&amp;C is rather different now, and we also have a government in place which has spent the better part of a decade criticising the ALP for its stimulus during the GFC. Well, time moves fast, and now it is time for Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison to step up. Yesterday the yields for Australian government bonds also fell \u2013 reaching record lows in the morning before recovering slightly in the afternoon off the news that the US Federal Reserve was expected to cut its target rate by 0.5% points. Even still, the outlook is pretty grim. The five-year and two-year bond yields were both at 0.44%, a sign that traders believe there are few good signs to come. And the reality is that, even before the coronavirus things were pretty poor. The latest new capital expenditure figures out last week showed even though investment in the mining sector for the first time since March 2013 was above what it had been a year earlier, overall investment was down: Most concerning is that new investment in the non-mining sector was falling. Given the mining sector is likely to be hit mightily from China\u2019s falling manufacturing and construction sectors, the lack of good news in the non-mining sector does not bode well. Last week\u2019s figures also contained the first estimate for investment in the 2020-21 financial year. Given these estimates were made well before the coronavirus, they are laughably out of date, but even here we see that the non-mining sector was projecting a slowdown: For the first time in five years the first estimate for future investment in the non-mining sector is below that of the previous year. Given the news has only got worse in the months since these estimates were made at the end of last year, that is decidedly not good. Yesterday we also saw the first lot of data that will feed into tomorrow\u2019s GDP figures. The business indictors showed a sharp fall in mining profits \u2013 down 8% in the December quarter in seasonally adjusted terms (the biggest fall for two and a half years). Even in the less erratic trend terms, mining profits were down 2.3%, and they rose a mere 0.1% in the non-mining sector (the worst result for three years): The horror show that has been the retail sector was also on display, with income from sales down in both volume and dollars: The sector is as bad now as it has been any time this century. At the moment there is no good news, and much of it is very bad. But we should not lose sight of the fact that prior to the coronavirus, the economy was already in a bad state and in desperate need of stimulus. The government, however, refused to step in and instead kept talking up the need for a surplus. Such talk is now out of date, but will this government be strong enough to respond, like the Rudd government in 2008-09, and finally provide stimulus that is fast and targeted enough to work?

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>During a press conference in Brussels, Von der Leyen expressed her \u201cfull sympathy for those who are suffering\u201d as she launched a coronavirus response team of commissioners to coordinate efforts to stem infection and deal with the economic fall out.</p> \n<p>Paolo Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister who is European commissioner for the economy, said transport, tourism and carmakers were among the sectors most affected, adding that recent predictions of a \u201cV-shaped\u201d economic recovery from the epidemic, involving a sharp downturn and sharp recovery, could prove optimistic.</p> \n<p>More than two months on, most cases and deaths from the virus are still confined to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>, whose health commission reported 202 new infections on Monday \u2013 the lowest daily rise since late January \u2013 and 42 new deaths.

During a press conference in Brussels, Von der Leyen expressed her \u201cfull sympathy for those who are suffering\u201d as she launched a coronavirus response team of commissioners to coordinate efforts to stem infection and deal with the economic fall out. Paolo Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister who is European commissioner for the economy, said transport, tourism and carmakers were among the sectors most affected, adding that recent predictions of a \u201cV-shaped\u201d economic recovery from the epidemic, involving a sharp downturn and sharp recovery, could prove optimistic. More than two months on, most cases and deaths from the virus are still confined to China, whose health commission reported 202 new infections on Monday \u2013 the lowest daily rise since late January \u2013 and 42 new deaths. All the fatalities were in the Hubei province. But as the death toll in China crept up to 2,912, there were signs of the rate of infection speeding up elsewhere. Amid fears that the real spread of infection in Iran may be much greater than is being acknowledged, governments and international organisations on Monday offered the Islamic Republic assistance fighting the epidemic. The UN World Health Organization sent its first planeload of assistance as the official death toll in Iran was raised to 66 \u2013 the highest outside China \u2013 with 1,501 confirmed cases. Tehran rejected an offer from the US, which has subjected the country to tightening sanctions, but China announced it had sent a Chinese Red Cross team to help with epidemic prevention. The German foreign ministry disclosed that France, Germany and the UK had also offered Iran a \u20ac5m package of assistance. State radio reported that a 71-year-old member of the council advising Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had died on Monday and that other senior officials had tested positive, as 300,000 Iranian soldiers and volunteers were mobilised. Around the Gulf region, 129 cases have been confirmed in the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar. In Italy, the European country worst affected by the virus, infections have risen to 1,835 cases, with 52 fatalities. All members of the local government of Lombardy, the region worst hit by the outbreak in northern Italy, will undergo tests after a councillor was found to have the illness. The number of confirmed cases in France jumped from 100 to 130 in 24 hours, with a woman in her eighties who lived in Crepy-en-Valois, north-east of Paris, where a 60-year-old teacher died last week, becoming the third fatality. Cases in the US rose to at least 76 with two deaths, both in Washington state. The second victim was a man in his 70s who died on Saturday in a nursing home where several other people are infected, local health authorities said.

Several protesters shouted slurs at the reclusive leader, who spoke a day after the Seoul city government asked prosecutors to begin a murder investigation against him. Australia reported two cases of person-to-person transmission, the first of its 33 confirmed cases. In Spain, it was reported that the number of cases had doubled from Saturday to 120 on Monday, prompting Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the doctor coordinating the country\u2019s response, to suggest the government could take action against the kissing of religious images.

Then there\u2019s a nice heartwarming tale about Panasonic signing up to sponsor the torch relay. Then an announcement for something called the \u201cTokyo 2020 Open Innovation Challenge\u201d. Nothing at all about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">deadly viruses or global disease outbreaks</a>.

Olympic Games have been cancelled before through world war: it happened in 1916, 1940 and 1944.

Even as the International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound speaks of coronavirus as \u201cthe new war scenario\u201d, even as Japan goes into lockdown and schools are closed and domestic baseball games are held before oceans of empty seats, the spectre of a cancelled Olympics still belongs to a different, scarier world: one of barbed-wire borders, soldiers on the streets, petrified citizens stockpiling Super Noodles.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

      "bodyText": "An escalation in the coronavirus outbreak could cut global economic growth in half and plunge several countries into recession this year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has warned. Sounding the alarm as the disease spreads around the world and rattles investors, the OECD said global GDP growth could plummet this year to as little as 1.5%, almost half the 2.9% rate it forecast before the outbreak took hold. The downturn could be the \u201cgravest threat\u201d to the global economy since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, it warned. Against a backdrop of already weak GDP growth, the economies of Japan and the eurozone could slide into recession this year, it added, while warning that failure in the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trade talks with the EU also represented a significant downside risk. The influential Paris-based group \u2013 which represents the world\u2019s 36 most advanced economies \u2013 urged governments around the world to take greater steps to work together, calling for an international response as Covid-19 spreads. In an equally downbeat assessment, Roberto Azev\u00eado, the head of the World Trade Organization, said he expected the epidemic to have a substantial impact on the global economy. \u201cThe effects on the global economy are also likely to be substantial and will start to show up in the trade data in the weeks to come,\u201d he said. The EU economy spokesman, Paolo Gentiloni, said the heavy impact of the virus on business activity would force the EU and European countries to increase spending. \u201cThe idea of a V-shaped recovery, returning quickly to growth, can\u2019t be taken for granted and could prove optimistic,\u201d he said. He emphasised that EU rules allowed individual countries to respond to the crisis and they should act quickly to maintain confidence. The OECD said its base-case scenario was for a short-lived but severe downturn, with the focal point for the economic damage in China. It forecast global growth would slide to 2.4% for 2020 as a whole, down from an already weak 2.9% last year. Even under its central forecast, the OECD said global growth could shrink in the first quarter. Chinese growth is expected to fall below 5% this year, down from 6.1% last year \u2013 which was already the weakest growth rate in the world\u2019s second largest economy in almost 30 years. However, the outbreak could also cause a \u201cdomino scenario\u201d whereby global growth is severely damaged in 2020 by the virus spreading throughout advanced economies across the northern hemisphere. Alongside growth slowing by about 1.4% over the course of the year to as little as 1.5%, financial markets around the world would also crash by about 20% under this scenario. Saying that world leaders needed to act swiftly, the OECD called for greater support for healthcare systems and workers, and for nations to protect the incomes of their most vulnerable social groups and businesses. Laurence Boone, the OECD\u2019s chief economist, has warned that central banks would be unable to protect economies from the coronavirus on their own. \u201cWe do not think this is a shock that can be managed by central banks alone,\u201d she said. Her comments followed a statement from the Bank of England that it would \u201censure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability\u201d. In a rebuke to Washington and Beijing, Boone said the US and China should end their trade war, during which import tariffs have increased on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods. Boone said global cooperation was needed to cope with the crisis and Washington and Beijing would signal a return to a more cooperative stance if they dispensed with tariffs imposed over the last two years. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, said the UK government needed to signal what efforts it would make if the situation deteriorated. \u201cThe government should be ready to intervene with a fiscal stimulus if necessary, and work internationally to coordinate economic interventions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe OECD report makes clear that governments need to be clear-sighted and coordinated in responding to the threat of coronavirus, and at the moment that leadership is sorely lacking from the chancellor and prime minister.\u201d Since the outbreak in January, close to 85,000 people have been infected worldwide, with a fast-rising share of these outside China.

      "bodyText": "The season-opening Formula One race in Australia will go ahead despite the increasing threat from the coronavirus, organisers have stated. The Chinese Grand Prix has already been postponed because of the outbreak and infection from the virus has now spread throughout Europe, where the F1 teams are based. The Australian GP is due to take place on 15 March and with teams and equipment set to leave this week, a definitive decision on staging the race needs to be made within days. Air freight, including cars, for the Melbourne meeting are expected to leave on Wednesday and Thursday, with team personnel flying out shortly afterwards. F1 management and the FIA state that they continue to monitor the coronavirus outbreak, insisting that the safety of teams, staff and fans is paramount. On Monday the chief executive of the Australian GP, Andrew Westacott, stated that at this stage he is confident the race will take place. \u201cWe are all systems go and gearing up for the 25th Formula One race in Melbourne next week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe finishing touches are being put on the circuit; F1 freight and personnel are arriving in the coming days. \u201cWe continue to closely monitor the situation in the lead-up to the grand prix and are taking guidance from subject-matter experts, including Victorian and national chief health officers and the Australian Health Protection principal committee. At this stage there is no indication of further travel bans, nor is there any indication that Formula One and the teams will not be arriving as usual. Formula One has again confirmed overnight that the Australian Grand Prix is going ahead.\u201d The spread of the virus in Italy and Japan remains a major concern. Ferrari, AlphaTauri and the tyre supplier Pirelli are all based in Italy, while the engine manufacturer Honda is based in Japan. They supply power units to Red Bull and AlphaTauri. Australia has already imposed strict controls on entry from China and Iran, with foreign nationals required to spend 14 days in a third country before entering. Currently Italy and Japan are not subject to such restrictions but Italy has experienced a surge in cases of infection. The Bahrain Grand Prix is set to be held one week after the Australian GP and there has been speculation that it might be held spectator free. However with the volume of personnel from teams, F1, broadcasters and media for a race running into the thousands, such a measure would be of limited effect. It is understood that F1 management is not considering closed-door meetings as an option. Organisers of the Vietnam Grand Prix insist it will still take place on 5 April. However on Monday authorities announced that 115 people were now suspected of having the virus in Vietnam. In response its ministry of foreign affairs announced that Italian nationals will no longer be granted visa-free entry to the country. The MotoGP series has postponed its scheduled second race of the season in Thailand set for 22 March because of the virus. The opening meeting in Qatar has already been cancelled due to travel restrictions put in place on entry from personnel from Italy and other countries.",

      "body": "<p>The airline industry often finds itself on the corporate frontline when global disaster strikes. The 9/11 attacks, the Sars outbreak and the credit crunch all posed a serious threat to a sector that has always struggled to make consistent profits.</p> \n<p>The coronavirus crisis marks another dangerous moment for airlines, which are already facing multibillion-dollar revenue losses as the disease hits demand.</p> \n<p>Carriers around the world are cutting routes, freezing pay and using smaller aircraft to cope with a further slump in bookings. British Airways and Ryanair announced flight cuts on Monday , with BA dropping 432 flights between 16 March and 28 March, including one flight a day between London and New York as well as services to Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Ryanair, Europe\u2019s biggest short haul carrier, said it was also cutting hundreds of services by cutting a quarter of its flights to and from Italy between 17 March and 8 April.</p> \n<p>Globally, airlines took five years to return to profit after the 2001 terror attacks, losing more than $40bn (\u00a330.7bn), mainly in the US, in that time. The industry plunged back into negative territory in 2008, losing an aggregate $8bn as the financial crisis struck.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4db28889-c914-4b4c-b6ad-4ee0194d1882\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>My flight to Europe is cancelled. All I\u2019m being offered is an alternative flight or vouchers. Is this legal?</b></p>\n    <p>No. But that hasn\u2019t stopped a number of airlines doing exactly that. All flights on EU carriers within, or into the EU, and all flights leaving from an EU airport, are protected by the EU\u2019s \u201cdenied boarding\u201d rules, which require a full refund in seven days when flights are cancelled.</p>\n    <p>The problem for consumers is that enforcing these rights is proving very difficult. After initially promising to refund passengers within 20 working days, Ryanair has now said passengers should accept vouchers valid for 12 months, or wait until the Covid-19 pandemic is over for a refund.</p>\n    <p>Refunds at British Airways are only being processed by customer services which, of course, is impossible to contact. easyJet, initially only offered refunds through customer services but now has a web portal to request refunds.</p>\n    <p>Note: the EU cancellation rules do not apply to non-EU carriers where the flight started outside the EU \u2013 for example, a Korean Air flight from Seoul to London.</p>\n    <p><b>In the face of a no-refund policy, what should I do</b>?</p>\n    <p>Taking the offer of replacement vouchers in the current climate is highly risky given the airline may not be around in six months. While some will be happy to accept vouchers, many will not.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Coby Benson of the specialist flight compensation lawyers, Bott&nbsp;and Co, advises passengers to submit their refund request in writing, using the following text:</p>\n    <p><i>I understand that my flight [fight number] on [flight date] has been cancelled and I therefore request a full refund pursuant to articles 5(1)(a) and 8(1)(a) of EC Regulation No.261/2004. You are reminded that the refund must be made within seven days. For the avoidance of doubt, I do not accept a travel voucher.</i></p>\n    <p>If the airline does not respond or does not agree then the passenger can either issue court proceedings or use <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers/alternative-dispute-resolution-for-consumers\">Alternative Dispute Resolution</a>.</p>\n    <p>If your flight cost more than \u00a3100 and was booked using a credit card, you can hold the card provider jointly liable.

      "bodyText": "The airline industry often finds itself on the corporate frontline when global disaster strikes. The 9/11 attacks, the Sars outbreak and the credit crunch all posed a serious threat to a sector that has always struggled to make consistent profits. The coronavirus crisis marks another dangerous moment for airlines, which are already facing multibillion-dollar revenue losses as the disease hits demand. Carriers around the world are cutting routes, freezing pay and using smaller aircraft to cope with a further slump in bookings. British Airways and Ryanair announced flight cuts on Monday , with BA dropping 432 flights between 16 March and 28 March, including one flight a day between London and New York as well as services to Italy, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Ryanair, Europe\u2019s biggest short haul carrier, said it was also cutting hundreds of services by cutting a quarter of its flights to and from Italy between 17 March and 8 April. Globally, airlines took five years to return to profit after the 2001 terror attacks, losing more than $40bn (\u00a330.7bn), mainly in the US, in that time. The industry plunged back into negative territory in 2008, losing an aggregate $8bn as the financial crisis struck. This time, the industry has hoped to stay in the black overall, according to the International Air Transport Association forecasts. But an Iata spokesman said the organisation\u2019s estimate of almost $30bn in lost revenues, made 11 days ago, was already seriously outdated, with the outbreak now affecting bookings in new regions of the world. With fears growing that years of unusually rosy financial health could be ending, airlines called on Monday for the suspension of normal \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d rules on valuable airport slots. Iata said it was contacting aviation regulators worldwide and requesting the usual rules governing the use of takeoff and landing slots be put on hold. About 43% of airline passengers worldwide fly from airports where airlines lose rights to takeoff and landing slots if they fail to use their allocation at least 80% of the time. Regulators can waive the rules in exceptional circumstances, and some have done so already for airlines flying to China. However, Iata\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said: \u201cIata research has shown that traffic has collapsed on key Asian routes and that this is rippling throughout the air transport network globally, even between countries without major outbreaks of Covid-19. \u201cWe are calling for regulators worldwide to help the industry plan for today\u2019s emergency, and the future recovery of the network, by suspending the slot-use rules on a temporary basis.\u201d De Juniac said airlines were \u201con the frontline of the challenge\u201d to prevent the spread of Covid-19 while keeping the global economy functioning. Iata said one carrier had taken a 26% reduction in passenger numbers across its entire operation, and a major carrier had reported bookings to Italy collapsing to zero and customers demanding refunds. Among the latest efforts to cut staff costs, the US carrier United Airlines on Sunday said it was offering pilots partially paid leave, and Emirates joined Cathay in encouraging its staff to take time off. The German airline group Lufthansa has grounded a number of large planes and said on Monday it was extending flight cancellations to Iran and China routes until late April. The Dutch carrier KLM has extended its flight ban to China. The spread of outbreaks to Italy has significantly worsened carriers\u2019 outlook. BA\u2019s owner, IAG, reported on Friday that it could no longer offer profit guidance for the year after the drop in bookings following the quarantining of parts of north Italy. EasyJet has also cancelled hundreds of flights to Italy. Airline shares have plummeted since last week, with easyJet falling 30%, IAG slipping 32% and both United Airlines and Lufthansa down a quarter. According to Andrew Lobbenberg, a HSBC analyst, while Air France-KLM had warned of a \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) hit from coronavirus until the end of May, \u201cthe widening of the outbreak across Asia and into Italy makes the company\u2019s estimate redundant.

      "body": "<p>When Cherie Blair got pregnant in Downing Street, to create the first baby born to an incumbent prime minister since the 1840s, the general response was a muted surprise and respectful congratulations. Nobody was anti-baby. At the same time, a prime minister was a public servant, not the head of a dynasty or a character in a soap opera; we weren\u2019t about to make baby Leo into a commemorative plate. We were, in the main, steadfastly neutral towards this baby, neither for nor against him.</p> <p>Contrast the forthcoming bundle of joy from Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds: supportive newspapers are billing this event somewhere between a royal baby and a second coming. <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-03-01/what-the-papers-say-march-1/\" title=\"\">The front cover</a> of the Sunday Telegraph looks like Hello! magazine, the great, beaming face of Symonds carefully angled so that Johnson, kissing her in profile, doesn\u2019t look anything like as raddled as usual. \u201cNo 10 wedding \u2013 and a baby too!\u201d the headline croons, as though these two heartwarming facts were entirely unrelated. A radio host <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danwootton/status/1233808346777604098\" title=\"\">tweets</a>, \u201csome much needed happy news for the country\u201d, and a nation is left scratching its head and rubbing its eyes: how is this supposed to be for the country? Isn\u2019t the prime minster constantly having children?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"663e10058318af0af750bdca70b6745618e0310d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/663e10058318af0af750bdca70b6745618e0310d/0_0_962_1328/724.jpg\" alt=\"Carrie Symonds and Boris Johnson announce their engagement on Instagram.\" width=\"724\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Johnson, kissing her in profile, doesn\u2019t look anything like as raddled as usual.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apples_Symonds/Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But all the personal critique is quite half-hearted. I don\u2019t care that Johnson will be on his third marriage, or that his fiancee is 24 years younger than him. I wouldn\u2019t care if he didn\u2019t get married. This tub-thumping moraliser, the prime minister who has happily spun a few bob out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/29/boris-johnson-dodges-lbc-radio-hosts-questions-about-his-children\" title=\"\">castigating single mothers</a>, dares us with his happy-family pantomime to use those moral arguments against him, and who knows, perhaps they would be effective. But I don\u2019t believe in policing people\u2019s personal lives. Conservatives are incredibly good at borrowing principles they don\u2019t hold to score a point. (Topical example: having had no interest in equality for the previous six decades, suddenly they\u2019re the most fearless crusaders against sexism and racism when they\u2019re defending Priti Patel.) The left, typically, is bad at it, and should be proud of that.</p> <p>Nor am I wild about the argument that the baby is a distraction, that news of its forthcoming arrival is being wheeled out to distract us at a difficult time for the government, when crises are all around, only roughly half of them of its own making. Perhaps Johnson is so cynical, maybe he\u2019s looking to maximise the feel-good or dead-cat potential of his progeny; maybe they\u2019ll be popping out a conveniently timed sprog every other year until all disasters have passed, by which time nobody will be able to count the prime minister\u2019s children.</p> <p>Yet when you try to second-guess a politician who uses his personal life to calculated effect, you\u2019re drawn into a cynical feedback loop. You start off questioning his motives in buying a dog: pretty soon, you\u2019re suspicious of the dog (it\u2019s looking cute on purpose, because it knows another permanent secretary is on the way out). This is win-win for Johnson \u2013 either we take his news at face value, and rejoice in it, or we scrutinise it for manipulative intent, becoming cynical ourselves in the process, normalising a culture of mistrust. I would prefer to be knitting a tiny hat.</p> <p>Yet there is a reason to balk at the new politics. The prime minister, present in Technicolor for this personal news, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/21/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnson-neglecting-the-nation\" title=\"\">absent as a politician</a>: invisible in the flood-hit areas; extremely late to, and so far nonsensical on, the matter of coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "When Cherie Blair got pregnant in Downing Street, to create the first baby born to an incumbent prime minister since the 1840s, the general response was a muted surprise and respectful congratulations. Nobody was anti-baby. At the same time, a prime minister was a public servant, not the head of a dynasty or a character in a soap opera; we weren\u2019t about to make baby Leo into a commemorative plate. We were, in the main, steadfastly neutral towards this baby, neither for nor against him. Contrast the forthcoming bundle of joy from Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds: supportive newspapers are billing this event somewhere between a royal baby and a second coming. The front cover of the Sunday Telegraph looks like Hello! magazine, the great, beaming face of Symonds carefully angled so that Johnson, kissing her in profile, doesn\u2019t look anything like as raddled as usual. \u201cNo 10 wedding \u2013 and a baby too!\u201d the headline croons, as though these two heartwarming facts were entirely unrelated. A radio host tweets, \u201csome much needed happy news for the country\u201d, and a nation is left scratching its head and rubbing its eyes: how is this supposed to be for the country? Isn\u2019t the prime minster constantly having children? But all the personal critique is quite half-hearted. I don\u2019t care that Johnson will be on his third marriage, or that his fiancee is 24 years younger than him. I wouldn\u2019t care if he didn\u2019t get married. This tub-thumping moraliser, the prime minister who has happily spun a few bob out of castigating single mothers, dares us with his happy-family pantomime to use those moral arguments against him, and who knows, perhaps they would be effective. But I don\u2019t believe in policing people\u2019s personal lives. Conservatives are incredibly good at borrowing principles they don\u2019t hold to score a point. (Topical example: having had no interest in equality for the previous six decades, suddenly they\u2019re the most fearless crusaders against sexism and racism when they\u2019re defending Priti Patel.) The left, typically, is bad at it, and should be proud of that. Nor am I wild about the argument that the baby is a distraction, that news of its forthcoming arrival is being wheeled out to distract us at a difficult time for the government, when crises are all around, only roughly half of them of its own making. Perhaps Johnson is so cynical, maybe he\u2019s looking to maximise the feel-good or dead-cat potential of his progeny; maybe they\u2019ll be popping out a conveniently timed sprog every other year until all disasters have passed, by which time nobody will be able to count the prime minister\u2019s children. Yet when you try to second-guess a politician who uses his personal life to calculated effect, you\u2019re drawn into a cynical feedback loop. You start off questioning his motives in buying a dog: pretty soon, you\u2019re suspicious of the dog (it\u2019s looking cute on purpose, because it knows another permanent secretary is on the way out). This is win-win for Johnson \u2013 either we take his news at face value, and rejoice in it, or we scrutinise it for manipulative intent, becoming cynical ourselves in the process, normalising a culture of mistrust. I would prefer to be knitting a tiny hat. Yet there is a reason to balk at the new politics. The prime minister, present in Technicolor for this personal news, has been absent as a politician: invisible in the flood-hit areas; extremely late to, and so far nonsensical on, the matter of coronavirus. He was so conspicuously absent for nine days of last month, holed up in the foreign secretary\u2019s country retreat, that wild rumours started to circulate as to what he was doing (the weirdest being that he was writing another novel). Perhaps his supporters will use his baby announcement as the reason for that \u2013 ah, it all starts to make sense, he was decorating the nursery \u2013 but this too is extremely unusual, not just in politics but in any job, to take nine days of paternity leave before the child is even born. His pattern of behaviour, and the way in which it instructs us to treat him, is not as a politician or, indeed, a professional at all but as a TV celebrity. It would be absolutely typical for a Kardashian to say nothing of substance and save all transparency for personal announcements on Instagram and to favourable media; it would be typical for a Trump, or any other politician in the showbiz model. There is an implicit servility \u2013 there is nothing reciprocal in that relationship, ours is not to question but to behold. Unlike a royal baby there\u2019s no pomp, just an atmosphere of constructed jollity (they\u2019re celebrities, after all, not royals). It is unnerving, beyond anything else \u2013 and it is this televisual razzle-dazzle, rather than any baby, that is unprecedented in an incumbent prime minister. \u2022 Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist",

The home secretary received universal support from the Conservative MPs who intervened, as well as a glowing endorsement from <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister who was answering the UQ on behalf of the government. She is very safe for now - but perhaps not so safe a bit further down the line. Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Gove announced that there will be a Cabinet Office investigation into Patel.</strong> The allegation is that she breached <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/826920/August-2019-MINISTERIAL-CODE-FINAL-FORMATTED-2.pdf\">the ministerial code (pdf)</a>, which says in paragraph 1.2:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the ministerial code and will not be tolerated.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his foreword to the code Boris Johnson also says \u201cthere must be no bullying and no harassment\u201d, as well as \u201cno leaking\u201d. Unlike Mark Field, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/political-parties/conservative-party/news/104733/minister-mark-field-suspended-after\">who was suspended as a Foreign Office minister when he was under investigation last year</a>, Patel is not being suspended from her job while this inquiry is going on. Gove also said that it was important for the inquiry to conclude quickly and, although he said Alex Allan, the PM\u2019s independent adviser on ministerial standards, was available to help, Gove did not say Allan would lead the inquiry. All of those factors may favour Patel.</p> <p>But other aspects of the announcement bode less well for the home secretary. If Allan is not in charge, the inquiry may be led by Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, who will have read a lot of stories over the weekend saying that he has not done enough to protect civil servants. Johnson did not have to order this inquiry; he could have just stuck to the line deployed at this morning\u2019s lobby briefing, which was that Sir Philip Rutnam is suing the government for constructive dismissal and that that tribunal case takes precedence. Gove also confirmed that the Cabinet Office inquiry will consider allegations made against Patel not just during her time as home secretary, but also during her time as international development secretary and and as an employment minister. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/02/brexit-uk-sets-out-its-ambitions-for-trade-deal-with-us-while-refusing-to-back-trumps-claim-of-massive-potential-benefits-live-news?page=with:block-5e5d2e1b8f0811db2fb022a1#block-5e5d2e1b8f0811db2fb022a1\"> 4.03pm.)</a> And the Cabinet Office inquiry will presumably have to take evidence from Rutnam who, on the basis of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/philip-rutnam-resignation-his-full-statement\">his resignation statement</a>, may be a powerful witness. Ultimately it is for the PM to decide if a ministerial is in breach of the ministerial code, and more often than not ministers who are in favour with No 10 tend to get exonerated, but it is by no means automatic that Patel will be cleared.</p> <p>However, a key factor may be the fact that ...</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tory MPs rallied firmly to the support of Patel, praising her for implementing the party\u2019s manifesto commitments and portraying her as a victim of sexism rather than a perpetrator of bullying.</strong> Many MPs said she was right to take on the establishment. For example, <strong>Julian Lewis</strong> asked:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>How ... Margaret Thatcher would have got on if she has been subjected to the same smears and sexism as have been used against the present Iron Lady in the Home Office?</p> </blockquote> <p>Those MPs most vocal in their support for Patel were people who, like her, were prominent in the pro-Brexit campaign in 2016, but Patel also received strong backing from MPs elected in 2019. During the exchanges almost the only Conservative who spoke up for civil servants was Gove, who as Cabinet Office minister is responsible for the civil service. He made it clear that he agreed with colleagues who were siding with Patel - at one point he implied she was similar to the great Labour cabinet minister Denis Healey, whom he described as no \u201cshrinking violet\u201d (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/02/brexit-uk-sets-out-its-ambitions-for-trade-deal-with-us-while-refusing-to-back-trumps-claim-of-massive-potential-benefits-live-news?page=with:block-5e5d2d828f0811db2fb02290#block-5e5d2d828f0811db2fb02290\">4.01pm)</a> - but Gove also made a point of stressing how much he valued the work of civil servants too.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson\u2019s administration of being \u201ca government led by bullies, presided over by a part-time prime minister\u201d.</strong> In his response to Gove, Corbyn said the Cabinet Office inquiry did not go far enough. An external lawyer should be involved, he said. He also complained that Johnson was not in the Commons to respond to the UQ himself. He concluded saying:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Isn\u2019t the truth, Mr Speaker that this is a government led by bullies, presided over by a part-time prime minister who not only can\u2019t be bothered to turn up but simply won\u2019t take the vital action required when the very integrity and credibility of the government is on the line.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T17:16:25.498Z\">at 5.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5d31628f08e1332474dc5a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T16:18:11.871Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Andrew Griffith,</strong> a Conservative, says if Patel had asked her civil servants to release more prisoners early, or let more migrants enter the country, her officials would not have been briefing against her.</p> <p>And that\u2019s it.

While some of the language on the NHS and food standards sounds very nice, in fact this trade deal will allow US multinationals to challenge and change our regulations, potentially even creating a corporate court to allow US multinationals to sue the British government in a secretive parallel legal process. </p> <p>What\u2019s more, the objectives aren\u2019t based in reality \u2013 it is not at all clear why the US would offer Britain greater access to its food markets without meeting the US\u2019s own core demands around food and medicines. This will not end well, and the fact the government is risking our standards for a mere 0.07%-0.16% of GDP is astonishing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5d1c6e8f0811db2fb02168\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T14:48:29.271Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fa33a36709eb319ab5b2aaec91c0c0fa042c7cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fa33a36709eb319ab5b2aaec91c0c0fa042c7cb/0_96_3441_2065/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, and Sir Tim Barrow, the UK ambassador to the EU, arriving in Brussels today for trade talks with the EU.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, and Sir Tim Barrow, the UK ambassador to the EU, arriving in Brussels today for trade talks with the EU.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5d12ed8f0811db2fb02123\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-02T14:45:58.767Z\">2.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It could be \u201cmonths rather than weeks\u201d before the coronavirus outbreak in the UK peaks, government sources indicated.

Today the UK starts trade talks with the EU, and the negotiations will take place with Boris Johnson\u2019s government saying it is willing to abandon the process, and revert to planning for a WTO \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/27/uk-says-it-will-consider-walking-away-from-brexit-talks-in-june\">if it is not making enough progress by June. </a>The government will be negotiating a trade deal with the US at the same time, and this morning, ahead of the publication of its negotiating objectives,<strong> Liz Truss,</strong> the international trade secretary, said the UK would be willing to walk away from these talks too if Washington is not prepared to accept UK red lines on food safety standards. In an interview with the BBC she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can absolutely guarantee that in a trade deal with the US we will not diminish our food safety standards, and we will also not put the NHS on the table, or the price the NHS pays for drugs on the table. Those are two very clear red lines in our trade deal.</p> <p>But I would also point out that there are huge potential benefits for all parts of Britain from a trade deal with the US.

The red lines that she set out are ones that the government has maintained for some time (and quite what \u2018maintaining food safety standards\u2019 means remains, of course, to be seen).</p> <p>What is perhaps more significant is how the UK\u2019s assessment of how much might be gained from a trade deal is at odds with President Trump\u2019s. In September last year, <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/donald-trump-brexit-trade-deal-latest-quadruple-pledge-636894\">at a meeting with Johnson in New York</a>, Trump said: \u201cWe can quadruple out trade with the UK [by negotiating a trade deal].\u201d And a month later he told LBC, <a href=\"https://spectator.us/full-text-nigel-farage-interviews-donald-trump/\">in his interview with Nigel Farage</a>, that with a trade deal \u201cwe can do many times of numbers that we\u2019re doing right now\u201d.</p> <p>But the Department for International Trade is now saying that it estimates that <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/liz-truss-kick-starts-uk-us-trade-talks?utm_source=30ab36bc-7e2b-4a87-b8b6-2dba0dfd8498&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_content=immediate\">a trade deal will \u201cincrease transatlantic trade flows by \u00a315.3bn\u201d.</a> That is not insignificant, but <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/868378/200227_UK_trade_in_Numbers_full_web_version_final.pdf\">the department\u2019s own figures (pdf)</a> put the value of total trade with the US at \u00a3200bn.

      "bodyText": "The Cabinet Office is to launch an inquiry into explosive claims that Priti Patel lied and bullied officials in several government departments, Michael Gove has told MPs. See 5.11pm for an analysis of how serious this is for Patel. An overwhelming majority of doctors fear the NHS is not well prepared to deal with a major outbreak of coronavirus, a survey has found. There is full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak on our separate live blog. Labour has called for all workers who have to self-isolate to be guaranteed paid sick leave or sick pay from day one, as part of a five-point plan for dealing with coronavirus. The Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy has also been making the same argument. The British economy would be at most 0.16% larger by the middle of the next decade under a comprehensive trade deal with the US, the government has admitted, laying bare the limited benefits from striking an agreement with Donald Trump. David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, has met Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, at the formal start of EU-UK trade talks. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here are the main points from the Priti Patel urgent question. The home secretary received universal support from the Conservative MPs who intervened, as well as a glowing endorsement from Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who was answering the UQ on behalf of the government. She is very safe for now - but perhaps not so safe a bit further down the line. Here are the main points. Gove announced that there will be a Cabinet Office investigation into Patel. The allegation is that she breached the ministerial code (pdf), which says in paragraph 1.2: Harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour wherever it takes place is not consistent with the ministerial code and will not be tolerated. In his foreword to the code Boris Johnson also says \u201cthere must be no bullying and no harassment\u201d, as well as \u201cno leaking\u201d. Unlike Mark Field, who was suspended as a Foreign Office minister when he was under investigation last year, Patel is not being suspended from her job while this inquiry is going on. Gove also said that it was important for the inquiry to conclude quickly and, although he said Alex Allan, the PM\u2019s independent adviser on ministerial standards, was available to help, Gove did not say Allan would lead the inquiry. All of those factors may favour Patel. But other aspects of the announcement bode less well for the home secretary. If Allan is not in charge, the inquiry may be led by Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, who will have read a lot of stories over the weekend saying that he has not done enough to protect civil servants. Johnson did not have to order this inquiry; he could have just stuck to the line deployed at this morning\u2019s lobby briefing, which was that Sir Philip Rutnam is suing the government for constructive dismissal and that that tribunal case takes precedence. Gove also confirmed that the Cabinet Office inquiry will consider allegations made against Patel not just during her time as home secretary, but also during her time as international development secretary and and as an employment minister. (See 4.03pm.) And the Cabinet Office inquiry will presumably have to take evidence from Rutnam who, on the basis of his resignation statement, may be a powerful witness. Ultimately it is for the PM to decide if a ministerial is in breach of the ministerial code, and more often than not ministers who are in favour with No 10 tend to get exonerated, but it is by no means automatic that Patel will be cleared. However, a key factor may be the fact that ... Tory MPs rallied firmly to the support of Patel, praising her for implementing the party\u2019s manifesto commitments and portraying her as a victim of sexism rather than a perpetrator of bullying. Many MPs said she was right to take on the establishment. For example, Julian Lewis asked: How ... Margaret Thatcher would have got on if she has been subjected to the same smears and sexism as have been used against the present Iron Lady in the Home Office? Those MPs most vocal in their support for Patel were people who, like her, were prominent in the pro-Brexit campaign in 2016, but Patel also received strong backing from MPs elected in 2019. During the exchanges almost the only Conservative who spoke up for civil servants was Gove, who as Cabinet Office minister is responsible for the civil service. He made it clear that he agreed with colleagues who were siding with Patel - at one point he implied she was similar to the great Labour cabinet minister Denis Healey, whom he described as no \u201cshrinking violet\u201d (see 4.01pm) - but Gove also made a point of stressing how much he valued the work of civil servants too. Jeremy Corbyn accused Boris Johnson\u2019s administration of being \u201ca government led by bullies, presided over by a part-time prime minister\u201d. In his response to Gove, Corbyn said the Cabinet Office inquiry did not go far enough. An external lawyer should be involved, he said. He also complained that Johnson was not in the Commons to respond to the UQ himself. He concluded saying: Isn\u2019t the truth, Mr Speaker that this is a government led by bullies, presided over by a part-time prime minister who not only can\u2019t be bothered to turn up but simply won\u2019t take the vital action required when the very integrity and credibility of the government is on the line. Andrew Griffith, a Conservative, says if Patel had asked her civil servants to release more prisoners early, or let more migrants enter the country, her officials would not have been briefing against her. And that\u2019s it. The Priti Patel UQ is over. I will post a summary soon. Gove says he was consistently impressed by the energy and dedication shown by civil servants last year preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit. But now Brexit has been done, he claims. Tim Loughton, a Conservative, says it is surprising that Labour has decided to prioritise this, when the country is also facing coronavirus and flooding. And he says Labour was silent in the face of \u201cindustrial-scale\u201d bullying from the Speaker\u2019s chair (by John Berow, he is implying). Rob Butler, a Conservative, asks what the government will do to ensure civil servants are accountable and are held to be accountable. Gove says ministers are accountable for what their departments do. But the government also wants to ensure that civil servants get the help they need to deliver. Dehenna Davison, a Conservative, says this issue should not be allowed to distract the government from delivering on its manifesto commitments. Richard Fuller, a Conservative, says ministers have the right to expect a basic level of competence from their civil servants. Adam Afriyie, a Conservative, asks if there will be an investigation into the leaks against the home secretary. Gove says leaks like this \u201care to be deprecated\u201d. Mark Fletcher, a Conservative, says there seems to be a pattern involving the appointment of female home secretaries and vicious briefing against them. Is it the case that men don\u2019t like taking orders from women? Gove says Fletcher is making an important point. He says the UK has had four powerful and effective women in this role: Jacqui Smith, Theresa May, Amber Rudd and Priti Patel. Richard Drax, a Conservative, says he hopes the investigation will be concluded quickly. Gove says it is \u201cvital\u201d that it is carried out as quickly as possible. Asked about Dominic Cummings\u2019 plans to dismantle the civil service, Gove says he is \u201cnot aware\u201d of any such plan. Labour\u2019s Sarah Jones says Philip Rutnam\u2019s resignation was unprecedented. And she says there is a pattern here; the government is endlessly picking fights. Gove rejects that claim. Far from being \u201cpugilistic\u201d, the government is concentrating on delivering its manifesto commitments, he says. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn asks if there were any complaints about Priti Patel when she was international development secretary and, before that, an employment minister. Gove says the Cabinet Office inquiry will consider all complaints against Patel. The Labour MP Stephanie Peacock asks what was the value of the pay-off offered to Sir Philip Rutnam. Gove says it would be inappropriate to say given that Rutnam is suing the government. Martin Vickers, a Conservative, says robust exchanges are often described as bullying these days. Gove says Vickers has a point. He says no one would have accused Denis Healey of being a \u201cshrinking violet\u201d. But it is also important to ensure people are shown respect in the workplace. The Conservative MP Alicia Kearns says she used to work as a civil servant in three government departments. On the day after the Brexit referendum she was told by multiple people in the Foreign Office that the public had got it wrong, she says. Labour\u2019s Dame Diana Johnson says this is supposed to the the honeymoon period for the government. But within three months it has lost a chancellor and the head of the Home Office, she says. Gove says different people enjoy different types of honeymoon. What matters is delivering the people\u2019s priorities. Owen Paterson, the Tory Brexiter and former cabinet minister, says the policies being pursued by Priti Patel were supported by voters. He says she is being victimised because she is implementing policies opposed by the establishment. The Tory MP Robert Halfon says Priti Patel is hiring 20,000 more police officers and creating a new immigration system. He says the allegations against her contain a \u201cnasty whiff of an establishment who are trying to stop these policies\u201d. Gove says Halfon is making a good point. This is what Michael Gove said in his opening statement about the Cabinet Office now investigation the Priti Patel allegations. He said: Allegations have been made that the home secretary has breached the ministerial code. The home secretary absolutely rejects these allegations. The prime minister has expressed his full confidence in her and having worked closely with the home secretary over a number of years, I have the highest regard for her - she is a superb minister doing a great job. This government always takes any complaints relating to the ministerial code seriously, and in line with the process set out in the ministerial code the prime minister has asked the Cabinet Office to establish the facts. As is usual, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, Sir Alex Allan, is available to provide advice to the prime minister. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says Priti Patel is an \u201cexcellent and dynamic home secretary\u201d. He says Corbyn failed to respond to allegations of bullying and antisemitism in the Labour party. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says in all her years as an MP and a minister she has never seen anything like Sir Philip Rutnam\u2019s resignation statement. He effectively called Priti Patel a liar. What will be done to protect civil servants from treatment like this? Gove says ministers must uphold the ministerial code. Ministers have benefited from candid advice from civil servants. He says he cannot comment further on the Rutnam case because Rutnam is taking legal action against the government. Sir Bill Cash, the Tory Brexiter, has just defended Priti Patel, saying civil servants must carry out the will of the people. He was the third Tory backbencher to do so. Earlier John Redwood said Patel should be allowed to get on with the job, and Julian Lewis said Patel was an \u201ciron lady\u201d like Margaret Thatcher, who was also a victim of sexism. Joanna Cherry, the SNP\u2019s home affairs spokesman, said Patel was responsible for creating a \u201chostile environment\u201d not outside the Home Office, but inside it. Jeremy Corbyn is responding. He says Boris Johnson should have come to the Commons himself to respond. He says the investigation announced by Gove is not enough. He says outside lawyers should be involved. He says he was alarmed by reports that Priti Patel told her civil servants to find a way of overturning a court judgment about an extradition case. He says this is a government \u201cled by bullies\u201d, and presided over by a part-time PM. Responding, Gove says the PM is in Downing Street leading the response to coronavirus. He is governing in the national interest. Gove says he is here because he is the minister in charge of the civil service. He pays tribute to the work of the civil service. He says the investigation will be robust. Every part of the ministerial code must be adhered to, he says. He says this government believes that ministers and civil servants must work together. He says Corbyn referred to media reports. But Corbyn of all people should know how important it is to be wary of what the media report. He says Patel is working to keep the country safe. That contrasts with what would have happened under Corbyn, he says. Jeremy Corbyn asks his urgent question. He ask the PM to make a statement on the allegations against Priti Patel, and whether he will order and investigation. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is responding. He says allegations have been made that Patel breached the ministerial code. The home secretary \u201cabsolutely rejects\u201d these allegations. He says he has the highest regard for her. She is a superb minister, he says. But he says the PM has asked the Cabinet Office to carry out an investigation to establish the facts. He says Alex Allan, the PM\u2019s independent adviser on ministerial standards, is available to help. Jeremy Corbyn is about to ask an urgent Commons question about Priti Patel, the home secretary, and the claim from Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office permanent secretary until he was effectively forced out last week, that Patel has bullied civil servants. Here is our story about Rutnam\u2019s resignation on Saturday. Here is the full text of Rutnam\u2019s resignation statement. And here are key extracts from the statement. Rutnam said: In the last 10 days I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign. It has been alleged that I have briefed the media against the home secretary. This, along with many other claims, is completely false. The home secretary categorically denied any involvement in this campaign to the Cabinet Office. I regret I do not believe her. She has not made the efforts I would expect to dissociate herself from the comments ... One of my duties as permanent secretary was to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our 35,000 people. This created tension with the home secretary, and I have encouraged her to change her behaviours. I have received allegations that her conduct has included shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands \u2013 behaviour that created fear and that needed some bravery to call out. And the Scottish government has also criticised Liz Truss\u2019s plans for a trade deal with the US. This is from Ivan McKee, the Scottish government\u2019s trade minister. We have repeatedly called for a proper and meaningful role in any trade arrangements and for the punitive US tariffs on Scottish products - whisky, food products and textiles - to be removed, but the UK government continues to recklessly pursue a US trade deal without effectively engaging with the Scottish government. This deal will fail by a large margin to compensate for the loss of full access to the single European market, and prioritising a deal with the US over the EU poses significant risk to Scotland\u2019s economy and jobs. Global Justice Now, which campaigns for social justice on a global basis, has criticised the government\u2019s plans for a trade deal with the US. This is from its director, Nick Dearden, commenting on the Department for International Trade\u2019s paper about its negotiating objectives published this morning. Dearden said: These objectives show that the government is living in cloud-cuckoo land. While some of the language on the NHS and food standards sounds very nice, in fact this trade deal will allow US multinationals to challenge and change our regulations, potentially even creating a corporate court to allow US multinationals to sue the British government in a secretive parallel legal process. What\u2019s more, the objectives aren\u2019t based in reality \u2013 it is not at all clear why the US would offer Britain greater access to its food markets without meeting the US\u2019s own core demands around food and medicines. This will not end well, and the fact the government is risking our standards for a mere 0.07%-0.16% of GDP is astonishing. It could be \u201cmonths rather than weeks\u201d before the coronavirus outbreak in the UK peaks, government sources indicated. As the Press Association reports, in a suggestion that extra emergency powers would not be required immediately, the source said: We don\u2019t want to have to take decisions before we have to. As much as possible we want people to carry on with their daily lives. Legislation allowing the government to use extra powers is expected to go through parliament by the end of the month, with experts indicating that is the earliest that it will be required, PA reports. Here are the main points from the Downing Street lobby briefing. Ministers have agreed a UK-wide action plan to tackle coronavirus that will be tackled tomorrow, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said. He said the plan would \u201cset out the steps which we have already taken, things which we could potentially consider in the event that this outbreak were to progress still further in the UK and also to set out the steps which the public could take in order to help contain this virus\u201d. The spokesman also confirmed that the government was considering emergency legislation, although he implied that details of this would not be in the document being published tomorrow. He said: There is a separate question of what legislative powers we may need to take going forward to make sure we can do everything possible to contain the virus and ensure people get the care and support they need. The spokesman suggested that next week\u2019s budget is being revised to make allowance for the coronavirus outbreak. He confirmed that it would go ahead, as scheduled, on Wednesday 11 March. Asked about the possible impact of coronavirus on its contents, he said: The government stands ready to use all levers at its disposal to ensure that we are as prepared as we can be. The chancellor and the prime minister are fully aware of the evolving situation. The spokesman signalled that the government no longer accepted the 2018 Treasury analysis saying that a Canada-style Brexit or a WTO \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit would be very damaging to the economy. Today the government has published an analysis saying a trade deal with the US could boost the economy by 0.16% at best, which would not come close to compensating for the harm caused by leaving the EU single market, according to the 2018 report. Asked about the 2018 figures, the spokesman said that they were published under another government and that they were controversial at the time. (See 1.06pm.) The government was seeking alternative views, he said. He went on: We set out last week that we want to throw open the question in relation to analysis of the future partnership with the EU to the wider analytical community to help inform the government and the country of the widest possible range of models, data and perspectives. He also defended the decision to publish an economic assessment of the impact of a trade deal with the US but not one with the EU, saying trade talks with the EU were starting from a different place. (See 1.02pm.) The spokesman refused to say whether Sir Philip Rutnam\u2019s claims about Priti Patel, the home secretary, bullying civil servants were true. The spokesman said the the government \u201ctreats any such allegation seriously\u201d but that, because Rutnam, the former permanent secretary, was suing the government for constructive dismissal, he could not comment further. In the clip for broadcasters recorded after this morning\u2019s meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee to discuss coronavirus, Boris Johnson said the spread of the coronavirus was \u201clikely\u201d to become \u201cmore significant\u201d for the UK in the coming days. He said: We have also agreed a plan so that if and when it starts to spread, as I\u2019m afraid it looks likely it will, we are in a position to take the steps necessary to contain the spread of the disease as far as we can, and to protect the most vulnerable. Johnson said closing schools and banning mass gatherings would only be taken upon scientific advice. He went on: The most important thing for people to understand is that [measures] will be guided by scientific advice. All four nations of the UK and the chief medical officers are involved in this and they will be helping us to take key decisions on when and how to take protective steps. We cannot forget that the single most useful thing that we can all do to support the NHS is to wash our hands, two times to Happy Birthday with hot water. It\u2019s very important that people should continue [doing] that and they should go about business as usual. This is from Guy Shrubsole, a Friends of the Earth campaigner. There are three urgent questions in the Commons this afternoon. Although Jeremy Corbyn is demanding a response from Boris Johnson himself about Priti Patel (the home secretary, who is accused of bullying civil servants in breach of hte ministerial code), it is very unlikely that he will get one. The government can decide which minister it wants to reply to an urgent question, and in this case it may well put up a junior Cabinet Office minister like Chloe Smith to respond to Corbyn. Urgent questions come before ministerial statements, and so the statement from Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, about the UK-US trade negotiations is unlikely to start before 5pm. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. I will post a summary soon. Q: Will the UK offer to host the Olympics if Japan can\u2019t? The spokesman says he is not aware of any discussion on that. Q: So you accept that the anticipated GDP gain from a trade deal with the US is less than the anticipated loss from leaving the single market? The spokesman says the government will be consulting later this year on the different views on the potential gains from a trade deal with the EU. He says the Treasury\u2019s 2018 analysis was \u201cconducted by another government\u201d. It was controversial, he says. Q: So you no longer accept it? The spokesman says that was an analysis conducted by a previous government. The government now wants to carry out an alternative analysis, he says. No 10 says government no longer accepts 2018 Treasury analysis of impact of Brexit. Q: Why has the government published an economic assessment of a trade deal with the US, but not one with the EU? The spokesman says with the US the UK is at a more typical start-point for a free trade agreement. He says the starting point for talks with the EU is different. And the talks will cover some aspects that go beyond a normal free trade agreement, he says. Q: Is the government committed to remaining party to the European convention on human rights? The spokesman says the government is a signatory. Q: Is it committed to remaining a signatory? There\u2019s no change in the UK\u2019s position, the spokesman says. Q: Back to coronavirus, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer has said up to 4% of the population could require hospital treatment. Was that the sort of figure discussed at the Cobra meeting. The spokesman says he did not hear that discussed. Q: Is this part of a wider campaign against some civil servants deemed unhelpful? The spokesman does not accept that. He says the PM stressed his admiration for the civil service in an interview yesterday. We are now changing the subject. Q: Will there be an inquiry into Priti Patel\u2019s behaviour? The spokesman says the government takes allegations of the kind made by Sir Philip Rutnam seriously. But because Rutnam is taking legal action, the spokesman says he cannot comment further. Q: Didn\u2019t the PM\u2019s comment about Priti Patel doing an excellent job prejudice any legal case? The spokesman does not accept that. Q: What evidence is there to show the government is taking this seriously? The spokesman says he cannot say any more. Q: It does not sound as if you are taking this seriously. The spokesman repeats the point about not being able to comment further. Q: How many people will be working in the \u201cwar room\u201d? The spokesman does not have those figures. Q: Will the military need to get involved? The spokesman says the government will take whatever steps are deemed helpful. Q: Can you tell us more about the \u201cwar room\u201d on coronavirus? The spokesman says there is a room in the Cabinet Office where health and communication officials from across the UK will be based. It will ensure that \u201cjoined-up messages\u201d go out to the public. The spokesman says we may get a Commons statement from the health secretary on the plan tomorrow. Regarding the government\u2019s plans for emergency legislation, the spokesman says the government wants to ensure it has the powers it needs when it needs them. Q: Do you know if Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has contracted coronavirus in prison in Iran? The spokesman says the government is urgently seeking an update about her condition. Q: Will the plan explain how emergency services will be sustained? The spokesman says it will be published tomorrow. Q: What worst case scenarios were discussed? The spokesman says he does not want to do that before the report is published. He says the public will need access to the best and clearest information. The spokesman says the chief medical officer is issuing updates whenever a new case is discovered. Q: Is emergency legislation necessary for the delay phase, or for the mitigation phase? The spokesman says it will cover all eventualities. Q: Should the public be prepared to accept a notable change in their daily lives? The spokesman says the government will take all reasonable steps. The plan will set out some changes that might need to happen. Q: What was the mood like at the Cobra meeting? The spokesman says he wants to emphasise that all parts of the UK are working together. The process of agreeing a plan was a smooth one, he says. Q: What will the government do to help low-income people who might have to give up work? The spokesman says the government is aware of the problems, and is willing to take \u201cfurther action if needed\u201d. Q: Currently people need a sick note from a GP to take sick leave. Would you encourage employers to waive those requirements? The spokesman says these issues are being considered. The government would back all \u201creasonable\u201d steps being taken. Q: Will this impact on the budget? The spokesman says the budget will go ahead as planned next week. But he suggests that allowance will be taken for the coronavirus outbreak. The spokesman says the chancellor and the Treasury have held discussions with the Bank of England about coronavirus. The bank put out a statement this morning, he says. The spokesman says the action plan will set out steps already taken, and steps that might be considered if the outbreak gets worse. It will also set out steps that members of the public might take. He says there is a separate issue as to what emergency legislation might be needed. The spokesman says the government wants to work with EU partners to address coronavirus. It is working closely with EU allies, for example on repatriation flights, the spokesman says. Q: Can you give us a feel of what the plan will say? There is a feeling it has been behind the curve. The spokesman says he does not accept that the government has been behind the curve. Q: Yesterday Matt Hancock talked about the possible need for cities to be put on lock-down. Were those plans discussed? The spokesman says the government will be guided by advice. The top priority is to keep the public safe, while minimising the economic consequences. Q: What is the PM doing to reduce the spread? The PM is washing his hands regularly. Q: Has he cut down on shaking hands? The PM is following medical advice, and that is to wash hands regularly, for 20 seconds. Q: Where the devolved leaders dialled in or screened in? The spokesman says he was not in the room, so he cannot be sure. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman is here. He starts by setting out the PM\u2019s day. He has just chaired a Cobra meeting on coronavirus, and done a clip for broadcasters. Later he will be hosting a World Cup day reception in No 10. Liz Truss has published negotiating objectives for the UK-US trade talks, he says. There will be a statement in the Commons this afternoon. In Brussels the first round of negotiations with the EU starts at 1pm UK time. It will start with a meeting between David Frost, the PM\u2019s Europe adviser, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, which is due to last an hour. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is holding talks in Oman. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has confirmed that the government has taken over rail services on the Northern network. The spokesman is now taking questions. Q: What happened at the Cobra meeting? The spokesman says the PM has set that out in his clip for broadcasters. A UK-wide action plan for coronavirus was agreed. It will be published tomorrow, the spokesman says. He says the devolved administrations were represented via conference call. Q: Why was Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, not there. Today was about setting out a national response, the spokesman says. The spokesman says the plan will be published. Reporters will be properly briefed on it, he says. Q: What sort of imput did the devolved administrations have? Are there differences in the different parts of the UK? It is as single plan for the UK, the spokesman says. I\u2019m at Downing Street for the regular morning lobby briefing. It is due to start at 12.15pm. Under the current system the embargo on the meeting tends to be lifted soon after it has started, so I hope to start posting soon afterwards. David Henig, the trade expert and former civil servant who now runs the UK Trade Policy Project, thinks the government\u2019s document on a UK-US trade deal will make it harder for the UK to resist the EU\u2019s level playing field demands in the UK-EU talks. He is referring in particular to this passage in the UK document. It says the deal should: Ensure parties reaffirm their commitment to international standards on the environment and labour. Ensure parties do not waive or fail to enforce their domestic environmental or labour protections in ways that create an artificial competitive advantage. Include measures which allow the UK to maintain the integrity, and provide meaningful protection, of the UK\u2019s world-leading environmental and labour standards. Secure provisions that support and help further the government\u2019s ambition on climate change and achieving Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050, including promoting trade in low carbon goods and services, supporting research and development collaboration and maintaining both parties\u2019 right to regulate in pursuit of decarbonisation. Apply appropriate mechanisms for the implementation, monitoring and dispute resolution of environmental and labour provisions. And this is from the FT\u2019s George Parker. Parker is referring the Treasury analysis (pdf) published at the end of 2018 saying that over the long term a no-deal Brexit, or WTO Brexit, could reduce GDP by 7.6%, and that a Canada-style deal could reduce GDP by 4.9%. These are from the Telegraph\u2019s James Crisp. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, is making a Commons statement later on the UK-US trade talks. The Labour whips think there is still a chance of getting a statement on coronavirus too. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international development secretary and Brexiter, has a more positive take on the potential gains from a UK-US trade deal. Here is the Labour MP David Lammy on the government\u2019s assessment of the economic benefits of a UK-US trade deal. And here is the chart from the document summarising the potential economic benefits from a trade deal. Even under the best trade deal (scenario 2 - see 11.12am), workers would only see pay go up by 0.2%. Here is a chart from the DIT report showing the regional impact of a UK-US trade deal, under two possible scenarios. Scenario 1 would involve a substantial tariff liberalisation, while scenario 2 would involve a more extensive trade deal, with full tariff liberalisation. This is from Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former trade negotiator who runs the ExplainTrade consultancy, on a UK-US trade deal. The Department for International Trade paper on negotiating objectives for a UK-US trade deal is here (pdf), on the DIT\u2019s website. It runs to 184 pages, and includes the results of the government\u2019s consultation on this topic. This is what the DIT document says about food standards. Now we have left the EU, the UK will decide how we set and maintain our own standards and regulations and we have been clear that we will not compromise on our high standards of food safety and animal welfare. The UK\u2019s reputation for high quality food and agricultural products is recognised internationally and underpins our exports of these products. Any trade agreement with the US must work for UK consumers, farmers and companies and the government will strongly defend our right to regulate in these areas in the public interest. The government\u2019s manifesto has made it clear that \u2018in all of our trade negotiations, we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u2019. The UK\u2019s independent food regulators will continue to ensure that all food imports into the UK comply with those high standards. Without exception, imports into the UK will meet our stringent food safety standards - all food imports into the UK must be safe and this will not change in any future agreement. In line with responses from business, we recognise the opportunities through a trade agreement to streamline procedures for UK food exports into the US. And this is what the US said about its goals relating to food standards in its own document (pdf) about its negotiating objectives for a trade deal published last year. It said a deal should: Provide for enforceable and robust SPS obligations that build upon World Trade Organization (WTO) rights and obligations, including with respect to science-based measures, good regulatory practice, import checks, equivalence, regionalization, certification, and risk analysis, making clear that each Party can set for itself the level of protection it believes to be appropriate to protect food safety and plant and animal health in a manner consistent with its international obligations. Establish a mechanism to remove expeditiously unwarranted barriers that block the export of U.S. food and agricultural products in order to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access. The Department for International Trade still has not published its paper on the negotiating position for the UK-US trade talks. But the document has been published here, on the Guido Fawkes website. The EU is urging Britain to drop the \u201cpolitical rhetoric\u201d around Brexit as historic talks on the future trading relationship open in Brussels, my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports. Here is Jonathan Portes, a former government economist and professor of economics at Kings College London, on the Department for International Trade\u2019s estimate of the benefits of a UK-US trade deal. This is from Sam Lowe, a trade expert at the Centre for European Reform. He has seen the Department for International Trade\u2019s report on its negotiating objectives for a trade deal with the US, which is not on the DIT website yet but which is due out imminently. Two Scottish National party veterans closely associated with Alex Salmond\u2019s leadership, Mike Russell and Stewart Stevenson, have announced they will retire before next year Holyrood elections. In the latest of a series of retirement announcements by MSPS, Russell, currently Brexit secretary in Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s government, and Stevenson said on Sunday they were stepping down as MSPs on age grounds, and to make way for younger candidates. Their announcements signal a generational shift within the SNP. Russell\u2019s first senior post within the party was to serve as chief executive under Salmond from 1994, where he helped shape the SNP\u2019s 1999 Scottish parliament election campaign. He had served as Salmond\u2019s campaign manager in his first leadership bid in 1990. Russell, 66, competed against Salmond for the leadership in 2004, but after Salmond became first minister in the 2007 Holyrood election by a wafer-thin one seat margin was given the first in a series of ministerial positions, at environment. After losing his post as education secretary in Sturgeon\u2019s first reshuffle as leader after she replaced Salmond as first minister in November 2014, she brought him back in as her blunt and combative Brexit secretary in August 2016. Stevenson, 74, is regarded as one of Salmond\u2019s few close friends within the party. He first entered the Scottish parliament in 2001 after Salmond quit as an MSP following his resignation as leader in 2000, taking over Salmond\u2019s seat in Banff and Buchan in the ensuing byelection. (Salmond remained at Westminster, as MP for Banff and Buchan.) Regularly cited as the parliament\u2019s most prolific speaker as a backbencher, Stevenson remains the only SNP minister to have resigned voluntarily on principle since the party first won power at Holyrood in 2007. He quit as transport minister in December 2010 after he described the authorities\u2019 response to blizzards and deep snow, which left thousands of motorists stranded overnight, as \u201cfirst class\u201d and initially refused to apologise. Four other SNP MSPs - James Dornan, Gail Ross, Bruce Crawford and Richard Lyall - have also said they will stand down next year. Boris Johnson will be chairing a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee later to consider the next steps needed to tackle the coronavirus crisis. According to the government\u2019s press release, the committee will \u201cdiscuss, finalise and sign off a battle plan containing a detailed set of countermeasures\u201d. In a statement ahead of the meeting Johnson said: The number of coronavirus cases around the world is rising every day - and the UK is no exception. There now seems little doubt that it will present a significant challenge for our country. But we are well prepared, and the government and the NHS will stop at nothing to fight this virus. This battle plan lays out in detail the measures we could use - if and when they are needed. There is full coverage of the coronavirus crisis on our separate live blog. You can read it here. Good morning. Today the UK starts trade talks with the EU, and the negotiations will take place with Boris Johnson\u2019s government saying it is willing to abandon the process, and revert to planning for a WTO \u201cno deal\u201d Brexit, if it is not making enough progress by June. The government will be negotiating a trade deal with the US at the same time, and this morning, ahead of the publication of its negotiating objectives, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, said the UK would be willing to walk away from these talks too if Washington is not prepared to accept UK red lines on food safety standards. In an interview with the BBC she said: I can absolutely guarantee that in a trade deal with the US we will not diminish our food safety standards, and we will also not put the NHS on the table, or the price the NHS pays for drugs on the table. Those are two very clear red lines in our trade deal. But I would also point out that there are huge potential benefits for all parts of Britain from a trade deal with the US. Our economic study shows a potential \u00a315bn benefit for trade ... and every single part of the country stands to benefit, with particularly the Midlands, the north east and Scotland likely to benefit the most. So there are big opportunities there. But if we don\u2019t get the deal we want, we will be prepared to walk away, and that includes the red lines of food standards and the national health service. Truss\u2019s stance is not particularly surprising. The red lines that she set out are ones that the government has maintained for some time (and quite what \u2018maintaining food safety standards\u2019 means remains, of course, to be seen). What is perhaps more significant is how the UK\u2019s assessment of how much might be gained from a trade deal is at odds with President Trump\u2019s. In September last year, at a meeting with Johnson in New York, Trump said: \u201cWe can quadruple out trade with the UK [by negotiating a trade deal].\u201d And a month later he told LBC, in his interview with Nigel Farage, that with a trade deal \u201cwe can do many times of numbers that we\u2019re doing right now\u201d. But the Department for International Trade is now saying that it estimates that a trade deal will \u201cincrease transatlantic trade flows by \u00a315.3bn\u201d. That is not insignificant, but the department\u2019s own figures (pdf) put the value of total trade with the US at \u00a3200bn. That means a trade deal would increase the value of UK-US trade not by 400%, as Trump claimed, but by 7.5%. And, as the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam points out, the impact on UK GDP would be worth about 0.2%. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, publishes the government\u2019s negotiating mandate for trade talks with the US. 10.30am: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee to consider the next steps needed to tackle the coronavirus crisis. 12.15pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. Afternoon: British officials start trade talks with their EU counterparts in Brussels. 3.30pm: Urgent questions and ministerial statements in the Commons. We will find out later if any have been scheduled, but it is possible that coronavirus or the departure of the Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam could come up. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

But Mikey just hadn\u2019t been able to resist making trouble for her. Now all sorts of other allegations would inevitably tumble out of the cupboard and she was living on borrowed time. Her job was no longer nearly as safe as she had imagined.

He contented himself with asking why the prime minister hadn\u2019t appeared in person to answer questions on the conduct of one of his ministers and if Patel had made illegal demands of her own officials. He ended by calling for her dismissal. Gove shook his head but his eyes sparkled. There\u2019s nothing he would like more. It was nothing personal between him and Patel.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Several of the big food retailers reported signs of panic buying.

Next week\u2019s budget will be redrawn to focus on shoring up the economy against the impact of coronavirus, the Treasury confirmed. British Airways and Ryanair cancelled hundreds of flights between Heathrow and parts of Italy, France, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Switzerland as well as New York\u2019s JFK airport. The Scottish government said up to 250,000 Scots could be hospitalised under a worst-case scenario. The level of risk of contracting coronavirus within Europe was raised to \u201cmoderate to high\u201d as deaths in Italy jumped from 18 to 52 and the outbreak reached more than 60 countries worldwide. Further details emerged of emergency legislation the government intends to introduce, including plans to empower it to curtail public events and draw up no-go areas.

It said: \u201cMore people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders.\u201d Members of the department for environment, food and rural affairs\u2019 Food Chain Emergency Liaison Group is expected to meet this week to discuss how to limit the impact of coronavirus. The group links key food and drink firms and the National Farmers\u2019 Union with government departments to deal with any potential disruption to food supplies, such as that which could have followed a no deal Brexit last year. Defra said in a statement that the group \u201ccan be convened in the event of an emergency response situation, linking together the food industry and central government civil contingencies activity to swiftly mitigate any issues and ensure a healthy and varied supply of food\u201d. Consumers have also been stocking up with frozen food, according to supermarket Iceland.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s my colleague Rob Davies on today\u2019s market drama: The world\u2019s economic powerhouses launched a coordinated push to show they can cope with the fallout from coronavirus, after the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) warned global growth could be cut in half. Governments, central banks and international economic institutions agreed on Monday to do whatever it takes to prevent economic meltdown, prompting signs of recovery on stock markets still reeling from their worst week since the financial crisis of 2008. Goodnight! GW US warehouse-club retailer Costco was one of the big winners on Wall Street today. Costco shares surged by 10% today, following reports of long queues and empty shelves as customers stocked up on groceries. Apple also has a strong day, leaping by 9.3% on hopes that it can put its Chinese supply chain problems behind it. A late development: ECB chief Christine Lagarde has released a statement, saying the ECB \u2018stands ready\u2019 to help. Echoing similar sentiment from the Bank of England today, it says: The coronavirus outbreak is a fast developing situation, which creates risks for the economic outlook and the functioning of financial markets. The ECB is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economy, medium-term inflation and the transmission of our monetary policy. We stand ready to take appropriate and targeted measures, as necessary and commensurate with the underlying risks. This is the Dow\u2019s strongest daily surge since March 2009, according to the WSJ\u2019s Akane Otani. CNBC agrees. That was back in the depths of the recession after the financial crisis. BOOM! US stocks have surged sharply higher tonight, as speculations swirls of coordinated intervention to prop up economic growth. The Dow Jones industrial average has leapt by 1,293 points, its biggest-ever points gain. That\u2019s quite a turnaround, after posting its biggest points loss on Thursday. In percentage terms, that\u2019s a 5.1% gain -- a very strong day (not a record though!). It brings some relief to investors after last week\u2019s 12.4% slump. The S&amp;P 500 index also snapped a seven-day losing run, by surging 4.6% or 136 points to 3,090. The rally comes despite the news that Washington state has seen six deaths from coronavirus, as new cases were reported across the US. There are now about 75 confirmed cases in the US. Clearly traders are hoping for progress towards coordinated action tomorrow when central bankers and finance chiefs meet. They\u2019ve also noted the pressure from the White House for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, perhaps even at an unscheduled decision (rather than waiting for their meeting in two weeks). Is it time to buy the dip. Or, to be blunt, have you missed out by sitting on the sidelines today? Economist and investor Mohamed El-Erian reckons long-term investors should resist looking for bargains just yet. El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz, says highly tactical traders could make some short-term profits in the current market. But if you\u2019re buying for the long term, hold on. He told CNBC that economic fundamentals will worsen as the crisis grinds on: I think the policies and fundamentals are going to go in favor of bad fundamentals, unfortunately, initially,\u201d he said. The S&amp;P 500 is also romping higher in late trading. Shares are pushing higher in New York in late trading, sending the Dow up by over 4%. That\u2019s a sizzling 1,046 point gain -- which would make up for one of last week\u2019s quadruple-digit losses. Economist Tony Yates has written about the economic risks of coronavirus, and the limited powers central banks have to fight it. Here\u2019s a flavour: A widespread halt in economic activity could cause insolvencies and defaults on bank loans, putting the viability of banks in question, and spreading financial disruption even further. The financial crisis of 2008 started out as a moderate-sized and localised default on US sub-prime mortgages. Other countries became infected because banks elsewhere were exposed to those loans, to a highly uncertain degree initially, and other institutions were exposed to those banks, and so on. With less than two hours trading left today, Wall Street is still rallying - up over 2.5%. The White House appears to be putting more pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates ASAP. This is from Bloomberg\u2019s Saleha Mohsin: Reuters are reporting that G7 finance ministers will hold their coronavirus teleconference call at noon UK time on Tuesday. Time for a recap Hopes of a global fightback against the economic damage caused by the coronavirus has lifted markets today, on another very volatile session. Stocks in London have recovered a little ground after their worst week since 2008, with the FTSE 100 gaining 1%. Supermarkets and drugs companies jumped, while airlines slumped. In New York, Wall Street traders are piling into stocks - pushing the Dow up by 737 points or 2.9%. The rally comes amid signs that policymakers are preparing to act. G7 finance ministers are reportedly planning a call tomorrow, with France\u2019s Brune Le Maire already predicting a co-ordinated response. The World Bank and the IMF said they would offer \u201cemergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance\u201d to countries struggling with the impact on their economics. Overnight, the Bank of Japan pledged to increase liquidity, and take other steps as necessary. This pushed the Nikkei up by 1%, and China\u2019s stock market by 3%. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank have both also promised to use their tools where possible, although were low on detail. Investors are anticipating interest rate cuts this year -- especially in America, where the Federal Reserve has more ammunition. Donald Trump criticised the Fed (again) for not moving faster. There are growing signs that Western companies are suffering from the factory shutdowns in China. Manufacturers in the UK, the eurozone and the US have all reported longer delays for parts and raw materials. Airlines are urging regulators to suspend rules which force them to operate flights or lose their landing slots. Ryanair announced plans to cut its routes in and out of Italy by 25% for three weeks, while British Airways is trimming flights to the US. UK supermarkets are bracing for a surge in stockpiling too: Fears of a global recession mounted, after the OECD slashed its growth forecasts this morning. It predicted growth of just 2.4% in 2020, down from 2.9% previously. But in a worst-case scenario, growth could be just 1.5%. EU commissioner Paolo Gentiloni warned that Europe\u2019s economy might not bounce back from the disruption. Jack Welsh is looking down on the New York stock exchange, after the former GE titan\u2019s death was announced today. Analysts at Berenberg bank has predicted that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its meeting later this month - perhaps by more than expected. But they also caution that lower interest rates will have a limited impact (despite Donald Trump\u2019s urging today). They write: The Fed is now expected to cut the target for the Federal funds rate by 25bp to 1.25-1.50% at its March 17-18 FOMC meeting, but we would not be surprised if the Fed decided to do a larger 50bp cut. While a rate cut could pacify financial markets, we expect its impact on the real economy will be muted. Monetary easing cannot fix supply-side shocks, especially with monetary policy already easy and bond yields at historic lows. Wall Street\u2019s most famous face is worried about the financial crisis, reports our US business editor Dominic Rushe: Peter Tuchman, the trader whose Einstein-esque features are the most photographed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), hasn\u2019t witnessed a sell-off as bad as this since the 2008 financial crisis. And he thinks it is going to get worse. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear here. A lot of confusion,\u201d Tuchman said at the end of a week when investor panic over the likely impact of the coronavirus had triggered the worst sell-off in US stock markets for a dozen years.... Tuchman isn\u2019t impressed by the White House\u2019s response either: \u201cI don\u2019t think our administration here has positioned or prepared itself correctly,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors are not stupid. They don\u2019t like to be played and they don\u2019t wait for the president of the United States to go: \u2018Nothing to see here. Keep walking.\u2019\u201d Here\u2019s Dom\u2019s full piece: A former top executive at Tesco has given a fascinating insight into how supermarkets will be preparing for panic buying and mass stockpiling. My colleagues Zoe Wood and Jasper Jolly explain: British supermarkets are preparing for stockpiling and panic buying by consumers if the coronavirus outbreak worsens in the UK \u2013 but analysts and retailers said the sector was prepared to handle major disruption. A major outbreak could result in \u201cpanic buying, empty shelves and food riots\u201d, according to a research note by Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at the investment firm Alliance Bernstein. Monteyne was previously a supply chain director at Tesco. However, he added that retailers have \u201cready-made plans\u201d to deal with disruption and move to \u201cfeed-the-nation\u201d status. \u201cThe industry has plans to deal with this,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, it will be chaotic (and expect pictures of empty shelves) but the industry will reduce complexity to keep the country fed.\u201d Monteyne\u2019s note said Tesco, the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chain, has practised multiday simulation exercises, including mocked-up news coverage and different teams preparing responses to a flu pandemic . He said supermarkets and their suppliers would work together to agree \u201ca major reduction in ranges\u201d so that suppliers can run their plants more efficiently. He added: \u201cWe would expect them to be drawing up lists right now of which products will be prioritised.\u201d He said he did not expect prices to rise because \u201cfood retailers cannot be seen to be profiteering at a moment of crisis\u201d. However, he warned the disruption could cost the sector \u00a31.2bn in lost profits. Bernstein\u2019s note has already been noted by investors, who sent shares in Ocado (+5.2%), Morrisons (+5.1%) and Sainsbury (+4.3%) up today. Newsflash: British Airways has announced it is cutting flights to the US, in response to lower demand for trans-Atlantic flights. Add in Ryanair\u2019s cancelled flights to Italy earlier today (and a similar move by easyJet last week) and it\u2019s clear that a lot of capacity is being taken out of the industry right now. Wall Street is pushing higher, on hopes of co-ordinated action between the world\u2019s policymakers soon. Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&amp;P 500 are up over 2%: European stock markets also shook off some of their losses in late trading. The Stoxx 600 index has closed 0.1% higher. It was lifted by gains in London and Paris, but dragged back by losses in Frankfurt and Milan (where the Italian FTSE MIB lost 1.5%). Newsflash: The UK stock market has closed over 1% higher, making a small dent in last week\u2019s whopping losses. The FTSE 100 finished the day up 74 points, or 1.1%, at 6654. Pharmaceutical stocks, energy companies, miners and utilities all had a good day, lifted by hopes of co-ordinated intervention by global policymakers. But consumer cyclical firms such as airlines and hotel groups fell, as did banks. Unfortunately for investors, this only recovers a tenth of last week\u2019s losses (the worst week since 2008). In another potentially significant move, G7 finance ministers are expected to hold a teleconference on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. They could consider what measures to take to prevent Covid-19 turning into a global pandemic - the big fear which triggered last week\u2019s slump. Earlier today, French finance minister Le Maire told France 2 television that he had already discussed the situation with the chair of the G7, Steve Mnuchin. Le Maire said: \u201cThere will be a concerted action. Yesterday I spoke with the G7 president, the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and this week we will have a meeting by phone of the finance G7 ministers to coordinate our responses.\u201d NEWSFLASH: the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have pledged to use all their tools to protect the global economy from the coronavirus. In a joint statement, Kristalina Georgieva and David Malpass said they will help companies hit by the economic damage caused by the virus \u201cThe IMF and the World Bank Group stand ready to help our member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by the COVID-19 virus. We are engaged actively with international institutions and country authorities, with special attention to poor countries where health systems are the weakest and people are most vulnerable. We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance. In particular, we have rapid financing facilities that, collectively, can help countries respond to a wide range of needs. The strengthening of country health surveillance and response systems is crucial to contain the spread of this and any future outbreaks. International cooperation is essential to deal with the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 virus. The IMF and the World Bank Group are fully committed to provide the support that people in our member countries expect from us. Budget airline Ryanair has reported it will cut its flights to Italy by 25%, responding to falling demand. Ryanair also reported that it has seen an increase in passengers not turning up for flights, particularly from and within Italy. Ryanair Group CEO, Michael O\u2019Leary said it is a sensible measure: \u201cOur focus at this time is on minimising any risk to our people and our passengers. While we are heavily booked over the next two weeks, there has been a notable drop in forward bookings towards the end of Mar, into early Apr. It makes sense to selectively prune our schedule to and from those airports where travel has been most affected by the Covid-19 outbreak. This is a time for calm. We will make sensible cuts to our schedules over the comings weeks to reflect weaker bookings, and changing travel patterns. All affected customers will be advised of any schedule changes at least 14 days in advance. While 80% of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild symptoms, the risk of infection can be significantly reduced by frequent hand washing with soap and water. Stock markets are pushing higher again! The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is now 80 points higher, or 1.2%, in late trading. Wall Street is catching a bid again, with the main indices up 2%. The rally comes as the chief of the World Health Organization insisted that the coronavirus can still be controlled (although the situation is still hugely concerning) Reuters has the details: The epidemics in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan are the World Health Organization\u2019s greatest concern, the body\u2019s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday. In the past 24 hours there were almost nine times more coronavirus cases reported outside China than inside, but the disease can be contained with the right measures, he said. Tedros added that Singapore and South Korea have been \u201cvery effective\u201d in suppressing the virus, without resorting to walling off cities. US president Donald Trump has urged America\u2019s central bankers to slash interest rates (something which investors are already anticipating). One clarification, though -- Germany hasn\u2019t actually done anything yet (although Italy has announced a \u20ac3.6bn stimulus plan) The coronavirus has already infected tens of thousands of people, and killed around 3,000. It has wiped an estimated $5 trillion off global markets, sending the main stock markets down over 10%. And it could, some experts believe, deal a real blow to modern globalisation. Companies are going to rethink their reliance on parts made on the other side of the world. Executives also may be reluctant to send time flying around the world, congregating in busy airports and conference centres where germs also congregate. Less globalisation could be a popular policy with both the left and the right. But it could also mean lower growth. Ed Conway of Sky News has written an interesting post on this, riffing off the OECD\u2019s gloomy growth warnings today: Now comes the coronavirus, itself an agent of deglobalisation, forcing companies to localise their supply chains (because those in China and other countries are themselves shut down), forcing tourists to stay home and preventing workers from doing business travel, forcing people to reconsider whether \u201cjust in time\u201d manufacturing, whereby you rely on parts to be delivered minutes before you assemble them into a product, is really the best way to run their businesses. This is more than a trivial concern. The world\u2019s collective economic model relies on the relatively free movement of goods and people from one place to another. Yet this model is under threat at every turn - you only need look at the scenes on Greece\u2019s border with Turkey for further vivid examples. COVID-19 has the potential to accelerate this process, with far more lasting effects for the way we live our lives today. Back in Europe, Paolo Gentiloni, the European Commissioner for the economy, has said the EU was talking to the G20 and G7 country officials to coordinate a response to the coronavirus epidemic. This will cheer the Paris club for the world\u2019s 36 richest nations, the OECD, which this morning called for greater cooperation to deal with the outbreak of Covid-19. Gentiloni said the EU was prepared to loosen the purse strings. \u201cThe EU is ready to use all the available policy options if and when needed to safeguard growth against these downside risks.\u201d But he played down any hopes of a quick rebound. \u201cThe fact that it is still too soon to measure the impact of the downside doesn\u2019t mean we can minimise it. The idea of a V-shaped recovery, returning quickly to growth can\u2019t be taken for granted and could prove optimistic.\u201d He emphasised that EU rules allow individual countries to respond to the crisis and they should act quickly to maintain confidence. The FT\u2019s Mehreen Khan attended the briefing: US factories are suffering from the coronavirus panic, according to two surveys just released. The Institute of Supply Management has reported that growth across the industry fizzled out last month. ISM\u2019s US manufacturing survey found that new orders fell last month, with many respondents also warning that supply chains were struggling (as we\u2019ve heard from the UK and eurozone already today). The ISM\u2019s UK factory PMI fell to just 50.1, close to stagnation. The underlying picture could be worse, as these PMI surveys treat supply delays as a good sign (as it usually implies there is strong demand for parts, not vanishing supplies). A rival survey from IHS Markit, released a few minute earlier, also shows that manufacturing output growth has weakened amid a slower upturn in new orders. It says: Supply chain delays stemming from supplier factory shutdowns in China and the outbreak of coronavirus led to a further deterioration in vendor performance, which reportedly held back output and the processing of backlogs due to a shortage of components. As a result, firms registered a renewed rise in outstanding business and a drop in pre-production inventories. Supermarket giant Walmart is the top Dow riser, up 2.5%. Consumer goods provider Procter &amp; Gamble are up too, around 1.3%. Both companies could benefit from a surge in stockpiling, or full-blown panic buying, if coronavirus cases continue to spread. Tech stocks are also having a good morning on Wall Street, with Apple and Microsoft up 2.3%. They both fell during last week\u2019s rout, with Apple falling from $313/share to $273. Wall Street\u2019s early rally is dragging European markets back from their earlier lows: Newsflash: The US stock market has opened higher, as the Wall Street opening bell rings out across the trading floor. After its biggest weekly loss since 2008, the Dow Jones industrial average has jumped 235 points to 25,644. That\u2019s a gain of 0.9%. The S&amp;P 500, which covers a broader range of US companies, has gained 1%. This follows speculation that the world\u2019s central bankers will be forced to cut interest rates, and implement other stimulus measures, to protect the global economy. The technology-focused Nasdaq has gained 1.1%, including strong gains from Twitter which is up 9%. That follows reports that billionaire Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Management has taken a \u2018sizable stake\u2019 in the social media site, and and intends to \u2018push for changes\u2019. That includes ousting CEO Jack Dorsey, apparently. Brace yourselves. Wall Street is about to open, and test investor confidence over the coronavirus crisis.... Financial news service RANSquawk has spotted that some brokers have been upgrading their stock recommendations today. That might seem counter-intuitive (or plain daft) given the uncertainty gripping the global economy. But the slump in share prices last week appears to make certain companies more attractive -- although we simply don\u2019t know how much damage corporate profits will suffer this year. The head of the World Trade Organization has warned the global economy will suffer a \u201csubstantial\u201d impact from the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Roberto Azevedo also told heads of delegations that a WTO meeting planned for June was still going ahead, but \u201cnecessary action\u201d will be taken if necessary. The markets are turning more volatile, as all eyes turn to the Wall Street open in under 30 minutes. As I type, the futures market is now predicting that shares will open higher in New York, with the Dow Jones currently called up 150 points. That\u2019s nudging the FTSE 100 higher - its now up 38 points. But there\u2019s a lot of nervousness about US traders will behave today, as the first two coronavirus deaths were reported yesterday. The FTSE 100 is being propped up by the pound, which is having a bad day. Sterling has fallen to its weakest level against the euro since last October, down 1.5 eurocents at \u20ac1.147. It\u2019s also lost almost half a cent against the US dollar, to $1.276. Investors are moving into safe-haven currencies, with both the euro and the dollar seen as less risky than the pound. The latest political developments aren\u2019t helping the pound either. The government\u2019s new strategy for trade talks with the US, published this morning, suggest that an \u201cambitious and comprehensive\u201d trade deal would only grow the economy by 0.07% \u201cin the long run\u201d. Any growth is welcome, of course, but this doesn\u2019t feel like enough of a boost to make up for new trade barriers with Europe.... CNBC are reporting that Jack Welch, one of the most important US business leaders of recent decades, has died aged 84. Welch ran General Electric between 1981 and 2001, transforming the company\u2019s prospects and growing its value 40-fold. He was famous for aggressively streamlining the company, and notorious for firing the 10% worst-performing managers each year. CNBC explains: He invented the \u201cvitality curve,\u201d in which managers were ranked into three groups. The top 20% \u201cA\u201d group was \u201cfilled with passion, committed to making things happen.\u201d The \u201cvital\u201d 70% \u201cB\u201d group was essential to the company and encouraged to join the A\u2019s. Then there was the bottom 10% \u201cC\u201d group. \u201cThe underperformers generally had to go,\u201d Welch said in his 2001 book, \u201cJack: Straight From the Gut.\u201d Airline group IATA are now calling for the \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 rules on landing slots to be relaxed. Currently, an airline can lose its rights to land at an airport if it doesn\u2019t fly at least 80% of planned flights (a rule designed to prevent incumbents from restricting new operators for breaking into the market). IATO, though, is urging regulators to drop this 80:20 rule during the coronavirus crisis - as happened in Europe during the global downturn in 2009. That suggests airlines are anticipating significant disruption to key routes (flights to China and Italy, for example, have already been curbed). But airports may not be happy -- fewer flights would mean less revenue at its shops, and lower landing fees. Bavarian newspaper Passauer Neue Presse is reporting that a BMW worker in Munich has contracted coronavirus. This means 150 employees at its R&amp;D centre have been sent home to self-quarantine. Here\u2019s our news story on the Bank of England\u2019s pledge to to what it can to support the UK economy through the coronavirus crisis. Mark Kleinman of Sky News has learned that the coronavirus crisis has scuppered Saga\u2019s plans to sell its Titan Travel division (which runs escorted holidays for the over 50s). Saga reportedly appointed City advisors last month to look for a potential buyer, but clearly it\u2019s impossible to price the business accurately in the current climate. The European Central Bank has now waded in, pledging to act where it can to protect the eurozone economy from the coronavirus. Speaking in London now, ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos says there had been signs of \u201cstabilisation\u201d in the euro area and an improving global growth outlook in recent weeks. The Covid-19 outbreak, though, is threatening the recovery -- both through supply problems and lower demand, he warns. De Guindos says: Over recent weeks, however, the coronavirus added a new layer of uncertainty to global and euro area growth prospects. The outbreak has the potential to affect the euro area economy through both demand- and supply-side channels. Euro area foreign demand could be directly hit as a result of quarantine measures in China and the associated suspension of production lines. This may affect euro area exports, and could cause disruption in global supply chains and the production of intermediate products. The euro area services sector, too, could be affected by travel disruptions. If the virus spreads more widely, domestic firms could be more directly affected due, for example, to supply chain delays. We remain vigilant and will closely monitor all incoming data. Our forward guidance steers the orientation of our monetary policy. In any case, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner. Sorry, small typo in that last post. International Airlines Group own British Airways and Iberia, as well as Aer Lingus, budget airline LEVEL and Vueling. Travel stocks are sinking lower in London. IAG (which runs British Airways and Iberia airlines) are down 11%, followed by cruise operator Carnival (-7.5%) and easyJet (-5.7%). Whitbread are down 5.3%, with traders concluding that demand for its Premier Inn hotels will suffer as companies urge staff to curb travel plans. Financial stocks are also suffering, with Royal Bank of Scotland losing 4.5%. Bank profits would suffer if the Bank of England slashed interest rates. They could also face rising bad debts if the coronavirus outbreak causes some companies to fail. One third of the index is still up - with Hikma Pharmaceuticals up 4% and Ocado now 3% higher. But the FTSE 100 is down 40 points, or 0.6%, overall, and looking rather jittery. So much for the market rebound! The FTSE 100 has just dropped into negative territory for the day, having been more than 2% higher at the open. All the main European indices are now in the red again, as markets suffer further coronavirus worries. Shares in UK supermarkets are rallying today, amid signs that UK consumers are stockpiling essential goods in case of a coronavirus pandemic. Sainsbury\u2019s are up 2.8%, with Morrisons close behind. Ocado has gained 1.6%, while Tesco are 1% higher. On Friday evening, online grocer Ocado told customers it was experiencing \u201cexceptionally high demand at the moment\u201d (a move which is likely to encourage MORE people to book delivery slots). Foreign exchange provider Travelex warned this morning that the coronavirus will dent its business. It told shareholders that it can\u2019t tell the full impact, but expects to suffer some hit to earnings , saying: The outbreak of Covid-19 is an incremental negative for Travelex\u2019s business given broad exposure to airports and travel flows. VAT and related services will also be negatively impacted. While China and other Asian in-country revenue account for approximately 10% of Travelex revenues, other markets closely linked to Asian outbound travel are also experiencing headwinds. Travelex also said underlying earnings in the current quarter will be \u00a325m lower than expected, mainly due to the impact of a cyber attack which took its services offline. The OECD\u2019s warning that global growth could be halved this year is dampening the mood in the markets. Wall Street futures have been falling steadily, and the S&amp;P 500 is no longer expected to rally today. That\u2019s now weighing on European markets too. Adrian Lowcock, head of personal investing at investment platform Willis Owen, says the early optimism has been \u201call but wiped out\u201d by the OECD\u2019s gloom: \u201cThe OECD has said that a \u2018longer lasting and more intensive coronavirus outbreak\u2019 could cause economic growth to halve in 2020, to just 1.5%, and markets are now heading back down in reaction. \u201cFor investors it means putting up with a lot more volatility to come \u2013 this event is unfortunately far from over and trying call when to buy and sell in the face of such an unknown event is virtually impossible. While many stocks look cheap now, they could get a lot cheaper before this crisis is over.\u201d In a press conference in Paris, Laurence Boone, chief economist at the OECD, has warned that central bankers cannot protect economies from coronavirus on their own. Boone told reporters that central banks need to play their part, by offering to ease borrowing costs and provide banks with liquidity in the event of a further downturn. But they cannot mop up the spillover effects of the coronavirus epidemic alone - governments must act too. As she outlined today\u2019s growth forecast cuts, Boone explained: \u201cWe do not think this is a shock that can be managed by central banks alone.\u201d She added that governments must put in place measures to protect businesses and households affected by decisions to quarantine towns or restrict business activities. In response to a question from my colleague Phillip Inman, she said the US and China should put an end to their trade war, which has seen import tariffs increase on hundreds of billions worth of goods. Boone said global co-operation was needed to cope with the crisis and Washington and Beijing would signal a return to a more co-operative stance if they dispensed with tariffs imposed over the last 2 years. Nike has temporarily shut its European headquarters in Hilversum, the Netherlands, after an employee was infected with the coronavirus. The HQ is being disinfected (our main coronavirus liveblog has more details) Goldman Sachs has joined the ranks of companies banning all \u201cnon-essential\u201d travel and putting in place specific restrictions on travel to China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran, according to an internal memo. Yahoo Finance explains: Staff who have recently visited China and South Korea have also been told to self-isolate away from the office for two weeks. \u201cWe are closely monitoring new developments regarding COVID-19 and calibrating the firm\u2019s global response on a daily basis,\u201d the bank wrote in the memo to staff. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The European stock market rally didn\u2019t last long. After just two hours, the Stoxx 600 has faded back towards last Friday\u2019s closing levels. The prospect of central bank intervention, although welcome, isn\u2019t assuaging concerns about coronavirus.... with the global death toll passing 3,000 today, and hundreds more cases in Iran. There are some hefty downgrades in the OECD\u2019s new growth forecasts, as this chart shows: Here\u2019s our news story on the OECD\u2019s coronavirus growth warnings: Newsflash: The coronavirus outbreak is plunging the world economy into its worst downturn since the global financial crisis, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warns. In its latest economic forecasts, the OECD has slashed its G20 growth forecast for 2020 to just 2.4%, from 2.9% predicted three months ago. It is now gloomier about growth in China, the eurozone and the UK - and fears Japan will barely expand at all. And worryingly, the OECD fears growth could be as low as 1.5% this year, if coronavirus becomes pandemic in Asia, Europe and North America. Such low growth would imply a recession in many major economies. Here\u2019s the new forecasts: China: growth of 4.9% in 2020, down from 5.7% previously US: growth of 1.9% in 2020, down from 2.0% Japan: growth of 0.2% in 2020, down from 0.6% Eurozone: growth of 0.8% in 2020, down from 1.1% UK: growth of 0.8% in 2020, down from 1.0% The OECD is also urging policymakers, such as central bankers and politicians, to take action where possible to protect their economies. Back in the markets..... the FTSE 100 is losing some of its early bounce. It\u2019s still rallying - up 1.2% at 6656. But that\u2019s only a 77-point gain, having been up 177 points at the open. Newsflash: UK factories are also struggling to get their hands on parts from China, just like their eurozone rivals. Supply- chain disruptions across British industry are \u201crapidly emerging\u201d as the outbreak of COVID-19 led to sizeable raw material delivery delays, rising input costs and increased pressure on stocks of purchases. That\u2019s according to data firm IHS Markit, and its latest survey of UK manufacturing. This PMI survey also found that export business fell again last month, for the fourth month in a row. The effects of the COVID-19 outbreak had a noticeable impact on supply chains during February. Average vendor lead times lengthened to the greatest extent since July 2018, while the eight-point drop in the level of the seasonally adjusted Suppliers\u2019 Delivery Times Index was the largest in the 28-year survey history. Recent storms and flooding in the UK also had an impact. This led to companies \u201cburning through their Brexit safety stocks,\u201d Markit adds. The shortage of raw materials is also pushing up input prices, which is leading to higher prices at the factory gate too. The mood in the City today is much calmer than during last week\u2019s manic sell-off, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cThere is a semi-reversal of last week\u2019s sector trends with healthcare and infrastructure-related stocks no longer in favour and heavily sold-off industrial and mining stocks leading the charge upwards. \u201cHowever, airlines were still in the doldrums with International Consolidated Airlines falling 6% and EasyJet down 1.4%. \u201cThe big question is whether a single day\u2019s rebound is enough to repair damaged investor sentiment or if this is simply a dead cat bounce before fears take over again. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see fund managers with spare cash take advantage of the market sell-off and buy companies for a discount. Britain\u2019s City watchdog, the FCA, says it is working closely with the financial services sector to ensure they can keep operating in the face of coronavirus. Reuters has the details: \u201cThis is in conjunction with the Bank of England,\u201d an FCA spokesperson said. \u201cAs you would expect we have been in contact with a wide range of firms across the sector. We expect all firms to have contingency plans in place to deal with major events so that they are able to continue operating effectively. And, as part of that, to consider how best to support their customers.\u201d Newsflash: Eurozone factories suffered falling exports last month, as the coronavirus outbreak hit demand for goods. Manufacturers have also reported longer delays to get raw materials and parts, due to the ongoing disruption to Chinese supply chains. That\u2019s according to the latest survey of purchasing managers at eurozone factories, from data firm IHS Markit. Factories across Europe suffered \u201cnotable\u201d supply-side constraints last month, mainly due to factory shutdowns in China. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, says this could hit eurozone growth in the months ahead: \u201cThe concern is that coronavirus-related delays in shipments threaten to constrain production in the coming months, prolonging a downturn that already extends to over a year. Supply chains are lengthening to an extent not seen since 2018 and inventories are being depleted at a rate rarely seen over the past decade as companies struggle to produce enough to satisfy order books. \u201cFurthermore, while a return to work for many Chinese factories after the extended New Year holiday could help ease global supply constraints, any further spreading of the COVID-19 epidemic risks driving increased risk aversion and a reduction of spending by both businesses and consumers.\u201d Markit\u2019s eurozone factory PMI came in at 49.2, up from 49.1 last month, a level which shows the sector contracted in February. Every sector of the FTSE 100 index is up this morning, as stocks rebound from last week\u2019s rout: But there are now some fallers, including airlines (AIG and easyJet) and cruise firm Carnival. Oil is also rallying. Brent crude has gained almost 4% to $51.59 per barrel, suggesting that fears of a global recession are easing (for the moment, anyway). Newsflash: The Bank of England is promising to take \u201call necessary steps\u201d to support the UK economy from the impact of coronavirus. A spokesperson says: \u201cThe Bank continues to monitor developments and is assessing its potential impacts on the global and UK economies and financial systems. The Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA - as well as our international partners - to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.\u201d So, no firm details of its plans yet. But it does mean the BoE is standing alongside the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve in promising to act where needed. Airline shares are still under pressure this morning, with British Airways parent company IAG down 4.7%. EasyJet has lost another 1%. The smaller FTSE 250 index is also bouncing back, up 2.5% or 483 points at 19815. Savers and pension-holders will be relieved to see stocks rallying in London, after suffering significant losses last week. But it\u2019s (obviously) too early to say this crisis is over. Even if a global pandemic can be avoided, the global economy still faces months of disruption to supply chains. Some industries, particularly travel, face weaker revenues this year as worried consumers rethink their holiday plans. Mark Haefele of UBS Global Wealth Management says volatility will remain high, even if a global downturn is avoided. For now a recession remains a risk case\u2014not our base case. The correction over the past week has been dramatic and understandably a reason to be concerned. The sizable though not recessionary hit to global growth is also being met with a policy response to mitigate some of the negative economic consequences. This should ultimately bode well for risk assets, but volatility is likely to remain high in the near term until this path becomes more apparent.\u201d Most European stock markets are rallying in early trading, although not quite as strongly as London. Hopes of co-ordinated central bank action are rising, following the Bank of Japan and the Fed\u2019s pledges to act where needed. France and Germany are both up almost 1.5%, a solid move, but Italy\u2019s only 0.4% higher despite Rome announcing a \u20ac3.6bn stimulus package yesterday. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has opened sharply higher, as investors try to put last week\u2019s mayhem behind them. The blue-chip has rallied by 177 points, or 2.7%, to 6758. Every share is up, in a burst of optimism ripples through the trading floors. Holiday firm TUI (which crashed by 30% last week) is leading the rally, up around 6.8%. Mining companies are also leading the charge, with Antofagasta up 6.4%, Rio Tinto up 5.7% and Anglo American gaining 4.4%. France\u2019s top central banker has said the European Central Bank could take more actions to protect the eurozone economy from the coronavirus. Francois Villeroy de Galhau, an ECB policymaker, told French radio that household consumption could be hit if the crisis intensifies, adding: \u201cIf more was needed and we were convinced that it would be effective, then we can do more, but we are not there yet. Our main coronavirus liveblog is covering all the latest developments - here\u2019s their latest summary: Australia has announced their first two cases of local transmission of Covid-19. Two people have now died in the US \u2013 both in Washington state \u2013 and New York state has recorded its first case of Covid-19. Indonesia reports its first two cases of Covid-19. South Korea infections pass 4,000, with 22 fatalities. China reports 202 new cases, 42 new deaths. Italy has confirmed 34 deaths from the virus. Iran raised its death toll from 43 to 54 with confirmed infections rising by more than half to 978. China\u2019s stock market is leading the rally today, with the CSI 300 index jumping over 3%. Investors are shrugging off the news that China\u2019s factories have had their worst monthly slump on record. Earlier today, Caixin\u2019s survey of Chinese manufacturing output sank to just 40.3, from 51.1 in January. That\u2019s its lowest level since it began in 2004, and signals a very sharp contraction. But it\u2019s actually better than the official Chinese purchasing managers survey (PMI) - it lurched down to 35.8, from 50. Any reading below 50 shows stagnation, so such dire readings highlight that the Chinese economy is really struggling, with many factories still closed or working below potential. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. After their worst week in over a decade, global stock markets are attempting a rebound today. Investors are wagering that politicians and central bankers soon announce stimulus measures to ward off a global downturn triggered by the spread of the coronavirus. The Bank of Japan has already led the charge, announcing today that they will inject fresh liquidity into the markets -- and possibly boost its asset purchase programme too. In a rare emergency statement, BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda declared: \u201cOverseas and domestic financial markets continue to make unstable movements due to heightening uncertainty over the impact on the economy from the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cThe Bank of Japan will closely monitor future developments, and will strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets through appropriate market operations and asset purchases.\u201d This move comes as Italy pledged to inject \u20ac3.6bn into its economy, which is already hurting from the impact of Covid-19. This will include tax credits for companies whose revenues are badly hit by the crisis, tax cuts and extra cash for the health system. Late on Friday night, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell promised to \u201cact as appropriate to support the economy\u201d. Those comments helped Wall Street to recover some of its losses (although it still had its worst week since October 2008). So after a rout that wiped over \u00a3200bn off Britain\u2019s blue-chip share last week, European stocks are expected to jump today. The FTSE 100 is currently being called 2% higher, or around 135 points higher at 6715 points. That\u2019s a decent gain, but it won\u2019t actually recover all of Friday\u2019s losses, let alone the 11% lost last week. But after recent slumps, any recovery is welcome. Asia-Pacific markets have already rebounded; Japan\u2019s Nikkei has closed 200 points higher, or nearly 1%, at 21,344 points. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI has gained 0.9%, despite another 500 cases being reported by Seoul today. The overall death toll from Covid-19 has hit 3,000, with some 88,000 people now infected. That includes the first case in New York state. My colleague Justin McCurry explains: The death toll in China rose to 2,912, but it is also creeping up in other countries. Iran has the second highest number of deaths, with 54, Australia reported its first Covid-19 death over the weekend. Infections nearly doubled over the weekend in Italy \u2013 Europe\u2019s hardest-hit country with nearly 1,700 cases. Also coming up today Later this morning the OECD will issue updated economic forecasts which may assess the coronavirus outbreak\u2019s impact on global growth. New surveys of factories in the US, eurozone and the UK will also show how much damage is being caused by the disruption to global supply chains.

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak has been forced to redraw next week\u2019s budget to focus on shoring up the economy against the impact of coronavirus. After Sajid Javid\u2019s abrupt resignation from the Treasury last month, Sunak\u2019s first major statement was due to herald a radical departure from the cautious Conservative economic policies of the past decade. But a No 10 source said the budget would now \u201cprioritise economic security\u201d in the face of the growing threat from the virus. Some potential reforms are likely to be shelved until another budget \u2013 with the possibility that the autumn statement could be upgraded to a full budget this year \u2013 while the government continues to assess the scale of the outbreak. Officials said more support measures could be announced sooner than autumn if necessary. Treasury number-crunchers are not yet convinced there is any need to stimulate demand in the economy, along the lines of the \u20ac3.6bn (\u00a33.14bn) package announced by Italy, which has been hit hard by the outbreak. UK public spending was already due to increase as a result of the one-year spending settlement announced in the autumn, with a further significant increase expected at the three-year spending review later this year. Sunak\u2019s immediate focus is expected to be on targeted measures aimed at minimising the effect on businesses and ensuring public services can continue to be provided. \u201cWe understand that people across the country are worried, but I assure you that we are taking firm action to support your families, your businesses and the public services on which you rely,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cWe are well prepared for this global threat and, as the wider economic picture becomes clearer, we stand ready to announce further support where needed.\u201d Sunak updated the Cobra emergency committee on the economic situation on Monday, as ministers signed off on the government\u2019s plan for trying to slow the spread of the virus. Boris Johnson, who has been accused by Labour of being a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d in recent days, will announce details of the coronavirus \u201cbattle plan\u201d at apress conference on Tuesday, as the government tries to show it has a grip on the outbreak. The plan is expected to include a major public information campaign, stressing the importance of regular handwashing \u2013 as well as keeping in reserve the option of a \u201csocial distancing\u201d strategy, urging the public to work at home and minimise travel if it spreads further. The Bank of England joined other central banks on Monday in promising to take steps to prevent the virus destabilising markets, and \u201censure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability.\u201d Forecasters are scrambling to analyse the potential economic impact of thousands of workers \u201cself-isolating\u201d, travel plans being cancelled, major events being reorganised and cities being cordoned off. The developed-country thinktank, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, halved its GDP growth forecasts for global economic growth on Monday as a result of the crisis, calling it the \u201cgravest threat\u201d since the financial crisis. The prime minister acknowledged that the government was conscious of the potential economic risks, as the disease continues to spread. \u201cSomething like a mass epidemic is going to have all sorts of consequences and there is always the potential for an economic downside \u2026 and we are ready for that. But don\u2019t forget the fundamentals of the UK economy are very strong.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for following our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak today. We are about to close this live blog, but you can pick up our live coverage here. In the meantime, here\u2019s a summary of the key points so far: Italy\u2019s death toll has risen to 52, with 1,835 confirmed cases The US has now recorded six fatalities from the virus, with 75 confirmed cases WHO chief says: \u201cWe have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures.\u201d UK supermarkets have drawn up plan to \u201cfeed the nation\u201d as coronavirus spreads. Confirmed cases stand at 39. The virus outbreak has reached more than 60 countries. The level of risk of contracting coronavirus within Europe has been raised from moderate to high. Australia\u2019s chief medical officers will meet on Tuesday to discuss if extra measures are needed to combat outbreak. You can follow our new liveblog here: The republican broadcaster Scottie Nell Hughes told the BBC\u2019s Emily Maitlis that president Trump \u201cbelieves he is stepping up with leadership\u201d by having appointed vice president Mike Pence as the person in charge of the outbreak, and his housing minister, Ben Carson, as one of the experts on his coronavirus task force. The Australian market has opened up more than 1%, its first rise after more than a week of falls caused by concerns over the economic damage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. This morning\u2019s increase follows relief rallies on overseas markets that saw the US S&amp;P500 index soar by 4.6% and the UK\u2019s FTSE book a more modest 1.1% rise. It comes ahead of a meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia this afternoon at which the futures market expects interest rates to be cut from 0.75%, which is already a record low, to 0.5%. Futures market trades imply a 100% chance of a rate cut today, according to ASX data. Further out, traders expect the official cash rate to drop to 0.25% by July. Jonathan Ashworth MP, the shadow health secretary, told BBC Newsnight the NHS \u201cwill struggle\u201d to cope with an escalation of the Covid-19 outbreak, because of \u201cten years of cutbacks\u201d. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has written an analysis about the government\u2019s scramble to respond convincingly to the challenges the coronavirus outbreaks poses. She writes: Behind closed doors in government there is a realisation that an outbreak of coronavirus could go on for many months and cause a lot of disruption to many people\u2019s lives. Many of us might be asked to work at home. There are questions too about how self-employed people or those on zero hours contracts can make a living. What happens to the local elections in May? Can the NHS, already under a lot of pressure, really cope? [...] Boris Johnson\u2019s government is certainly no longer in the position of surveying the new political landscape and wondering which of its priorities it can choose to deal with first. Instead, it faces an immediate and highly complicated question it needs to answer. Get it wrong and there could be serious political damage too. The UK government will launch a major public information campaign later this week, as it aiming to set out clear steps the public can take to limit the spread of the virus, a No 10 spokesperson has said. The spokesperson added that a new bill will be published in the coming weeks \u201cto ensure the government has all the necessary powers to prepare for and tackle the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d They added that, should the virus spread, the government might encourage more home working and discourage unnecessary travel as part of a \u201csocial distancing\u201d strategy that could delay the peak of the outbreak until later in the year, potentially helping combat the virus in warmer weather conditions. In Australia, the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has just held a press conference in Melbourne to update the public about efforts to prepare the health system for any coronavirus spread throughout the community. It follows news from NSW on Monday that there had been two cases of community transmission, including the first case that could not be immediately traced back to direct contact with an infected person. While there is no immediate threat of widespread community risk, Australian doctors are preparing. Andrews said there were now 33 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia, including nine in Victoria. \u201cWhile we are doing what we can to contain COVID-19, we are also preparing to take more targeted action if, as expected, the virus starts impacting more Victorians,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working closely with the Commonwealth and our response is being guided by the very best expert advice.\u201d The government is currently monitoring and investigating cases as they occur, and working with the primary care sector to ensure it has the appropriate clinical knowledge, response and capacity available to treat patients. The government is communicating with at-risk groups, such as the elderly. There is also preparation for hospital surge management. The state government is providing $6m to the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity working with the Burnet Institute and other experts to fast-track new treatments and vaccines for COVID-19. There are efforts around the world to develop a vaccine, and any vaccine is likely to be the result of a global effort. Australia\u2019s attorney general Christian Porter said the laws used to detain people at airports and other entry points could also be used to stop people elsewhere, as the government attempts to keep a lid on the coronavirus spread in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s very likely that these laws will get used on a larger scale,\u201d Porter told ABC radio RN on Tuesday morning. \u201cAnd it\u2019s very likely that Australians will encounter practices and instructions and circumstances that they have not had to encounter before,\u201d he said. My colleagues Jasper Jolly and Rebecca Smithers have written a story about how the UK\u2019s supermarket sector is bracing for panic buying, should the coronavirus threat worsen in the UK. This just in from the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake: And this from Reuters\u2019 Jeff Mason: London mayor Sadiq Khan has issued a statement aiming to \u201creassure Londoners\u201d in regard to the outbreak. Khan said: Today, I brought together senior officials from Public Health England, the NHS, our emergency services, TfL, and representatives from councils across London, and the Government, to review and ensure we are fully prepared to respond to the coronavirus. I want to reassure Londoners that, although the risk to individuals currently remains low, I\u2019m in regular contact with Public Health England to ensure that we work together as closely as possible to monitor the impact on our city and be ready to take the necessary action required. Khan stressed that people with symptoms should not go to their GP or an A&amp;E unit and call 111 for advice instead. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, told NBC News that the coronavirus outbreak had \u201clikely reached pandemic proportions\u201d. Fauci said: We\u2019re dealing with clearly an emerging infectious disease that [has] now reached outbreak proportions and likely pandemic proportions. Asked whether concerned members of the public were reacting correctly by getting off public transport if a co-passenger coughed, Fauci said: \u201cNo, no. Getting off is not going to help.\u201d In response to the question of whether people should stop attending sporting events and concerts, he said: We are not at the stage right now of mitigation for this. It may come to a point where, when you have enough community spread, that you switch from trying to contain it, from coming into the country or containing it from spreading, and trying to protect yourself and your community. We\u2019re not there yet. Australia\u2019s top medical officers will meet on Tuesday to consider whether mass gatherings such as sporting events should be cancelled as the country grapples with the first two cases of community transmission of coronavirus. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee \u2013 made up of Australia\u2019s chief medical officers \u2013 will meet to consider whether it was necessary to introduce bans on mass gatherings including large sport and entertainment events. It comes after officials in New South Wales on Monday confirmed a 53-year-old health worker and 41-year-old woman as the first two cases of patient-to-patient transfer in the country. The woman was believed to have contracted the virus from her brother, who had recently returned from Iran. However officials expressed concern about the origin of the health worker\u2019s illness; he had not recently travelled to an affected country and had not knowingly been in contact with an infected person. Previously, the only people with the virus in Australia were those who had contracted it in other countries. The city of San Antonio in the US state of Texas has declared a state of emergency, the Houston Chronicle reports. Mayor Ron Nirenberg declared a public health emergency on Monday afternoon local time to keep more than 120 coronavirus evacuees from a cruise ship quarantined at an airforce base at the outskirts of San Antonio until further notice, and banned new evacuees from entering the city. The cruise ship evacuees were originally to be released Monday. My colleagues Matthew Weaver, Denis Campbell and Severin Carrell have written up a story about the latest Covid-19 developments in the UK, and how the outbreak could test NHS resources. Four more people in Washington state have died from coronavirus, officials have said. This brings the total number of US fatalities to six. At a news conference Monday Jeff Duchin from Public Health Seattle &amp; King County said five of the deaths were people from King County and one was a person from Snohomish County, north of Seattle, AP reported. Researchers said earlier that the virus may have been circulating for weeks undetected in Washington state. Here my colleague Amanda Holpuch\u2019s story: Most of Google\u2019s 8,000 staff and contractors in Ireland have been told to work from home tomorrow after a member of staff reported flu-like symptoms, RTE reports. While the worker is only vaguely suspected to have the virus, it is understood that the company decided to test having all staff work remotely in case the situation surrounding the coronavirus escalates. A Google spokesperson said: We continue to take precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce, and as part of that effort we have asked our Dublin teams to work from home tomorrow. The Formula One season-opening Australian Grand Prix will go ahead on 15 March despite a rising threat of becoming infected with coronavirus, my colleague Giles Richards reports. The Chinese Grand Prix has already been postponed because of the outbreak and infection from the virus has now spread throughout Europe where the F1 teams are based. The French health chief, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, corrected earlier reports that there had been four deaths from coronavirus in France, and reduced the number down to three. There are now 191 cases confirmed in the country. The third death was an 89-year-old woman who was declared positive for the virus after a postmortem examination. Salomon said that for 75% of cases in France there was a clear chain of transmission that could be identified. Across France, 12 regions have reported cases, five of which have more than 10 infected people. Asked why certain events, like the Paris half marathon had been cancelled, Salomon said it was a \u201crational, scientific response\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of whether people are confined (in a space) or not, it\u2019s a question of proximity,\u201d he said. East and North Hertfordshire NHS trust now says that a clinician at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre who had tested positive for the virus has since been given the all-clear. Its update suggest that Public Health England may need to revise down their total by one. An update on the trust\u2019s website said: After initial PCR testing by Public Health England, subsequent genomic testing shows that the member of staff from Mount Vernon has now proven to be negative for Coronavirus (Covid-19). Public Health England has just informed us of this latest result. This is obviously a source of relief to the individual in question, and also to those members of staff and patients who had been advised to self-isolate and/or undergo testing. We are thankful to colleagues at NHS England and Public Health England who have been in close communication with us, both as they tested, and then supported us as we implemented national guidance. Nick Phin, deputy director at the National Infection Service at Public Health England, said: As part of our highly precautionary approach, we are acting on all presumptive positive cases as though they are confirmed in order to limit spread of the virus. This means we begin tracing close contacts of all cases and asking them to self-isolate before definitive confirmation by the PHE reference laboratory at Colindale. The confirmatory test for one case at Mount Vernon hospital has found that the result was negative and the person does not have novel coronavirus. This is obviously good news and we will therefore no longer ask the individuals to self-isolate.\u201d While airlines have cancelled hundreds of flights in response to the outbreak, the Six Nations rugby competition organisers have said no additional match postponements were planned for the time being. England\u2019s men\u2019s match in Italy is expected to go ahead on 14 March. However, organisers said the women\u2019s and under-20s fixtures between the two countries could be relocated. The UK government has been advised to provide \u201cresilience\u201d training for teenagers so they can help support the authorities in civil contingencies like floods or the coronavirus outbreak, according to PA Media. A report by the Royal United Services Institute military thinktank said the nation\u2019s teens represented an \u201cuntapped\u201d resource when it came to dealing with emergencies. It called for 16- to 18-year-olds to be offered training during the school holidays in \u201ccrisis preparedness\u201d and \u201cemergency response\u201d. Hello, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Frances Perraudin. I have compiled a short overview of today\u2019s developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak. A majority of Britons are not taking any extra steps to reduce their risk of contracting coronavirus such as washing their hands or using a hand sanitiser, a new survey has found. Only 35% of Britons have improved their personal hygiene in those ways in a bid to protect themselves against the virus, according to new YouGov research. Other findings from the pollster\u2019s survey of 1,618 British adults show strong public support for the government\u2019s handling of the outbreak so far, a widespread belief that the NHS will be able to cope if large numbers of people become unwell with Covid-19 and \u2013 so far \u2013 a lack of fear about the virus, which first arrived in Britain in late January. YouGov\u2019s findings show that: \u2022 Overall 35% of those questioned are washing their hands more regularly, 14% are avoiding public places and 14% are not touching objects in public such as lift buttons. \u2022 However, 54% are not taking any extra precautions. \u2022 While 24% are \u201cfairly\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d scared about the prospect of contracting Covid-19, 70% are \u201cnot scared\u201d. \u2022 A majority \u2013 54% \u2013 think the government is handling coronavirus well, and people of all party loyalties are more likely to think that the government has been doing well rather than badly, while only 16% say handling has been \u201cbad\u201d. \u2022 Almost two-thirds (64%) are confident the NHS will respond well to a major outbreak but 29% are not confident. \u2022 62% feel they have enough information about what to do if they suspect they may have become infected. Asked what measures the government should take to try and contain coronavirus 65% want anyone who has been in contact with an infected patient to be quarantined, 50% want all flights from mainland China banned and 36% support the potential ban on sporting events, concerts and other large gatherings that Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said last week may become necessary. The BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg has interviewed Boris Johnson about the country\u2019s preparedness for the coronavirus outbreak. She started by asking him what the worst case scenario was. He responded: Well, I think the most important thing now is that we prepare against a possible very significant expansion of coronavirus in the UK population \u2013 that \u2026 that\u2019s clearly on the \u2026 on the cards. It\u2019s \u2026 it\u2019s possible that we will see a big expansion in the number of cases. And I\u2019ll just remind everybody what I\u2019ve said for a while now: this country is very well prepared, we have a fantastic NHS, we have a fantastic ability to conduct large-scale testing. He said the government would be announcing further protective measures in the morning. Kuenssberg asked if the prime minister could give a sense of the kind of numbers that could be affected by the virus. He said: Well, I think it\u2019s important to stress that there are \u2026 there is\u2026 there is a range of possibilities, of course, Laura, but you know, and at the moment, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s difficult to \u2026 to speculate about exactly how it may or may not progress. But what I think you can say, with a fair degree of certainty, it is, in my view, much more likely than not that we will face a challenge in the weeks, months ahead\u2026 The NHS\u2019s 111 online service to provide advice about coronavirus was used by more than 35,000 people in a single day this weekend. The service was set up last Wednesday to help deal with the volume of enquiries relating to covid-19 and has since given advice to more than 70,000 people. NHS England said it would spend an initial extra \u00a31.7m on the 111 helpline so staff could offer more clinical advice over the phone. The funding will provide 500 additional initial call responders with the capacity to answer around 20,000 more calls every day. They said investment would increase if demand continued to rise. A home diagnostic testing programme is currently being rolled out across the country, while a \u201cdrive-through\u201d testing centre has started operating in west London. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: NHS staff are working round the clock to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. We know that 111 has come under pressure as people have understandably turned to the service for help, support and advice which is why we are ploughing in funding to increase staff available to field calls. The public is also now benefiting from the new NHS 111 online service which is helping increase capacity and free up clinicians time by offering specific help and advice on coronavirus at the touch of a button and has already had more than 70,000 hits since launched on Wednesday. I would like to say a personal thankyou to all those NHS staff who are doing an incredible job caring for patients, testing thousands of worried people and taking calls from thousands more. Big businesses and wealthy people are chartering private jets for \u201cevacuation flights\u201d out of countries hit by the coronavirus outbreak, reports the Guardian\u2019s wealth correspondent Rupert Neate. Adam Twidell, the chief executive of the private jet booking service PrivateFly, said the company had been inundated with requests from multinational firms arranging the mass evacuation of staff from China and south-east Asia. Twidell said rich families were also chartering private jets to reduce the risk of exposing their families to the virus by avoiding commercial flights and busy airports. \u201cOver the past few weeks, there\u2019s undoubtedly been a rise in demand for short notice on-demand charter relating to the coronavirus Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very significant number of inquiries for group evacuations and from corporates and individuals.\u201d You can read the full story here: British Labour MP Tulip Siddiq has had confirmation from the family of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman detained in Iran, that she has not been tested for coronavirus. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s husband told broadcasters this morning that his wife suspected she might have the virus and was displaying all the symptoms. A former head of the UK civil service said the coronavirus highlighted a dilemma for Boris Johnson\u2019s government, arguing that ministers should be prepared to close schools or halt public gatherings such as football matches within days to disrupt the spread of the disease. Lord Bob Kerslake told the Guardian\u2019s Dan Sabbagh that \u201cif ministers believe that emergency measures will be necessary, they should act now\u201d. Their problem is that by the time we know for sure how serious the coronavirus outbreak is, it\u2019ll be too late, because such measures will be unable to halt its transmission. The additional difficulty for ministers, the former official said, is that such actions could have \u201ceconomic consequences\u201d, but he argued that the only reason for not introducing emergency measures quickly was because \u201cyou don\u2019t believe they are necessary in the end\u201d. The crossbench peer also said the government\u2019s communications efforts had been insufficient, and were damaged by boycotts of the Radio 4\u2019s Today and other programmes. You are reliant on communications in these situations, and need every media outlet necessary. You certainly shouldn\u2019t be boycotting programmes. Frankly that\u2019s pretty feeble. He said there were also not enough ministers appearing in the media to support Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who has been leading communications efforts on coronavirus almost single handedly in the past few days. Although Johnson himself chaired his first Cobra meeting on the crisis on Monday, Kerslake said it had come late in the day: \u201cNo criticism of Hancock, but if I was him, I\u2019d want a bit more back up.\u201d On the closure of Guildhall School, a spokesperson for the City of London Corporation said: Guildhall School can confirm that a member of its teaching staff has tested positive for Covid-19. The school has been given PHE advice. The staff and principal are working closely with students to ensure that they receive urgent appropriate advice. The principal of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London emailed staff and students shortly after 5pm today to say it would be closed for up to 14 days after a teacher was diagnosed with the virus. The email said: We regret to inform you that a member of teaching staff has tested positive for Coronavirus. He is currently recovering well at the Royal Free hospital. He was present and teaching in one of the ancillary school buildings on one day last week. He came into contact with a limited number of students and we are working closely with those students to ensure that they receive urgent appropriate advice. As a precautionary measure, the school will be closed for up to 14 days from today (Monday 2 March), to allow time for a review of the situation and for appropriate measures to be taken. In line with current government advice, we are advising any staff and students who exhibit any symptoms during the 14-day period to use the Coronavirus online helpline (www.111.nhs.uk/covid-19 ) and to notify their line manager or their department head. Whilst I understand this will cause anxiety amongst the school community, all necessary steps are being taken to minimise risk to others. All meetings, performances, workshops, masterclasses and any other on-site school engagements in the next 14 days should be cancelled. Staff are encouraged to work remotely during this period and if they are in any doubt of how to do so should contact their line manager. Donald Trump has accused Democrats of \u201cfearmongering\u201d over the coronavirus outbreak in the US, while claiming his decisions have \u201csaved many lives\u201d and asking drug companies to accelerate work on a vaccine. Two people have died from the coronavirus in the US and new cases were reported over the weekend in Washington state, New York, Florida, Rhode Island and Illinois. There are about 75 cases of the respiratory illness recorded in the US. \u201cThe country\u2019s doing very well, our professionals are doing an incredible job,\u201d Trump told journalists at the White House on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re also working with other countries to help them because they really have a fear of the unknown.\u201d Read the full story here: A teenage daughter of a Greek coronavirus victim on a school trip to London with 100 or so classmates has tested negative for the virus, reports the Guardian\u2019s Lisa O\u2019Carroll. However, those close to the incident say it took three days before the girl was given the all clear. The teenager arrived in London last Monday and had been in Italy days previously when she and her mother had been on a trip. Her mother tested positive last Thursday, prompting her teachers to contact the authorities on Friday. Her classmates were all flown home on Friday but the girl and one friend were told to remain in their rooms in a central London hotel while the tests were done. They did not get the test result until Sunday night causing bewilderment among those who were taking care of her who had expected a test to be done as soon as the authorities were notified. The hotel also remained open, raising questions about the scale of the contact-tracing that would have been required had the girl tested positive. The Guardian football editor, Marcus Christenson, is reporting that RB Leipzig have been forced to apologise for an \u201cerror\u201d towards Japanese fans during Sunday\u2019s game against Bayer Leverkusen. The club did not specify what the \u201cerror\u201d was but reports in Germany said that up to 20 supporters were asked to leave after the start of the game because of coronavirus fears. Leipzig said in a statement released on Monday that security officers at the stadium had been asked to follow guidelines from the Robert Koch institute \u2013 Germany\u2019s centre for disease control and prevention \u2013 in regards to groups of people from affected areas but that an error had been committed towards \u201cour Japanese guests\u201d. You can follow the story here: Here\u2019s some more on those cases in the UK: Debra Lapthorne, the centre director for Public Health England South West, said two confirmed cases were from the south Devon area and had become infected in northern Italy. Public Health England is contacting people who had close contact with two confirmed cases of Covid-19. Both cases are residents from the south Devon area and became infected whilst in northern Italy. Staff from PHE continue to support a secondary school in Torbay where one case attends. Caroline Dimond, the director of public health for Torbay council, said: I\u2019d like to reassure people that the risk to the general public remains low in both Torbay and south Devon and we are working with health colleagues to do everything we can to stop the virus spreading and ensure the people of Devon and Torbay are protected. An another individual confirmed to have Covid-19 in Kent had recently returned from Italy and is now in a treatment centre in London. They were located at offices of the North East London NHS Foundation Trust in Maidstone. Dr James Mapstone, the acting regional director, Public Health England South of England, said: Close contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed case. This tried and tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have issued a joint statement on the coronavirus, saying they are prepared to provide financial and technical help to their member countries. The IMF and the World Bank Group stand ready to help our member countries address the human tragedy and economic challenge posed by the Covid-19 virus. We are engaged actively with international institutions and country authorities, with special attention to poor countries where health systems are the weakest and people are most vulnerable. We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice, and technical assistance. In particular, we have rapid financing facilities that, collectively, can help countries respond to a wide range of needs. The strengthening of country health surveillance and response systems is crucial to contain the spread of this and any future outbreaks. International cooperation is essential to deal with the health and economic impact of the Covid-19 virus. The IMF and the World Bank Group are fully committed to provide the support that people in our member countries expect from us. A spokeswoman for the US vice-president, Mike Pence, has said that the White House will hold meetings this week with top executives from US airlines and the cruise industry amid the growing coronavirus outbreak, reports Reuters. Pence, who is overseeing the administration\u2019s efforts to tackle the outbreak, will attend a meeting with airline officials on Wednesday. Those planning to attend include the chief executives of American Airlines Group Inc, United Airlines Holdings Inc, Southwest Airlines Co, Spirit Airlines Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp. Tedros said 62 countries have reported coronavirus cases, 38 of which have reported 10 or fewer cases. He said that surrendering to the virus was not right and that we had to give it our best using a containment strategy irrespective of the number of cases. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, is speaking at a press conference. You can watch the live feed at the top of this blog. He said the epidemics in South Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan were the body\u2019s main concern. In the past 24 hours there were almost nine times more coronavirus cases reported outside China than inside, but the disease can be contained with the right measures, he said. Ryanair said in a statement: Ryanair today notified passengers that it was reducing its short haul flight programme (mainly to and from Italy) by up to 25% for a three-week period from Tuesday March 17 to Wednesday Apr 8, in response to the Covid-19 virus. Over the past week, Ryanair has seen a significant drop in bookings over that late March/early April period, in response to the Covid-19 virus. There has also been a significant step up in passenger no-shows on flights, particularly from and within Italy. The UK education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has told parliament schools \u201cshould stay open unless they\u2019re advised otherwise by Public Health England\u201d. Speaking earlier during education questions in the Commons, he said: We, as like all government departments, are, right across the country, making sure that we have regular communications to all educational settings, making sure that they have a clear understanding of some of the challenges in dealing with the coronavirus. We\u2019re advising that schools should stay open unless they\u2019re advised otherwise by Public Health England and we\u2019re planning for reasonable worst-case scenario, working closely with other departments and of course PHE. Italian health associations are appealing for more blood donors as medics warn a fall in the number of volunteers amid the coronavirus outbreak could have serious repercussions for those in need of blood transfusions, reports the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. \u201cWe need everyone\u2019s help to prevent the emergency from becoming more serious,\u201d the Association of Voluntary Blood Donors at Rome\u2019s Bambino Ges\u00f9 said in a Facebook post. Gianpietro Briola, the president of Avis, the Italian blood donor charity, said there had been a fall in the number of blood donors, particularly in the outbreak areas in northern Italy. \u201cIt is important that all donors go, without fear, to donate,\u201d he said. \u201cI emphasise that there is no scientific evidence of coronavirus transmission through transfusion. So whoever is in good health can donate, a rule that is always valid.\u201d Stefania Saccardi, a health councillor in the Tuscany region, said: \u201cI urge people to keep their nerve, get information only from official sources and avoid unjustified alarmism which has far more serious consequences than is necessary, such as the lack of transfusion support for the health services.\u201d Mary Lou McDonald, the leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, has revealed that her children attend the Dublin school that has been closed because of a coronavirus outbreak, reports the Guardian\u2019s Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll. Health authorities ordered the secondary school to close on Monday for two weeks after a pupil who returned from Italy was diagnosed with the virus \u2013 Ireland\u2019s first confirmed case. All the estimated 400 students and staff have been advised to stay at home and restrict their movements. McDonald tweeted that she was staying at home and would restrict her meetings this week. Sinn F\u00e9in is holding a series of rallies to bolster the party\u2019s efforts to enter a coalition government in the wake of its election success last month. Here is a video of Boris Johnson\u2019s statement following the Cobra meeting earlier \u2013 It is being reported in the French press that less than a week after the death of a high-school professor in the Oise region of northern France, two other people have died from the coronavirus in the same hospital. Le Parisien newspaper says it has the information from three sources. \u201cThe hospital at Compi\u00e8gne has suffered two further deaths, according to the last information I have,\u201d said Philippe Marini, the city mayor. In Nice, a three-year-old child was admitted to hospital with the virus. The UK government\u2019s plan to tackle the coronavirus outbreak will be released tomorrow after Boris Johnson chaired his first emergency Cobra meeting, reports the Guardian political correspondent Kate Proctor. Emergency legislation will also be introduced by the end of the month. This includes suspending rules on classroom sizes to try to keep nurseries and schools open. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesperson said: One of the purposes of the plan which we will be publishing will be to set out to the public some potential changes in relation to everyday things, action that might need to be taken to deliver that best possible response. He added: [The plan] was agreed by all four parts of the United Kingdom and they will be working closely together on ensuring we have the best possible response for dealing with the outbreak. Significant work has gone on already, you will hopefully have seen the adverts in particular stressing the need for people to wash their hands but there will be further and extensive public information campaigns in the coming days and weeks. Every Whitehall department in government was represented by a minister or secretary of state, and the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Michelle O\u2019Neill, the joint first minister of Northern Ireland, were also present via phone-ins or video links. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, was not invited. On criticism that the government has been slow to act over the virus, the spokesman said: I simply don\u2019t accept that. We have been taking extensive steps led by the best medical and scientific advice since the very beginning of this outbreak. Two patients have died of coronavirus in northern France, bringing the death toll in the country to four, Le Parisien newspaper has said, citing the mayor of the city of Compi\u00e8gne and other sources. Reuters reports: \u201cAs of Monday, according to the latest information I have, there were another two deaths in the hospital of Compiegne,\u201d Philippe Marini, the mayor of Compiegne, was reported as saying by Le Parisien. As of Sunday, France had 130 confirmed cases of the flu-like disease. The French health ministry did not return calls for comment. A widespread halt in economic activity could put the viability of banks in question and spread financial disruption further, writes Tony Yates, an adviser at Resolution Foundation, for the Guardian\u2019s comment section. The first cases of coronavirus were recorded in China\u2019s landlocked Hubei province, which has a population of about 59 million. Despite the Covid-19 virus and the respiratory disease it causes starting out as a local healthcare problem, it has become a global and an economic one because of the ways in which humans are profoundly interconnected through the world\u2019s economy. The first kind of interconnectedness is the one epidemiologists study: the human travel network. How a disease spreads depends on the number of physical encounters, and the probability of the virus jumping from carrier to new host. These encounters, caused mostly by global air and sea travel, are the ones policymakers have been trying to stop, albeit belatedly. The second kind of interconnectedness that is transmitting economic pain out of China and other heavily affected countries is the global supply chain: the \u201cgoods network\u201d. China now accounts for 9.6% of total UK imports; Italy, 4.1%; South Korea, just 0.8%. But because of their positions in the global supply chain, the absence of what these countries produce \u2013 from semiconductors, computer chips, plastics and phone network hardware to automotive components \u2013 will be felt more broadly. Four more patients have tested positive for coronavirus in England, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to 40, PA Media quotes the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, as saying. A 29-year-old Russian man diagnosed with coronavirus has became the country\u2019s first citizen to be found ill with the disease while inside of the country, Andrew Roth reports from Moscow. David Berov, who had returned from a ski trip to northern Italy on 23 February and checked into a hospital several days later, had tested positive for the disease, Russian authorities said on Monday. Two tests had returned negative results before a third test showed Berov was indeed infected with the coronavirus. In a series of videos reposted by Russian media, Berov filmed scenes from his quarantine, where he was being held in a single room with other suspected coronavirus patients. \u201cWhen we got there we asked the medical staff why we are all lying together in the same room \u2013 any one of us could infect the others,\u201d Berov told the Moscow Times, an English-language newspaper, by phone from the hospital. Doctors at Moscow\u2019s Infectious Diseases hospital No 1 had later told him not to tell Russian health officials that he had been held in a single room with other suspected coronavirus patients, the paper said. So far, two Chinese citizens have been diagnosed with the disease in Russia and since released from hospital. Three Russians onboard the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship hit by the coronavirus while it was docked in Yokohama, Japan, have also tested positive for coronavirus. Russia has stepped up measures against coronavirus in recent days, banning entry to Chinese citizens and to most Iranian travellers, and also deploying dozens of medical staff clad in white protective suits to meet planes arriving from Italy. More than 200 suspected coronavirus patients have been admitted to hospital in Moscow alone, Russian authorities have said. The European Central Bank called off on Monday a joint event with the European Commission that was to take place on the following day, citing cancellations by participants as the region is hit by the coronavirus outbreak. The ECB said in a statement: The ECB has decided, in close consultation with the co-organising European Commission, to postpone for now the conference on European financial integration that was scheduled for Tuesday, 3 March 2020. Several cancellations by conference participants and otherwise increasingly challenging travel logistics have made it preferable to defer a physical meeting for now. The report publication will go ahead as planned. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has published an up to date list of cases of infection and fatality within the European economic area, the UK, San Marino, Monaco and Switzerland, Daniel Boffey reports. There have been 2,199 cases and 38 deaths reported: Italy (1,689), France (130), Germany (129), Spain (83), UK (36), Switzerland (24), Norway (19), Sweden (14), Austria (14), Netherlands (13), San Marino (8), Greece (7), Croatia (7), Finland (6), Denmark (4), the Czech Republic (3), Iceland (3), Romania (3), Belgium (2), Estonia (1), Ireland (1), Lithuania (1), Luxembourg (1) and Monaco (1). The EU organisation said that of the fatalities 35 deaths were in Italy; two deaths have been reported in France, and one death has been reported from San Marino. The Bank of England has promised to do whatever it can to shore up the economy against the impact of coronavirus after mounting anxiety about the disease sent stock markets into freefall, Rob Davies reports. The value of FTSE 100 companies slumped by \u00a3200bn last week, in tandem with a broader global sell-off in which global stock markets suffered their steepest falls since the 2008 financial crisis. However, Asian markets rallied overnight as investors gambled that central banks will respond by cutting interest rates to stimulate growth, offsetting the coronavirus effect. The UK\u2019s central bank joined the Bank of Japan in telling investors that it is keeping tabs on the situation and stands ready to use its monetary policy levers to promote financial stability. \u201cThe Bank is working closely with HM Treasury and the FCA [Financial Conduct Authority] \u2013 as well as our international partners \u2013 to ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability,\u201d a spokesman said. Health officials in Washington state said late on Sunday a nursing home resident had died after contracting coronavirus, while New York\u2019s governor confirmed his state\u2019s first positive case, Reuters reports. Late on Sunday, Florida declared a public health emergency as it confirmed its first two cases. Cases in Chicago and Rhode Island were also reported. The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has sent global markets falling as it quickly moves around the world. It appeared poised for a spike in the US, in part because of more testing to confirm cases. Trump administration officials worked on Sunday to soothe nerves and calm fears that a global recession is looming, arguing that the public and media were over-reacting and saying stocks would bounce back because the US economy was fundamentally strong. The total number of confirmed cases in the US is more than 75 with two reported deaths, both in Washington state. Globally there have been more than 87,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths in 60 countries, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). British guests at a quarantined hotel in Tenerife are being flown back to the UK after testing negative for coronavirus, Jet2holidays has said. PA Media has the story: Holidaymakers at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace had previously been told they would have to remain in quarantine until March 10, after at least four tourists were diagnosed with Covid-19. But travel operator Jet2holidays said on Monday that its customers at the hotel will return to the UK in the afternoon. It is understood that a number of other hotel guests were flown back on Sunday evening after testing negative for coronavirus. A Jet2holidays spokeswoman said: We are pleased to confirm that Jet2holidays customers at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace will be flying back to the UK with us on a dedicated flight this afternoon, following their negative test results for Covid-19 and subject to them showing no symptoms on departure. Nicky Bandini, the Guardian\u2019s Italian football correspondent, has written about the knock-on effects in Serie A after five matches were postponed over the weekend. Atalanta and Lecce did their best to pick up the slack on a weekend missing its headline act. Cagliari and Roma, too. For the second week running, Serie A\u2019s Sunday schedule was reduced to two games, with the rest all postponed amid disagreement over the appropriate response to Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreaks. This time, the cancellations included the Derby d\u2019Italia. No other match could capture the imagination like that one: Juventus taking on Internazionale in the first season when both have truly contested the title against one another for almost two decades. But the four teams who did take the field entertained us instead by combining for 16 goals. The spread of coronavirus in the UK is likely to worsen, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has warned. Speaking after an emergency Cobra meeting where ministers gathered to discuss a \u201cbattle plan\u201d to be published on Tuesday, Johnson reiterated advice from health authorities for people to wash their hands thoroughly. We have also agreed a plan so that if and when it starts to spread, as I\u2019m afraid it looks likely it will, we are in a position to take the steps necessary to contain the spread of the disease as far as we can, and to protect the most vulnerable. Johnson said closing schools and banning mass gatherings would only be taken upon scientific advice, adding: The most important thing for people to understand is that (measures) will be guided by scientific advice. All four nations of the UK and the chief medical officers are involved in this and they will be helping us to take key decisions on when and how to take protective steps. We cannot forget that the single most useful thing that we can all do to support the NHS is to wash our hands, two times to Happy Birthday with hot water. It\u2019s very important that people should continue (doing) that and they should go about business as usual. [Cross-posted from the politics live blog] The prime minister\u2019s spokesman is here. He starts by setting out the PM\u2019s day. He has just chaired a Cobra meeting on coronavirus, and done a clip for broadcasters. Later he will be hosting a World Cup day reception in No 10. Liz Truss has published negotiating objectives for the UK-US trade talks, he says. There will be a statement in the Commons this afternoon. In Brussels, the first round of negotiations with the EU starts at 1pm UK time. It will start with a meeting between David Frost, the prime minister\u2019s Europe adviser, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, which is due to last an hour. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is holding talks in Oman. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has confirmed that the government has taken over rail services on the Northern network.

Q: Will the military need to get involved? The spokesman says the government will take whatever steps are deemed helpful. Wall Street\u2019s most famous face is worried. Peter Tuchman, the trader whose Einstein-esque features are the most photographed on the floor of the New York stock exchange (NYSE), has not witnessed a sell-off as bad as this since the 2008 financial crisis. And he thinks it is going to get worse. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear here. A lot of confusion,\u201d Tuchman said at the end of a week when investor panic over the likely impact of the coronavirus had triggered the worst sell-off in US stock markets for a dozen years. Tuchman has been working at the world\u2019s most famous stock market for 35 years and his picture crops up in media worldwide whenever things go right or wrong. He first rose to prominence in 2008 when a picture of his fretful face came to symbolise panic on the stock markets. There he was just a few short weeks ago, positively beaming when the key Dow Jones stock market index crossed 29,000 for the first time. Tuchman was everywhere again last week as US markets crashed. In the US, health officials in Washington state say that a second person had died from the coronavirus, the Associated Press reports. The victim was a man in his 70s from a nursing facility near Seattle where dozens of people were sick and had been tested for the virus. According to AP: Researchers said earlier the virus may have been circulating for weeks undetected in Washington state. In a statement, Public Health Seattle &amp; King County said the man died Saturday. On Friday, health officials said a man in his 50s died of coronavirus, the first death from the virus in the US. Both had underlying health conditions, and both were being treated at a hospital in Kirkland, Washington, east of Seattle. Washington state now has 12 confirmed cases. State and local authorities stepped up testing for the illness as the number of new cases grew nationwide, with new infections announced in California, Florida, Illinois, Rhode Island, New York and Washington state. Authorities in the Seattle area reported four new cases Sunday night, including the man who died. Two health care workers in California were also diagnosed. Of the new Washington state cases, two were women, one in her 80s and another in her 90s. Both were in critical condition. A man in his 70s was also in critical condition. All three were from the LifeCare nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, where health officials said 50 people are sick and being tested for the virus. On Sunday night, the International Association of Fire Fighters said 25 members who responded to calls for help at the nursing facility are being quarantined. The number of known coronavirus cases in the US had reached at least 80 as of Sunday, counting people evacuated from a cruise ship and Wuhan. Trump said Saturday at a White House news conference that he was thinking about closing the southern border with Mexico as a precaution. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, is unhappy after he was excluded from the UK government\u2019s Cobra meeting to discuss the coronavirus outbreak, PA Media reports. A city hall source said people might think it was \u201ca bit strange\u201d he was not invited, given the size of London, its status as a global travel hub, its large transport network and its sport and entertainment venues. Khan is due to meet senior officials and health specialists from across the capital to review preparations for dealing with the outbreak. He said: \u201cI want to reassure Londoners that although the risk of coronavirus to individuals remains low, we are not complacent. I\u2019m in regular contact with Public Health England to ensure we have the latest advice and to monitor the impact on our city.\u201d For the benefit of our international readers, the UK government is led by the Conservative party, while Khan is a member of the opposition Labour party.

The number of confirmed cases in France jumped from 100 to 130 in 24 hours to Sunday evening, reports Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Paris. The director general of France\u2019s health service, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, gave the latest figures on Sunday evening. Of the 130 people who have contracted the virus, two have died, 116 are in hospital \u2013 nine of them in a serious condition \u2013 and 12 have recovered after treatment and have returned home. France has declared it is in \u201cStage 2\u201d of an epidemic. Stage 1 is attempting to avoid the virus entering the country. Stage 2 is attempting to avoid it spreading. The health authorities would only move to Stage 3 when it was considered impossible to mitigate the spread of the virus and necessary to introduce compulsory collective measures, such as the closure of schools and other public buildings. Salomon said this would be an \u201cobservational and not a political decision\u201d. \u201cThis epidemic, as we\u2019ve already seen with the flu or bronchiolitis, is not necessarily homogeneous. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll have a very adapted, pragmatic and reactive attitude depending on the territories,\u201d Salomon said. The new cases include two children aged one year and five years from Alsace in eastern France, who have been hospitalised in Strasbourg along with their 27-year-old mother who also tested positive. Their condition was described as not worrying. Salomon says French travellers should avoid journeys abroad outside the European Union unless necessary. He pointed out the death rate worldwide is 3.4% of confirmed cases. The Manga and Sci-Fi Show salon planned for next week, which was to have featured giant karaoke and K-pop concerts have been cancelled. Several schools and creches have been closed in the Morbihan in Brittany after a cluster of suspected coronavirus cases. This was announced shortly before midnight on Sunday. Most schools remain open, but students who travelled to areas considered risky, including China and northern Italy, have been asked to self-quarantine for two weeks. The Louvre will remain closed. The museum\u2019s staff have exercised their \u201cright to withdraw\u201d (their services). Apparently they called a meeting with management after concerns about the number of tourists, reportedly from Asia, entering the museum wearing masks. The European commission said there had been 2,100 people infected so far by Coronavirus, including 38 fatalities in 18 member states, as it raised its risk of contraction from low to moderate up to moderate to high, Daniel Boffey reports. Nearly 300 million people have gone back to work in China since the Lunar New Year break as more companies restart business and coronavirus travel restrictions ease, although many small firms are still struggling to find enough workers to run plants, Reuters reports. Indications from China are that the country has managed to get a handle on the coronavirus outbreak, with the numbers of new cases continuing to slow in the country, even as they accelerate elsewhere in the world. According to Reuters: Eighteen regions in mainland China have cut the emergency response level as of Monday, and authorities eased travel restrictions amid a sharp drop in new coronavirus infection cases. The flu-like epidemic has killed 2,912 people and infected more than 80,000 across the country. China transportation ministry data showed an average of 15.8 million passengers returned from their hometowns last week, the third week after the prolonged Lunar New Year break. That brings the total to 295 million people so far tracked by the ministry as having returned to their workplaces since the holiday, according to Reuters calculations based on transportation ministry data. Increasing traffic flows in big cities also indicate more commuting across the country. Location technology firm TOMTOM\u2019s traffic index shows congestion levels picked up noticeably in most major cities on Monday to their highest levels since the virus outbreak. Public transportation systems have also gotten busier. Of the 33 Chinese cities that have metro lines, only three have system restrictions still in place: Wuhan where the virus originated, Wenzhou in manufacturing hub Zhejiang province, and Urumchi in northwestern Xinjiang. Average daily passenger volumes at metros across the country reached 10.2 million last week, up 65.15% from a week earlier, according to data compiled by China Association of Metros. But air quality measures indicate China\u2019s industrial emissions remain well below normal. In the UK, cabinet ministers have been attending No 10 Downing Street for a Cobra national security committee meeting chaired by the prime minister, Boris Johnson. Health officials in Ireland are expected to decide on Monday whether to restrict mass gatherings, including the St Patrick\u2019s Day festival, Rory Carroll reports from Dublin. The possible curbs come as a secondary school in Dublin closed for two weeks to prevent the spread of infection after a pupil was identified as Ireland\u2019s first case of coronavirus. Health officials ordered the school to close after the student, who had returned recently from a mid-term visit to Italy, was diagnosed over the weekend. He is being treated in isolation at a Dublin hospital. Officials have not named the school, which has about 400 pupils, but several media outlets identified it. Pupils, staff and relatives have been asked to restrict their movements during the two weeks. The national public health emergency team is due to review potential curbs on public gatherings, including celebrations in the run-up to St Patrick\u2019s Day on 17 March. Tony Holohan, the chief medical officer at the department of health, told RTE he believed the risk of the Covid-19 infection spreading across Ireland is low. Last week, Northern Ireland reported its first confirmed case: a woman who returned from northern Italy, a coronavirus hotspot, via Dublin airport and travelled to Belfast by train. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, and Simon Harris, the health minister, discussed cross-border co-operation in a conference call with Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, the deputy first minister and Robin Swann, the health minister. Portugal registered its first two cases of the new coronavirus on Monday, SIC television channel reported. Reuters reports: SIC said one case was discovered in a man who had recently travelled to Italy and another one in a man who had returned from Spain. Both were taken to hospital in Porto. Health ministry officials were not immediately available for comment. An escalation in the coronavirus outbreak could cut global economic growth in half and plunge several countries into recession this year, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has warned. Sounding the alarm as the disease spreads around the world and rattles investors, the OECD said global GDP growth could plunge this year to as little as 1.5%, almost half the 2.9% rate it forecast before the outbreak took hold. Against a backdrop of already weak GDP growth, the economies of Japan and the eurozone could slide into recession this year, it added, while warning that failure in the UK\u2019s post-Brexit trade talks with the EU also represented a significant downside risk. The influential Paris-based group \u2013 which represents the 36 most advanced economies \u2013 urged governments around the world to take greater steps to work together, calling for an international response as Covid-19 spreads. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer has defended the decision to close a secondary school after it was confirmed a student was diagnosed with coronavirus. Dr Tony Holohan said the move to shut the school for two weeks was a \u201cproportionate measure\u201d. PA Media reports: Dr Holohan also said he believes the risk of the infection spreading in Ireland is still low. It was confirmed on Saturday night that the male student who lives in the east of the country contracted the virus in one of the affected areas of northern Italy. The school has been closed for 14 days from today, during which all pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements. Speaking on RTE\u2019s Morning Ireland, Dr Holohan said authorities are not naming the school to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the patient. Dr Holohan said health officials carried out an assessment of the case, which concluded in the closure of the school. \u201cWe felt this was a proportionate measure and I (want) to stress that we believe that the risk of transmission infection, even despite the contact, will still be low,\u201d he said. In a letter sent to parents from the HSE, it was confirmed that children, teachers and school staff have been advised to limit their social interactions, avoid social gatherings and not attend sporting events. \u201cThis measure is focused on the children, it\u2019s not focused on their families and it\u2019s not focused on the wider community,\u201d Dr Holohan added. \u201cEach of the parents will get a text message on each of the days of the incubation period, asking whether or not their child or staff member have symptoms and if they say yes to that text message they will have follow up engagement with public health doctors. \u201cThe purpose of that is to at the earliest possible stage identify another case.\u201d The global death toll from the coronavirus outbreak exceeded 3,000 on Monday as South Korea reported almost 500 new cases of the disease and a second person died in the US, Justin McCurry, the Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, reports. Covid-19 has now infected more than 88,000 people and spread to more than 60 countries after first emerging in China late last year. Indonesia, which has so far claimed to be virus-free, registered its first two cases on Monday. More than two months on, most cases and deaths are still confined to China, whose health commission reported 202 new infections on Monday \u2013 the lowest daily rise since late January \u2013 and 42 new deaths. Hubei province, where the outbreak has been concentrated, recorded 196 of the 202 new cases and all of the new deaths. The death toll in China rose to 2,912, but it is also creeping up in other countries. Iran has the second highest number of deaths, with 54, Australia reported its first Covid-19 death over the weekend. Infections nearly doubled over the weekend in Italy \u2013 Europe\u2019s hardest-hit country with nearly 1,700 cases. The number of cases in the US rose to at least 76 with two deaths, both in Washington state. The second victim was a man in his 70s who died on Saturday in a nursing home where several other people are infected, local health authorities said. Authorities in China have closed the first of 16 hospitals specially built in Wuhan to tackle the coronavirus epidemic, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has said. According to Reuters: News of the closure coincided with a sharp fall in new cases in Hubei province and its capital of Wuhan but China remained on alert for people returning home with the virus from other countries where it has spread. \u201cThe rapid rising trend of virus cases in Wuhan has been controlled,\u201d Mi Feng, a spokesman for China\u2019s national health commission told a briefing. \u201cOutbreaks in Hubei outside of Wuhan are curbed and provinces outside of Hubei are showing a positive trend.\u201d The virus emerged in Wuhan late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, the majority in China, with most in Hubei. Paul Cosford, the emeritus medical director of Public Health England, who we reported earlier as telling Good Morning Britain that the UK could expect to see widespread coronavirus infection \u201cfairly soon\u201d, has also been speaking on the Today programme this morning. Cosford told today that there will come a point \u201cwhere we reduce social contact if we see more widespread transmission\u201d. I think the increase in number that we are seeing, coupled with the increases in countries nearby in Europe and of course in south-east Asia, do make it much more likely we will get more widespread transmission in the UK. It\u2019s still the case that the vast majority of the cases we\u2019ve got in the UK, we can trace a link to countries where there\u2019s infection and people returning from those countries, but we\u2019ve not been able to identify that in every single case now, so that\u2019s something we are looking at extremely carefully to understand where the source of those infections may be. I think we now have to expect there to be more widespread infection in the UK that we will need to deal with. We\u2019ve got to be prepared for that. We\u2019re not there yet but we\u2019ve got to be prepared for it, and it will give us some challenges.\u201d Cosford said, however, that it was important that people remembered the infection was mild in most cases. The vast majority of people will make a recovery from it and it is a relatively mild illness. Children and otherwise healthy adults seem to be at much lower risk of getting into serious complications you get with this sort of disease. It\u2019s older people and people with severe underlying conditions that we will be particularly concerned about. People in Israel are voting in a national election today and the government has set up 16 special voting booths for roughly 5,000 people who are in precautionary home isolation, Oliver Holmes, the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, reports. The polling stations are small tents made of plastic sheeting, with staff in full protective suits. Ten Israelis in total have contracted the virus and have been quarantined. The health ministry, however, has said it does not see a threat to the general public from voting today and urged people to go out. Police are also on alert as there are fears some people might spread false reports about coronavirus to suppress votes for their opponents. India said on Monday two people in the country had tested positive for coronavirus. According to Reuters: One case was detected in the capital, New Delhi, while the other was in the southern state of Telangana, the government said in a statement. The patients had a travel history from Italy and the United Arab Emirates, respectively, the statement said. Both patients were stable and being closely monitored. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany has risen to 150 on Monday from 129 on Sunday, Reuters reports the Robert Koch Institute for disease control as saying. More than half of the cases, 86, are in the western region of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, where several schools and daycare centres will be closed on Monday to try to prevent the spread of the virus after staff members tested positive. Iraq has detected two new coronavirus patients, both of whom had recently visited Iran, the Health Ministry said on Monday, bringing the total cases recorded so far to 21, Reuters reports. The news agency goes on: The two new cases were detected in Baghdad and had recently returned from Iran, the ministry said in a statement. The first case was detected on Tuesday and was of an Iranian student who has since been sent back home. The other 20 are all Iraqis who had recently been in Iran. Public Health England\u2019s emeritus medical director, Paul Cosford, says the UK can expect to see widespread coronavirus infection \u201cfairly soon.\u201d Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Cosford said: The extent of infection we are seeing in other countries suggests it is likely that we will see more widespread infection in the UK and that is what we have to be prepared for. We should expect at times that might be quite challenging for us, it is therefore very important that we do everything we can to reduce the spread of infection. At the moment, the vast majority of cases we see in the UK are still linked to countries where there is more widespread infection, either in Italy or south east Asia. It is true to say there is a small number now where it is much more difficult to find that link, and that is leading us to think we may well see more widespread infection in the UK fairly soon. It could happen in the next few days or it could take a little longer. In the UK, Jonathon Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, says he would support shutting down cities to control the spread of coronavirus. Ahead of a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra national security committee this morning, to be chaired by the prime minister, Ashworth told BBC Breakfast this morning that he wanted greater clarity from the government about its next steps. He said Labour would support shutting down cities to prevent the spread of Covid-19 within the UK, \u201cif the medical advice and the scientific advice is to take measures along those lines.\u201d Ashworth went on: It would be a move by Government so drastic that we hadn\u2019t seen it. And I\u2019m not sure how practical it could be in reality. However this virus is serious and appears to spread very easily and we need to contain it and slow down the spread. If the medical advice is to do something like that then of course we should support it. That is why I am keen, however, that Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, comes to the House of Commons today after the Cobra meeting to update MPs on plans. We just need clarity from Government. Concern is growing among campaigners that vital UN climate talks will be derailed by the coronavirus outbreak, while government officials are working to find ways round the problem, reports Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. This year\u2019s UN talks on the climate are the most important since the Paris agreement in 2015, as the world is now far adrift of the Paris goals and the Cop26 summit \u2013 scheduled for Glasgow this November \u2013 is seen as one of the last chances to put nations back on track to avoid climate breakdown. But while the talks will take place over a fortnight in November, the frantic round of global diplomacy required to reach a settlement is already under way and is being affected by the outbreak of the virus. Campaigners fear that preparations are being hampered by both the travel restrictionsand the urgent demands the outbreak is putting on governments\u2019 time and resources. China, the world\u2019s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, is the key player in the climate talks. As the US is withdrawing from the Paris accord, whether or not China takes on strong new commitments on carbon will help determine whether Cop26 (the conference of the parties) is a success. But with the coronavirus taking hold across the country, the climate is likely be much less of a priority. Italy also plays a vital role in this year\u2019s talks as the country is officially co-host of Cop26 and some key pre-meetings are planned there. Normally, at this stage before crunch climate talks, officials and politicians from the host nation would be convening meetings in key countries. A member of the council that advises Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, has died today after falling sick with Covid-19, the Associated Press reports, citing Iranian state radio. Expediency council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi, 71, died at a Tehran hospital of the virus, making him the the first top official to succumb to the illness that is affecting members of the Islamic Republic\u2019s leadership. The council advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as settles disputes between the supreme leader and parliament, according to AP. The agency\u2019s report continues: His death comes as other top officials have contracted the virus in Iran, which has the highest death toll in the world after China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Those sick included include Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, better known as Sister Mary, the English-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and sparked the 444-day hostage crisis, state media reported. Also sick is Iraj Harirchi, the head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who tried to downplay the virus before falling ill. Iran has reported 978 confirmed cases of the new virus with 54 deaths from the illness it causes, called COVID-19. Across the wider Mideast, there are over 1,150 cases of the new coronavirus, the majority of which are linked back to Iran. Experts worry Iran\u2019s percentage of deaths to infections, around 5.5%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be much higher than current figures show. Trying to stem the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Iran on Monday held an online-only briefing by its Foreign Ministry. Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi opened the online news conference addressing the outbreak, dismissing an offer of help for Iran by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. A school in London, UK, Wimbledon College, is to close for at least a week and undergo a deep clean after a member of staff tested positive for coronavirus. According to a letter to parents, the member of staff, who had recently travelled to Italy, was last in school on 25 February and has not had contact with pupils since the new half-term began. \u201cHowever, as some staff members are now classed as close contacts of a confirmed case of Covid-19 they are required to self-isolate as a precautionary measure for 14 days,\u201d the letter says. As a result, the school is low on staff and must close. G7 countries will take \u201cconcerted action\u201d to limit the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on economic growth and their finance ministers will discuss by phone this week how best to act, the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Monday. According to Reuters: \u201cThere will be a concerted action. Yesterday I spoke with the G7 president, the US. Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and this week we will have a meeting by phone of the finance G7 ministers to coordinate our responses,\u201d Le Maire told France 2 television. He also said that eurozone finance ministers would be in touch with each other and that he would speak with the ECB chief, Christine Lagarde. \u201cWe must act so that this impact that we know will be important on growth, be as limited as possible,\u201d he added. Le Maire said that when the coronavirus outbreak was limited to China, he had expected the crisis to shave 0.1 percentage points off French economic growth this year. \u201cNow that the outbreak is reaching other countries, the impact on French growth will be much more significant,\u201d he said, adding it was too early to provide a new figure. He reiterated that the hotel, restaurant, air transport and event industries were the worst hit sectors in France. As of Sunday, France has 130 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the head of the public health service, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, said on Sunday, raising the count from 100 a day earlier. A medical worker from the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre is one of three people confirmed to have coronavirus in Hertfordshire, UK, the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust has confirmed. The trust said the risk to patients and staff at the centre in Northwood is very low. Patients were told they should continue to attend appointments. In a statement on its website, the trust said: We are very well-prepared for incidents like this and the NHS and Public Health England are taking all necessary steps to manage the situation. All individuals who were in contact with the clinician have been identified and the appropriate measures taken. The risk to patients and staff at Mount Vernon Cancer Centre is very low and we are working with individual patients to appropriately manage their care. We would like to offer assurance that it remains safe for patients to attend Mount Vernon Cancer Centre as normal and ask patients to attend scheduled outpatients appointments. This is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog from London, where concerns are beginning to grow about the domestic spread of Covid-19, following a weekend in which the number of people infected in the UK climbed to 36. Later this morning, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is to chair a meeting of the UK government\u2019s Cobra national security committee regarding the coronavirus. There is \u201clittle doubt\u201d coronavirus will present a \u201csignificant challenge\u201d for the UK, Johnson will tell those signing off the government\u2019s battle plan to fight the disease. That\u2019s expected at about 10.30am. Also today, a leading union is to warn that outsourced hospital staff, including cleaners, porters and caterers, are being forced to work while ill because of lack of sick pay, even in the face of the coronavirus crisis. As usual, throughout the day I will be posting the latest coronavirus news from the Guardian\u2019s global network of correspondents, while also keeping you notified of the latest breaking news from the wire agencies. But I can\u2019t do it all without your help, so if you have any news, tips, questions or suggestions, please let me know, either via email at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. It\u2019s been a very busy news day on this live coverage of coronavirus. Here are the main points: Australia has announced its first two cases of local transmission of Covid-19. Two people have died in the US \u2013 both in Washington state \u2013 and New York state has recorded its first case of Covid-19. Indonesia reports its first two cases. South Korea infections pass 4,000, with 22 fatalities. China reports 202 new cases, with 42 new deaths. Italy has confirmed 34 deaths from the virus. Iran raised its death toll from 43 to 54 with confirmed infections rising by more than half to 978. Nike will close its European headquarters in the Netherlands on Monday and Tuesday after an employee was infected with the coronavirus, the Dutch news agency ANP said. Citing an internal email, ANP reported overnight that the office in Hilversum would be disinfected. The employee was staying home in isolation for 14 days, it said. Roughly 2,000 employees from 80 countries work at the site. A Nike representative could not immediately be reached for comment. Dutch health authorities have reported 10 coronavirus infections since 28 February. Chant is talking about the risk in Iran and from people who have been to Iran: \u201cIt\u2019s probably equivalent (risk) to the risk we have seen in Wuhan\u201d \u2013 the centre of the outbreak in China. Kerry Chant is now talking about how they identify close contacts with confirmed cases. She says health authorities are working through the process of getting in touch with contacts of people diagnosed. There\u2019s particular concern with regards to the health worker who has been diagnosed and who he has been in contact with. She says it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if the healthcare worker had been in contact with people over 65 years of age. Hazzard has taken the floor again. He tells people he is not changing anything he is doing at the moment in his day to day life. He suggests people stop shaking hands as a greeting, and instead pat each other on the back. \u201cIt would be sensible not to shake hands\u201d. Hazzard also tells people to \u201cexercise some degree of caution\u201d when kissing. We\u2019re now hearing from Kerry Chant, the chief medical officer for the state of New South Wales. She applauds the family for coming forward to be tested. Both members are now in Westmead hospital in Sydney. She\u2019s now talking about the male healthcare worker. They are unsure how he has acquired the virus. They are now tracing his close contacts. The infected man is in ICU. Brad Hazzard, the New South Wales health minister is now speaking. He confirms that there are three new cases of Covid-19 in the case, taking the total to 9. One of the new cases was a man who arrived from Iran on Saturday, the day before the travel ban on entry from Iran began. The man\u2019s sister has also been confirmed as having the virus. She had not travelled to Iran so, he says it appears she caught the infection in NSW. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that the transmission has occurred from her brother,\u201d Hazzard says. A 53-year-old health worker has also tested positive. Hazzard says that case is likely the second likely case of \u201cperson-to-person transmission\u201d. The health worker has continued worked and NSW health is now looking at where he has been working and who he has been working with. He says there are no indications that anyone else is infected at the moment. We are about to hear from the health minister in the Australian state of New South Wales, Brad Hazzard, and the state\u2019s chief health officer, Kerry Chant. Australia now has 30 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The numbers are moving very quickly ... the last four (at least) cases of the virus were in people entering the country from Iran. Australia reported its first death from the virus on Sunday \u2013 a 78-year-old passenger who was repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The state of Tasmania recorded its first case of Covid-19 today. That person had returned from Iran. We understand that this first case of transmission between people is from a patient to a doctor, and we will confirm that shortly. All other cases have been people who have contracted the virus outside Australia. The confirmation of two coronavirus cases in Indonesia - the first to be reported in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country - follows mounting concern that the country is failing to identify transmission of the virus. Health experts have warned that the lack of confirmed patients in Indonesia, a country of 272 million people, was surprising, especially given its close links to China. Last month, researchers at Harvard University analysed air traffic from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak originated, and concluded case numbers were lower than expected. They also raised concerns about other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand and Cambodia. At the time, Indonesian health minister Terawan Agus Putranto called the study \u201cinsulting\u201d. Further concerns were raised when New Zealand and Malaysia reported that patients who tested positive for their disease within their borders had recently traveled to Indonesia. On Saturday, Ary Hermawan of the Jakarta Post, questioned whether officials were being transparent, adding that the government appeared more worried \u201cabout the social and economic impact of a mass hysteria created by the virus outbreak than the outbreak itself\u201d. Indonesia\u2019s Balitbangkes, the sole agency tasked with testing suspected coronavirus patients, had only concluded around 140 lab tests, he wrote. \u201cTo put things in perspective, as of 26 February, the United Kingdom has conducted 7,132 tests, 13 of which have come back positive.\u201d Details of the two cases confirmed by officials on Monday are not yet known, though Indonesian President Joko Widodo said both patients were Indonesians and that they had been hospitalised. On Sunday Australia updated its travel restrictions for people arriving from Iran. You need to isolate yourself in your home or hotel if you have been: in or transited through Iran on or after 1 March 2020 transited through mainland China (not including Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan) in the past 14 days. It also advises to self-isolate if you have been: in contact with a person sick with COVID-19 infection in mainland China in the past 14 days We are hearing reports that Australian health authorities say there has been the first case of community transmission in the country. We are expecting a news conference from the health authorities in the state of New South Wales shortly. On the reports of empty shelves in Coles and Woolworths as a result of people stockpiling food in Australia as a result of coronavirus, both supermarkets say there has been an increase in long-life product sales but say they\u2019re well equipped. A spokeswoman for Coles said the company had boosted deliveries this week to increase stock of long-life food and healthcare products. \u201cLike many retailers, we currently have a shortage of some antibacterial handwashes and hand sanitiser products due to high customer demand. We are continuing to work with our suppliers to maintain availability for customers.\u201d A spokesman for Woolworths said they\u2019ve been restocking shelves after the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a sharp increase in demand for long life pantry items and household staples in recent days, which has led to partial stock shortages across some of our stores,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have good stock levels to draw on in our distribution centres and will continue working closely with our suppliers to maintain supply.\u201d In case some of you may have missed this from Friday, the New England Journal of Medicine published its latest report on the coronavirus, in which it extracted data regarding 1,099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China through January 29, 2020. You can read the whole study here, but here are the main points: The median age of the patients was 47 years and 41.9% of the patients were female. 0.9% of the patients were younger than 15 years of age. 5% were admitted to intensive care, and 1.4% died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact with wildlife. The most common symptoms were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalisation) and cough (67.8%). Among the overall population, 23.7% had at least one coexisting illness (e.g. hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). On admission, the degree of severity of Covid-19 was categorised as non-severe in 926 patients and severe in 173 patients. The median incubation period was 4 days. Many did not have abnormal radiologic findings (X-ray/CT scan). A majority of the patients (58.0%) received intravenous antibiotic therapy, and 35.8% received oseltamivir therapy. Oxygen therapy was administered in 41.3% and mechanical ventilation in 6.1%; higher percentages of patients with severe disease received these therapies Thailand has reported one new coronavirus case, bringing the total number of such cases in the country to 43 since January, a senior health official said on Monday. The new case is a 22-year-old Thai woman who works with another Thai patient, a Thai driver for foreign tourists, Sukhum Kanchanaphimai, the permanent secretary of the health ministry, said in a news conference. So far 31 coronavirus patients have recovered and returned home and 11 are still being treated in hospitals. We are hearing that the Australian state of Tasmania has its first coronavirus case, a 40-year-old man who travelled from Iran, via Melbourne to Launceston. People on the same flight as the man are being contacted by health authorities. He arrived in Tasmania on Saturday, prior to restrictions on entry from Iran being introduced. Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Monday two Indonesians had tested positive for coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country. The two had been hospitalised, Widodo told reporters at the presidential palace in Jakarta. He did not specify where the patients were being treated. Shares across Asia Pacific have returned to positive territory after a week of heavy losses on the hope of stimulus measures from central banks. In Japan the Nikkei is up 1.4% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong has risen 0.9%. In Shanghai the Composite is up nearly 3% while Seoul is 0.9% to the good. Australia\u2019s ASX200 is still off 1% but that\u2019s an improvement on earlier when it plunged 2.7%. The Aussie dollar, a China proxy, has been under pressure for weeks but recovered slightly to US65.25c. The FTSE100 is expected to bounce by 1.89% this morning, according to futures trading. Wall Street is seen opening up 0.34%. The US Fed is widely expected to cut rates by 50 basis points when its policy makers meet on 17-18th of this month \u2013 if not before. It\u2019s priced in, as traders say. Australia\u2019s Reserve Bank will most likely get there first with a cut of at least 0.25% when it convenes its monthly monetary policy tomorrow. The Bank of Japan said on Monday that it would take all action possible to stabilise financial markets. US bond yields, which we talked about earlier, have recovered a bit as well. It\u2019s a crucial part of the markets equation. Allianz chief economist Mohamed El-Erian says it shows there will be a lot of volatility around when the European and US markets start up later. And in case you\u2019re wondering, the Vix volatility index, sometimes called the \u201cfear index\u201d, is up slightly to 40.11. Australian officials have been telling people there\u2019s no need to stock up on essentials due to the coronavirus. But it would seem many are not listening. Below are some pictures from Woolworths supermarket in Northbridge, on Sydney\u2019s lower North Shore. The photos were taken at around 3pm. A store employee said many of the aisles in the photos had been empty for a few hours. One shopper said it was so busy it felt like trying to buy goods on Christmas eve. The Chinese city of Shenzen, which borders Hong Kong, has identified its first case of imported coronavirus. The China Daily says the male patient surnamed Sun, 35, flew from London to Hong Kong on 27 February, where he took a ferry to cross the Shekou port to arrive in Shenzhen the next day, according to the Shenzhen Municipal Health Commission. Sun has been working in Bristol in the United Kingdom for the past two years and has not traveled to Hubei before, the outlet said. Beijing reported two imported coronavirus cases from Iran on Sunday, the first in the capital since the outbreak began in Wuhan. Ningxia Hui autonomous region confirmed two imported cases from Iran last week. Sumo wrestling has become the latest sport to be affected by the coronavirus outbreak, after officials decided that the spring tournament would be held behind closed doors. \u201cTo those many who were looking forward to this, we are sorry for this huge inconvenience,\u201d Hakkaku, the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, told reporters. \u201cThere were various viewpoints, but there was an absolute desire to hold it for the sake of the fans.\u201d The tournament, which opens in Osaka next Sunday, will be televised by public broadcaster NHK, but will be canceled if a wrestler is found to have contracted the virus, Hakkaku added, according to Kyodo news agency. The decision to ban spectators from the 15-day tournament - one of six major sumo competitions held throughout the year - comes after Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said sports and cultural events should be cancelled or scaled down until the middle of the month. Preseason baseball games are being played in empty stadiums through to 15 March, while Japan\u2019s professional football league said that all 94 matches scheduled to run through to the same date would be postponed. Rugby\u2019s Top League has postponed 16 matches, while the Japan Racing Association is holding horse races without spectators, and keirin cycling races are being held behind closed doors until 11 March. On Sunday, just a few hundred elite runners took part in the Tokyo Marathon, after 38,000 amateur runners were told they would not be able to participate. Members of the public had been discouraged from turning out to watch the race, which last year drew more than a million spectators. While Tokyo 2020 organisers insist there are no plans to cancel this summer\u2019s Olympics, the coronavirus has disrupted preparations for the Games, due to open on 24 July. Last week, Tokyo postponed training for Olympic volunteers and Toshiro Muto, chief executive of the organising committee, said it would scale back the torch relay, due to begin in Fukushima in late March. South Australia plans to amend its Public Health Act to allow for the compulsory quarantine of people with coronavirus. Premier Steven Marshall announced the move on Monday, saying: My number one priority is the safety of all South Australians. This is about getting on the front foot and making sure we have the legislative necessities in place as soon as possible. The move has the support of the state\u2019s Chief Public Health Officer, Nicola Spurrier, who said it would provide \u201cclarity\u201d about government powers. The proposed amendments will allow the chief public health officer to say where a particular person should be detained for quarantine purposes, and allow for the police to be called in our court orders issued to ensure compliance. Sixteen temporary hospitals have been set up in gyms and other buildings in Wuhan in China\u2019s central Hubei province to cope with demand caused by the coronavirus. These images of some of one of those temporary hospitals, Wuhan Living Room Temporary Hospital, were taken last week but released today. The captain of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Gennaro Arma, has been praised by passengers for his frequent messages and strong leadership during their gruelling quarantine. In a profile of Arma by AFP (which you can read here), the Italian says the experience gave him \u201ca few grey hairs.\u201d In one of his updates to the ship\u2019s 2,600 passengers, he said: For all of you who are concerned about me, I\u2019m extremely moved by your kindness and I\u2019d like to reassure you all that I\u2019m absolutely fine. I\u2019m very much the same captain that I was 12 days ago, just with the addition of a few new grey hairs. Here is a bit more information about the second person to die from Covid-19 in the US, who was a patient at the Life Care Centre of Kirkland nursing home in Washington State. That nursing home is under close monitoring after five residents and a staff member tested positive to the virus, and 50 more showed respiratory symptoms, Hallie Golden reports. One of the confirmed cases is a woman in her 70s, who is in a serious condition. The man who died was also in his 70s. There are 108 residents and 180 staff members at the aged care home, and officials said that 27 residents and 25 staff members had respiratory symptoms. They are all being tested for coronavirus. More than two dozen firefighters and police who have responded to calls at the centre over the past two weeks have also been placed under isolation. Dr Jeff Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King county, said he \u201cwould not be surprised to find additional cases\u201d among residents. We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people, as we would be wherever people who are susceptible might be gathering. The Australian Academy of Science has published a fact-check video on the coronavirus with Professor Raina MacIntyre, a global biosecurity expert and head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales. MacIntyre said this about how the virus spreads, and why global health agencies keep telling you to wash your hands: We know that the load of virus, the number of viruses you can find, is higher in the lungs, deep in the lungs, than in the throat or the nose. But we also know that like Sars and Mers coronavirus is spread by droplets... large respiratory droplets coming from the throat and the nose. [It also spreads] through contact. So contaminated surfaces. If someone has coughed or sneezed on a handrail or a table or a chair and you put your hand there you can then infect yourself. Health officials in Washington state have confirmed another death from coronavirus \u2013 the second in the US and the state. A man in his 70s with underlying health conditions who had been hospitalised with Covid-19 died on Saturday at a Kirkland nursing facility, Public Health \u2013 Seattle &amp; King County said on Sunday local time. A man in his 50s who died on Saturday in King County after contracting the virus was the first US fatality. The department said three other new reported cases are older people in critical condition, Reuters reported. In total, 10 cases have been reported in King County. All of the four new cases were residents of a Kirkland nursing facility that reported two prior cases. With regards to South Korea, the Australian government is advising people to \u201creconsider your need to travel\u201d to Daegu and Cheongdo, the centre of the infections. I\u2019m just looking at the detailed advice for Australians travelling to Italy. The Level 3 advice (\u201creconsider your need to travel\u201d) to northern Italy includes 10 towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto. Lombardy towns: Codogno Castiglione d\u2019Adda Casalpusterlengo Fombio Maleo Somaglia Bertonico Terranova dei Passerini Castelgerundo and San Fiorano Veneto: Vo\u2019 Euganeo Outside that area, the advice is Level 2, which is \u201cexercise a high degree of caution\u201d. Murphy says the travel ban is a way of slowing things down. He says in Italy and South Korea the outbreaks are confined and localised and that travel bans were not needed for those countries at the moment. In the case of Iran are very such a high risk that a travel ban is worth doing it because it will slow it down the number of cases. We\u2019re now hearing from Brendan Murphy, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer. He emphasises the risk from travel to Iran. I think as we have been saying for some time, these additional cases that we have seen over the weekend from Iran were expected and I think as we also said over the weekend we had a very high index suspicion that the caseload in a run was much greater than being reported, because of the death rate. Murphy says the most important thing for anyone coming from an area of risk is to monitor their health and isolate if they become unwell, with any sort of flu-like symptoms, contact their doctor or the hospital and let them know. \u201cThat is the time when people are most infectious is when they are symptomatic,\u201d he says. The most important thing, anyone who has come back from a country with a COVID-19 outbreak who gets unwell in any way, please isolate yourself and contact medical advice. Greg Hunt also says they are changing entry advice to Japan for people travelling home from Italy or South Korea. The chief health and medical offices have recommended that if you are returning from Italy or South Korea, and you work as a healthcare worker, or as a residential aged care worker, you should not attend your regular work for 14 days. That is an additional level of protection which has been advised by the Chief health and medical offices and accepted by the Australian government. We\u2019re now hearing a press conference from Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. He says coronavirus is now in 67 countries globally. Australia has 29 cases, he says: 15 who had travelled from China, 10 cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship (including one man who died on Sunday). In addition there are four cases of people who have travelled from Iran. They are all under treatment and are tracing people who may have been in contact with them. He announces the Australian travel advice to Italy has changed: \u201cThat has been raised to level two for the whole of the country. And Level three for selected towns in the north of. Level two means it has a high degree of awareness and Level three is to reconsider traveller.\u201d We\u2019re getting new figures on South Korea .... 476 new cases taking their total number of infections to 4,212. The country has also recorded 22 fatalities, a jump of 4 from yesterday. It\u2019s believed 60% of confirmed cases are linked to a branch of Shincheonji religious sect in the southeastern city of Daegu. Despite that poor Chinese data, stocks markets are recovering across Asia Pacific on the prospect of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve that we referred to earlier. The Nikkei is Tokyo is up 0.28%, the Kospi in Seoul is up 0.95%, the Hang Seng has risen 0.7% at the opening and Shanghai is up 1.2%. Oil has also rebounded on hopes of a production cut by Opec. Chinese factory activity slumped to its sharpest contraction on record, according to a survey released on Monday, after the virus crippled manufacturing in February. The closely watched Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) tumbled to 40.3 last month, the lowest level since the survey began in 2004, and down sharply from the 51.1 reading in January, Reuters reports. The 50 mark separates growth from contraction. It follows official PMI data on Saturday that showed a reading of 35. it tracks larger companies while the Caixin PMI tracks smaller companies. The number was much worse than expected by forecasters and even worse than the depths of the financial crisis in 2008-09. The online giant Amazon has confirmed that two of its employees in Milan have tested positive for coronavirus. New York state has confirmed its first coronavirus case, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Twitter Sunday evening, calling on residents to remain calm and not have any \u201cundue anxiety.\u201d Cuomo said the patient is a woman in her 30s who contracted the virus while traveling abroad in Iran. He said the woman is in quarantine in her home. \u201cThe patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in a serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York,\u201d a Cuomo statement said. \u201cThere is no cause for surprise \u2013 this was expected. As I said from the beginning, it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York.\u201d Cuomo added that the \u201cgeneral risk remains low in New York\u201d. We\u2019re seeing a news conference from the Australian city of Melbourne, where more cases of Covid-19 have been detected. Four new virus cases were confirmed on the weekend in people returning from Iran before the ban on entry from Iran was imposed in Australia. New South Wales health authorities confirmed the state\u2019s fifth and six cases as a man in his 40s and a woman in her 50s who both returned to Sydney from Iran. The two cases are not connected, and they arrived on different days. New cases in Victoria and Queensland also came from Iran. A Victorian woman was confirmed as testing positive on Sunday after landing in Melbourne on Friday. In Queensland, a 63-year-old Gold Coast beautician was confirmed as having the virus on Saturday after arriving on Monday. Brett Sutton, the chief health officer for the state of Victoria said people who are asked to isolate themselves need to think about how they can organise access to necessities: People don\u2019t need to rush out and purchase goods in a rush, currently. We are telling people to go about their normal lives. But they do need to think about what it would mean, should they become a case, should they be infected with Covid-19, and therefore need to isolate at home for two or three weeks, or indeed to look after a carer for two or three weeks at home. So what are the things that they need to think about in order to manage the situation? Pet food? Food for themselves. Understand how to care for themselves. Understand how others could care for them should they require it, or if they have emergencies. That doesn\u2019t require rushing out to a supermarket today or this week, but it does require you to think about it, make some plans and understand what your needs are. If that\u2019s medicines, food, other consumables, then that\u2019s reasonable to plan for, and to maybe bring that into your purchasing over the next couple of weeks. South Korea is the worst affected countries outside of China in terms of coronavirus cases. We are waiting today\u2019s update, but as of Sunday, 3,736 people were infected, with 17 deaths. A large proportion of the cases are connected to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu. The leader of the group, Lee Man-hee, was tested on Staruday and is awaiting results, according to the Yonhap news agency. Earlier, the group said he has been talks with a local public health centre over scheduling his test but corrected this to say that he had already taken the test, Yonhap said. Lee has been in self-quarantine at his home in Gyeonggi Province, near Seoul. Nearly 95% of the church\u2019s 239,000 followers had been tested for Covid-19 as of Saturday, Yonhap says. Of them, 8,563 members and 393 \u201ctrainees\u201d have shown symptoms, according to the authorities. Here\u2019s an excerpt of Yonhap\u2019s report: Some 4,000 Shincheonji followers across the country have not been reached, so local governments have been working together with police to trace them, they group added. In a statement addressed to South Korea\u2019s political leaders Sunday, Shincheonji asked them to stop portraying the sect as a criminal organisation. \u201cWe\u2019re working with regional authorities the best we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to ask for your help so that we\u2019ll continue to remain cooperative in these efforts.\u201d The Seoul metropolitan government, however, referred the case to the prosecution, demanding an investigation into Lee and 12 heads of the sect\u2019s branches for alleged homicide, infliction of injury and violating regulations on preventing infections. \u201cThey have refused to undergo tests for the virus, and they have not taken any measures to have its believers cooperate with the authorities to prevent the spread of COVID-19,\u201d the city said, explaining reasons for the move. The group is also suspected of providing inaccurate lists of its followers, which would constitute the obstruction of business of authorities, according to the city. As for the group\u2019s claim that leader Lee underwent the virus test, city officials said it is yet to be officially confirmed. The Chinese health commission\u2019s daily national briefing has reported 202 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 42 new deaths. The total confirmed cases has passed 80,000 for the first time. Of the 80,026 confirmed cases, 44,462 (56%) have recovered and 2,912 (or 3.6%) have died. Hubei province, where the outbreak has been concentrated, recorded 196 of the 202 new cases and all of the new deaths. One more post on Australian interest rates. The doyen of economic forecasters, Bill Evans of Westpac bank, says developments over the weekend over the coronavirus impact have prompted him to change his prediction froman April cut to tomorrow. He sees the RBA cutting the cash rate by 25 basis points tomorrow to 0.5%, and then again in April to take the rate to 0.25%. The WHO chief has said the spread of the coronavirus to countries with weaker health systems is \u201cone of our biggest concerns\u201d. On Sunday the organisation released US$15 million from its Central Emergency Response Fund to help fund global efforts to contain the COVID-19 virus. The same day the WHO upgraded the global risk assessment for Covid-19 as \u201cvery high\u201d \u2013 its highest level. We\u2019ve seen the stock markets crashing for a week now. While that\u2019s bad if you hold shares and have a lot of your pension funds invested in equities, other movements on the financial markets are arguably more significant, especially the continued fall in US government bond yields. The implied yield on US 10-Year Treasury futures traded below 1% for the first time on Monday morning. This is because investors are dumping risky assets like shares and buying government securities. But more demand pushes up the price of bonds, forcing down the yield, or interest paid on them. The result is that interest rate cuts in Australia \u2013 where the Reserve Bank meets on Tuesday \u2013 and the US are a near-certainty. Here\u2019s Michael McCarthy again from CMC Markets: The surge in bond yields comes ahead of tomorrow\u2019s Reserve Bank of Australia board meeting. Short-term markets indicate traders think an interest rate cut tomorrow is a virtual certainty. The combination of lower interest rate expectations and tumbling commodity prices propelled AUD/USD to a new eleven-year low this morning. Factory activity in China contracted at the fastest pace ever in February, even worse than during the global financial crisis, highlighting the colossal damage from the coronavirus outbreak on the world\u2019s second-largest economy, Reuters reports. China\u2019s official Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) fell to a record low of 35.7 in February from 50.0 in January, the National Bureau of Statistics said, well below the 50-point mark that separates monthly growth from contraction. The data foreshadows that the economic disruption from the virus will likely extend to the whole first quarter of 2020 since the disease outbreak has caused widespread transport curbs and required tough public health measures that have paralysed economic activity. \u201cWe expect year-on-year growth in all activity data to be negative in January-February as China\u2019s economy has been severely constrained since 23 January,\u201d said analysts at Nomura in a note, citing the extended lunar new year holiday and the slow resumption of businesses. Trading has started in Tokyo where the Nikkei is down 1.3% in the first few minutes. It\u2019s not all bad though \u2013 the Kospi index in Seoul is up 0.5%. Egypt\u2019s has recorded its second case of Covid-19. A statement on Facebook from the health ministry said it was a foreign citizen, who was taken to an isolation unit in hospital and was receiving the necessary medical care. Egypt\u2019s first case was also a foreign national, who was the first confirmed case of Covid-19 on the African continent. Cases in Algeria and Nigeria were announced last week. We\u2019re now seeing the Australian market has dropped 2.7%. The Japanese markets are about to open and we\u2019ll bring you news on that shortly. The Australian dollar is in freefall this morning as investors expect the economic impact of the coronavirus to worsen and weaken demand for the country\u2019s industrial commodities. The Aussie has fallen 0.84% in the current trading session, taking it to US65.18c. Other commodity currencies such as the canadian dollar and the Brazilian real have seen similar falls. Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets in Sydney explains that the weekend\u2019s poor economic data from China will lead to lowered expectations of growth in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, subduing demand all over the world: China data over the weekend offered hard evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 virus, and growth fears are likely to dominate trading today. The official PMI reads in China released on Saturday showed both manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity contracted during February. The manufacturing index plummeted to 35.7, from a neutral 50.5 previously, and non-manufacturing activity fell from an expansionary 54.1 to a shrinking 29.6. This macro evidence of the economic impact of the coronavirus could see economists dropping their estimates of GDP growth in China, with potential knock-on effects. Today\u2019s read on the Caixin manufacturing PMI, due mid-session, is forecast at 46.0. A big miss on this read could keep pressure on regional currencies, shares and industrial commodities. Read more about those very bad Chinese figures here with this report from our economics writer Phillip Inman: In Australian the stock market opened down 2.2% on Monday morning, marking the seventh straight trading day of losses as the coronavirus spreads. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 144.2 points at the start of trade on Monday. The decline means the ASX has now gone down over 10% in the last seven trading days. Among the biggest drops at the opening of trade were Bega down 10%, and Fortescue down 9.92%. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Before we kick off, here\u2019s a summary of the top points so far. Italy has confirmed 34 deaths from the virus. Iran raised its death toll from 43 to 54 with confirmed infections rising by more than half to 978. The number of people in Germany infected rose to 129 on Sunday, up from 66 on Saturday. Non-essential British embassy staff in Tehran are being withdrawn with immediate effect due to the virus France\u2019s confirmed cases has risen to 130, from 100. The Trump administration has accused the public of overreacting to the impact of the coronavirus on the economy, and insisted that stocks would bounce back. Oman has suspended Italian tourist flights from Salala airport for a month, in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. You can get up to date with all our stories using the links below.
