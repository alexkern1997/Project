years sub-Saharan Africa is about to go into recession, according to World Bank estimates.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s two biggest economies, South Africa and Nigeria are heading for deep recessions, it said, as demand drops from developed nations for raw materials such as oil and precious metals.</p> <p>The same goes for Angola, Africa\u2019s second biggest oil exporter.</p> <p>Oil prices have fallen to between $20 and $30 a barrel, nearing the cost of production in Nigeria.</p> <p>Following 2.4% growth last year, the estimate for sub-Saharan Africa 2020 is between -2.1 and -5.1 % as the economy contracts.</p> <p>This is in part a knock-on effect from the economic hits being taken by Africa\u2019s main trading partners: China, the EU and the United States.</p> <p>Add to that the slump in the key markets of raw materials and tourism as well as the effect of measures to confine populations at home and you have the perfect economic storm for the continent.</p> <p>The African Development Bank remains less pessimistic but still sees a fall into recession of between -0.7 and -2.8 %.</p> <p>The African Union estimates that around 20m jobs, in formal and informal sectors, are under threat.<br></p> <p>The United Nations puts the figure much higher, at up to 50m.</p> <p>High unemployment and economic slowdown are also hitting African workers abroad, and therefore their money transfers back home, which are often a vital part of the economy.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e92b7668f08db3109f20f8a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p

British aid minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said assisting the poorest nations now would help prevent the virus returning to the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Britain has reported almost 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus so far, the fifth highest national number globally. </p> <p>\u201cWhile our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we\u2019re deploying British expertise and funding

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re closing this blog and have launched a new one at the link below. Head over there for the latest global coronavirus news throughout the day: Peru police arrest Chinese man for illegal Covid-19 testing Police in Lima on Sunday arrested a Chinese citizen for illegally conducting rapid Covid-19 tests on the public with newly-delivered kits stolen from Peru\u2019s health ministry, AFP reports. Tianxing Zhang, 36, was arrested in the Brena district of Lima as he was about to take samples from two women at the door of their house, police said. He \u201cwas proceeding to carry out rapid tests for Covid-19 that he had stolen\u201d from the Lima Sur health authority where he worked, according to a police statement. Zhang was wearing a mask and a light blue medical apron at the time of his arrest by the state security police. Both women had paid him to carry out a rapid home test, without health ministry approval. \u201cWhen questioned, he acknowledged he was not authorised to carry out this rapid test and that the Rapid Diagnostic Tests had been stolen from the Directorate of Integrated Health Network of Lima Sur where he had worked,\u201d the police said. According to the police, the bespectacled Zhang confessed to stealing two batches of the test to use, for monetary gain, on people who suspected they were ill with the coronavirus. Police found a backpack with 25 Covid-19 tests and other medical supplies at his home. More than 3,300 deaths across the US have been linked to coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, an alarming rise in just the past two weeks, according to the latest count by the Associated Press. Because the federal government has not been releasing a count of its own, the AP has kept its own running tally based on media reports and state health departments. The latest count of at least 3,321 deaths is up from about 450 deaths just 10 days ago. But the true toll among the 1 million mostly frail and elderly people who live in such facilities is likely much higher, experts say, because most state counts don\u2019t include those who died without ever being tested for Covid-19. Christians around the world celebrated an Easter Sunday upended by the coronavirus without the usual crowded church Masses and large family gatherings. Instead, they turned to the internet, television and radio from home to follow services that noted the grave impact of the pandemic. Some found novel ways to mark the holy day. Others still assembled in groups, but took precautions to try to avoid infection, AP reports. Here\u2019s a sample of Easter events around the world: At the Vatican, St Peters Square was empty of crowds and ringed by police barricades. Pope Francis celebrated Easter Mass inside the largely vacant basilica, calling for solidarity the world over to confront the epochal challenge posed by the coronavirus pandemic. In the central German city of Hildesheim, around 400 people participated in a drive-in Catholic Mass for Easter Sunday. At one of the biggest churches in South Korea, Seoul\u2019s Yoido Full Gospel Church, a small number of masked church followers attended the service broadcast online via the church\u2019s website. In the US, Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious diseases expert and a key member of the White House coronavirus task force said on Sunday that the economy in parts of the country could have a rolling reentry as early as next month, provided health authorities can quickly identify and isolate people who will inevitably be infected with the coronavirus. Dr Anthony Fauci also said he can\u2019t guarantee\u201d that it will be safe for Americans to vote in person on Election Day, 3 November. Fauci said the process will be gradual and based on the status of the pandemic in various parts of the US, as well as the availability of rapid, widespread testing. \u201cOnce the number of people who are seriously ill sharply declines, officials can begin to think about a gradual reentry of some sort of normality, some rolling reentry,\u201d Fauci said. In some places, he said, that might occur as soon as May. But whenever restrictions ease, Fauci said, \u201cwe know that there will be people who will be getting infected.\u201d Social distancing guidelines imposed by President Donald Trump are set to expire 30 April. Trump is eager to restart the economy, which has stalled because most Americans are under orders to stay at home to help slow the virus spread. But other senior US public health officials have pushed back on Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness to reopen the country quickly, as a senior World Health Organization (WHO) figure warned that Covid-19 \u201cis going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come\u201d: Hi, I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. You can get in touch with me directly at any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Helen Sullivan in Sydney now. Thanks for reading. Here is a quick roundup of the latest developments. The global number of confirmed cases has passed 1.8m, reaching 1,844,410, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been over 113,000 deaths globally. Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno and his cabinet members have taken 50% pay cuts in a bid to tackle the pandemic\u2019s economic effects on the country. A former Israeli chief rabbi has died from coronavirus complications. Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron died from complications from the virus in a Jerusalem hospital, aged 79. UK government is facing mounting criticism over its coronavirus response, particularly over its failure to secure enough personal protective equipment and tests for NHS and care workers as the country\u2019s death toll passed 10,000. This follows a warning that that the UK could experience the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe. China has vowed to improve treatment of Africans in the southern city of Guangzhou following international pressure. Facing accusations of discrimination linked to the pandemic, China said it rejected all \u201cracist and discriminatory\u201d remarks. S\u00fcleyman Soylu, a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has resigned following the bungled handling of the country\u2019s lockdown, only to have his resignation rejected by Erdo\u011fan. Jordan has extended its month-long lockdown until the end of April. The country, which has registered 389 coronavirus cases and seven deaths, declared a 24-hour, nationwide curfew on March 20. Sudan has announced it is banning all passenger road transport between cities and introducing emergency laws to enforce measures aimed at stopping Covid-19\u2019s spread. The country has 19 confirmed coronavirus cases and two deaths. Senior US public health officials have pushed back on Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness to reopen the country quickly, as a senior World Health Organization figure warned that Covid-19 \u201cis going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come\u201d. France\u2019s death toll has continued to slow, with the country reporting a drop in coronavirus deaths on the previous 24 hours. There were 315 deaths in hospital over the last day, compared with 345 the day earlier. Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno and his cabinet members have taken 50% pay cuts in a bid to tackle the pandemic\u2019s economic effect on the country. In recent weeks, the outbreak has overwhelmed sanitary authorities in the largest city of Guayaquil, where corpses have remained in homes or on the streets for hours. The salary reductions will also affect state officials including lawmakers in the National Assembly, who have heavily criticised Moreno\u2019s plans to increase taxes to protect government finances amid the pandemic. \u201cI have arranged a 50% reduction in the monthly income of the President, Vice President, Ministers and Vice Ministers,\u201d Moreno tweeted. Ecuador has registered 7,466 infections and 333 deaths. Reuters reports that another 384 people are believed to have died of coronavirus, but the cases have not been confirmed because the victims were not tested. Moreno has proposed creating a humanitarian assistance fund that would collect 5% of the profits with reported revenue exceeding $1 million in 2018, and would tax workers with monthly salaries of more than $500. The measures have been criticised as unfair on workers. A former Israeli chief rabbi has died after contracting the coronavirus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said. Eliyahu Bakshi-Doron, who served from 1993 to 2003 as the state\u2019s top chaplain for Sephardim, or Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent, died late on Sunday from complications from the virus in a Jerusalem hospital, aged 79, Israeli media said. \u201cTragically, Rabbi Bakshi-Doron contracted the coronavirus and doctors\u2019 efforts to save him did not succeed,\u201d Netanyahu said in a statement. Israel has reported 11,145 confirmed cases and 103 deaths. In case you missed it, here\u2019s a handy explainer on how to make sense of the constant flurry of coronavirus statistics Turkish President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has rejected the resignation of interior minister S\u00fcleyman Soylu. \u201cThe resignation of our interior minister has not been accepted by the president, he will continue his duty,\u201d the presidency\u2019s communications directorate said. Soylu had said he was resigning after criticism of the implementation of the country\u2019s weekend lockdown. Criticism of the UK government\u2019s response to the crisis is growing, report Rowena Mason and Haroon Siddique, particularly over its failure to get enough personal protective equipment and testing kits to NHS and care workers. It comes as a government adviser also warned that the UK could experience the highest death toll from coronavirus in Europe on a day when the number of fatalities in British hospitals passed 10,000. Read the full story here: The Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli performed inside the empty Milan Duomo on Sunday as millions tuned in via livestream. Bocelli said: \u201cI will cherish the emotion of this unprecedented and profound experience, of this Holy Easter which this emergency has made painful, but at the same time even more fruitful, one that will stay among my dearest memories of all time.\u201d The Andrea Bocelli Foundation has started a fundraiser to help hospitals purchase the necessary instruments and equipment to protect their medical staff during the Covid-19 pandemic. It has so far raised more than 200,000 euros. The UK has cancelled an order for thousands of units of a simple model of ventilator developed to treat Covid-19 because more sophisticated models are now needed, Reuters reports. \u201cWe are no longer supporting the production of the BlueSky device following a reassessment of the product\u2019s viability in light of the ever developing picture around what is needed to most effectively treat COVID-19,\u201d said a spokesman for the Cabinet Office, which is coordinating ventilator orders. \u201cWe are continuing to work at unprecedented speed with a number of other manufacturers to scale up UK production of ventilators.\u201d The government has appealed to industry to come forward with new models that could be produced on a large scale at short notice. Over 30,000 ventilators in total have been ordered from various firms from sectors including aerospace, engineering and Formula One. Following international pressure, China has vowed to improve the treatment of Africans in the southern city of Guangzhou after facing accusations of discrimination linked to the pandemic, and said it rejected all \u201cracist and discriminatory\u201d remarks. Africans in the industrial centre of 15 million say they have become targets of suspicion and subjected to forced evictions, arbitrary quarantines and mass coronavirus testing, particularly as Beijing steps up its fight against imported coronavirus cases. The African Union expressed its \u201cextreme concern\u201d about the situation, calling on Beijing to take immediate corrective action. Meanwhile, the United States denounced what it called \u201cxenophobia towards Africans by Chinese authorities.\u201d A recent cluster of coronavirus cases linked to the Nigerian community in Guangzhou, southern China\u2019s largest city, sparked the alleged discrimination by locals and virus-prevention officials. Several Africans told AFP they had been forcibly evicted from their homes and turned away by hotels. \u201cThe Chinese government has been attaching great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals in China,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a statement. \u201cThe Guangdong (provincial) authorities attach great importance to some African countries\u2019 concerns and are working promptly to improve their working method,\u201d he added. Among the measures Zhao announced were non-discriminatory health management services and hotels for foreigners who are required to undergo medical observation, to be offered at reduced rates for those in need. In the UK, police are looking for thieves who stole personal protective equipment (PPE) from an NHS building, according to the Press Association. The raid took place at the offices of the Care Homes medical practice in Salford, which cares for patients living in nursing and residential homes. Police were called to the premises shortly before 7.50am on Sunday and discovered that a number of laptops and a quantity of petty cash had also been taken. Inquiries are ongoing. A spokeswoman for Salford Royal NHS foundation trust said: \u201cWe are shocked and saddened that one of our community bases has been burgled and belongings stolen, including some items of PPE equipment. Our priority has been supporting staff based at this unit and ensuring they have access to the equipment that they need to carry out their roles. \u201cIt\u2019s a testament to staff that service delivery has not been significantly impacted today following this incident. We will support Greater Manchester police in their ongoing inquiries.\u201d Police have caught a church in Paris holding a traditional Easter mass with dozens of worshippers, flouting the strict rules imposed to fight coronavirus, AFP reports. Religious services and all gatherings have been banned in France for the past month, but the traditional Saint-Nicolas-du-Chardonnet Catholic church in the centre of Paris held an Easter mass late on Saturday, police sources said. The priest was warned and booked for not respecting the confinement rules, the source said. This would have made him liable for a \u20ac200 (\u00a3176) fine. Police had been tipped off by local residents who had heard music coming from the church in the fifth arrondissement in the heart of the French capital. This has just come in from the Guardian\u2019s Turkey and Middle East correspondent, Bethan McKernan: Turkey\u2019s interior minister, S\u00fcleyman Soylu, a close ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has resigned from his post after the bungled handling of a total lockdown across 31 Turkish cities over the weekend to contain Covid-19. The government announced on Friday at 10.30pm that a 48-hour-long lockdown during which people would not be allowed to leave home would go into effect at midnight, causing panic across the country as people rushed to shops and bakeries to stock up before the curfew. While officials rushed to reassure citizens that the lockdown would not affect basics such as groceries and pharmacies, the last-minute decision was heavily criticised by civilians and politicians alike. Istanbul \u2013 home to 16 million people \u2013 had a significant surge in panic buying and traffic backed up as people made late-night trips to check on loved ones. The city\u2019s mayor, Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu of the opposition Republican Peoples\u2019 Party (CHP), said in a video posted to Twitter that his municipality had not informed in advance of the expected shutdown. Soylu addressed the criticism in remarks to Turkish media on Sunday morning, accepting \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for Friday\u2019s events, but announce his resignation via Twitter on Sunday evening. \u201cI acted in good faith ... to prevent the epidemic spreading,\u201d Soylu wrote. \u201cThe scenes that occured before the lockdown began, even for a short time, are my responsibility. My actions should not have caused this.\u201d Political resignations are rare in Turkey. The last time a minister from the ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party stepped down was in 2013. Turkey has become one of the countries with the fastest rising number of recorded cases, which stood at 56,956 on Sunday. Erdo\u011fan, usually no stranger to heavy-handed tactics, has resisted calls by doctors\u2019 unions and opposition politicians to order people to stop going to work and stay home, insisting that the \u201cwheels of the economy must keep turning\u201d. Jordan has extended its month-long lockdown until the end of April, according to Reuters. A government spokesman said Prime Minister Omar Razzaz took the decision in light of \u201cdevelopments and recommendations\u201d related to the pandemic. The country has registered 389 coronavirus cases and seven deaths. Jordan declared a 24-hour, nationwide curfew on March 20. The lockdown followed the Jordanian monarchy enacting emergency laws to give the government powers to restrict civil and political rights. Sudan has announced that it is banning all passenger road transport between cities and introducing emergency laws to enforce measures aimed at stopping Covid-19\u2019s spread. The country has 19 confirmed coronavirus cases and two deaths. Reports reports that officials are eager to prevent the virus\u2019s spread, especially in light of the country\u2019s economic crisis and weakened health system. Authorities have imposed a 12-hour curfew, shut down schools, universities and clubs, and banned gatherings, but compliance with the rules has been uneven. Emergency laws means those breaking quarantine rules, hiding information or impeding medical treatment could now face criminal prosecution. Meanwhile in the United States, President Trump is facing opposition to his keenness for a swift reopening of the economy. Richard Luscombe, Edward Helmore and Martin Pengelly report: \u201cSenior US public health officials have pushed back on Donald Trump\u2019s eagerness to reopen the country quickly, as a senior World Health Organization (WHO) figure warned that Covid-19 \u2018is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come\u2019. \u201cAccording to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, by Sunday lunchtime more than 530,000 Covid-19 cases had been confirmed in the US and close to 21,000 deaths, making the US the country with the most cases and the most fatalities.\u201d Greece has registered five fatalities in the past 24 hours, raising the total to 98, authorities say. AP reports that all the victims were men. The country now has a total of 2,114 confirmed cases of the virus, with 33 added since Saturday afternoon. Authorities remain concerned that people will flout the country\u2019s strict quarantine measures during the Orthodox Easter next Sunday. The feast is usually a period of mass exodus to the countryside, and on Sunday, 38 people were stopped trying to leave cities and fined \u20ac300 each. Correspondents Tom Phillips and Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro have reported that experts fear the consequences of Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, continuing to downplay the threat of the coronavirus pandemic to public health. Medical experts have said they fear that Bolsonaro could be hastening the country\u2019s march towards a devastating public health crisis like those to have hit northern Italy and New York by undermining social distancing measures. France has reported a drop in coronavirus deaths on the previous 24 hours, with the total toll now 14,393, AFP reports. There were 315 deaths in hospital over the last day, compared with 345 the day earlier. The health ministry confirmed that a \u201cplateau\u201d appeared to have been reached but warned the situation remained serious despite the slightly improving data. The country announced a total of 95,403 confirmed coronavirus cases. The country\u2019s nursing and care homes report 37,188 confirmed or suspected cases, according to Reuters. Here is a roundup of the latest developments around the world. The global death toll has passed 110,000, reaching 110,892, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The number of confirmed cases has passed 1.8m. Singapore has announced 233 new infections, bringing the total number to 2,532. Thousands of displaced Syrians have begun returning to Idlib, some driven by fear of the spread of the coronavirus to camps by the Turkish border. Italy\u2019s death toll has continued to slow, reporting 431 deaths - the lowest daily rise since 19 March. Spain\u2019s daily death toll has risen after falling for three days in a row, with 619 new deaths registered in the last 24 hours compared to 510 the day before. New York\u2019s death toll has slowed, with governor Andrew Cuomo announcing there have been 758 deaths in the state in the last day, down from 783 the day before. The UK\u2019s death toll has passed 10,000, as the government confirms that the total number of deaths from coronavirus in UK hospitals has reached 10,612. The Netherlands has topped 25,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, while the number of deaths has risen by 94 to 2,737. Boris Johnson has been discharged from hospital. He thanked the NHS for \u201csaving [his] life\u201d after leaving St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London where he had been hospitalised for a week. Italy has ordered 149 migrants onboard a rescue ship off its coast to be quarantined and tested for the coronavirus before they can disembark. Singapore has registered 233 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total number of infections to 2,532. Thousands of displaced Syrians have begun returning to their homes in war-torn Idlib province, some driven by fear of the spread of the coronavirus in camps by the Turkish border. Reuters reports that about 1 million Syrians fled Idlib and the surrounding countryside in northwest Syria this past year after Russian-backed government forces escalated a campaign to retake the last rebel stronghold. Fighting has calmed since a ceasefire was agreed in March. While Syria\u2019s north-west does not yet have a confirmed case of coronavirus, doctors fear the area\u2019s ravaged medical infrastructure and crowded camps would rapidly turn any outbreak into a humanitarian disaster. As the tentative peace holds, displaced Syrians are faced with a grim choice: remain in overflowing camps where an outbreak could be deadly, or return home at risk of getting caught in renewed fighting. \u201cOur lives go from danger to danger as we flee from bombing, the regime, and conflict, to overcrowding and coronavirus,\u201d Abu Abdo, 45, told the news agency. The number of fatalities from coronavirus in Italy rose by 431 on Sunday, the lowest daily rise since 19 March. The civil protection authority said 102,253 people are currently infected with the virus, 1,984 more than on Saturday (2%). The curve for infections has been flattening over the past week or so, and Walter Ricciardi, the scientific adviser to the Italian government on the coronavirus outbreak, told the Guardian last week that the plateau could continue for 20-25 days before there is a definitive decrease. To date, there have been 156,363 cases of coronavirus in Italy, including 19,899 victims and 34,211 survivors. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has warned that the country is \u201cfar from victory\u201d in its fight against the coronavirus as the country\u2019s death toll rose again after falling for three days in a row. The country registered 619 new deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 16,972, the health ministry said, the highest in the world after the US and Italy. The toll was 510 on Saturday, the lowest since 23 March, according to AFP. Conversely, the number of new infections continued to slow, rising by 4,167 to 166,019, a smaller increase than was recorded on Saturday. Although health chiefs say the pandemic has peaked, they have urged citizens to strictly follow the national lockdown which began on 14 March. \u201cWe are still far from victory, from the moment when he will recover normality in our lives,\u201d Sanchez said during a televised address. \u201cWe are all keen to go back out on the streets \u2026 but out desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse,\u201d he added. To follow New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, head over to our US live blog. The governor reports there were 758 deaths in the last day, down from 783 the day before. A total of 9,385 people have died from Covid-19 across the state since the start of the outbreak, and the total number of hospitalisations is at about 18,700. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has tweeted his support for health services and congratulated Boris Johnson on his recovery after he was discharged from hospital. Meanwhile in India, ten tourists have been forced to write \u2018sorry\u2019 500 times after breaching the country\u2019s lockdown. AFP reports that the travellers - from Israel, Mexico, Australia and Austria - were caught taking a walk in Rishikesh, flouting the rule that allows people to leave their homes only for essential services like buying groceries and medicine. Over 700 foreign tourists from the US, Australia, Mexico and Israel staying in the area had disobeyed the lockdown rules, a local police officer said, adding the unusual punishment was handed out to teach them a lesson. Police said they would direct hotels in the area to allow foreign guests to step out only if accompanied by local helpers, with establishments that do not follow the order facing the threat of legal action. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to extend the nationwide lockdown that was originally meant to end on Tuesday, for another two weeks. To follow Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing as the UK\u2019s death toll passes 10,000, head over to our UK live blog. Hello, this is Clea Skopeliti in London taking over the blog from my colleague Josh Halliday in Manchester. If you have a story to share, please do drop me a message on Twitter. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything but will read them all. Thanks in advance. Saudi Arabia has extended a nationwide curfew until further notice due to the coronavirus, the interior ministry said on Sunday. The kingdom recorded more than 300 new infections on each of the last five days, according to Reuters news agency, reaching a total of 4,462 cases and 59 deaths. Its tally is the highest among the six Gulf Arab states. Saudi Arabia placed its capital Riyadh and other big cities under a 24-hour curfew last week, locking down much of the population. Residents are allowed to leave their houses only for essential needs inside their residential area. Elsewhere, the curfew which began on March 23 runs from 3pm to 6am. Saudi Arabia has halted international flights, suspended the year-round umrah pilgrimage, and closed most public places. Elsewhere in the Gulf, the United Arab Emirates warned of possible action against countries refusing to allow migrant workers to be repatriated. The total number of deaths from coronavirus in UK hospitals has reached 10,612, the UK government has confirmed. The grim milestone was passed after a daily rise of 737 fatalities was recorded in the 24 hours to 5pm on 11 April. The daily rise has slowed from 917 on Saturday but it remains to be seen whether this is a flattening of the curve, meaning the UK has reached its peak, or whether a delay in reporting cases over the Easter weekend is a factor. The UK has recorded the fifth highest number of deaths in the world \u2013 behind the US, Italy, Spain and France \u2013 and is the sixth-worst affected country per 100,000 of the population. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has posted a video message thanking the nurses and doctors of the National Health Service for \u201csaving my life\u201d. Johnson was discharged from St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London on Sunday, three days after leaving the intensive care unit where he was treated for Covid-19. Readers have been in touch to ask for more reporting on per capita death rates of countries. Comparing statistics between countries is fraught with difficulty, not least because each one is at a different stage of the pandemic and every nation has unique characteristics (the number and usage of mass transit systems, for example, or the average age of the population \u2013 not to mention the varied forms of lockdown in place around the world). The John Hopkins University, whose online dashboard is the go-to place for data on the pandemic, has published the below chart showing the mortality rate per 100,000 people for the 10 countries that are \u2013 by this measure \u2013 the worst-affected by coronavirus. It shows that Spain has recorded the most deaths per 100,000 people \u2013 at 35.5 \u2013 closely followed by Italy and Belgium. The US, which has the highest total number of deaths, is seventh in the world when the huge size of its population is factored in. The UK is in sixth place, with 14.9 deaths per 100,000 people. The number of people who have died from coronavirus around the world has reached 110,042, according to the John Hopkins University tracker. The number of confirmed cases is approaching 1.8m. Almost one in five (17.7%) of global deaths from the pandemic are in Italy, with nearly the same proportion in the US (17.1%). The UK\u2019s death toll passed 10,000 on Sunday. While the official total will be confirmed later, the combined figures from England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland make it clear that the tally will take the UK past 10,000 deaths. Readers have been in touch to highlight lesser-reported cases of countries that appear to have successfully slowed or stopped the spread of coronavirus. Linda Burton, in Tbilisi, points out that Georgia has only 252 confirmed cases and three deaths out of a population of 3.7m. The three deaths were all women, aged 79 to 86, who had underlying health conditions, according to reports in local media. There will, of course, be many factors behind this but experts have said the country was quick to enact travel restrictions \u2013 including banning flights from China as early as January \u2013 and closing nurseries, schools and universities in early March despite having relatively few confirmed cases. In Madagascar, a country populated by 26.2 million people, the virus has barely taken off with only 102 confirmed cases and no deaths to date. Angela Reilly, a Scot who lives and works in the capital Antananarivo, said she had been very impressed by the \u201cswift and decisive\u201d measures taken by the government, which declared a state of emergency on 21 March when it had only three confirmed cases. All passenger flights have been grounded, personal travel is strictly limited, public transport has been shut down, and lockdown measures are in place across the island country. Angela writes: \u201cI am so impressed by these moves, especially in comparison to the UK. People are largely calm and following the rules. The priority is health and protecting people, not politics and economics. Italy has ordered migrants onboard a rescue ship off its coast to be quarantined and tested for the coronavirus before they can disembark, Reuters reports. The Alan Kurdi ship, which is run by the German non-governmental group Sea-Eye, is sailing in international waters off the western coast of Sicily. The transport ministry said in a statement those onboard will be transferred to another ship, screened by health authorities and quarantined on that ship. Sea-Eye tweeted in the last hour that 149 people were onboard the Alan Kurdi and that Europe was \u201cletting them drown\u201d. The Italian government last week closed ports to charity boats for the entire duration of the national health emergency over the coronavirus, a ban due to remain in effect until 31 July. The transport ministry said allowing the migrants to disembark would put too much pressure on already stretched health services in Sicily. It gave no details on the planned transfer, its timing or location. Thanks to Jedidajah Otte. This is Josh Halliday again to steer you through the next few hours. Chinese cities near the border with Russia said on Sunday they would tighten border controls and quarantine measures on arrivals from abroad, after the number of imported cases of Covid-19 hit a one-month high, Reuters reports. New daily confirmed cases in mainland China reached 99 on 11 April, almost doubling from 46 the previous day. All but two of the new recorded cases involved people travelling from abroad, many of them Chinese nationals returning from Russia. In the commercial hub Shanghai, 51 Chinese nationals flying in on the same flight from Russia tested positive while 21 cases involved Chinese nationals travelling from Russia to the northeastern Heilongjiang province. Chinese authorities fear a new wave of cases after strict lockdowns had largely contained the outbreak in China, where it has killed a recorded 3,339 people since it emerged in the city of Wuhan in December last year. Readers from Malta have written in as concerns grow that at least four vessels carrying migrants are in distress at sea not far from the Maltese coast, after the foreign minister Evarist Bartolo suggested in a Facebook post on Saturday that migrant rescue NGOs in the Mediterranean are encouraging people traffickers. Bartolo wrote that Malta \u201ccannot handle anymore\u201d asylum seekers as national resources are being stretched due to the pandemic. Alarm Phone, one of independent organisations monitoring migration in the Mediterranean, have urged authorities to conduct rescue operations. About an hour ago, Alarm Phone tweeted that one ship had seemingly capsized. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has left hospital after having been hospitalised with Covid-19 for a week, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. Johnson was being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London and had spent time in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit after his situation deteriorated. Full story below. Johnson\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Carrie Symonds, thanked healthcare staff on Twitter. \u201cThere were times last week that were very dark indeed. My heart goes out to all those in similar situations, worried sick about their loved ones,\u201d she wrote. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has topped 25,000, health authorities said on Sunday, according to Reuters. The number of deaths rose by 94 to 2,737. The Netherlands\u2019 National Institute for Health (RIVM) reported 1,188 new infections over the past 24 hours, taking the total to 25,587. The rate of increase in infections and deaths has slowed for several days. Hello, this is Jedidajah Otte taking over the blog for a bit from my colleague Josh Halliday. If you have an update to share, please get in touch on Twitter or email me. Here is a roundup of the latest developments around the world. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Jedidajah Otte for a while. The global death toll has reached 109,691, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. More than 1.78 million people have been diagnosed. Pope Francis departed with centuries of tradition and livestreamed his Easter Sunday mass to allow the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Catholics to celebrate their holiest holiday. In a strikingly political speech, the pope said he hoped that rivalries from before the second world war \u201cdo not regain force\u201d as a result of the pandemic. The pope said the European Union faced an \u201cepochal challenge, on which will depend not only its future but that of the whole world\u201d. The infection rate in Spain continued to slow. Its death toll rose to 16,972 on Sunday \u2013 a daily rise of 619 \u2013 but there are signs the country\u2019s strict lockdown appears to be paying off. It remains a global hotspot for the virus, with the highest total of confirmed cases in Europe. Tight restrictions on movement came into force in Jerusalem where predominantly ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas have been hit disproportionately by the virus, in part because influential rabbis were slow to shut synagogues and religious seminaries. Britain has pledged \u00a3200m to the World Health Organization and charities to assist containment in vulnerable countries. Elderly people may have to be kept isolated until the end of the year to protect them from the coronavirus, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. One country marking a particularly difficult Easter this year is Sri Lanka. It is a year since more than 260 people, mostly Catholics, were killed in the Islamic State-inspired attacks on three churches and three hotels last Easter. Due to coronavirus, there were no organised events to remember the victims as the country has been under curfew for most of the past three weeks. Like much of the rest of the world, Sri Lankan Christians observed Easter services on the internet and television. Francesca Mudannayake, a Guardian reader in Sri Lanka, got in touch to describe the situation where she is: \u201cI am very surprised and envious the UK still allows people to go out for an hour every day \u2026 The general public [in Sri Lanka] have not really seen the outside world in just over three weeks. It\u2019s distressing as it has been a year since the Easter attacks and we spent a lot of time trying to rebuild the economy only for it to again tank due to the virus. We hope for better days.\u201d We have more on what was an extraordinary address by Pope Francis, who was delivering his most pressing and political speech since he was elected seven years ago. The pope expressed particular concern for the future of Europe, saying he hoped that rivalries from before the second world war \u201cdo not regain force\u201d as a result of the pandemic. According to Reuters, he added: \u201cThe European Union is presently facing an epochal challenge, on which will depend not only its future but that of the whole world \u2026 This is not a time for division.\u201d The pope repeated a call for a ceasefire \u201cin all corners of the world\u201d, condemned arms manufacturing and said the pandemic should spur leaders to finally end long-running wars such as that in Syria. He also appealed for help for migrants and others suffering from existing humanitarian conflicts. Pope Francis has departed from centuries of tradition and livestreamed his Easter Sunday mass to allow the world\u2019s 1.3 billion Catholics to celebrate their holiest holiday. In the Vatican, the pope delivered mass from a largely empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica before a handful of token faithful sitting one per pew and with the choir\u2019s Kyrie hymn echoing off the bare marble floors, reports the Associated Press. You can watch this historic occasion below: Pope Francis called for global solidarity in fighting the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout, urging the relaxation of international sanctions, debt relief for poor nations and ceasefires in all conflicts. He also warned the European Union that it risked collapse if it did not agree on how to help the region recover. This is from the Reuters report of the pope\u2019s address: \u201cThis is not a time for indifference, because the whole world is suffering and needs to be united in facing the pandemic,\u201d he said in the message, almost entirely dedicated to the pandemic\u2019s effects on personal and international relations. \u201cIndifference, self-centredness, division and forgetfulness are not words we want to hear at this time. We want to ban these words forever!\u201d he said. In Iran, the worst-hit country in the Middle East, the number of deaths has risen by 117 in the past day to 4,474, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. In total, the Islamic Republic has recorded 71,686 cases of coronavirus \u2013 the eighth highest total in the world and the biggest in the region. Iran has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for an emergency $5m loan to fight the virus, which appears to be tearing through hospitals across the country. However, the US \u2013 which is the IMF\u2019s largest shareholder \u2013 is reportedly planning to oppose the request amid its ongoing sanctions dispute with Iran. Thank you to everyone getting in touch from around the world. In the past couple of hours I\u2019ve had emails and tweets from Cameroon, Madagascar, Afghanistan, Sweden, Turkey, Thailand, Brazil, New Zealand, France, Switzerland, Ireland and more. I try to read every message but I can\u2019t always respond \u2013 so apologies if you\u2019ve not heard back from me. Your insights are greatly appreciated in helping us understand how the epidemic is affecting people across the globe. Where we can, we will highlight the situation in your country. Also, keep an eye on this dedicated page for all of the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus coverage. Despite the rise in the number of deaths and new cases in Spain, the country\u2019s strict lockdown seems to be paying off. The overnight rise in new cases was 2.6% compared with a daily average of 12% at the end of March and 20% in mid-March. The prime minister, who recently extended the lockdown until 26 April, is meeting the presidents of Spain\u2019s autonomous regions by videoconference today to coordinate the country\u2019s response. Meanwhile Luis de Guindos, the former Spanish finance minister who now serves as vice-president of the European Central Bank, has described the Covid-19 crisis as the most serious economic challenge Spain has faced \u201csince the civil war\u201d. De Guindos told La Vanguardia that the world was headed for a recession that would be felt particularly keenly in Europe- not least in Spain: \u201cSpain had an advantage at the beginning of the crisis because it was growing more on average than its partners in the eurozone. \u201cBut it also has a problem: its economic structure leaves it more exposed to the crisis because it is more dependent on services such as tourism, which will be very deeply affected by the pandemic. That fact probably means it will suffer a deeper recession.\u201d The number of coronavirus-related deaths in Spain has risen by 619 since Saturday to a total of 16,972, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s health ministry said the number of recorded cases had also risen, from 161,852 to 166,019 on Sunday. Spain has been a global hotspot for the disease, with more recorded cases than any other country except the US. However, data shows that the number of new cases is now in decline. The latest daily jump of 4,167 new cases is the lowest the country has recorded since 22 March. Spain\u2019s population of 47 million people remains in strict lockdown but some non-essential workers have been allowed to return to their jobs, prompting concern that the contagion could return if measures are lifted too early. My colleague Oliver Holmes, the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent, has more on the historic city\u2019s quarantine that came into effect at 12 noon on Sunday: Israel\u2019s government has quarantined parts of Jerusalem, including the historic and densely packed Old City, in an attempt to stall the spread of the coronavirus. The measures will shut down travel in and out of several neighbourhoods, predominantly ultra-Orthodox Jewish areas. The minority group has been hit disproportionately by the virus, in part because influential rabbis were slow to shut synagogues and religious seminaries. In the Old City, which Israel has occupied since a 1967 war, already tight restrictions meant Easter Sunday celebrations were low-key. At the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, Easter Mass was held by clerics and priests to mostly empty rooms. \u201cDespite the sign of death and fear that we are seeing everywhere all over the world, we have to look at the good all those that are giving their lives for the others,\u201d Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa said in the shuttered church. \u201cThe message of Easter is that life, despite all will prevail,\u201d he added. For the Jewish holiday of Passover, gatherings of at the Old City\u2019s Western Wall \u2013 the holiest site where Jews can pray \u2013 have also been reduced. While tens of thousands of worshippers typically gather, only handfuls have been allowed to congregate. Israel was quick to lock down most of the country as the pandemic spread worldwide. The country has confirmed around 10,000 cases, with roughly 100 deaths. Indonesia has reported what appears to be its biggest daily increase in new coronavirus cases, which have risen by 399 to of 4,241, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. It also reported 46 new coronavirus-related deaths, bringing to the total to 373. Its previous largest daily rise was 337 new cases, recorded on 9 April, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. However, Indonesia\u2019s tally must be seen in context: my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe reported last week on how the country of 264 million people is thought to be able to process only 240 of the most accurate tests a day and is instead relying on quicker, less reliable tests. A sudden rise in burials has raised concerns over undetected cases in the country. The European Union has directed \u20ac117m to help Afghanistan\u2019s fight against the coronavirus as the country\u2019s number of confirmed cases reached 600, my colleague Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. All roads to the capital, Kabul, were blocked this morning, with tightened restrictions on movement in a city of about 6 million people. Afghanistan has recorded 45 new cases in the last 24 hours \u2013 28 of which were in Kabul and eight in Kandahar. The EU said it recognised that Afghanistan \u201cmay be severely affected\u201d by the pandemic as its public health system is \u201cweakened by years of conflict, has to cope with limited resources, and is not accessible throughout the country\u201d. Afghanistan has so far reported 18 deaths of Covid-19 and 37 recoveries. Concerns are high in Kandahar as thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Pakistan in recent days. Staying on Russia for a minute, the city of Suifenhe on the Chinese side of the border has implemented strict controls to prevent cases being imported from its neighbouring country. The remote border city \u2013 which is 1,000 miles from Beijing \u2013 has recorded an increase in coronavirus cases even as China\u2019s infection rate slows dramatically. The country reported 73 new cases on Saturday, according to the John Hopkins University tracker. Last Wednesday, the whole of China reported 59 imported cases of Covid-19; state media reported that 25 of those were Chinese citizens who were returning through Suifenhe after flying from Moscow to Vladivostok, about 100 miles south. Suifenhe\u2019s authorities said on Sunday they were stepping up controls on traffic and enforcing quarantine measures. The city has banned all types of gatherings and drawn up a list of businesses that must be suspended from operations, Reuters reports. Russia has reported its biggest daily increase in new coronavirus cases, up by 2,186 to a total of 15,770. The number of coronavirus-related deaths rose by 24 to 130, Reuters reports. My colleague Andrew Roth, in Moscow, reported last week on how Vladimir Putin appears to have taken a backseat during the crisis, delegating powers to trusted lieutenants and focusing on cushioning the blow to Russia\u2019s economy. The Israeli government has approved tight restrictions on several areas of Jerusalem, including the historic Old City, in a bid to slow the spread of the outbreak among its most vulnerable communities. The measures, which come into force today until Wednesday, mean residents in several areas will only be able to leave their homes for \u201cwork, essential medical care, the funeral of a direct family member, the transfer of a minor between divorced parents, legal processes and any other essential reasons that have been the subject of prior approval\u201d, reports Haaretz. The extended curfew had faced opposition from ultra-orthodox ministers in Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government who rejected the singling out of their constituencies. Israel\u2019s health ministry has documented more than 10,000 cases of the novel coronavirus and more than 100 deaths. About a fifth of all cases in Israel are in Jerusalem. A large percentage of the Covid-19 cases are in the country\u2019s ultra-orthodox community, which for weeks did not adhere to government orders to maintain social distancing, the Associated Press reports. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Many thanks to Helen, in Sydney, for steering us through the last seven hours. This is Josh Halliday, in Manchester, to guide you from here. I\u2019ve just looked at the readership figures: this blog has an extraordinary international reach, with readers joining us from the UK to Canada, New Zealand, India, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates and beyond. Thank you all for reading. I\u2019m interested in how your town, city and country are affected by the outbreak. If you would like to get in touch, please do drop me an email or contact me on Twitter. Twitter: @JoshHalliday Email: josh.halliday@theguardian.com I\u2019ll hand over to my colleagues in London now. Thanks for your company. Here is a quick roundup of the latest developments. Thanks so much. The global death toll has reached 108,867, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. More than 1.77m people have been diagnosed. Britain has pledged 200m pounds to the World Health Organisation and charities to assist containment in vulnerable countries. Elderly people may have to be kept isolated until the end of the year to protect them from the coronavirus, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. The partner of Julian Assange has pleaded for him to be released from prison on bail over fears he could contract Covid-19. The World Bank has warned the pandemic is a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for the vulnerable economies of both South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. China could take control of debt-struck nations\u2019 assets at an accelerated rate because of the pandemic, or it could boost its soft diplomacy by forgiving debt. Mainland China has reported 99 new cases on Saturday, of which all but two were imported. The country\u2019s national health commission said no one had died from the virus on Saturday. A \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus patients in Russia has started to put a strain on Moscow\u2019s hospitals. Thailand reported 33 new coronavirus infections and three new deaths on Sunday, while Germany\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus infections rose by 2,821 on Sunday, with 129 new deaths, For the first time in history, all 50 US states are now under disaster declarations, after Wyoming became the final state to announce. Pope Francis has urged people not to \u201cyield to fear\u201d at his Easter address. The event was scaled back due to coronavirus, with just two dozen attendees, a smaller choir, and no processions or baptisms. British prime minister Boris Johnson has said he owes his life to the NHS. He has been in hospital since Sunday night, and had spent three nights in intensive care. Seven African states have called on authorities to explain allegations of mistreatment of Africans in Guangzhou city. Many report having been evicted, tested for coronavirus several times without being given results and being shunned and discriminated against in public. For the first time in 25 years sub-Saharan Africa is about to go into recession, according to World Bank estimates. Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s two biggest economies, South Africa and Nigeria are heading for deep recessions, it said, as demand drops from developed nations for raw materials such as oil and precious metals. The same goes for Angola, Africa\u2019s second biggest oil exporter. Oil prices have fallen to between $20 and $30 a barrel, nearing the cost of production in Nigeria. Following 2.4% growth last year, the estimate for sub-Saharan Africa 2020 is between -2.1 and -5.1 % as the economy contracts. This is in part a knock-on effect from the economic hits being taken by Africa\u2019s main trading partners: China, the EU and the United States. Add to that the slump in the key markets of raw materials and tourism as well as the effect of measures to confine populations at home and you have the perfect economic storm for the continent. The African Development Bank remains less pessimistic but still sees a fall into recession of between -0.7 and -2.8 %. The African Union estimates that around 20m jobs, in formal and informal sectors, are under threat. The United Nations puts the figure much higher, at up to 50m. High unemployment and economic slowdown are also hitting African workers abroad, and therefore their money transfers back home, which are often a vital part of the economy. Reuters: Britain said on Sunday it was pledging \u00a3200m ($248m) to the World Health Organization (WHO) and charities to help slow the spread of the coronavirus in vulnerable countries and so help prevent a second wave of infections. More than 1.6 million people are reported to have been infected by the novel coronavirus globally and deaths have topped 100,000 according to a Reuters tally. Infections have been reported in 210 countries since the first cases were identified in China in December last year and British aid minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said assisting the poorest nations now would help prevent the virus returning to the United Kingdom. Britain has reported almost 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus so far, the fifth highest national number globally. \u201cWhile our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we\u2019re deploying British expertise and funding around the world to prevent a second deadly wave reaching the UK,\u201d Trevelyan said in a statement. \u201cCoronavirus does not respect country borders so our ability to protect the British public will only be effective if we strengthen the healthcare systems of vulnerable developing countries too.\u201d From AFP: It\u2019s a grim truth that times are good for the coffin business when they\u2019re bad for people, and the coronavirus pandemic is no exception. At a factory belonging to Europe\u2019s largest coffin maker, OGF, in eastern France, workers are doing overtime to meet demand from families parting with their loved ones. \u201cDue to the epidemic, we decided to manufacture just four models of coffins that are top sellers with families\u201d compared to the 15 types usually on offer, said factory director Emmanuel Garret. The change \u201callowed us to optimise production\u201d, he added. Output has risen to 410 coffins per day, compared to 370 normally. Workers are putting in nearly an extra hour per day. \u201cPeople have been forewarned and are ready to come in and work on Saturdays,\u201d said Didier Pidancet, who heads up the team that selects the wood for the coffins. France has been one of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be participating in this national effort, we\u2019re doing our best to ensure that victims can have their final overcoat, as we say,\u201d added Pidancet. Mathematician John Horton Conway has died after contracting Covid-19, his colleagues have reported. Conway was the subject of this engaging long-read published in 2015. He is Archimedes, Mick Jagger, Salvador Dal\u00ed, and Richard Feynman, all rolled into one. He is one of the greatest living mathematicians, with a sly sense of humour, a polymath\u2019s promiscuous curiosity, and a compulsion to explain everything about the world to everyone in it. According to Sir Michael Atiyah, former president of the Royal Society and arbiter of mathematical fashion, \u201cConway is the most magical mathematician in the world.\u201d Conway\u2019s greatest accomplishments were in fields such as finite groups and lattices, which won him great fame in the mathematical community, but one of his most accessible creations - still used to teach beginner programming to this day - was the \u201cGame of Life\u201d. Less a winnable game than a system (or a \u2018cellular automata\u2019), it is often used to demonstrate that apparent complexity can arise from simple rules \u2013 or, to put it another way, that dizzying complexity can be explained by fundamental principles. From Reuters: Indonesia has imposed curbs on public transport ahead of the annual exodus to home villages that marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, in a bid to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the government said on Sunday. About 75m Indonesians usually stream home from bigger cities at the end of Ramadan, due this year at the end of May, but health experts have warned against a surge in cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak. Public buses, trains, airplanes and ships will be allowed to fill only half their passenger seats, under a new regulation that also limits occupation of a private car to just half the seats, while a motorcycle may be ridden only by one person. The ministry also ordered public transport operators to check passengers\u2019 temperature, while bus terminals, train stations, airports and seaports must provide soap and hand sanitizers and standby medical staff. \u201cThe essence of this new regulation is to carry out public transport control...while still meeting the needs of the people,\u201d transport ministry spokeswoman Adita Irawati said in a statement posted on the cabinet secretariat website. The capital Jakarta is the epicentre of the outbreak in the world\u2019s biggest Muslim-majority country, with the most infections and deaths among a national tally of 3,842 cases and 327 fatalities. A video clip showing the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, encouraging people to stay home has prompted ridicule and anger online, as Tokyo registered another record daily rise in infections. The clip, posted on Twitter on Sunday, shows an expressionless Abe at home cuddling his dog, sipping what appears to be tea or coffee, reading and clicking his TV remote control, while on another screen the popular singer and actor Gen Hoshino plays acoustic guitar and performs his song promoting social distancing, with the lyrics: \u201cLet\u2019s survive and dance, each one of us, wherever we are, all of us as one, let\u2019s sing at home.\u201d Some pointed to Abe\u2019s detached demeanour throughout the awkward one-minute video, while others were angered by his message, which began with words intended as sympathy for people who were unable to see friends or go out drinking. But, he added, \u201cthis is the kind of behaviour that is going to save many lives\u201d and reduce the burden on medical workers \u201cwho are battling the virus in the toughest of circumstances. Many on Twitter were unimpressed. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d asked one user. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t what we need right now,\u201d said another, while one woman berated him for mentioning disruptions to people\u2019s social lives while students were being forced to drop out of college because they could no longer afford their tuition fees. Summing up the general mood, one critic tweeted: \u201cThis person is far removed from the lives of ordinary people.\u201d Abe, who just a month ago was insisting that the Tokyo Olympics would go ahead as planned this summer, has attracted criticism for his response to the coronavirus outbreak, which includes the distribution of two reusable masks per household and restrictions on movement that some experts say do not go far enough. Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other areas last week amid a sharp rise in cases in urban areas. The measures, including requests that people avoid nonessential trips outside, and work from home where possible, and that businesses close or reduce their hours - have since been expanded to all 47 of Japan\u2019s prefectures. Tokyo reported almost 200 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday - the fourth straight day of record increases - bringing the number of infections in the capital to more than 1,900, according to the Kyodo news agency. This post was edited for clarity at 3:51pm AEST Thailand reported 33 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, for a total of 2,551 cases, as well as three more deaths, taking the southeast Asian nation\u2019s toll to 38. Two Thai men aged 74 and 44, and a woman aged 65 died, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration. Germany\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus infections rose by 2,821 on Sunday to 120,479, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed. That was lower than a 4,133 increase reported on Saturday, and marked the second decline after four days of increases. The reported death toll rose by 129 to 2,673. The partner of Julian Assange has pleaded for him to be released from prison on bail over fears he could contract Covid-19. Stella Moris, who also revealed the couple have two children, aged one and three, said Assange had been in poor health for months and there were now genuine fears that the coronavirus was spreading the London\u2019s Belmarsh prison where he is being held, awaiting an extradition hearing. One prisoner has died and a number of prison officers are off sick with suspected Covid-19, Assange\u2019s friends have claimed. Moris said Assange was in isolation 23 hours an day and all visits had been stopped. The pandemic has been a \u201cperfect storm\u201d for South Asian countries, the World Bank has said. AFP has more on the World Bank report released on Sunday. South Asia is on course for its worst economic performance in 40 years, with decades of progress in the battle against poverty at risk, because of coronavirus. India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan and other smaller nations, which have 1.8bn people and some of the planet\u2019s most densely populated cities, have so far reported relatively few coronavirus cases but experts fear they could be the next hotspots. The dire economic effects are already much in evidence, with widespread lockdowns freezing most normal activity, Western factory orders cancelled and vast numbers of poor workers suddenly jobless. \u201cSouth Asia finds itself in a perfect storm of adverse effects. Tourism has dried up, supply chains have been disrupted, demand for garments has collapsed and consumer and investor sentiments have deteriorated,\u201d said a World Bank report. It slashed its growth forecast for the region this year to 1.8-2.8 % from its pre-pandemic projection of 6.3 %, with at least half the countries falling into \u201cdeep recession\u201d. Worst hit will be the Maldives where the collapse of tourism will result in gross domestic output contracting by as much as 13 %, while Afghanistan could shrink by as much as 5.9 % and Pakistan by up to 2.2 %. Regional heavyweight India, where the fiscal year began on April 1, will see growth of just 1.5-2.8% in its current financial year, down from an expected 4.8-5.0% for the year just ended, the bank predicted. Donald Trump has said that reopening parts of the US for working life will be one of the toughest decisions he ever makes, and he\u2019ll be making it \u201creasonably soon\u201d. Speaking with Fox show \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d, Trump said: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the toughest decision I ever made and hopefully the most difficult I will ever have to make. I hope I\u2019m going to make the right decision. I will be basing it on a lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders. There are a lot of things that go into a decision like that. And it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and instincts.\u201d \u201cPeople want to get back, they want to get back to work. We have to bring our country back,\u201d he said. Separately, Trump has also continued his attacks on parts of the media, including the New York Times which ran an investigation into his and his administrations actions in January and February when the outbreak was spreading across the world. As the coronavirus pandemic causes global economic devastation, China could take control of debt-struck nations\u2019 assets at an accelerated rate, or it could boost its soft diplomacy by forgiving debt. The choice has been laid out by the authors of a Harvard report on a Chinese tactic dubbed \u201cdebtbook diplomacy\u201d, and comes amid calls for G20 nations to endorse a year-long debt moratorium for the poorest countries. State-owned Chinese companies and banks have become major international lenders, including through large scale infrastructure investments under Xi Jinping\u2019s Belt and Road initiative. China watchers have previously warned about the \u201cdebtbook diplomacy\u201d ploy, where developing nations are unable to service heavy loan repayments on Chinese infrastructure investments, forcing them to relinquish control of assets to China. \u201cDebt is a very flexible instrument,\u201d said report co-author Gabrielle Chefitz. \u201cAs we see China making big soft power push, looking down the line \u2026 there are opportunities for China to require payment on debt perhaps with strategic assets in return, or to forgive that debt which furthers that soft power narrative as a global leader.\u201d More here: Guatemala has reported 16 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the central American nation\u2019s total to 153 cases, president Alejandro Giammattei said. Three people have died from the disease. Great story from the Miami Herald which reports that Florida\u2019s governor allegedly put pressure on the paper\u2019s lawyers to quash a law suit demanding that the state divulge records showing how many people in care homes have tested positive for the virus. The law firm, Holland &amp; Knight, told Sanford Bohrer, a senior partner with decades of representing the Miami Herald, to stand down and abandon the lawsuit, the paper reports. It has refiled the suit through another law firm. The governor, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has been accused of responding too slowly to the threat of the virus. The coronavirus behind Covid-19 can produce three times more pathogens than the one behind Sars, a Hong Kong University study has found. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, the study is the first of its kind based on testing of lung tissue from Covid-19 patients. The team infected lung tissues donated by six patients and found that Sars-CoV-2 could replicate by about 100 time within 48 hours, compared to the Sars virus peaking at about 10-20. The new virus also induced slower immune and inflammatory responses, it said. \u201cThe virus is like a ninja, replicating inside the body with lower inteferons and inflammatory response,\u201d said Dr Jasper Chan Fok-woo, a colinical assistant professor at HKU\u2019s medical school. Mild symptoms or a lack of them has made this virus particularly difficult to contain, and the scientists warned measures would have to continue. Microbiologist Yuen Kwok-yung sai there was \u201calmost no possibility of containing the virus before July\u201d. A meeting of the North Korean ruling party\u2019s central committee, presided over by Kim Jong Un, has called for stricter and more thorough countermeasures to ensure the safety of its citizens. A joint resolution was adopted to take \u201cmore thorough state measures for protecting life and safety of (its) people from the great worldwide epidemic disease.\u201d The Korean Central News Agency said the widespread virus has created obstacles to the country\u2019s effort in its economic construction, though it added the country \u201chas been maintaining (a) very stable anti-epidemic situation\u201d thanks to its \u201cstrict top-class emergency anti-epidemic measures ... consistency and compulsoriness in the nationwide protective measures.\u201d A World Health Organisation representative to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea told Reuters on Tuesday that the country continues testing of the coronavirus and has more than 500 people in quarantine but still had no confirmed cases yet. From Reuters in Russia, where a \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus patients has started to put a strain on Moscow\u2019s hospitals. \u201cThe situation in both Moscow and St Petersburg, but mostly in Moscow, is quite tense because the number of sick people is growing,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview on state television, news agencies reported. \u201cThere is a huge influx of patients. We are seeing hospitals in Moscow working extremely intensely, in heroic, emergency mode.\u201d Russia\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said hospitals were taking all possible measures to ensure rapid admissions and that cases of ambulances needing to wait hours to drop off patients was not a systemic issue. Russia has reported 13,584 cases of the virus, and the authorities said on Saturday that 12 new coronavirus-related deaths in the last day had pushed the death toll to 106. Mexico reported 375 new cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, bringing the country\u2019s total to 4,219 cases and 273 deaths, the health ministry said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Saturday condemned aggression towards French people travelling into border areas, which has flared amid the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. \u201cCoronavirus knows nothing of nationality. It\u2019s the same for human dignity. It hurts to see how some of our French friends have been insulted and attacked because of Covid-19,\u201d Mass posted on Twitter. \u201cSuch behaviour is completely unacceptable. And besides: we are in the same boat,\u201d he added. Maas\u2019 tweet came in response to a similarly apologetic post from Anke Rehlinger, economy minister in Saarland state which borders France\u2019s Grand Est region. \u201cI apologise to our French friends for these isolated incidents.\u201d Some days before, the mayor of a small town on the border, Gersheim complained of \u201ca certain hostility to our French friends\u201d in his district, including people being spat at. One had been told to \u201cgo back to your corona-ridden country,\u201d Michael Clivot added. The French consul in Saarland, Catherine Robinet, confirmed that \u2018isolated\u2019 incidents targeting French nationals had taken place in the region, but she urged against \u201cgeneralising\u201d the anti-French sentiment, adding that she had also received numerous messages of support. Some people in France also have reacted poorly to Germans in the country, she added. Mainland China has reported 99 new cases on Saturday, of which all but two were imported. The country\u2019s national health commission said no one had died from the virus on Saturday. The two local cases were in Heilongjiang, China\u2019s northernmost province and which borders Russia. Of the 97 imported cases recorded, 43 were in the city of Shanghai. There were no new cases reported in Hubei, the province where the outbreak is believed to have begun. Elderly people may have to be kept isolated until the end of the year to protect them from the coronavirus, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has said. \u201cWithout a vaccine, we have to limit as much as possible contact with the elderly,\u201d she told the Germany daily Bild. \u201cI know it\u2019s difficult and that isolation is a burden, but it is a question of life or death, we have to remain disciplined and patient.\u201d \u201cChildren and young people will enjoy more freedom of movement earlier than elderly people and those with pre-existing medical conditions,\u201d she said. She said she hoped that a European laboratory will develop a vaccine towards the end of the year. To ensure that people can be quickly vaccinated, authorities are already in talks with producers on gearing up for world production, she added. In Australia more than a thousand people will land on home soil after weeks stranded abroad, AAP reports. Long-stuck travellers flown from Peru, Uruguay, India and Nepal will trickle through Sydney and Melbourne on Sunday before being shuttled to hotels for two weeks of quarantine. Nearly 100 of them spent weeks stranded on an Antarctic cruise ship off the coast of Uruguay while another 63 left Kathmandu on a Canadian government-backed flight. \u201cThanks also to (the) Canadian High Commission in New Delhi and Canadian Govt. To do what you did remotely ... hats off,\u201d Australian Ambassador to Nepal Peter Budd tweeted on Saturday night. Puerto Rico, which has reported more than 780 cases of Covid-19, and at least 42 deaths, will continue its lockdown until at least 3 May. Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez announced on Saturday that people must stay indoors from 9pm to 5am, and only leave their house outside those hours to buy food or medicine or go to the bank. Non-essential businesses will remain closed. However, she lifted all license plate restrictions and said hardware stores and car repair shops can operate once a week on a limited schedule. Everyone is still required to wear a face mask to enter any business as Health Secretary Lorenzo Gonz\u00e1lez warned that the peak of cases is not expected until early May. Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman has approved an extension of the kingdom\u2019s curfew until further notice, the state news agency (SPA) reported early on Sunday. The country has been under a 7pm to 6am curfew since 23 March, due to the rate at which the coronavirus is currently spreading. The capital Riyadh, and other big cities, were plcaed under a 24-hour curfew last week. The Pope has urged people not to \u201cyield to fear\u201d in his Easter address. \u201cEaster offers a message of hope in peoples darkest hour,\u201d Pope Francis said at a late-night vigil Mass Saturday in St. Peters Basilica. The public was barred because of the pandemic, and around the world Catholics followed his service and other Masses on television or online. \u201cDo not be afraid, do not yield to fear: This is the message of hope,\u201d said the Pope. \u201cIt is addressed to us, today. These are the words that God repeats to us this very night.\u201d He encouraged people to be \u201cmessengers of life in a time of death,\u201d again condemning the arms trade and urging those better off to help the poor. Hello, welcome to the Guardian\u2019s continuing international coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to Molly Blackall and other colleagues in London for taking us through the last day. This is Helen Davidson, in Sydney, to take you through from here. If you would like to follow the Australia-focused blog you can find it here. For US-specific updates, head over the the US blog here. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest international developments. The global death toll has reached 108,281, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. For the first time in history, all 50 US states are now under disaster declarations, after Wyoming became the final state to announce. Pope Francis has urged people not to \u201cyield to fear\u201d at his Easter address. The event was scaled back due to coronavirus, with just two dozen attendees, a smaller choir, and no processions or baptisms. British prime minister Boris Johnson has said he owes his life to the NHS. He has been in hospital since Sunday night, and had spent three nights in intensive care. British opposition parties and senior Conservatives have united in calling on the British government to reopen Parliament. Seven African states have called on authorities to explain allegations of mistreatment of Africans in Guangzhou city. Many report having been evicted, tested for coronavirus several times without being given results and being shunned and discriminated against in public. The Kremlin have warned that Moscow\u2019s hospitals are under strain after a \u201chuge influx\u201d of coronavirus cases. The World Health Organisation have warned that Belarus must take further action to combat coronavirus, as they enter a new phase of infection. Belarus are still hosting football games, and their President, Alexander Lukashenko, has downplayed restrictive measures. In recent weeks, he has said that drinking vodka and bathing in saunas could help fight the virus.",

It\u2019s a tad bit convoluted to explain, although it\u2019s rather easy to follow once the game is in progress. </p> <p>For the purpose of this tournament, players will be facing each other one-on-one. The first player (decided by a coin flip, in this particular instance) literally calls the shot: they specify a particular shot that they will attempt. Should they make it, the other player has to make the same shot. If that player fails, they get a letter starting with H (followed by O and then an R and then a\u2026 well I think you get the picture). Then it\u2019s that player\u2019s turn to challenge the other. A player is eliminated on the fifth shot they fail to pull off.</p> <p><strong>So the goal for each player is NOT to spell H-O-R-S-E?<br></strong></p> <p>Correct. Reverse \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d rules.</p> <p><strong>Why a horse? Why not a chicken?</strong></p> <p>It turns out that the origin of \u201cH-O-R-S-E\u201d is a nearly impossible thing to google. (I did find some interesting things about evolution, so it\u2019s not a total wash.) Maybe it was just the optimal number of letters, as there\u2019s a shorter version called P-I-G.</p> <p><strong>Wait, doesn\u2019t this means that there\u2019s no time limit here?</strong></p> <p>Yes, although this is scheduled to be a two-hour event, how long we\u2019re actually here depends on how good the players are at making shots. (Spoilers: they are very, very good.) If this does last a long time, it\u2019s probably a good thing. The more competitive tonight\u2019s tournament is, the more entertaining it will likely be. Plus, hey, there hasn\u2019t been basketball in a month, so in my book the longer this goes, the better.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9387048f082dfd549d5338\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T22:20:04.295Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oh hey look, it\u2019s an actual sporting event! </p> <p>As you\u2019ve probably heard, pretty much the entire U.S. has been shut down for the last month. In fact, the NBA deserves at least parital credit in helping the country realize just how serious the coronavirus pandemic was about to become. After Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19, Adam Silver made the quick decision to immediately <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/12/nba-suspends-season-covid-19-coronavirus-basketball\">shut down the league indefinitely</a>. It was a bold move, and the other sports leagues followed suit.</p> <p>Here we are a month later and a healthy percentage of the country is under quarantine. Ironically, we\u2019ve never needed the distraction of live sports more. There are only so many episodes of \u201cTiger King\u201d to binge, after all. Thankfully, ESPN and the NBA managed to figure out a way to put together a vaguely sports-related competition without, you know, putting huge groups of people at risk. While team basketball, even in an empty arena, is a no-go, H-O-R-S-E is turn based. This means, players can compete with each other without violating social distancing guidelines. </p> <p>ESPN, which has been desperate for content over the last few weeks for obvious reasons, plans to make the most out of this tournament. Today is merely the first round and we won\u2019t crown a winner until the remaining two rounds play out on Thursday.<br></p> <p>The good thing about social distancing is that it doesn\u2019t affect your ability to communicate with us.

Those will feature Conley vs Billups and Quigley vs. LaVine, with the winners meeting in the Finals. That will do it for tonight\u2019s basketball-related activities, thanks to everybody who followed along. Ciao! Quigley banks a free throw and Paul\u2019s attempt banks out. That\u2019s H-O-R-S-E and that\u2019s the end of Chris Paul. Quigley calls for a right-wing bank shot that she can\u2019t follow through on. Paul\u2019s back in control, he calls on a one-hand, right-leg free throw. He serves it up, waiter-style. Quigley duplicates it and Paul, yet again, can\u2019t make the shot he calls for. Quigley has yet another chance to end this. Paul has to make one behind the backboard, which he does. Quigley has to go back to the well for a closing shot. She decides on a WNBA three-pointer. Paul makes it. This is legitimately suspenseful now. Quigley can\u2019t avoid hitting the rim and she\u2019s at H-O-R. Paul\u2019s still very much alive, but he can\u2019t pull off his own shot. Quigley has another chance to close this one out. Paul comes up with a ridiculously convoluted, multi-part shot that I can\u2019t even follow, let alone imagine making. Quigley misses. She\u2019s at H-O. Do we have a Paul comeback brewing? Quigley is just one Paul miss away from putting me at 0-4 as far as pre-tournament predictions. I don\u2019t feel quite as bad for jinxing him as I did Pierce though. Quigley misses her chance at putting Paul away and Paul can start calling shots. Paul can\u2019t make a bank shot and he\u2019s at H-O-R-S. He\u2019s on the ropes. Paul can\u2019t make a floater of the glass. He\u2019s up to H-O-R. Quigley\u2019s still in control. This match feels substantially more entertaining than the previous three. Meanwhile, ESPN is promoting the hell out of this Michael Jordan documentary, which ESPN desperately needs to be a huge hit in the absence of real sports (and this tournament doesn\u2019t quite count, to be frank). Quigley misses a WNBA three pointer. Paul\u2019s back in control and he goes simple here: a regular free throw and THIS is the shot Quigley can\u2019t make. She gets her first letter. Never mind, Paul can\u2019t answer and he picks up a H. Quigley then sits down for her next shot attempt. \u201cI just hope she misses,\u201d Paul says, not confident he can match. She doesn\u2019t, he does. He\u2019s at H-O. Quigley wins the coin toss, so she\u2019s going to be in control to start things off. That seems to be something of an advantage here. It doesn\u2019t last, however. A miss puts things back in Paul\u2019s court\u2026 but he can\u2019t take advantage. Quigley\u2019s back in charge. We have a few misses here, but they\u2019ve all been from the shot-callers, so nobody\u2019s got a letter yet. Quigley sounds a bit like she\u2019s autotuned here thanks to a rather iffy audio situation. If you were hoping that Paul also had a sweet home gym like Conley, well he\u2019s playing outdoors. Sorry. Oh for the record, the reason that Zach LaVine, a two-time dunk contest winner, did not attempt a dunk in this contest? They\u2019re not allowed. If ESPN ever does this again, I imagine they might change that. Chris Paul will be up against Allie Quigley next. Let\u2019s see if that ends up being a tad more competitive. It\u2019s hard to picture either of them flaming out as badly as Pierce did. I am now 0-for-3 in predictions, so sorry in advance to Chris Paul. LaVine was on fire from the get go and forced Pierce to match ridiculously tricky shots. He could very well be the favorite going forward. Pierce brings out a scooter. Is he planning to introduce props into the equation here? He may not get the opportunity here. LaVine forces Pierce to take a way long three-pointer, out beyond the confines of the court and into the grass and he can\u2019t make it. Pierce is eliminated. LaVine did not get a single letter. The reviews are even coming from NBA players themselves. Pierce and LaVine show off their homes in a pretaped segment. ESPN shows us shots of LaVine playing against his dog and why isn\u2019t THIS the main event? Can Pierce do a left handed jumper off the block? Pierce cannot. Make that H-O-R-S. LaVine bounces one off the backboard and then hits a smooth jumper and it seems like this will end Pierce, who has been struggling, but this manages to be the one shot he\u2019s able to duplicate. Go figure. LaVine is in control and has yet to receive a Scarlet Letter. When LaVine does a reverse, Pierce can\u2019t even get his shot off during his attempt. Pierce is at H-O-R. So far the glimpses into the players\u2019 homes and personal lives has been far more interesting than the basketball itself. ESPN shows a few clips of them trying to set things up, highlighting what a clearly D.I.Y. affair this is. They jam econo, to quote to the Minutemen. He\u2019s in good position to at least win this matchup as Pierce misses again to put him at H-O. Pierce starts things off with a Dirk Nowitzki attempt that fails, immediately putting LaVine in control. Not the best start for the Truth. \u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d Pierce complains right before missing and picking up his first letter. Pierce does not have a home gym but he does have a sweet Boston Celtics logo on his court and his son providing emotional support. LaVine is out there on his own. Advantage: LaVine. Fewer distractions. Well I\u2019m 0-2 in my predictions. I will add that Conley, as he himself admitted, had the home court advantage of not having to play outside in wind and cold. I just hope I haven\u2019t jinxed Paul Pierce who is going to face Zach LaVine. For those of you wondering what you buy when you sign a contract worth $152 million. Catchings misses her shot, meaning that Conley\u2019s back in control. Conley puts Catchings on her own lawn for an over-the-top of the backboard shot that she can\u2019t make. Catchings has been eliminated. Next up Conley challenges her to an off hand shot from the right corner, she\u2019s at H-O-R-S. Catchings catches a break as Conley, in a position to put her away, misses the shot he was attempting. The ball\u2019s back in her court (or driveway) and Conley can\u2019t duplicate her shot. He picks up his first letter. We pause on the proceedings for Catchings to talk about the late Kobe Bryant, whom she knew well. Then she misses an offhand free throw. She\u2019s at H-O-R, now. I probably should stop making predictions about anything at this point. Catchings is at H-O after being unable to duplicate a ridiculously intricate turnaround from Conley. I will grant you this: Conley\u2019s ridiculously professional-grade home gym greatly improves the visual quality of the tournament. Catchings catches the first letter. She and Conley are attempting much trickier shots than Young and Billups did. Catchings is outside on her driveway. Conley has a home gym. This feels like a metaphor for the financial differences between men\u2019s sports and women\u2019s sports. Catchings wins the coin toss and will start the proceedings. And now we have Tamika Catchings vs. Mike Conley. Twitter is honing in on the lack of production values for this event. Young misses a one handed, underhand free throw and he\u2019s now at H-O-R-S. He\u2019s one miss away from elimination. He misses the very next attempt and that\u2019s H-O-R-S-E. Billups advances. So much for my prediction about Young going all the way. Sorry for jinxing it, Trae. Nice comeback from Chauncey after falling behind. And we return to the Blair Witch Basketball Tournament. Okay, somewhere along the way I missed a Young miss so it\u2019s actually tied at H-O-R. (Yes, it\u2019s really odd to be using letters instead of numbers to score this thing, it\u2019s very post-modern.) Okay so Billups is at H-O-R. Young is at H-O. Okay, the main problem so far is that the footage is so glitchy that I\u2019m continually convinced that Comcast is lagging on me. I\u2019m not alone here, apparently. I can\u2019t tell if this is genuinely entertaining or if I\u2019m just a basketball junkie who has gone forever since his last fix. Young balls behind the backboard\u2026 and misses! Billups is back in control. One dribble, right leg, three-point shot: he makes it! The degree of difficulty has increased dramatically and Young can\u2019t answer. He gets his H. Billups calls for right corner, feet out of bounds, behind the backboard. He makes that as well. Young has to go on his lawn to attempt this one and it\u2019s no good. He gets an O. Young\u2019s going fairly conservative here, but maybe that\u2019s best for us as it\u2019s kind of easing us into the competiton. Apparently this is tricky to watch in the UK. Billups in control, three-ball, left wing, no net is the call. He misses. Young once again gets in control, he calls for a three and Billups smoothly knocks one down. Young calls for left handed free throw. He makes it, as he seems to be making just about everything. Billups misses. He\u2019s up to H-O-R. Left handed free throw from Young. He misses! Billups gets his first chance to pick a shot. He misses whatever he was trying. Young goes for a floater that can\u2019t hit the rim. He also misses. Back to Billups, who hits a bank shot. Young knocks it in. Billups is still in control, he calls for backboard no rim\u2026 and his shot hits the rim. The ball\u2019s back in Young\u2019s court literally, he hits a left-handed free throw. Billups answers. Young gets to choose first after Billups loses the coin toss. Young starts things off simple with a free throw, that may not quite be regulation. Billups answers. Next up is a three-pointer, which they both make. The next Young his a left-handed shot and Billups can\u2019t answer. He gets himself a \u201cH.\u201d In Norman, OK. Trae Young will be playing in his driveway. The audio quality is not ideal. Chauncey Billups has his own basketball court in Denver. Advantage: Billups. A sense of how ESPN has been dealing with the lack of sports: They just wrapped up showing Spelling Bee reruns. And here we have Mark Jones, broadcasting from his home (this is something that will never stop being surreal). The tournament is about to begin, let\u2019s see how this works. If it works. It\u2019s hard to know if this experiment will end up attracting the kind of viewership they get when airing actual games, but at the very least NBA Twitter, which has had absolutely nothing to talk about for weeks now, is paying attention. I hate this prediction lots, by the way. Predictions Well, we won\u2019t get our champion today, we\u2019ll have to wait for the grand finale on Thursday, but we can at least make predictions for who will advance to the semi-finals. Here are my picks: Trae Young OVER Chauncey Billups. Young\u2019s also the favorite to go all the way and I don\u2019t disagree with the experts here. Tamika Catchings OVER Mike Conley. Note, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time that I\u2019ve underestimated Conley, but I\u2019m comfortable with my prediction. Paul Pierce OVER Zach LaVine: This is solely because I\u2019m a Boston Celtics fan, mind you. Chris Paul OVER Allie Quigley: I\u2019ll happily be wrong here. If you have predictions, feel free to send them over here and we\u2019ll expose them to the world. You can email Hunter.Felt.Freelance@theguardian.com or tweet them to @HunterFelt. The most famous game of H-O-R-S-E ever played didn\u2019t even really happen and, also, it was technically a game of \u201cH.\u201d In a legendary McDonalds ad campaign, living legends Michael Jordan and Larry Bird exchanged increasingly impossible baskets, with the winner getting the prize of a\u2026 Big Mac and some fries. The moral of this commercial? Some rich people are such absolute cheapskates that they will go to ridiculous lengths to avoid paying for anything, even if it\u2019s just a hamburger. It\u2019s like a complete refutation of the absurdity of trickle-down economics within the span of just 60 seconds. The Participants Our players: Chris Paul of the Oklahoma City Thunder, Trea Young of the Atlanta Hawks, Zach LaVine of the Chicago Bulls, Mike Conley of the Utah Jazz, WNBA legend Tamika Catchings, current WNBA star Allie Quigley of the Chicago Sky and retired legends Chauncey Billups and Paul Pierce. What\u2019s also interesting in today\u2019 tournament: it\u2019s co-ed! Here are your first round matchups: Trae Young vs Chauncey Billups Tamika Catchings vs Mike Conley Zach LaVine vs Paul Pierce Chris Paul vs Allie Quigley What is H-O-R-S-E? The short answer is that H-O-R-S-E is a turn-based skill contest where players battle to show off their ability to make specific shots. Could you go into more detail? I was worried you would ask this. It\u2019s a tad bit convoluted to explain, although it\u2019s rather easy to follow once the game is in progress. For the purpose of this tournament, players will be facing each other one-on-one. The first player (decided by a coin flip, in this particular instance) literally calls the shot: they specify a particular shot that they will attempt. Should they make it, the other player has to make the same shot. If that player fails, they get a letter starting with H (followed by O and then an R and then a\u2026 well I think you get the picture). Then it\u2019s that player\u2019s turn to challenge the other. A player is eliminated on the fifth shot they fail to pull off. So the goal for each player is NOT to spell H-O-R-S-E? Correct. Reverse \u201cWheel of Fortune\u201d rules. Why a horse? Why not a chicken? It turns out that the origin of \u201cH-O-R-S-E\u201d is a nearly impossible thing to google. (I did find some interesting things about evolution, so it\u2019s not a total wash.) Maybe it was just the optimal number of letters, as there\u2019s a shorter version called P-I-G. Wait, doesn\u2019t this means that there\u2019s no time limit here? Yes, although this is scheduled to be a two-hour event, how long we\u2019re actually here depends on how good the players are at making shots. (Spoilers: they are very, very good.) If this does last a long time, it\u2019s probably a good thing. The more competitive tonight\u2019s tournament is, the more entertaining it will likely be. Plus, hey, there hasn\u2019t been basketball in a month, so in my book the longer this goes, the better. Oh hey look, it\u2019s an actual sporting event! As you\u2019ve probably heard, pretty much the entire U.S. has been shut down for the last month. In fact, the NBA deserves at least parital credit in helping the country realize just how serious the coronavirus pandemic was about to become. After Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19, Adam Silver made the quick decision to immediately shut down the league indefinitely. It was a bold move, and the other sports leagues followed suit. Here we are a month later and a healthy percentage of the country is under quarantine. Ironically, we\u2019ve never needed the distraction of live sports more. There are only so many episodes of \u201cTiger King\u201d to binge, after all. Thankfully, ESPN and the NBA managed to figure out a way to put together a vaguely sports-related competition without, you know, putting huge groups of people at risk. While team basketball, even in an empty arena, is a no-go, H-O-R-S-E is turn based. This means, players can compete with each other without violating social distancing guidelines. ESPN, which has been desperate for content over the last few weeks for obvious reasons, plans to make the most out of this tournament. Today is merely the first round and we won\u2019t crown a winner until the remaining two rounds play out on Thursday. The good thing about social distancing is that it doesn\u2019t affect your ability to communicate with us. We\u2019ll be taking your questions and commentary throughout tonight\u2019s competition. Just shoot an email to Hunter.Felt.Freelance@theguardian.com or tweet @HunterFelt and we\u2019ll include your thoughts in the liveblog. The tournament is scheduled to start at 7:00pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back before then with some further pre-competition thoughts, including an explanation of just what H-O-R-S-E actually is. Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s LeBron James on the NBA shutdown: LeBron James says he won\u2019t be able to enjoy \u201cclosure\u201d on the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 superb season if it is unable to be completed. The Lakers were in stunning form throughout the season that was halted by coronavirus on 11 March. With 19 games until the play-offs, the club had easily the best win-loss record in the Western Conference, at 49-14. They led the second-place LA Clippers by five and a half games games and were steaming towards their first playoff appearance since 2013. In a conference call with reporters, James said while he could be proud of the Lakers\u2019 performances this season, he would still feel less than fulfilled if the season can not be completed. \u201cI can have some satisfaction on what our team has been able to do this year (with) a first-year coach, first-year system, a whole new coaching staff, bringing on so many new pieces to our team this year,\u201d James was quoted as saying by Sports Illustrated. \u201c(But) I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to have any closure if we do not have an opportunity to finish this season.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "First, the Chinese came to Belgrade, with planeloads of equipment and six medical experts to help coordinate national coronavirus policy. An emotional Serbian president kissed the Chinese flag in gratitude and slammed Europe for its lack of assistance. Then came the Russians, who flew in less crucial but nevertheless welcome resources on military jets with much media fanfare. Finally the Europeans came, pointing out that they had been there all along and had funded significantly more than Russia and China put together. In Serbia, a candidate country for eventual EU accession that has also courted Moscow and Beijing in recent years, the intersection of competing \u201ccoronavirus diplomacies\u201d is highly visible. As the pandemic gathers speed, major players are looking to use soft power and aid to fulfil their foreign policy goals. For the EU, it\u2019s trying to prove that talk of European values and solidarity is not just empty words. For China, it\u2019s changing the narrative to present the country as the solution to coronavirus, not its cause. For Russia, it\u2019s using more modest resources for maximum effect, with Russian military vehicles driving through Italy or a planeload of equipment despatched to the US partly produced by a sanctioned company. The Americans, focused internally under the Trump administration, have largely been absent from the coronavirus diplomacy game.

      "bodyText": "Iran\u2019s president has been accused of leaving the country exposed to a second coronavirus outbreak after he relaxed social distancing rules in the face of concerns that as many as 7 million Iranians had been left jobless or suffering wage cuts because of the restrictions imposed by the government over the last month. Hassan Rouhani has urged millions of low-risk businesses to reopen and lifted travel restrictions within provinces. Most businesses in Tehran are not due to reopen formally until 18 April, but travel has already intensified, leading to a build-up of traffic. Surveys cited by the government showed that a third of people are experiencing financial problems. Ali Rabiei, Rouhani\u2019s spokesman, told the Isna news agency that the Covid-19 crisis had affected 3.3 million official employees through dismissal, suspension or reduction of wages, with a further 4 million self-employed also feeling its impact. In common with most world leaders, Rouhani is wrestling with the competing needs of collapsing living standards and public health. Iranian officials describe it as a dual policy of \u201csaving lives and providing bread\u201d. He is also operating against a backdrop of US economic sanctions and public scepticism about official government statistics on the spread of coronavirus. Schools, religious services, mass gatherings and many shops remain closed and Rouhani has said if the position did not improve he expected the existing closures to remain in place through Ramadan. He urged people to use private cars after there were crowded buses on the first day of the relaxed rules on Saturday. The metro has called for \u201csmart distancing\u201d, although what this means in practice is not clear. Iran\u2019s medical system organisation expressed concern, saying smart distancing \u201cwas being introduced without considering the scientific and executive justifications for the project, or the threat that the past efforts of all people, officials and medical staff will be wasted\u201d. The Tehran city council chairman, warned the reopening of business might lead to \u201ca second wave of coronavirus\u201d. Ali Maher, the planning deputy of the Tehran coronavirus taskforce, said the Rouhani government has been shifting between two different approaches against the spread of the virus, one of mass immunity and the other of implementing lockdowns and quarantines. The signs of pressure on the government are growing. In an unprecedented step, union leaders have refused to back a proposed 21% increase in the minimum wage \u2013 well below the current 40% inflation rate. Ministers are offering individual loans to those suffering most, but even that help is being criticised, as the monthly repayment instalments will attract 12% interest. Newspapers have also been dealt a heavy blow, with the government proposing to ban all but online newspapers temporarily on the basis paper might transmit infection. The plan, subsequently withdrawn, led to warnings of mass permanent newspaper closures. Redundancies, including in prestigious reformist newspapers such as Etemad, have gone ahead. Tragedies, including the death of three generations of men in one family, are being publicised in a bid to underline the seriousness of the crisis. A mother and son were reported to have committed suicide after the father died. There are also growing reports of domestic violence, with one Tehran counselling service saying it had taken 4,000 calls in the last few days. Children stuck at home without education do not have the money to afford the internet required to download lessons. The health ministry\u2019s latest statistics on Sunday showed a continued de-escalation of coronavirus cases, with 4,474 now dead and 71,686 infected.

Tours of the Unesco world heritage site came to a grinding halt last month as Spain began battling one of the world\u2019s deadliest coronavirus epidemics. \u201cLa Pedrera closed its doors and I stayed inside, like a guardian,\u201d said Viladomiu. \u201cAll I hear is my footsteps and silence.\u201d Two other tenants remain in another part of the building \u2013 separated from Viladomiu with their own elevator and staircase \u2013 while a few security guards rotate through their shifts unseen. \u201cSo I\u2019m really by myself,\u201d she said. Her unusual status as a tenant in a tourist attraction came to light last year after she published a book, The Last Neighbour, weaving together the history of the building with her experience of living on the fourth floor of an attraction that received some 1.3 million visitors last year. The book hinted at the trade-offs of a life within the curved surfaces that echo Gaudi\u2019s unfinished Sagrada Familia basilica; from elbowing her way through crowds to get to her front door to the many who peer into her apartment as they tour the site. Like much of Spain, however, the building has been transformed in recent weeks by the pandemic. \u201cWhat surprised me the most is the silence,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt alone living here, this building is always bustling. Now there is nobody.\u201d The quiet has its advantages, she noted, such as the freedom to take out the rubbish in pyjamas. \u201cThere\u2019s usually so many people. I would never dare take the elevator in a nightgown,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cNow I\u2019ve been wandering around here freely. I\u2019m liking that a lot.\u201d She has taken comfort in the building\u2019s cast iron pillars, bright airy courtyards and sculptural nods to nature. \u201cI\u2019m really privileged to be surrounded by art and beauty,\u201d she said. \u201cIn these tough moments, they help lift the spirit.\u201d Amid signs that the outbreak in Spain is slowing, the government has said it is studying how it might gradually ease the near-total lockdown. But Viladomiu said she was doubtful her solitary status would end anytime soon. \u201cI\u2019m getting more and more used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to be shocking is that first day when they open the doors and people start pouring in. I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Madre mia, what is happening?\u2019\u201d",

So they have been working with frontline staff to reuse visors and a burgeoning cottage industry of 3D visor printing has grown up overnight.</p> \n<p>The shortage of clinical gowns over the past week has been more difficult to address as, to protect staff, the gowns have to meet a high technical specification.

      "body": "<p>Last week, I spoke to Anna Rogers, a Polish-born Londoner who lives in Brixton. She works for a charity called <a href=\"https://www.moneyaande.co.uk/\">Money A+E</a>, which operates across the south of the capital. It offers advice about debt, benefits and other financial issues to people who are often facing extreme hardship. It is a small set-up, with only four dedicated advisers. Since the coronavirus crisis began, the number of people getting in touch has tripled and is rising all the time.</p> \n<p>Rogers spoke matter-of-factly about the defining feature of many who now need her help. \u201cThey are people without any income,\u201d she said. Many are migrant workers who have been sacked by small businesses or had cash-in-hand work \u2013 in, say, the building trade \u2013 suddenly withdrawn.

Now, even last-ditch safety nets are fraying fast. The day after my conversation with Rogers, I spoke to Robin Burgess at the <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-04-09/hope-is-fragile-demand-is-great-the-challenge-for-charities-during-the-pandemic/\">Northampton Hope Centre</a>, a project that runs one of the comparatively rare food banks that deals not only with \u201cambient\u201d items (cans, pasta and other dried goods) but also fresh food. We had briefly spoken a few days before, when he sent me an image of a box of doughnuts covered in mould, sent by one of the big supermarkets \u2013 a particularly vivid example, he said, of how low his organisation\u2019s supplies were running, and how useless some of the \u201chelp\u201d they received sometimes proved to be.</p> \n<p>Donations from the public, Burgess explained, had largely dried up. A lot of fresh food used to come from cafes and restaurants, but they were now shuttered up. Aside from Morrisons, the big supermarkets tended to only directly donate food that was either past or very close to its sell by date, and often of poor nutritional value. And need was inexorably increasing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got about two weeks of supplies, or more like 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have nothing left.\u201d To some extent, he said, what he was facing reflected the growing crisis for charities and voluntary organisations \u2013 who, over the next 12 weeks, are reckoned to face a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/rishi-sunak-heeds-calls-to-help-charities-with-750m-extra-funding\">shortfall of \u00a33.7bn</a>.

The coronavirus crisis brings the polar opposite: a new world of confinement, silence, closures, lay-offs and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/fraudsters-likely-to-target-furlough-scheme-says-hmrc-chief\">furloughing</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>If you are able to work from home, relatively free of anxiety about your job and so far untouched by either illness or death, isolation might come with compensations: you may, indeed, be living the Sunday-supplement lockdown dream of craft projects with the kids and demolishing your backlog of novels.

      "bodyText": "Last week, I spoke to Anna Rogers, a Polish-born Londoner who lives in Brixton. She works for a charity called Money A+E, which operates across the south of the capital. It offers advice about debt, benefits and other financial issues to people who are often facing extreme hardship. It is a small set-up, with only four dedicated advisers. Since the coronavirus crisis began, the number of people getting in touch has tripled and is rising all the time. Rogers spoke matter-of-factly about the defining feature of many who now need her help. \u201cThey are people without any income,\u201d she said. Many are migrant workers who have been sacked by small businesses or had cash-in-hand work \u2013 in, say, the building trade \u2013 suddenly withdrawn. In desperation, some say they would like to return to their countries of origin to be with their families, but that option is cut off right now. A lot of them have no experience of the British benefits system, and few of the language skills and insider knowledge needed to navigate it. \u201cThe universal credit system never worked terribly well,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cBut now people are saying that the system crashes, or they can\u2019t upload documents.\u201d Not everyone has internet access, and the sudden closure of public libraries has meant that even fewer people can get online. Even if they manage to do so, there is now an ominous sense that with the system under such pressure, the standard five-week wait for universal credit is bound to increase. So, for now, Rogers and her colleagues have to introduce people to the most basic kinds of help. One fairly reliable source of food assistance, she said, was the array of new mutual aid groups that have sprung up at the most local level: \u201cFingers crossed, they can get people some food parcels.\u201d When she spoke about the details of her work, her words had a palpable sense not just of sadness, but of urgency and a clear sense that things were only going to get worse, and quickly.

The plan was to raze an infected part of the city\u2019s Chinatown (a plan imbued with racial overtones), <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/08/history-of-the-cordon-sanitaire-honolulu-hawaii-bubonic-plague-in-1899.html\">but the fire ended up destroying most of the city</a> when the wind changed direction.</p> <p>Other countries experimented with burning down urban blocks to create <em>cordons sanitaires</em>, but once the rat was identified as the main carrier, all attention turned to safeguarding buildings against rodents. \u201cEvery city in the world suddenly had committees of engineers trying to devise ways of rat-proofing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a global craze, spawning thousands of patents in the 1910s and 20s, from drainpipe guards to concrete barriers.\u201d</p> <p>Lynteris is sceptical about how much coronavirus will actually change anything. \u201cEpidemics and pandemics have their own temporality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are very condensed times, then panic dissipates very quickly and people rarely follow up.\u201d He points to the 2003 Sars outbreak, when it was discovered that one residential block in Hong Kong became a site of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d because of the way <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC539564/\">contaminated droplets from sewage pipes could enter people\u2019s bathrooms through dried-up U-bends in the drains</a>. Afterwards, there was no overhaul or mass-inspection of plumbing and ventilation systems to stop this happening again. \u201cA one-off pandemic usually has no impact at all,\u201d says Lynteris. \u201cIt has to keep coming back for us to take any notice.\u201d</p> <p>Some are using the current crisis to take a step back and reassess fundamental assumptions about how cities are structured. \u201cThis is the best time ever to think of a walkable city,\u201d says Wouter Vanstiphout, professor of design as politics at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. \u201cCould coronavirus be a catalyst for decentralisation? We have these enormous hospitals and people living on top of each other, but still having to travel long distances across the city to get to them. The pandemic suggests we should distribute smaller units such as hospitals and schools across more of the urban tissue and strengthen local centres.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f134749fa678e8b96c0d4a7c7cc1e92067e563c/0_800_4123_2474/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Personal space \u2026 open-plan offices may become a thing of the past.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lester Lefkowitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With travel limited, the local high street has come into its own: corner shops and bodegas are generally proving much better stocked than supermarkets. The pandemic has also made visible other changes that have been happening under our noses. Vanstiphout says his friends who live in central Amsterdam have had a rude awakening. \u201cNow that tourism has stopped and the Airbnbs are empty,\u201d he says, \u201cthey have discovered they have no neighbours. There is no neighbourhood. There is no city. If you subtract the tourists, there is nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has exposed the effects of tourism and migration on cities across the world in different ways. In Delhi, the decree to stay at home has seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/india-wracked-by-greatest-exodus-since-partition-due-to-coronavirus\">thousands of migrant workers walk hundreds of miles back to their rural villages</a>, with cancelled work leaving them unable to pay rent.</p> <p>\u201cI think that \u2018global cities\u2019 boosterism will take some blows,\u201d says Vanstiphout. \u201cMuch has been made of this fluid network of metropolitan areas, but there is now more of a sense of the city as a place of safety, a place of home and continuity. This whole thing could be taken as warning against migration, but to me it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s a warning against tourism and the inequality that causes labour migration on a temporary basis; a warning against the gig economy and the devastation of public services. There is something really clarifying about a pandemic: you can see the absolute necessity of a public health service and a proper social welfare system. It creates a very clear picture of what is good.\u201d</p>",

Lynteris\u2019s study of the third plague pandemic \u2013 outbreaks of which recurred around the world for several decades, killing more than 12 million people in all \u2013 reveals how the disease spawned drastic urban measures. \u201cBurning down parts of the city was one of the most popular solutions,\u201d he says, citing one extreme attempt in Honolulu in 1900. The plan was to raze an infected part of the city\u2019s Chinatown (a plan imbued with racial overtones), but the fire ended up destroying most of the city when the wind changed direction. Other countries experimented with burning down urban blocks to create cordons sanitaires, but once the rat was identified as the main carrier, all attention turned to safeguarding buildings against rodents. \u201cEvery city in the world suddenly had committees of engineers trying to devise ways of rat-proofing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a global craze, spawning thousands of patents in the 1910s and 20s, from drainpipe guards to concrete barriers.\u201d Lynteris is sceptical about how much coronavirus will actually change anything. \u201cEpidemics and pandemics have their own temporality,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are very condensed times, then panic dissipates very quickly and people rarely follow up.\u201d He points to the 2003 Sars outbreak, when it was discovered that one residential block in Hong Kong became a site of \u201csuper-spreading\u201d because of the way contaminated droplets from sewage pipes could enter people\u2019s bathrooms through dried-up U-bends in the drains. Afterwards, there was no overhaul or mass-inspection of plumbing and ventilation systems to stop this happening again. \u201cA one-off pandemic usually has no impact at all,\u201d says Lynteris. \u201cIt has to keep coming back for us to take any notice.\u201d Some are using the current crisis to take a step back and reassess fundamental assumptions about how cities are structured. \u201cThis is the best time ever to think of a walkable city,\u201d says Wouter Vanstiphout, professor of design as politics at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. \u201cCould coronavirus be a catalyst for decentralisation? We have these enormous hospitals and people living on top of each other, but still having to travel long distances across the city to get to them. The pandemic suggests we should distribute smaller units such as hospitals and schools across more of the urban tissue and strengthen local centres.\u201d With travel limited, the local high street has come into its own: corner shops and bodegas are generally proving much better stocked than supermarkets. The pandemic has also made visible other changes that have been happening under our noses. Vanstiphout says his friends who live in central Amsterdam have had a rude awakening. \u201cNow that tourism has stopped and the Airbnbs are empty,\u201d he says, \u201cthey have discovered they have no neighbours. There is no neighbourhood. There is no city. If you subtract the tourists, there is nothing.\u201d Coronavirus has exposed the effects of tourism and migration on cities across the world in different ways. In Delhi, the decree to stay at home has seen thousands of migrant workers walk hundreds of miles back to their rural villages, with cancelled work leaving them unable to pay rent. \u201cI think that \u2018global cities\u2019 boosterism will take some blows,\u201d says Vanstiphout. \u201cMuch has been made of this fluid network of metropolitan areas, but there is now more of a sense of the city as a place of safety, a place of home and continuity. This whole thing could be taken as warning against migration, but to me it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s a warning against tourism and the inequality that causes labour migration on a temporary basis; a warning against the gig economy and the devastation of public services. There is something really clarifying about a pandemic: you can see the absolute necessity of a public health service and a proper social welfare system. It creates a very clear picture of what is good.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The barrel-vaulted tunnels and platforms of the tube stations traversed by millions of Londoners a day are empty. Some, grotty and bleak with just the sound of a creaking escalator breaking the eerie silence, others such as Lord Foster\u2019s Canary Wharf and the art deco Arnos Grove, laying bare their architectural magnificence in the newly ordained coronavirus peace. A solitary passenger on the escalator at Bank underground station, usually one of the most congested on the network. Signs at Westminster underground station. Three weeks into the coronavirus lockdown, traffic on the tube has been slashed with all but essential workers discouraged from travelling because of the risk of infection in crowds. According to Transport for London, the numbers of journeys have dropped from 3.98m on 3 April last year to just 200,000 on 1 April this year. The tiling at Piccadilly Circus, which was refurbished in the mid-1980s. The original tile designs helped a then more illiterate population identify the stations on the network. TfL gave the Guardian access over two days to chronicle both the classic architecture and the experience of key workers during this historic time. So what is it like? In parts, it is as if the grim reaper is waiting at the bottom of the escalator. Leytonstone psychodrama. Masked man passes mural of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s Psycho shower. Posters at the station entrances offer clear orders: essential workers \u201cyou can travel\u201d, everybody else \u201cgo home\u201d. Staff are cordoned off from the ticket barriers with red and white tape to ensure their distance from potentially infected members of the public. Public address systems blare out war-like instructions across the network every four minutes telling people who shouldn\u2019t be on the tube to go home. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Mike, one of the team here who are supporting journeys for critical workers only\u201d booms the public address system at Whitechapel station opposite one of the biggest hospitals in London. \u201cNo one should be travelling\u201d. Stop. \u201cStay at home\u201d. Stop. \u201cDon\u2019t travel, Stop. \u201cSave lives.\u201d Mike, one of the duty managers at Whitechapel tube. Morale among the staff appears good despite the bad news that morning that 14 transport workers have died after contracting the coronavirus. They feel as if they are playing their part in a war effort. But just who else is still using the tube? NHS staff in their droves, but many more who are also keeping the capital ticking over during the lockdown. The longest escalator in the tube network at Angel station would normally carry hundreds. Westminster The station that is probably used by more powerful people than any other in the network; the hub for MPs, civil servants, lobbyists, journalists along with millions of tourists a year lies virtually empty, with dozens of homeless people now taking the place of buskers and queues into Portcullis House. It is also a hub for NHS staff as it serves St Thomas\u2019 hospital, where Boris Johnson was being treated until his release on Sunday. Jieun Park, 26, banking executive Jieun works in the corporate loans department for a Korean bank at Tower Bridge. She cannot access the banking system at home, so is allowed to travel under government rules. \u201cThis is my first day back at work after 14 days. My flatmate had the symptoms, she had the cough, but she went back to Korea and because everyone going into Korea has to be tested, she got tested and it came back negative.\u201d Asked how she thought the UK was faring with coronavirus compared to Korea she said: \u201cThe UK, I\u2019m sorry to say this, is quite bad. I think the important thing is that everyone gets tested.\u201d \u201cIn Korea you can walk into a GP surgery and get tested. You don\u2019t need to make an appointment and there is a supply of masks for everyone. It\u2019s just an everyday thing.\u201d Akeim Ansine, 22, Amazon worker On his way to work for Amazon at its Park Royal delivery warehouse, Akeim is helping keep the nation in toilet roll. \u201cWe do same day or next delivery groceries. We used to do the normal things like paper, pens, staplers, just general homeware. \u201cNow it\u2019s pasta, toilet paper, oils. Everybody is pretty much overwhelmed,\u201d he said. But in an important message for the nation he says, \u201cthere is an abundance of toilet roll\u201d. \u201cPeople should not be worried. Every day, trucks come and deliver five to 10 pallets a day with about 500 to 1,000 packs per pallet. \u201cWe sell all of that every single day. It\u2019s kind of weird.\u201d Alex, homeless, normally sleeps at Charing Cross station \u201cThey\u2019ve closed Charing Cross and they\u2019re putting us all in hotel rooms, but we\u2019re being allocated rooms miles away. How are we supposed to get there when we have no money for the tube? Last night I tried to get on a bus and the bus driver tried to fight me to get off. We are the victims. When we get to the hotels all the rooms are gone, then where are we supposed to go. It\u2019s a joke,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve closed all the public toilets. How are we meant to wash our hands? I just don\u2019t understand. How can they not allocate free transport to us when they can suddenly allocate housing to people, something they\u2019ve never done before. \u201cWe can\u2019t get enough food. People aren\u2019t going to work so we can\u2019t get money begging. It used to be okay. We used to get fed on the Strand. Over the past 10 years, 500 people got their food there every night and there\u2019s never been any trouble. Now they have police out moving us on. The victims of this are the homeless.\u201d Fernanda Harwicke, 37, assistant manager, Leon restaurant, South Kensington Like many, the Leon restaurant chain, continues to operate but as a supplier of meals to NHS workers and online customers. \u201cYesterday we did 368 meals for the hospital nearby [Chelsea and Westminster]. But we are also supplying food to our customers. \u201cIn the very first week we turned our restaurant into making meals, it has taken time to adapt but it\u2019s good now and it\u2019s good to help the NHS,\u201d she says. Canary Wharf The escalators at Canary Wharf move passengerless to the outside. It is said that more people use this vast cathedral-like station at the heart of Britain\u2019s financial district than Oxford Circus during rush hour. But the grandeur and elegance of Lord Foster\u2019s Docklands tube station is exposed as the hustle and bustle of this station at the heart of Britain\u2019s financial services Docklands district is replaced by an empty, eerie silence. Escalators move passengerless. Some trains pass through without a single passenger getting on or off. Louis Nicholl, 21, from Norfolk Louis is travelling to Southwark for his first day in his new job as a police officer. \u201cWhen I was getting the bus from Sidcup I was more afraid. I came here on the DLR and the driver is barriered off and people can be 10 feet apart so it\u2019s okay.\u201d Roxy Yang, 28, and Sue Yang, 54 Roxy works on the beauty counter at Selfridge\u2019s in Oxford Street and was among the first batch of workers to be furloughed. She decided to leave London because her housemate was still working and she felt she might bring the virus home. Her mother, Sue, came down from Manchester to accompany her home. \u201cShe was very worried I might catch the virus in London. She\u2019s been asking me to come home every day for more than a week. She\u2019s very relieved and happy that finally we are going home,\u201d says Roxy. \u201cThe trains are so empty. It is so different from what it usually is. I\u2019m happy to see that because it means people are staying at home,\u201d she adds. Charlie Briars and Varelie Ivalor The couple have just walked from nearby Poplar to get their cash out of Santander bank but the branch isn\u2019t open so they are on their way on the tube network in search of a branch that is. \u201cI\u2019m really annoyed, they don\u2019t answer the phone. The website has the wrong information. We need to get our money out,\u201d said Charlie. Northern line platform at Bank. A deserted London Bridge concourse. London Bridge London Bridge, one of the critical interchanges in the country, with packed commuter trains connecting with the Jubilee and Northern line tube services, is like a ghost town with shops shuttered and empty concourses. Titi, 40, support worker, mental health services Tito is on her way back from Elephant and Castle after a supervisory visit to a residential unit for adults with learning and mental disabilities. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard. They don\u2019t understand why they have to stay indoors and they are not very happy about it. They like to go out and about. One of them managed to leave the house and they had to call the police. The problem is when they are out they touch everything because they don\u2019t understand about not touching things or about social distancing, so they can bring the virus home. \u201cThe last three weeks have been very stressful. Some of them were crying and on the phone wanting to go. Some have family, some don\u2019t,\u201d she said. Margaret She is travelling from Canning Town to Clapham North hoping to pay her last respects to her friend who has died at home, she believes, of bronchitis. \u201cI am going to a funeral of a friend. Her husband has just died. He was 73 and had bronchitis. I don\u2019t know if the body is still at home.\u201d Only immediate families are advised to attend funeral services in England, according to government guidance, so it is an especially challenging time for all the bereaved. \u201cAt least he died at home and wasn\u2019t in hospital because she wouldn\u2019t have been able to be with him,\u201d she says. *Margaret asked for her real name not to be used. Ricky, 36, security staff Ricky is on his way to work at an office block and is anxious about travelling on the tube. \u201cI follow the distancing rules but when you are on the underground there is more virus because it\u2019s more compact. They gave us gloves and the mask at work. But you notice some sort of crazy people on the tube,\u201d he says as a young adult male, possibly on drugs, bounces erratically around the platform shouting. A lone figure at a Bank tunnel, normally crammed with City types working in financial services. A discarded begging cup and the Mind the Gap warning at Bank. Whitechapel Whitechapel station in east London is the stop for NHS staff working at the Royal London, one of the biggest hospitals in London and home to London\u2019s air ambulance. We visited outside rush hour (due to Tfl restrictions) and the station was near deserted. Sarah, NHS worker Sarah commutes from Essex to the Royal London hospital, one of the biggest hospitals in the capital. She works in \u201cbackline\u201d duties in a non-face-to-face job in blood sciences. She was recently redeployed to another department as part of the hospital\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cI don\u2019t want to particularly come out and travel on the tube but some of us have got to do this. Coming in, there is only one train an hour and the hard part is connecting with the train on the way back,\u201d she says illustrating how hard travelling to work has become after the reduction of transport services. But she is positive. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve not had to breach the two-metre rule.\u201d Giuseppe Casser from Naples He restores antiques but is currently out of work and staying at home. He\u2019s on the tube at Whitechapel where he lives to go to Sloane Square to help an 80-year-old friend who is vulnerable and needs food and cleaning products. \u201cEvery day the tube is full, full, full, but now there are fewer people, it is good. Andrea Peter, 25, from Hungary Andrea is on her way to work in the dispensary at a branch of Boots in Hyde Park. \u201cIn the past two weeks it was a bit scary on the tube. It was quite chaotic in the first few weeks. In the beginning there were a lot more people on the tube. There were lot of homeless people and beggars on almost every train. Now everybody is used to it so it is better.\u201d Monument Monument underground station. Monument station on the north bank of the Thames is linked to Bank through a warren of underground walkways that connect the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Northern lines and \u201cthe drain\u201d, the nickname for the Waterloo and City line, which is closed during the coronavirus lockdown. Empty train with doors open at Monument underground station. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 and 28 April 2020 to clarify that only immediate families are advised to attend funeral services in England, rather than \u201callowed\u201d to do so as an earlier version said; and to correct the date of the tiling at Piccadilly Circus.",

HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) appears to have been focusing its efforts on providing financial support for those affected by coronavirus (Covid-19), setting up a phone helpline* to support businesses and self-employed people concerned about not being able to pay their tax bills because of Covid-19 and suspending regulations in order to fast-track supplies of PPE to NHS staff. The most recent HMRC communication about the capital gains tax (CGT) changes was a press release on 13 March 2020 (so pre-lockdown) which urged property owners to get ready for the new 30-day deadline for paying CGT on gains from a property sale.</p> <p>This means that from 6 April 2020, if you are a UK resident and sell a property on which CGT is due, you\u2019ll have 30 days in which to fill in a \u201cUK land return\u201d and pay any tax due. Failure to do so will result in a \u00a3100 penalty with a further penalty of the higher of 5% of the tax due and \u00a3300, if you are more than six months late. In addition, from 6 April 2020, lettings relief \u2013 which I think is the disappearing allowance you are referring to \u2013 will be available only to people who let their former homes to tenants they also lived with. Previously, lettings relief was available who let a former home but didn\u2019t live with the tenants. Lettings relief has never been available to buy-to-let investors who never lived in a property let to tenants. What won\u2019t disappear \u2013 for people who let a former home \u2013 is private residence relief. As in past tax years, this makes part of the any gain on the sale of a former home tax free. You work out how much by taking the number of months you actually lived in the property and adding nine then dividing by the number of months you owned the property. Also on the plus side is that, from 6 April 2020, the annual exempt amount for CGT has gone up, meaning that the first \u00a312,300 of your total gains is tax free.</p> <p>Finally, there has not been a \u201cgovernment clampdown on transactions\u201d.

Many of his images on the coronavirus outbreak have drilled down into how the disease, and the social disruption it has provoked, has been experienced by some of the country\u2019s poorest citizens.</p> <p>Among Delay\u2019s striking images are several depicting a roundup of homeless and sometimes drug-addicted South Africans, including a group rounded up and taken to the Caledonian sports stadium in Pretoria to be housed in tents.</p> <p>But if documenting outbreaks of disease \u2013 including Ebola virus \u2013 is familiar to him, more jolting has been the experience of covering a serious epidemic in the place he calls home.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing that helps,\u201d he told the Guardian by phone while waiting for permission to photograph inside a hospital, \u201cis that I have three tours of duty doing Ebola.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82fa7186a562055cf794a7a14ea2467368fe17f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82fa7186a562055cf794a7a14ea2467368fe17f6/0_0_7952_5304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homeless people wait for food parcels in a Johannesburg park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homeless people, some who haven\u2019t eaten in days, practise limited social distancing as they wait for food parcels in a Johannesburg park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Delay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe social distancing, the handwashing and keeping healthy, none of that\u2019s new. The difference is that this is happening in my own town \u2013 to people around me, and to people who I know. So there\u2019s no escaping from it.\u201d</p> <p>In South Africa, like other places, the disease first appears to have arrived in force via those more connected to the international hubs of finance, business and globalisation.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the hotspots has been the financial centre, people who had travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore, places like that, and who had come back and gone to parties.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>And if, as he notes, life has not changed much in well-to-do places like the suburbs of northern Johannesburg, where \u201cpeople live indoors behind high walls\u201d, that is not the case for those living in crowded poorer neighbourhoods or on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cIn the townships, even up to a few days ago, people would see me, a westerner, and shout: \u2018Corona! Corona!\u2019 because they thought it was a disease of rich white people. Now people ask if I know how they can get tested. It\u2019s beginning to sink in.\u201d</p> <p>While South Africa has been quick to introduce tough movement and isolation restrictions to control the spread of the disease, the prism through which that is viewed, in a country with a strong memory of the apartheid era, has been very different.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6eb56b26da62886b3277f72479fbe8f5bc82ed5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eb56b26da62886b3277f72479fbe8f5bc82ed5d/0_0_7462_4977/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A woman pleads with a police officer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman pleads with a police officer to let taxi drivers work in central Johannesburg.

But there are still ghosts floating around.</p> <p>\u201cSome people are being forcibly removed home, to open spaces.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve become used to the images of western cities around quarantine. In the empty streets of industrial and post-industrial societies tightly connected by globalisation, absence has become one of the most powerful metaphors of the coronavirus. It\u2019s a very different story in countries where inequality and poverty are much more acute; where access to a safe and distanced space in which to isolate is limited by poverty, social status and economics, and intimate social connections have a different importance. As part of a series on photographing coronavirus in these places, we have spoken to photographers or asked them to submit their impressions of the images they\u2019re capturing, and the challenges that they face in documenting the pandemic among the world\u2019s impoverished. Jerome Delay, who is based in South Africa for the Associated Press, is a veteran of covering war, social conflicts and outbreaks of disease. Many of his images on the coronavirus outbreak have drilled down into how the disease, and the social disruption it has provoked, has been experienced by some of the country\u2019s poorest citizens. Among Delay\u2019s striking images are several depicting a roundup of homeless and sometimes drug-addicted South Africans, including a group rounded up and taken to the Caledonian sports stadium in Pretoria to be housed in tents. But if documenting outbreaks of disease \u2013 including Ebola virus \u2013 is familiar to him, more jolting has been the experience of covering a serious epidemic in the place he calls home. \u201cOne thing that helps,\u201d he told the Guardian by phone while waiting for permission to photograph inside a hospital, \u201cis that I have three tours of duty doing Ebola. \u201cThe social distancing, the handwashing and keeping healthy, none of that\u2019s new. The difference is that this is happening in my own town \u2013 to people around me, and to people who I know. So there\u2019s no escaping from it.\u201d In South Africa, like other places, the disease first appears to have arrived in force via those more connected to the international hubs of finance, business and globalisation. \u201cOne of the hotspots has been the financial centre, people who had travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore, places like that, and who had come back and gone to parties.\u201d And if, as he notes, life has not changed much in well-to-do places like the suburbs of northern Johannesburg, where \u201cpeople live indoors behind high walls\u201d, that is not the case for those living in crowded poorer neighbourhoods or on the streets. \u201cIn the townships, even up to a few days ago, people would see me, a westerner, and shout: \u2018Corona! Corona!\u2019 because they thought it was a disease of rich white people. Now people ask if I know how they can get tested. It\u2019s beginning to sink in.\u201d While South Africa has been quick to introduce tough movement and isolation restrictions to control the spread of the disease, the prism through which that is viewed, in a country with a strong memory of the apartheid era, has been very different. \u201cIt\u2019s very different to what\u2019s happening in the west. It\u2019s a different beast. This country has a big history of inequality. [In one sense] that\u2019s why people are trying do the right thing. But there are still ghosts floating around. \u201cSome people are being forcibly removed home, to open spaces. Even if it is an informal shack it brings back some bad memories \u2013 that, and the police telling people to get indoors.\u201d He describes photographing homeless people rounded up at the Caledonian stadium earlier in the month, at the beginning of the country\u2019s lockdown. \u201cAll these homeless people, mainly drug addicts on heroin or whatever they can get their hands on, they were rounded up on the street in Pretoria and taken to the stadium, where there was nothing but a few tents to accommodate them. \u201cSome local NGOs tried to help them by giving them methadone so they would stay cool but, apart from that, there was almost nothing. While I was there the municipality gave out four hygiene packs for 700 people. When I was there the main concern, when people spoke to me, [because it is viral] was how can they stay clean.\u201d Among the more striking images from the stadium is Delay\u2019s picture of Henry, who he found sitting in a rubbish bin. \u201cI saw this guy in a trash can. You know, it\u2019s starting to get cold here. When I first noticed him, he was sitting on it. Then his legs went inside. He was protecting himself.\u201d Inevitably, perhaps, the conversation turns to a comparison with his three stints photographing Ebola, and his own personal safety concerns. \u201cWith Ebola you have a lot less chances of catching it. Unless you fall head first into a bucket of vomit next to the bed of someone who is dying, the odds of catching it are slim \u2013 but the chances of dying if you do are very high. With coronavirus the odds of catching it are very high, and the odds of surviving high. Delay catches himself. \u201cBut I\u2019m in a bad age group. I\u2019m 60 in a couple of weeks. I\u2019ve had a heart attack. Basically, I\u2019m in trouble if I catch this thing!

It is by far the largest collection of classical sculpture in Britain outside the British Museum and probably represents the largest single personal 18th-century sculpture collection still relatively intact in the world. Henry Blundell (1724\u20131810), after Mather Brown (1761\u20131831), World Museum Liverpool, 2:B - Dramatist, playwright, composer and artist Willy Russell was painted by artist Peter Edwards in his office in Canning Street, in Liverpool city centre, in 1990. Two of Willy\u2019s best-known plays, which were also made into hugely successful films, are Educating Rita and Shirley Valentine. His long-running musical Blood Brothers continues to entertain after many years. Willy Russell (b1947), Peter Douglas Edwards (b1935), \u00a9 the artist, Museum of Liverpool, 3:B - The signalling station at Bidston lighthouse alerted merchants in Liverpool that their ships were approaching the River Mersey. The semaphore station near to Bidston lighthouse on the Wirral peninsula was built in 1763, and the combination of flags indicated the name of the ship approaching and its cargo, once the vessel had been identified by spotters on Bidston Hill. Bidston, Wirral, Old Lighthouse and Flagpoles, 1825, Robert W Salmon (1775\u20131851), Merseyside Maritime Museum, 4:B - Alma-Tadema specialised in scenes from everyday life in ancient Rome. Frequent visits to Italy enhanced his classical knowledge. He was famous for representing textures like the translucent quality of marble. The artist insisted that this subject should be read from the protagonist\u2019s perspective as she awaits her lover to escort her to the revels. He emphasised that the woman was not really a bacchante, but is simply dressed as one. A Bacchante c1875, Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1836\u20131912), Sudley House, 5:C - The most difficult objects Wedgwood ever made were the ceramic tablets produced for the artist George Stubbs. Stubbs wanted to paint in enamel colours, which could then be fixed by firing in a kiln so that they would never fade. Technically, the large tablets were very hard to make. Stubbs paintings were not popular with artists or critics at the time, although they are now considered great treasures. Haycarting, 1795, George Stubbs (1724\u20131806), Lady Lever Art Gallery, 6:B - William Hesketh Lever (later Lord Leverhulme, 1851\u20131925) set up the firm of Lever Brothers in 1886. Lever made a fortune through selling pre-wrapped soap. Port Sunlight, the village he built for his workers, is named after his most famous brand of soap. He amassed a huge collection of art and built the Lady Lever Art Gallery to house it. Lever believed that \"art can be to everyone an inspiration\". William Hesketh Lever (1851\u20131925), 1st Viscount Leverhulme, Bt, 1920, Augustus Edwin John (1878\u20131961), \u00a9 the artist's estate / Bridgeman Images, Lady Lever Art Gallery, 7:B - Stom painted the original version of this work in Rome between 1630\u20132. While we do not know exactly how it made its way to England, Dobson copied it about 10 years later while working for the exiled King Charles I in Oxford. Stom\u2019s painting is now in the collection of the National Gallery, London. The Executioner with the Head of John the Baptist (after Matthias Stom), c1640\u20131643, William Dobson (1611\u20131646), Walker Art Gallery, 8:B - Eleanor Fortescue-Brickdale (1872-1945) studied art in London. She worked firstly as an illustrator, and from 1911 taught at the Byam Shaw School of Art. During the first world war she designed propaganda posters for the Ministry of Information and was later responsible for a number of stained glass regimental memorials. A 1901 exhibition of her paintings and watercolours saw her described as a \"Pre-Raphaelite revivalist\" for her detailed, naturalistic style.

      "bodyText": "The waters of the Murray River and the Darling River in NSW have joined for the first time in two years, in a milestone for drought-stricken communities in New South Wales. Water flowing down the Darling joined water backed up from the Murray River around 5.30pm on Sunday evening about 90km upstream from Wentworth in NSW. Sheep farmer and wine grape grower Mat Robertson, 50, witnessed the waters join at the edge of his property, Ashvale Station, on Sunday evening and had a small celebration. On Monday morning he said he \u201chad a bit of a headache\u201d. \u201cMost people are just happy to see a healthy river,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThere have been no flows for two years. Just to see fresh water flowing through the system \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t be happy about that?\u201d Robertson watched as isolated pools were flushed by water as it flowed down the Darling River, which is the boundary of his property. \u201cIt pushed the green stuff out and then you have this muddy looking beautiful water. For all the dry land farmers from here to Queensland \u2013 we all have a boundary fence again. \u201cWithout water, everyone\u2019s stock has been just going where it wants because there\u2019s no river to stop them.\u201d The chief executive of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Phillip Glyde, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe two arms of the Murray-Darling were reunited on Sunday evening, bringing with it the first decent flows since August 2018. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching this water light up communities as it makes its way down the Darling, and it\u2019s great to see it finally join the Murray. These flows are bringing relief to everyone and everything in its path.\u201d Josh Sheard is the owner of the Pooncarie Hotel, about 70km upstream from Ashvale Station. He got up at 6.45am on 7 April to watch the river \u2013 dry for 18 months \u2013 fill with water as it passed his pub. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to miss it,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout the water we\u2019ve got no fishers or caravaners. For the last two years we\u2019ve been way down on trade.\u201d The water\u2019s arrival is bitter sweet for Sheard, who said a healthy river would have signalled the start of a revival in trade, \u201cbut Covid-19 has put a bit of a spanner in the works\u201d. The coronavirus pandemic measures have restricted the pub to just take-away alcohol and meals but \u201cthere\u2019s only so much a town of 40 can drink\u201d, Sheard said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to see the water, but without the people that would have been here, it\u2019s just created a very local buzz.\u201d The Murray and Darling rivers\u2019 true meeting place is in the town of Wentworth. Its deputy mayor, Tim Elstone, said on Monday lunchtime the water still had about 70km to run until it met the Murray. \u201cIt\u2019s not reached all the way through yet \u2013 we\u2019ll expect it Thursday or Friday \u2013 but we\u2019re all happy, no worries about that,\u201d he said. The severe drought has hit farmers and communities hard. Hundreds of thousands of native fish have died in multiple kills over the past 18 months. Bushfires in river catchments created further problems, as when rains did come, they flushed sediment and ash into rivers. Ecologists have said the drought, fires and floods have caused a crisis for Australia\u2019s rivers. Last week, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority said while the water was bringing a smile to people\u2019s faces, there was a long way to go until the drought was over. Basin storages were rising, but the persistent rain of recent weeks had not seen storage levels rise as high as some had expected. The authority\u2019s executive director of river management, Andrew Reynolds, said: \u201cThe picture of the last 36 months is that virtually the entire basin has had below-average or record-low rainfall overall, so making up for that will take a lot more rain.\u201d Between 390bn and 420bn litres was expected to flow into the Menindee Lakes, which was great news for locals and farmers, he said. In a statement on Sunday, the NSW water minister, Melinda Pavey, said the Barwon-Darling system had received its best natural flows since the floods of 2016. She said: \u201cWe mustn\u2019t be fooled into thinking this brings these regions out of drought. It\u2019s going to take more rain over the coming months to really take the pressure off these areas.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On Sunday afternoon, more than 1,000 healthcare workers in north-west Tasmania received a text message warning they would be told to self-isolate, and to watch a press conference given by premier Peter Gutwein for more information. The press conference began at 4pm. Gutwein announced the immediate closure of two hospitals in Burnie \u2013 the North West Regional hospital and North West Private \u2013 due to an outbreak of coronavirus among hospital staff. Anyone who had worked at either hospital from 27 March onwards was told to go into mandatory self-isolation from 7pm that night. The order included their families or anyone sharing a house. With just three hours of warning, between 4,000 and 5,000 people were locked down. Many did not have supplies or are living with vulnerable family members. The Tasmanian government has said healthcare workers will be provided with alternative accommodation if they can\u2019t self-isolate at home, and with groceries if they need them but to access that support they need to call the Tasmanian public health hotline. \u201cWe are hearing from members that they can be on the phone for up to three hours to get that support,\u201d said Emily Shepherd, branch secretary of Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Tasmania. \u201cTo be informed via text message was pretty hard to take.\u201d As of midnight on Sunday, the seven councils which make up the north-west region of Tasmania were under stricter coronavirus restrictions than any other part of the country. As well as forcing up to 5,000 people to self-isolate, the Tasmanian government put a ban on all non-essential businesses. Extra police patrols, already in place to ensure Tasmanians heeded warnings about not heading to the coast or visiting their shacks on the Easter long weekend, are now ensuring residents are abiding by the new restrictions. \u201cNever before has a premier had to ask a community to do this,\u201d Gutwein told reporters on Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve got to admit, the responsibility rests heavy on me in having to make these decisions. But I would ask that you work with us. This is the best way that we can get on top of this \u2013 that we can stop the spread of this insidious disease, and importantly, that we can save lives.\u201d The source of the infection The most likely source of the outbreak is the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has been linked to more than 660 Covid-19 cases and at least 13 deaths since it returned to Sydney on 19 March. On 30 March, a woman in her 80s who had been a passenger on the cruise ship passed away in the North West Regional hospital. She was the first person in the state to die after testing positive to Covid-19. A man in his 80s, who had also been on the ship, died in the same hospital the next day. Three days later, on 3 April, two staff at North West Regional hospital tested positive and the Department of Health and Human Services set up an incident management team to control the spread. On 7 April a third person, a man in his 80s who was also a passenger on the Ruby Princess, died at North West Regional hospital. Over the next five days two more people died at the same hospital, and the virus had spread to more than 30 healthcare workers at the hospital as well as at North West Private hospital, and other allied health workers in the coastal city. Sixty staff were stood down and told to self-isolate. As of Monday Tasmanian had 144 cases of coronavirus, all of which, excluding those that came from international travel, could be traced back to the state\u2019s north-west. Tasmania\u2019s director of public health, Dr Mark Veitch, said the Ruby Princess was \u201cone of our strongest leads for looking at the source of the infection\u201d. What is unknown is how the virus spread from infected patients to healthcare workers. \u201cThat\u2019s the $64,000 question,\u201d the Health and Community Services Union Tasmanian secretary, Tim Jacobson, said. Healthcare workers have told Guardian Australia they have had some difficulty accessing appropriate protective equipment, with shortages of N95 masks in the emergency wards. Staff also requested showers be installed so they could wash before going home to their families, but the portable showers did not have heaters \u2013 and Tasmania is cold in April. Staff were also initially working across wards, going from wards that housed people with Covid-19 to wards with no known cases. Veitch said epidemiologists were working to trace the spread from the 60 known cases. \u201cThere\u2019s a lesser possibility of it spreading from the inanimate environment to people, but we\u2019ll be looking particularly at how it could have passed from person to person through the hospital community,\u201d he said. Reports began circulating that the virus may have spread at a party allegedly held by hospital workers, which Shepherd said was an \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and hurtful rumour. \u201cThey feel a sense of failure, like they have been shut down,\u201d Shepherd said. \u201cTo have those unsubstantiated rumours on top of that is very upsetting.\u201d Twenty-three people who were in hospitals in Burnie were transferred to the Mersey Community hospital in Devonport, 46km down the coast, on Monday. Tasmania\u2019s health minister, Sarah Courtney, said Mersey hospital \u201chas the PPE it needs\u201d but had also been advised to ensure \u201cgeographical separation of patients who are Covid positive as well as patients who are not Covid positive\u201d. The defence force was called in to thoroughly clean and disinfect both North West hospitals, with the aim of getting the emergency department running again. In the meantime, Courtney said, they had increased ambulance resources and aeromedical support. \u201cI\u2019d like to reassure all Tasmanians that if you\u2019re on the north-west coast and you\u2019re experiencing a medical emergency, please do not hesitate to call 000,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cWe have plans in place to make sure that you get the highest-quality care.\u201d Aged care providers stopped accepting residents returning from either North West Regional or North West Private hospitals last week. At least one aged care home has told staff they would only provide masks to residents who have symptoms and are in isolation, and recommended staff forgo PPE in other circumstances. Jacobson said those reports were \u201calarming\u201d and there was no reason for aged care homes, which have been given priority access to the national medical stockpile, not to have access to adequate PPE. Challenging community ambivalence Before this weekend, it was sometimes difficult to convince locals to take the threat of coronavirus seriously, said Burnie mayor Steve Kons. \u201cThe attitude certainly changed in the last week or so,\u201d Kons said. \u201cBeing an isolated place you don\u2019t have the expectation that you will be impacted as much as other areas. But what\u2019s happened to the hospital up here and the isolation orders has certainly driven the message home.\u201d More than 20 people were charged with breaching public health orders over the weekend, including two men who took a 500km round trip from Railton to Strahan \u2013two north-west towns \u2013 to purchase a car for sale on the side of the road. \u201cWith the additional stronger restrictions on retail activity now in place in the north-west \u2013 there are fewer reasons to leave your home,\u201d said acting deputy police commissioner Jonathan Higgins. North-west Tasmania is known for its independent streak, an attitude that saw communities of shacks built without permission on public land and saw some locals drive around fences cutting off 4WD tracks. It\u2019s also one of the most vulnerable areas in the population, with an older population, high rates of chronic illness and lower levels of education. Up to two-thirds of the population receive at least one form of welfare payment, said Kons. Many do not have access to a computer or the internet. It\u2019s a community convinced of its isolation from the rest of the world \u2013 because the rest of the world does not often come knocking. Jacobson said there seems to have been an attitude, across a number of regional areas in Australia, that \u201cthis is a city virus\u201d. \u201cMost of the media around it has been on very big outbreaks in New York and London, and there seems to perhaps have been a trend of country people not following the guidelines around social distancing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case in the north-west of Tasmania.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the main stories on Monday 13 April.</p> <h2>Flattened curve \u2018consolidated\u2019 as travel drops over Easter</h2> <p>The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was \u201cnow seeing consolidation of the flattening of the curve\u201d after new cases continued to grow less than 2% a day. He revealed data that Australians were travelling 13% less this year compared to last year\u2019s Easter holiday. That was over Thursday, Good Friday and Saturday \u2013 with Sunday\u2019s data still to come. \u201cWe said before this weekend that Easter could be the most important weekend in our fight against the coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralians have done what we had hoped \u2013 and more.\u201d However, he warned there could still be coming \u201coutbreaks and spikes\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Five thousand people in Tasmania lockdown</h2> <p>In what premier Peter Gutwein described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, Tasmania has placed its northwest region under lockdown to stop the spread of a coronavirus cluster among doctors and medical staff. Of the state\u2019s total 144 cases, 60 are linked to the northwest cluster, and of those 60, 42 are healthcare workers. Of the 11 new cases on Monday, eight were healthcare workers. As a result, two hospitals were closed on Monday, and the Australian defence force brought in. Five thousand people will be immediately quarantined: 1,200 hospital staff and their families. Tasmanian health authorities also said at least 300 people had already had close contacts with confirmed coronavirus cases in the northwest.</p> <h2>Death toll rises from Ruby Princess</h2> <p>Australia\u2019s national death toll rose to 61 after two people in NSW, who were both passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, died. A 74-year-old woman died in John Hunter hospital and a 79-year-old man died in Northern Beaches hospital. NSW Health\u2019s acting director, Dr Christine Selvey, also said 66 crew members on the Ruby Princess have tested positive for Covid-19. Nationally, Australia now has 6,335 people diagnosed with Covid-19, 81 in intensive care and 35 on ventilators.</p> <h2>Queensland extends distance learning</h2> <p>Queensland has extended its school policies for at least the first five weeks of term two, as children prepare to return from school holidays. The same rules from the end of term one will apply \u2013 the schools will be open, but only for essential workers and those who have no other choice. This will be reviewed on 15 May. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria\">Victoria</a> has extended its state of emergency for another month. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/13/are-schools-open-closed-term-2-australia-coronavirus-easter-holidays\">You can read a state by state guide to what\u2019s happening with schools next term here.</a></p> <h2>NSW announces rent relief</h2> <p>The NSW government announced early details of a $440m package to help renters and owners affected by job losses. Renters who have lost at least 25% of their income due to the coronavirus will be protected from immediate eviction if they fall behind in their rent. Instead, landlords and tenants will be required to \u201cnegotiate in good faith\u201d, and can only be evicted if the NSW civil and administrative tribunal is satisfied negotiations have concluded.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Naaman Zhou bringing you the main stories on Monday 13 April. Flattened curve \u2018consolidated\u2019 as travel drops over Easter The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was \u201cnow seeing consolidation of the flattening of the curve\u201d after new cases continued to grow less than 2% a day. He revealed data that Australians were travelling 13% less this year compared to last year\u2019s Easter holiday. That was over Thursday, Good Friday and Saturday \u2013 with Sunday\u2019s data still to come. \u201cWe said before this weekend that Easter could be the most important weekend in our fight against the coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cAustralians have done what we had hoped \u2013 and more.\u201d However, he warned there could still be coming \u201coutbreaks and spikes\u201d. Five thousand people in Tasmania lockdown In what premier Peter Gutwein described as \u201cunprecedented\u201d, Tasmania has placed its northwest region under lockdown to stop the spread of a coronavirus cluster among doctors and medical staff. Of the state\u2019s total 144 cases, 60 are linked to the northwest cluster, and of those 60, 42 are healthcare workers. Of the 11 new cases on Monday, eight were healthcare workers. As a result, two hospitals were closed on Monday, and the Australian defence force brought in. Five thousand people will be immediately quarantined: 1,200 hospital staff and their families. Tasmanian health authorities also said at least 300 people had already had close contacts with confirmed coronavirus cases in the northwest. Death toll rises from Ruby Princess Australia\u2019s national death toll rose to 61 after two people in NSW, who were both passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship, died. A 74-year-old woman died in John Hunter hospital and a 79-year-old man died in Northern Beaches hospital. NSW Health\u2019s acting director, Dr Christine Selvey, also said 66 crew members on the Ruby Princess have tested positive for Covid-19. Nationally, Australia now has 6,335 people diagnosed with Covid-19, 81 in intensive care and 35 on ventilators. Queensland extends distance learning Queensland has extended its school policies for at least the first five weeks of term two, as children prepare to return from school holidays. The same rules from the end of term one will apply \u2013 the schools will be open, but only for essential workers and those who have no other choice. This will be reviewed on 15 May. Meanwhile, Victoria has extended its state of emergency for another month. You can read a state by state guide to what\u2019s happening with schools next term here. NSW announces rent relief The NSW government announced early details of a $440m package to help renters and owners affected by job losses. Renters who have lost at least 25% of their income due to the coronavirus will be protected from immediate eviction if they fall behind in their rent. Instead, landlords and tenants will be required to \u201cnegotiate in good faith\u201d, and can only be evicted if the NSW civil and administrative tribunal is satisfied negotiations have concluded. Owners will then be given a land tax waiver or rebate up to 25% if they give tenants a rental reduction. However, the NSW Labor leader, Jodi McKay, said the plan was \u201cdisappointing\u201d because only 16% of landlords paid land tax. Further details are still to be announced. Immunity study and treatment trial Australian scientists will start a national study to determine whether contracting coronavirus gives a person immunity, and how common that is. Professor Sharon Lewin from the Apprise Centre of Research Excellence said it would \u201clead a national zero prevalence study to understand how many people really are immune to coronavirus\u201d. Thousands of people will be assessed through a blood test in the coming months. Lewin also said researchers were close to finishing a clinical trial of drugs that could treat Covid-19. She said she was \u201cactually quite optimistic we will have results at least \u2013 whether the results are good or not so good \u2013 from many clinical trials in the next few weeks\u201d. Qantas staff consider class action Qantas staff have begun exploring legal action after 59 employees and family members contracted Covid-19. The Flight Attendants\u2019 Association of Australia said it was looking at a potential class action against the airline, accusing it of failing to protect staff from the disease. Qantas is about to restart limited international flights to Los Angeles, London, Auckland and Hong Kong.

Now, as cases climb, we are braced for impact.</p> <p>As the crisis deepens in the world\u2019s largest economies, taking up most of the media bandwidth, Africa hardly makes the headlines. In international news outlets, the idea of crisis in Africa is met with resignation, not outrage. It is almost as if the media perceives crisis as the status quo in Africa, something expected. Unavoidable.</p> <p>Kenya\u2019s cabinet secretary for health, Mutahi Kagwe, has <a href=\"https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2020-04-08-coronavirus-kenyans-told-to-prepare-for-bad-news/\">cautioned</a>: \u201cWe are praying and hoping for the best, but clearly we must also prepare for the worst.

We now know this is possible, and what it will take. So we must ask ourselves \u2013 what more can be done to strengthen prevention and readiness efforts where coronavirus has yet to take hold?

I grew up in Kibera, Africa\u2019s biggest slum, on the outskirts of Kenya\u2019s capital city.

      "bodyText": "When Covid-19 hits Africa, will we be ready? This was a distant thought just one month ago. Now, as cases climb, we are braced for impact. As the crisis deepens in the world\u2019s largest economies, taking up most of the media bandwidth, Africa hardly makes the headlines. In international news outlets, the idea of crisis in Africa is met with resignation, not outrage. It is almost as if the media perceives crisis as the status quo in Africa, something expected. Unavoidable. Kenya\u2019s cabinet secretary for health, Mutahi Kagwe, has cautioned: \u201cWe are praying and hoping for the best, but clearly we must also prepare for the worst. And mentally we must prepare ourselves to face an insurmountable situation.\u201d To date, only a handful of countries have successfully \u201cflattened the curve\u201d, controlling the outbreak so that it doesn\u2019t overwhelm their healthcare system. We now know this is possible, and what it will take. So we must ask ourselves \u2013 what more can be done to strengthen prevention and readiness efforts where coronavirus has yet to take hold? We must do more as a global community to ensure the third wave is not the deadliest and most destructive. If we don\u2019t act now, communities such as mine are where Covid will cause the most destruction and even chaos. I grew up in Kibera, Africa\u2019s biggest slum, on the outskirts of Kenya\u2019s capital city. Like all cities, Nairobi is a fluid urban centre where people are interconnected through jobs, mass transit, daily life, but here approximately 60% of the population are living in an urban slum. Kibera, like all slums, is a transitory place where people come and go between their families\u2019 ancestral village and the promise of economic opportunity in urban centres. Raised in a 10-by-10 shanty room with seven siblings, we had no concept of personal space or time alone. Hygiene was poor, our toilet was shared by more than 50 households. Today, despite all our efforts, thousands of Kibera\u2019s families live in the same circumstances alongside poor sanitation. With up to 250,000 of the world\u2019s poorest people living on 2.5 sq km of land, there is no way to practise \u201ctwo-metre social distancing\u201d. in Kibera and among the world\u2019s one billion slum dwellers, our best bet is to try to prevent an outbreak; we know this is virtually impossible but it\u2019s our only hope and we have to try. In a pandemic such as this, the fate of urban slums will impact the trajectory of the Covid-19 virus on a national scale. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO,) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that Africa must wake up to the coronavirus. Vulnerable communities like mine are heeding this call, working around the clock, scraping together resources to do everything they can to keep the virus out. It is time for international leaders to step in with support that can reinforce community-led efforts. Even modest investments such as cash payments to slum dwellers and improving awareness, testing efforts and food support would go a long way towards containing and slowing the spread.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re going to wind things up for the evening on what\u2019s been a quieter day overall. Here are the main events: Two more people have died of Covid-19 in NSW, with both cases linked to the Ruby Princess. A 74-year-old woman died in John Hunter hospital and a 79-year-old man died while being treated in Northern Beaches hospital. Tasmania has placed most of the north-west of the state on lockdown. 1,200 hospital staff and their families, meaning about 5,000 members of the north-west community, have been placed on a strict quarantine lockdown. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia now has 6,335 people who have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Of those 61 people have died, 238 people are in hospital, 81 are in intensive care, 35 are on ventilators. More than half have recovered The Apprise Centre of Research Excellence, which leads Australia\u2019s research into infectious diseases, will lead a national study that will analyse thousands of Australians from different risk groups to try to understand how many people are immune to Covid-19. Queensland students are being asked to continue to learn from home until 22 May. Schools in the state will be open to children of essential workers and vulnerable students only. The ACT\u2019s chief minister, Andrew Barr, has said the ACT could take part in trials of easing restrictions in conjunction with neighbouring regions in NSW. He stressed this was unlikely to happen this month. Thanks again for following along. We\u2019ll see you back here tomorrow. Interrupting Covid-19 coverage with this cheerier piece of non-coronavirus news. My environment colleague, Graham Readfearn, has written about the Murray and Darling rivers reconnecting for the first time in two years. This does not signal the end of the drought, but you can read about what it means for communities on the river system here. Queensland\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has made a few more comments about those interim school arrangements announced earlier today. From next Monday, most students will continue to learn from home, with schools open only to children of essential workers and children from vulnerable families. \u201cWe are in extraordinary times and this will take place until Friday 22 May, and then we will review it again,\u201d Palaszczuk said in a statement this evening. She said the diagnosis of 35 new Covid-19 cases in the state over the course of the long weekend was \u201can extraordinary effort\u201d but \u201cthis is just the start, there\u2019s a huge road to go, a long way to go and we need to keep this up\u201d. In relation to professional sport, Palaszczuk said there is no health advice suggesting any sporting code could resume. Good evening. Australian researchers say they are \u201ca few weeks\u201d away from concluding clinical trials of drugs that could be used in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. You can read more in this piece by Malcolm Farr. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Lisa Cox to take you through the evening and into Q+A. SA premier Steven Marshall points to the number of cases in the US and the UK when pushing back against talk about easing restrictions. It\u2019s too premature, he says. Australia is doing really well at flattening the curve. The national cabinet will meet this week, and then the following week there will be data that will show where Australia is likely to go, and what the response needs to be. On the Qantas cluster in SA, the state authorities say Qantas has been very helpful in the investigation, and thorough cleaning has been undertaken, so when staff return, or new staff go to the affected area, they can be sure they won\u2019t be infected. No one who was in any of the public areas around the location has tested positive for coronavirus. One woman refused to stop when she crossed the border into South Australia and when pulled up by police, coughed on them, the SA police commissioner Grant Stevens alleges. The woman was arrested and fined. Just catching up on the South Australian press conference \u2013 Sky News is now playing the presser in full, so I can summarise it a bit better. Over the long weekend, police monitored popular areas, holiday areas, beach fronts, etc. There were 640 people checked in relation to quarantine obligations and almost all were complying. About 620 businesses were checked and only two were not compliant. There were 630 people were crossing the border over the long weekend. Around half were essential travellers, and the other half were required to go into isolation for two weeks. Our colleagues in the UK reported overnight that Facebook removed an anti-5G group, which had been spreading misinformation linking the roll-out of 5G telecommunications services to the spread of coronavirus. It was so bad in the UK, people had begun attacking phone poles. I went to check if one of the most prominent ones in Australia was still up and couldn\u2019t find it. Most of the anti-5G groups were no longer coming up in search results. Shortly after I\u2019d discovered they\u2019d renamed themselves to \u201cAustralians for safe technology\u201d in the hope it would stop them being banned. Facebook in Australia has already agreed to remove content linking coronavirus to 5G, and communications minister Paul Fletcher has asked YouTube to look at removing similar content from its platform. While Cook has been talking, South Australia\u2019s health minister, Stephen Wade, is providing an update. Because the states, for some reason, like having press conferences at the same time. Wade confirms two new cases in South Australia overnight \u2013 none from the Qantas cluster, which stands at 34 cases. Seven hundred and fifty Qantas staff are isolating right now, he says. There are 13 people in hospital for treatment, and six in the ICU. One person is in a critical condition. On the cruise ship Artania, the crew members are isolated from others on board, Cook says. Once the 14 days isolation are over, those who haven\u2019t been exposed to the virus won\u2019t get it, he says, so they can then sail away from WA. Those who have been confirmed to have coronavirus have been removed from the ship for treatment. The ship is due to depart WA on Saturday. WA is reporting six new cases overnight, four of which are from a cruise ship. There will also be eight collection centres where people can go get tested for coronavirus with a referral from a GP. Good afternoon. WA\u2019s health minister, Roger Cook, is holding a press conference. He\u2019s asked about what will lead to easing of restrictions. It\u2019s about the health advice, and it\u2019s being reviewed monthly. The low numbers are just for the past week and a half, so they\u2019d like to see it be like that for a bit longer before a review of any restrictions (worth noting, aside from the no movement between regions and hard closed borders, WA is much less restrictive than the eastern states). National cabinet will meet again tomorrow, as scheduled. In the meantime, I will hand you over to Josh Taylor for a few hours on what is left on this Easter Monday. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning. Please \u2013 take care of you Those repatriation flights are starting to fill: That continues: The most immediate priority is the more than 1,000 crew members on board the Ruby Princess currently alongside Port Kembla. These people are confined to their cabins, with no idea on when they will be able to return home. Twelve crew members from this vessel have already had to be airlifted to Sydney hospitals and at least another 44 crew are confirmed to have contracted the virus. The Morrison government must immediately test all remaining crew members and ensure that appropriate medical care is available to any people who return a positive result. Once the scale of the infection on board these vessels in Australian waters is known, arrangements need to be put in place, at the expense of the cruise liner companies, for crew members to return home as quickly and safely as possible. Only the federal government has the capacity to deliver the required national response as it controls our borders, our biosecurity responsibilities, and our management of diplomatic relationships. As a signatory to international maritime conventions, Australia has international obligations to assist people who need our help and the basic human rights of individual crew members must be respected. Labor will be constructive and supportive, but we will speak up if things look like they are going off track. This is a national crisis and, above all, we want the government to get the policy right. And while we are still on cruise ships, Labor has just released this missive to the government (via press release) The Morrison government must urgently take action to assist the crews on board the last remaining cruise ships in Australian waters. If the government fails to act now, it risks creating another Ruby Princess-style disaster. Three foreign flagged vessels remain in Fremantle, Darwin and Port Kembla with dozens of crew infected with Covid-19 needing urgent help, whilst the scale of infection on board is unknown. Every day the Morrison government waits to assist in repatriating these crews, it risks more crew members becoming critically ill, requiring transport to Australian hospitals and placing unnecessary additional stress on state health systems. The government must urgently put in place a plan to support these workers now. This plan must include testing of all remaining cruise ship crew members, providing medical assistance or quarantine to any unwell crew members, and repatriating all crew members who are not required for the return of the ships to their home ports. Failure by the federal government to enact such a plan risk the crews on these vessels overwhelming our state health systems and potentially spreading coronavirus in Australia. Under the conventions of maritime law, Australia must not force these vessels to leave Australian ports while the scale of infection is unknown and sick crew are still on board. The Morrison government must treat these people the same way we would want Australians treated in other countries. Some 600 Australians are still crewing other cruise ships around the world. With the help of other governments, approximately 6,000 Australians have disembarked over 50 cruise ships and made it home. Just yesterday hundreds of Australians who were stranded on board the Greg Mortimer arrived home thanks to the assistance and cooperation by the government of Uruguay. Last Thursday, on Sydney radio 2GB, Peter Dutton said he was almost ready to be back on deck, after almost a month in isolation, after he was diagnosed with Covid-19, so you should see more of him again soon. Take that however you want. And the full comments from Chris Bowen, saying Australian Border Force chief Michael Outram\u2019s call for hard maritime borders (I mean, I thought we had those \u2013 they were meant to be the Coalition\u2019s whole \u201cwe stopped the boats\u201d deal) was an admission Peter Dutton had failed: I thought this was an extraordinary contribution by the head of Border Force. In effect, he has criticised Australia\u2019s border arrangements. In effect, the boss of Border Force says we need tougher borders and the government needs to provide them. It is an extraordinary public intervention and it underlines also everything we have said, that Kristina Keneally has said that we need a full explanation as to what role Home Affairs and Border Force played under Peter Dutton\u2019s management in the disaster of the Ruby Princess, because it is an admission that the rule that our ports have been more lax than the rule that our airports, and here we have a classic example of rolling disaster that the Ruby Princess has been for Australia\u2019s health system. For those who were wondering, here is Brad Hazzard\u2019s full quote on how, when the Ruby Princess sailed, coronavirus was already an issue: The day that the ship came in, there were a lot of discussions publicly about what should or shouldn\u2019t have happened. The chief health officer\u2019s view has been that if the ship stayed alongside [without disembarking passengers] for any length of time, there could have been a lot more people infected and it could have been an even worse outcome. It is a very unfortunate outcome but at the time that that ship sailed, which was 8 March, from memory, there was Covid-19 well and truly. I know that all of us were doing \u2013 you as journalists were talking about it and I, as health minister, was working hard on it and it is unfortunate that people went out cruising at that particular point. It says a lot that this plea is even necessary: There have been a few questions today about this, so here you go: This is still happening. From AAP: A prank could have a costly end for a young man after he coughed at an elderly Port Stephens couple out on a walk on Easter Sunday. A 73-year-old man and a 68-year-old woman were approaching a pedestrian crossing on Victoria Parade in Nelson Bay about 2pm on Sunday when a car pulled up. A young man leaned his head and shoulders out of the window before coughing and making retching noises at the pair, police said on Monday. He and the car\u2019s other occupants started laughing before they drove away. Detectives are hoping to speak with a tanned caucasian man with short, dark, curly hair, aged in his late teens or early twenties, about the incident. It is an offence to cough or sneeze on someone under new regulations tackling the spread of the coronavirus. In March, two men were charged after allegedly coughing on police officers and claiming they had coronavirus in separate incidents. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has opened the door to taking part in trials of easing restrictions in conjunction with neighbouring regions in New South Wales. The ACT has had great success in physical distancing, recording just seven new cases in the last nine days, a total of 103 cases with 72 already recovered. Asked if the ACT could trial easing restrictions, Barr said there was nothing currently on the agenda for national cabinet and the ACT would be guided by AHPPC health advice. He said he would be \u201csurprised\u201d if restrictions were eased in April, but the ACT might \u201cin concert or at least in discussion with NSW\u201d consider easing restrictions, because NSW \u201cmay adopt a different approach in their state, by region\u201d and the ACT could take part as part of a broader Canberra region. Asked about federal calls for a consistent approach on schools, Barr said the ACT\u2019s decision to consolidate teaching in some schools while closing others in term 2 is \u201cscalable\u201d \u2013 meaning if more students want to attend in person, the system will respond. ACT police have so far not issued any fines for breaches of social distancing, although Barr warned that people needed to exercise care on the popular Bridge 2 Bridge walk around Lake Burley Griffin and a \u201cflat pack furniture store near the airport\u201d (IKEA). Australia doesn\u2019t even have an answer on domestic travel as yet (other than don\u2019t do it) but some people are already beginning to ask when trans-Tasman travel will be greenlit once again. AAP says Jacinda Ardern does not have that high on her priority list: As New Zealand mourns a fifth victim of Covid-19, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has warned a return to trans-Tasman travel remains a way off. New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus elimination strategy, which has involved a four-week lockdown, relies on tight border arrangements. Only citizens and established residents have been allowed back into New Zealand since 20 March, and arrivals in the last week have been subject to mandatory quarantine arrangements. A dramatic fall in cases has Ardern pondering an exit strategic to the country\u2019s most severe lockdown restrictions, due to end on 23 April, but not a relaxation of the border controls. \u201cWe have created no end date for the border restrictions,\u201d Ardern said, adding that her goal was the resumption of \u201ceveryday life\u201d in New Zealand. \u201cThe fastest way we can do that is to maintain the border restrictions we have. \u201cWe will have to live with a very different ability to move globally while we continue to give back freedoms.\u201d As a former shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen is asked about withdrawing super funds. He is not into it: This is a bad policy. Superannuation was set up to give Australians a dignified retirement. And the Liberal Party has tried to undermine it from the beginning, and will take any opportunity to undermine universal superannuation. They hated it when Labor introduced it and tried to undermine it then. Now, they included this measure as part of the broader package necessary to support the Australian economy and of course we will never stand in the way of that package being implemented. But we have made it very, very clear, this part of the package, the superannuation access package is one that we oppose. It undermines Australian retirement incomes and puts downward pressure on the Australian stock market at a time at least can afford it. If you take what might appear to be a relatively small amount out of your account now, that could have big impact on your retirement because you are losing years and years of return on that investment for your retirement. And for the government not only to facilitate that, but in many ways almost encouraging by their actions, beggars belief, and I just say to those Australians thinking about accessing their superannuation, please, please get every bit of advice before you do so and think about the long-term implications for your finances. And then, when talking about north-west Tasmania, Chris Bowen goes even harder: This all started again with the Ruby Princess. The north-west Tasmania cluster has been caused by the Ruby Princess, it is again a reminder that the Ruby Princess is not a New South Wales problem, it is a national scandal. Chris Bowen is holding his press conference, and has a few things to say about the Ruby Princess cruise ship: Now, of course, one of the ongoing challenges we have is the ongoing disaster of the management of the Ruby Princess cruise ship. It is very important that this ship, which has caused so much damage already, not be kicked into the long grass. We need the government, the federal government to take control of the situation and take control urgently. Everybody on the Ruby Princess should be tested as a matter of urgency. A plan should be put in place to quarantine and provide healthcare to those who need it and to work with the cruise ship company to repatriate anybody who is not essential to get that cruise ship home to its home port. There could still be considerable pressure put on the Australian health system by the Ruby Princess, and this needs to be fixed. These are human beings onboard that ship and they also provide, the ship also an ongoing risk to Australia\u2019s health system, and it needs to be fixed and fixed now. The first step to be to test every person onboard. AAP has more on Brad Hazzard\u2019s plea to health and aged care workers (and workers in general) not to go to work if they are feeling unwell: Brad Hazzard said a female health care worker at Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House aged care facility in Caddens in western Sydney went to work while she was showing symptoms of an illness for six days. She has since tested positive for coronavirus. A resident of the aged care facility has also been confirmed to have the virus while another resident is awaiting test results, Anglicare Sydney said in a statement on Monday. Newmarch House staff who were in close contact with either the resident or their colleague are self-isolating at home, while all residents are in self-isolation in their own rooms. All staff have been directed to wear personal protective equipment when caring for residents. Meanwhile, not coronavirus related, but this is going to be quite the distraction when it comes out later this month. Chapter 44 looks entertaining: It helps if there is not a lot to go outside for: The ABC is now speaking to a nutritionist who is concerned about comfort eating and what we have been putting into our bodies during isolation, and I would like to know when the national broadcaster started spying on me. The three easter eggs I had for lunch were obviously self care and egg-sential to my continuing on today. Greg Hunt says Australia is not pursuing a \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy: Firstly, I addressed last week the question of a deliberate herd immunity strategy, which is not the government\u2019s strategy and it\u2019s not the medical advice. Essentially, if it were 60% of the population that were required to produce this, that would be 15 million Australians and in the there were a 1% loss of life, that would be an unthinkable strategy and one we reject. At the same time, what we are doing now with containment and suppression and this goal of effective eradication, but without ever being able to promise that any country could completely do that, means that we are giving ourselves the time to plan the exit. Now is the time to maintain what we are doing, but to plan the road out. And then in terms of what you have raised in particular, the rapid response is a critical part of it. What Tasmania has done with a localised ring of isolation is exactly what we talked about early in February, and they have done that, according to the pandemic plan, and that rapid response, that if there were individual cases which broke out into a local spike, then the ability to respond, contain and to isolate will be absolutely critical to Australia\u2019s capacity to, further down the track, progressively lift restrictions on a step-by-step basis. ACT Health have released its official update: There has been one new case of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is now 103. The new confirmed case is a female in her 50s who was a close contact of a previous confirmed case. A total of 72 cases have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. There are currently three Covid-19 patients in Canberra hospitals. The remainder are isolating at home with ACT Health support. The ACT has recorded two deaths. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 6191. On whether or not Michael McCormack is actually working on subsidising domestic flights \u2013 he told the ABC this morning he had been speaking to Qantas and Virgin about that \u201cvery thing\u201d this morning, only to have Simon Birmingham, just a short time later tell the same program he believed domestic flight subsidies were \u201cunlikely\u201d, Greg Hunt takes the middle road: Look, I understand that the deputy prime minister is working directly with the aviation sector, and he will have more to say in coming days on that. ...I know he\u2019s working very directly with them and I will respectfully not pre-empt that. Professor Sharon Lewin, who is heading up the Apprise Centre of Research Excellence, which leads Australia\u2019s research into infectious diseases, is also at this press conference. She says the group is building on research from around Australia and the world, to try and find out exactly how many people in Australia are immune to Covid-19. Apprise will lead a national zero prevalence study to understand how many people really are immune to coronavirus. Many of you would have heard about the concept of herd immunity, or people becoming immune to the virus without ever getting sick. We still have no idea how common that occurs. To do that we need a blood test for coronavirus, which we now have, and led by Kristine McCartney from the University of Sydney we will analyst thousands of Australians from different risk groups to understand how common immunity is. Greg Hunt: I think it is very important to say that now is the time to stay the course. To continue with these self-isolation and social distancing. These are producing real reductions in the rate of growth, real reductions in the number of new cases, and real increases in the number of cleared cases. Greg Hunt says Australia now has 6,335 people diagnosed with Covid-19 Of those 61 people have died 238 people are in hospital 81 are in intensive care 35 are on ventilators More than half have recovered It\u2019s been enough that the health minister says he now knows and \u201cbelieves absolutely\u201d that Australia will get through Covid-19. (Which is a little less heartening, if you think about what that phrase actually means: This has a real consequence in the best sense. We are now seeing consolidation of the flattening of the curve. The latest data shows that we have had consistent growth in new cases of below 2% a day. What that means is that we are now beginning to see a consolidated flattening of the curve. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re out of our challenge. There is still growth and there could, at any time, be outbreaks and spikes. But this is a cause for real hope and real aspiration. We said at the start that we would get through this. We are getting through this. And now I know - and I believe absolutely - we will get through this. I want to say thank you to all Australians for their action. Greg Hunt says physical distancing is working; I said before this weekend that Easter could be the most important weekend in our fight against the coronavirus. Australians have done what we had hoped \u2013 and more. They have stayed at home. They have self-isolated. They have responded with the best sense of Australia imaginable. The hard data is that our transport movements have been below 13% over the Thursday, Friday and Saturday of Easter, with Easter Sunday data still to come. Below 13% of the average movements for this time in an ordinary year. That means that Australians are making a difference. They are saving lives and protecting lives with their own actions. Staying at home. Maintaining the distance. Responding to the requests. I couldn\u2019t be more impressed, more honoured, and more heartened by the work of Australians over the Easter weekend and in the weeks before. Greg Hunt: Ring ahead, make an appointment. It can be any time in the next two months. One of the products, which is very important, is blood plasma. Blood plasma has recently been identified... as a potential part of globally leading treatment in a cooperative consortium between Australia and Japanese interests. This could assist those patients who are most ill with Covid in their treatment. It still to be determined, but plasma plays a very important role going forward. Greg Hunt is speaking, and repeating the calls from the Red Cross over the past month, asking people to, if they can, continue to give blood. Greg Hunt is about to give his daily update. That will include a $3m further investment in training for health workers. Labor has muscled up its response on the government\u2019s university support package, which guarantees universities funding for 2020 but doesn\u2019t provide much extra beyond $100m in regulatory relief which has to be shared with the broader tertiary education sector, including vocational providers. On Sunday the treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, said only that Labor would study the detail, but on Monday the shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, came out swinging. Extra support for universities is always welcome, but the government\u2019s announcement yesterday will sadly not do enough to save jobs and protect critical research during the Covid-19 crisis ... \u201cIf the federal government fails to deliver more help now, universities have said ... tens of thousands of livelihoods [will be] gone \u2013 a catastrophe. We\u2019re talking about academics, tutors, admin staff, library staff, catering staff, grounds staff, cleaners, and many others \u2013 all with families, trying to make ends meet. It is disappointing that the government has refused to make universities eligible for jobkeeper payments on the same basis as other not-for-profit organisations. The treasurer could fix this with the stroke of a pen. The government is also denying universities access to low or no interest loans.\u201d For commercial landlords, those that help pass on rental relief (or have seen a downturn because of the coronavirus crisis) will receive a 25% waiver or refund (depending on whether or not they have already paid their land tax) as well as a three-month deferral. With the NSW tenancies agreement, the treasurer Dom Perrottet says: On the basis of residential, we ask landlords to work through with their tenants over this period of time. \u201cWhere tenants have not been affected by Covid-19, then their obligations to pay rent remain in place and we will work through these issues as they see fit. \u201cThe reality is, as a result of this decision today, no tenant can be evicted over the next six months, simply because of being in a rental arrears. \u201cThe other point I would make, for real estate agents that have marks against tenants names who fall behind in rental arrears, that those marks will not be put against that tenant\u2019s name in circumstances where they have fallen into rental arrears over the next six months.\u201d Why has transmission been so bad on the Ruby Princess, compared to other cruise ships which came in during that period? Brad Hazzard says that is a question for the chief medical officer, Kerry Chant, when she is back; Clearly, there has been a very close proximity in that ship and who was it that caused it is still \u2013 I think the jury is well and truly out on that, in the sense of who brought it onto the ship. The New Zealand government is struggling with that as well, trying to come to grips with it. It is a very challenging issue for the medical people to actually track down the original source. I do know that the chief health officer said if the ship had stayed alongside for much longer, then there could have been a lot more people who were infected. That is an issue for you to direct to the chief health officer when she is back on deck. Brad Hazzard takes back the microphone when questions move to the NRL: As I have said in the past, the NRL made the choice, as has every other sport worldwide, to cease playing the game. Obviously there are work health and safety issues that have to be considered. That is for them to work through. I think it is fair to say that we would all love to see the league back playing. I am looking forward to Manly winning the season [eye-roll emoji], if it starts. But, the problem for NRL is that it does have to make sure that it is keeping its players safe, keeping everybody safe and complying with the public [restrictions]. Dr Christine Selvey says 66 crew members from the Ruby Princess have tested positive for Covid-19. I would like to emphasise that they \u2013 some of those people are already very close to recovery, or just recovering. Their infections have been spread out over a few weeks. They have just been tested recently which is why the numbers have gone up so high. On whether or not there should have been more tests on the ship, Selvey says: I have heard some requests that everybody on the ship should be tested. That is not a good strategy for a couple of reasons. First of all, it won\u2019t change the way that anyone is being managed on the ship or the way the outbreak has been managed on the ship. Secondly, testing everybody doesn\u2019t identify everybody who might be infected. That is because soon after infection, the tests are negative during the period the incubation period from when someone gets the virus to when they will develop symptoms. They will only test positive at the time of symptoms or just before it. NSW Health has reported two more deaths \u2013 a 74-year-old woman who died in John Hunter hospital and a 79-year-old man who died while being treated in Northern Beaches hospital. Both were passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship and were infected on the ship. More money will also be spent on mediation to help tenants and landlords come to an agreement. The NSW treasurer, Dom Perrottet, has a bit more information on the tenancy package announced for that state today: This policy is about protection. Protecting tenants from being evicted due to circumstances outside their control. It protects landlords from tenants in circumstances where payment of rent is not being paid when it should be paid. These measures today go to the heart of that. I would make the point that what is really important here is for landlords and tenants to be sitting down together and negotiating an agreement through this phase. It is pleasing to note that, right across the board, this has already been happening at both a commercial, retail and residential level. The reality is the more that a landlord looks after their tenant, and the more that a tenant works with their landlord, the better off that both will be as we move through this pandemic. Today\u2019s announcement will provide a 25% rebate or waiver for landlords who pass on an equivalent amount of rental relief for their tenants. We will also be deferring land tax for the next three months for those who have yet to pay their land tax bill for this year. Doctor Christine Selvey says NSW health authorities are worried about the potential for community outbreak in these areas: Penrith local government area, Liverpool, Blacktown, Cumberland and the Westmead areas. Also people in the inner west of Sydney, in eastern Sydney in Waverley, Woollahra and Randwick. Also in Ryde in the northern Sydney local government area. We are continuing to have the same messages for people in Manning and Lake Macquarie area in Newcastle. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said too many people, including healthcare and aged care workers, are going to work, while ill. If you\u2019re feeling sick and you\u2019re working in an aged care facility, you are working with some of the most vulnerable people in our state, please don\u2019t go to work! The potential is disastrous consequences if you\u2019re working with some of our most vulnerable people. I will leave it at that. There have now been 144 people diagnosed with Covid-19 in Tasmania, which includes the 11 cases in the last 24 hours. Of those, there have been 44 cases in the south, 25 in the north and 72 in the north-west (three other cases were interstaters who were diagnosed in Tasmania). With the north-west outbreak, Tasmanian health authorities have identified at least 305 people who have been in contact with confirmed cases, a number it expects will \u201cincrease quite dramatically\u201d. Testing will be expanded in Tasmania, as the state attempts to keep a lid on what is happening. You may remember a week or so ago, when we reported about a Covid-19 outbreak among Qantas baggage handlers at the Adelaide airport. That is still going on, with 750 Qantas staff now being asked to self-quarantine. The Transport Workers Union is demanding a full investigation into the handling of the outbreak, including how Qantas handled it. From AAP: The airline cluster stands at 34, including 18 baggage handlers, 13 of their close contacts and three other Qantas staff. South Australia\u2019s chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said those recently included in the cluster indicated a spread to other areas of the airline\u2019s operations. There are concerns for people who worked as airport duty managers, pilot and cabin crew managers and for people in an area used by engineers. The TWU said it was compiling a dossier of evidence on how Qantas allowed the virus to spread at Adelaide Airport which it would submit to SA Health and SafeWork SA in the coming days. We know that the first person managed at the hospital with coronavirus infection was a person from the Ruby Princess cruise, who, sadly, died. As did another person from the Ruby Princess a week or so later. So that\u2019s obviously one of our strongest leads for looking at the source of the infection. The 60 cases, information on them is being collected, and the movements of those people when we worked, when they were admitted to hospital, is being plotted and worked out through our epidemiologists, and they\u2019ll be looking for links between patients and staff to look for the mechanism of how it appears to have spread from person-to-person over the last couple of weeks. We\u2019re not in a position to provide all that detail at the moment. It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t jump to any conclusions too quickly, but this is a virus that particularly spreads from person-to-person. There\u2019s a lesser possibility of it spreading from the inanimate environment to people, but we\u2019ll be looking particularly at how it could have passed from person-to-person through the hospital community. There have been 60 cases, not counting two cruise ship patients, in the north-west of Tasmania. 42 have been health care workers. That\u2019s why the state has shut down two of its hospitals and put 5,000 people under a strict quarantine order. Queensland is also rolling out laptops and Telstra internet sim cards for students who have been doing without: Peter Gutwein: Never before has a premier had to ask a community to do this. I\u2019ve got to admit, the responsibility rests heavy on me in having to make these decisions. But I would ask that you work with us. This is the best way that we can get on top of this \u2013 that we can stop the spread of this insidious disease, and importantly, that we can save lives. So if you\u2019ve been asked to quarantine, please do so. Please ensure your family does it with you, and importantly, follow the rules. Stay home and save lives, and we will all get through this together. 11 people were newly diagnosed with Covid-19 overnight in Tasmania. Eight were health care workers, seven from the North-West Hospital. So a lot just happened in that 10 minutes: Queensland will continue distance learning for at least the first five weeks of term 2, with the situation to be reviewed on 15 May. Queensland schools will be open, and teachers and staff on-site, for parents who have to send their children to school grounds. Tasmania has placed most of the north-west of the state on lockdown. 1,200 hospital staff and their families, meaning about 5,000 members of the north-west community, have been placed on a strict quarantine lockdown. Peter Gutwein: That is unprecedented. It is a significant ask of the north-west coast and the residents of the north-west coast. But I would ask that you work with us. I would ask that you take these necessary steps to ensure that we can control this outbreak, that we can get on top of it and that we can ensure that we not only flatten the curve, but that we work to crush it. This outbreak is unfortunate. We need to understand how it\u2019s occurred, and there will be contact tracing and tracking that will occur to ensure that we can do this. But with the numbers of people that we have quarantined, the most important thing that people can do is to ensure that they stay at home with their families, that they follow the rules and that they ensure that we can get on top of this. We don\u2019t want to see community transmission. I live in hope that that\u2019s not going to occur. But I think reasonably, we would have to expect that at some stage, that is going to bubble up. But we need to deal with this outbreak first. Peter Gutwein is once again pleading with Tasmanians to keep following the physical distancing rules. He says that it is the first time in 100 years that Tasmania has had to close hospitals (two in the north-west were closed after a cluster outbreak, with further restrictions in that area, including helicopter patrols). It is an extreme measure but it\u2019s a measure that we have needed to take. I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019ve made a request to the federal government to provide further resources, and we will see an AUSMAT team, an Australian medical assistance team, key leaders supported by the ADF, coming into the state over the course of this week to help us deliver the medical services that we need on the north-west coast and the minister can say more about those matters in a moment. 1,200 of the hospital staff, will be quarantined, with their families \u2013 bringing the number to about 5,000 \u2013 to try and control the outbreak. Queensland schools will be open for term 2 \u2013 but it will be much like it was when the term ended \u2013 open for essential workers and those who have no other choice, but parents who want to keep their students home, can. The rest will be done as remote or distance learning. That will be reviewed on May 15 (so first five weeks of the term will be remote or online learning, but for parents who need to send their children to school, the schools will be open, and teachers will be there) Annastacia Palaszczuk: But what I want to say is - we want to give you some certainty and some clarity. But just as I can\u2019t predict what\u2019s happening in the next week or two, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be happening by the end of May, and that is why we want to put that position in place in concrete until then, and by May 15, we will once again let people know definitely which way to go. The Victorian premier says another 13 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. There are 26 people in hospital not in ICU, and 14 people who are receiving intensive care. So a total of 40 people that are in Victorian hospitals. Police are out and about and doing their work to enforce the social distancing rules that have been in place for some weeks now. There\u2019s 20,426 checks that have been made since 21 March. And 1,123 of those checks in the last 24 hours. Essentially, much like yesterday and recent days, we\u2019re seeing some stability in our numbers in terms of the number of additional cases. That story is also interesting because of the role Asic now has, following the banking royal commission, but also, the role it has watching everything that is happening in the finance world and its reactions following the economic slowdown. We have already seen Asic send out a warning about real estate agents issuing \u2018financial advice\u2019 after reports tenants who were financially struggling were being encouraged to investigate dipping into their superannuation. In case you missed it, Ben Butler and Ben Smee have this (non-Covid related story: The high-end investment fund Mayfair 101 launched a website comparing its products to bank term deposits last month, after the corporate regulator had enlisted the help of Google to block search traffic to a similar Mayfair-run site. On Monday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission began legal action against Mayfair 101, the firm behind the ambitious redevelopment of Queensland\u2019s Dunk Island, claiming its advertisements are misleading and deceptive. The regulator\u2019s case centres on advertisements and websites run by Mayfair that compare its products to term deposits, including claims it can provide favourable rates of return. The decision to take legal action follows two years of investigations into the Mayfair 101 group. For our Tasmanian readers: Both the Victorian and Queensland premiers will hold their press conferences at 11am. There aren\u2019t a lot of new announcements to come from either of those states when it comes to Covid-19. Victoria looks like having a glint of normal business returning, with Daniel Andrews to also talk about level crossing removals. Police in Victoria have continued to use the coronavirus laws to crack down on motorcycle gangs, because while a pandemic changes a lot of things it does not stop police from being police. Six alleged organised motorcycle gang members who were \u201cgathered in cars in Flinders Street\u201d are among the 158 people fined by police in the past 24 hours, a spokeswoman said. Also fined were eight people allegedly having a party \u201cplaying loud music\u201d (loud music is not specifically against public health orders) in St Kilda East on Sunday night; tourists allegedly holding a party in a short-stay property at Cowes, and \u201cmultiple instances of private gatherings at residential properties\u201d. It is unclear how police became aware of these gatherings \u2013 presumably they were reported by neighbours. In the past 24 hours, police said, they have conducted 1,123 spot checks to ensure people are complying with social isolation and social distancing orders. That makes 20,426 spot checks since the rules came into effect on 21 March. And yesterday premier Daniel Andrews extended the state of emergency \u2013 and therefore the health orders \u2013 until 11 May. Anyone looking for more information on the state of NRL, can find it here: The Liberal senator, Eric Abetz, has given us a blast from the past this morning by reminding us of some legislation that was set to be a big focus for the Coalition in 2020: the religious freedom package. The Morrison government had released a second draft bill in December and consultation closed in January, with many still unhappy about the state of the bill. It has not yet been introduced to parliament and will still have to go through a committee inquiry before it is voted on. Abetz told Sky News it was understandable the controversial legislation is \u201con the back burner for the moment\u201d because the attorney general Christian Porter is also responsible for industrial relations, and is busy helping employers and employees doing it tough. Abetz said: That said, religious freedom is a fundamental freedom enshrined in the UN\u2019s protection of human rights. Let\u2019s hope 2021 is the year religious freedom will be enshrined in our legislation, so the Tasmanian archbishop won\u2019t have to face the trauma of complaints simply for teaching Catholic church\u2019s on view on marriage. (NB: the complaint was about archbishop Porteous saying messing with marriage is \u201cmessing with children\u201d \u2013 a dog whistle about pedophilia, not simply teaching the church view. The complaint was also dropped.) So, obviously Abetz is setting down some markers about how long is too long to delay the legislation. But Queensland, being Queensland, means one of those fines included a bloke who tried to take a helicopter to Moreton Island. Twice. Some people are breaching quarantine. If they\u2019re in quarantine and they don\u2019t abide by that, we\u2019ll take action in relation to that. There\u2019s the fellow with the helicopter who thought it was OK to fly to an area, against the advisory, or the requirements of the directions. Not only once, but twice. On both occasions action has been taken. If they do it again, action will be taken again. That\u2019s not on. There\u2019s been a number of other types of incidences. In our state the size of this, there\u2019s lots of activity going on and lots of people are doing that we need to intercept. Queensland\u2019s fines are worth $1,334. Queensland police are pleased with how the weekend went, from an enforcement point of view. I missed his name, but the police officer giving the Brisbane press conference says: Overall the community has been fantastic. Probably the quietest Easter we have seen for a long time. Nonetheless there\u2019s still people who do the wrong thing. We issued 496 penalty infringement notices. Where people engage with our police, police see they may be not complying with the directions, we have a conversation with them. If they\u2019re trying to do the right thing, they don\u2019t understand, we give them the opportunity to comply. If they do the wrong thing, then we take action. The repatriation flights Marise Payne announced last week are starting to touch down in Australia. The special commercial charter flights, designed to get Australians still stranded overseas home, began in earnest late last week. The latest arrival to land was a Singapore Airlines flight carrying just under 200 Australians from Cambodia. The government is stepping in, using diplomatic channels to organise not just the airlines, but the stopovers as international commercial flights disappear. Passengers pay for the flight themselves. More flights are being arranged for Australians still in Peru and Argentina. The NRL\u2019s 28 May restart date is still looking ambitious, particularly after Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said her government would not lift travel and quarantine restrictions for players. In response, Queensland great, Gorden Tallis, said players would need to make sacrifices to ensure the game went on, even if it meant moving to NSW for the season, to make it happen. As AAP reports: Tallis, who famously sat out the 1996 season in support of Super League and his commitment to the Broncos, said the current day players must also be prepared to make sacrifices for the greater good of the game. \u201cMate, I\u2019m prepared to drive down to come and sit on the couch [to be on Fox League Live],\u201d Tallis said. \u201cThe players, they\u2019ve got to do whatever they\u2019ve got to do to get paid, to make sure the competition goes ahead. Simple as that.\u201d The AFL is eyeing off July as a possible re-start date. The university sector has breathed a pretty big sigh of relief at the news the government will guarantee projected enrolment figures through the Commonwealth Grants Scheme and HELP funding, even if Covid-19 means 2020 enrolments drop. Universities Australia Chair Professor Deborah Terry said it gave the sector confidence. This assurance signals the Government\u2019s confidence in the sector and its crucial role in national recovery and is an important first step.\u201d But universities are still asking to be included as part of the jobkeeper arrangement, warning jobs will be lost, if the wage subsidy is not put in place. Scott Morrison has sent his condolences after the death of one of Australia\u2019s most feted mandarins, Ted Evans. It is with great sadness that we mourn the passing of Ted Evans, one of Australia\u2019s great public servants. Ted began his working life as a linesman with the Postmaster-General\u2019s department in Ipswich, Queensland. For a decade, he balanced the physical rigours of his work with earning a Honours degree in economics from the University of Queensland. Ted joined the Australian treasury in 1968 and devoted the next 43 years of his working life to public service, including eight years as treasury secretary from 1993 until 2001. He then served ten years on the board of Westpac from 2001 until his retirement in 2011, including four years as chairman. Ted has left an indelible mark on Australia. As treasury secretary, Ted advised the Keating and Howard governments on balancing the budget, major tax reforms, including introduction of the GST, and establishment of the key economic frameworks that continue to serve Australia well to this day. He was renowned for his sharp intellect, modesty, integrity and the quiet fearlessness and forcefulness of his advice, earning the respect of prime ministers and treasurers on all sides of politics. Good signs though, tend to lead to people feeling impatient, which means loosening the physical distance restrictions and isolation rules is once again on the agenda. Victoria has extended its state of emergency for another month. Tasmania, attempting to deal with an outbreak in its north-west, is cracking down harder in the cluster area. The chief medical officer, professor Brendan Murphy, told ABC radio that loosening some of the restrictions which are in place is something which the national cabinet will look at \u2013 but not yet: I think we need to look at all of the data, look at our preparedness, and the national cabinet will be making a lot of decisions about what if anything can be relaxed in the coming weeks. After two more Australians who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 died overnight, Australia\u2019s toll stands at 61. There was a sliver of light though, with just 33 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours. There is always the caveat though, as we say every Monday, that less testing was conducted on the weekend, but it is a good sign. Speaking about airlines: For those wondering about what New Zealand is doing: Should anyone be booking a trip for December? Simon Birmingham says no: I wouldn\u2019t put any guarantees that you could undertake that overseas trip in December. That is a long time away and hard to make predictions about what will happen then. We could be in this circumstance for quite some period of time. The success we are having, in terms of slowing the spread of the virus in Australia, does mean we could be at risk, in terms of exposure to people from overseas and countries who have not controlled it so well for quite some period of time. We will have to be mindful of that, follow the public health advice and that is why I say to Australians, firstly, keep doing the right thing to keep yourself and fellow Australians safe, then there may come a time where at least we can relax some of the travel restrictions within Australia and that will give you a chance to be able to get out, if you\u2019re in a position where you can afford to do so, perhaps to support some of the regions who, at the start of the year, were dealing with bushfires or the many other tourism regions who are struggling at present because of the loss of business. Simon Birmingham said at this point of time, everything is a day by day proposition \u2013 including domestic travel: I think we have got to take everything a step at a time at present. We are protecting lives by restricting travel, we are protecting jobs as a government by putting in place measures such as the jobkeeper payment and additional support for businesses, including support for the airlines. Step by step we have been working through this. As we have said all along, our response will continue to be targeted, proportionate and deal with the circumstances as we find them. But Simon Birmingham, on the same program just a few moments later, says he believes subsidising domestic flights would be \u201can unlikely step\u201d. ...But, ultimately, we will keep working carefully through this crisis. At present our focus is on telling people don\u2019t travel and our gratitude to Australians who have heeded that message and not traveled over the Easter break. For a while to come, travel is still off the books for people for the foreseeable future. There will come a time and on this public holiday Monday, perhaps for those Australians who can, it is a good chance to do dreaming by looking up your favourite Australian tourism destination or the one you might love to visit in the future and think about what you can do in the months and years ahead when you get back into a position to do so. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack has blessed ABC screens this morning. (I know) Asked by Michael Rowland whether or not the government is considering subsidising domestic flights \u2013 most routes have been grounded \u2013 McCormack says he spent the weekend \u201ctalking about that very thing, talking to Virgin, to Qantas, trying to make sure that we have those trunk routes between capital cities\u201d but there doesn\u2019t look like being an answer as yet. Very, very sad news for a lot of comedy fans to wake up Greg Hunt will make both those announcements during his daily briefing, which today, will be at 1pm. Things are moving so quickly with Covid-19, it is hard for even health care workers to keep up. Another $1m will be spent to help train frontline health workers on how to better spot and identify severe cases of the coronavirus in patients through CT scans, while another $2m will be spent on training \u201cto understand the prevalence, improve diagnostic tests and develop innovative tools that limit transmission of coronavirus\u201d. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy spoke to Fran Kelly on RN this morning. He says Australia is in the suppression stage, but that it is still too complicated (and early) to speak about exit strategies. On the New Zealand strategy of a complete shutdown \u2013 and how successful it will be in eliminating the virus from its own population, professor Murphy says: The question is that no one knows yet if it\u2019s realistic. While we all keep measuring time in phone battery percentages, there has been some more good news in how Australia is managing to flatten the curve this weekend: With no agreement coming out of national cabinet as yet, states are starting to move individually on rental answers. NSW is the latest, as AAP reports: The NSW government has introduced a $440m rent relief package along with measures to support landlords and tenants during the Covid-19 pandemic. NSW commercial and residential tenants significantly impacted by Covid-19 will have greater protection from eviction as the state government puts $440m towards rent relief in the form of land tax waivers or rebates. The government\u2019s six-month support package will include a moratorium on applications for forced residential evictions due to rental arrears for households financially disadvantaged by the pandemic. Residential landlords and tenants will be required to negotiate rental payments in good faith in circumstances where a household has lost at least 25% of its income because of the coronavirus. Eligible tenants will be protected from eviction until the National Civil and Administrative Tribunal is satisfied negotiations have concluded, with any unpaid rent to accrue as arrears in that time. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic here in Australia. Hope you\u2019re having a relaxing Easter weekend. In case you missed it, here\u2019s what happened yesterday: The federal government talked down extending the jobkeeper payment beyond its current capacity, although treasurer Josh Frydenberg confirmed it would cost an extra $18bn (beyond the current $130bn) to include more casuals and others who have missed out on the payment. There were eleven new confirmed cases of coronavirus around the country bringing the total to 6,314, and three more deaths, taking the toll up to 59. A man in hotel quarantine in Melbourne died, his death is not being treated as suspicious. Tasmania will close down two hospitals in north-west Tasmania and clean them out after a number of infections were identified as being connected with the hospitals. A further shutdown of most retail outlets aside from those absolutely necessary will be in place in the region for the next two weeks. Some 112 passengers from the Antarctic cruise ship the Greg Mortimer touched down in Melbourne and, after medical checks, are headed for quarantine. About 16 New Zealanders went straight onto a smaller plane to return home. Victoria extended its state of emergency for four more weeks, to 11 May. Education minister Dan Tehan said costs for short courses in universities and tertiary settings would be cut, and he guaranteed no funding cuts for universities.

A group of prominent medical practitioners and experts has issued an appeal to capital punishment states to release their stocks of essential sedatives and paralytics that they hoard for executions. The drugs are among the most sought after in hospital intensive care units around the country where shortages of the key medicines are putting lives of Covid-19 patients at risk. A letter, co-signed by seven leading anesthesiologists, pharmacists and medical academics, is being sent out to the corrections departments of all death penalty states. It points out hospitals are facing desperate shortages of sedatives and paralytics used for intubations and mechanical ventilation of the most severely ill coronavirus patients who cannot breathe for themselves. The letter to the directors of state prison departments warns the drug shortages could put even the lives of those departments\u2019 own top officials in peril. \u201cYour stockpile could save the lives of hundreds of people \u2026 Those who might be saved could include a colleague, a loved one, or even you,\u201d it warns.

None of those trades were as large as the ones made by Loeffler and Burr, though. Donald Langevoort, a Georgetown University law professor who specializes in securities regulation, said the impression lawmakers can give from making big trades during a major crisis can send the public a bad message about the lawmakers\u2019 priorities. \u201cThese episodes just create the impression of: here\u2019s somebody who thought the best thing to do with her time and attention is manage the stock portfolio,\u201d Langevoort said. A bill passed in 2012, the Stock Act, bars members of Congress and government employees from using non-public information from buying or selling stocks. Burr was one of the few votes opposing that bill. A trio of House lawmakers are supporting a more strict bill, the Humble Act, which would bar members of Congress from owning individual stocks. That bill has five sponsors.",

      "body": "<p>Fears of coronavirus-induced shortages have sparked a desire to grow our own food, but getting hold of supplies isn\u2019t easy when popping to the garden centre is out of the question. Here\u2019s how to overcome some of the common obstacles to harvesting your first crop.</p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got a clue</strong></h2> <p>Being on hand at home to care for your plants\u2019 needs means you will quickly learn what makes them thrive. But you must set out with the right mindset. Treat everything you grow as an experiment: if you manage a small harvest, that\u2019s a perk rather than the goal.</p> <p>Don\u2019t assume that you can plant seeds of 20 different veg now, and within a month be able to spurn supermarket produce. Although a few crops can be ready in just a few weeks, such as radishes and salad leaves, most take months to reach maturity, and even the most seasoned gardeners experience failures because of pests (slugs: I mean you), late frosts that kill fruit-tree blossom or a bad batch of seed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52ba60414cf61519dccb32094cb8204bd1e032f9/543_1_4396_2639/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chillies need to be sown now.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chillies need to be sown now.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dla4/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s the process of growing that is your reward: you\u2019ll soon become addicted to the thrill of spying your very first flash of green leaf against compost as your seeds sprout. If there are children in your household, get them involved. They are much more likely to eat something they helped to cultivate, and every aspect of growing involves some kind of home-schooling activity, from counting out seeds and writing labels for younger children to learning about photosynthesis and transpiration for older ones.</p> <p>Reach back in your mind to school biology lessons, and you will remember that all plants have the same basic needs: water and nutrients for the roots, and light, air and warmth for the leaves. Beyond that, every vegetable has its own ideal growing conditions. Some \u2013 such as tomatoes, chillies, courgettes and aubergines \u2013 need a long season to mature, so these need to be sown now if you want any chance of a crop. Others, such as lettuce, mature more quickly and can be sown in small amounts throughout the growing season.</p> <p>The internet is awash with advice, a great deal of it misleading \u2013 so ignore those viral videos about sowing herbs in glass jars; it won\u2019t work. However, you can\u2019t go far wrong starting with <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/,\">the Royal Horticultural Society website</a>, while the <a href=\"https://www.gardenorganic.org.uk/growing-advice\">charity Garden Organic </a>has plenty of guides to growing organically. </p> <h2><strong>You haven\u2019t got any seeds</strong></h2> <p>If the panic-buying run on vegetable seeds has left your local shops lacking, and you can\u2019t face yet another online order, have a rummage. If you locate some packets, unopened or opened, at the back of a drawer, it\u2019s worth sowing them, as many seeds remain viable long after the \u201cbest before\u201d date.</p> <p>Even if you draw a blank on that, your kitchen is full of other possibilities: there\u2019s no harm in sowing seeds plucked from the inside of a pepper or strained from the pulp of a tomato, although the results may be less predictable than those from a packet. If you have whole seeds of coriander, dill, fennel or fenugreek, you can sprout them as microgreens (see \u201cNo outdoor space\u201d, below). You can also regrow the bases of celery, onions and lettuce by placing them in a shallow dish of water. And you can raise pea shoots from dried peas. Growers are discouraged from planting sprouted spuds from the veg rack \u2013 certified disease-free seed potatoes specially produced for the grow-your-own market are safer \u2013 but many people report great harvests from discarded potatoes. For more ideas, get hold of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Waste-Kitchen-Gardening-Regrow-Leftover/dp/0760361606\">No-Waste Kitchen Gardening by Katie Elzer-Peters</a>.</p> <p>If you have your own outside space, there may be things already thriving there that you can eat: some plants maligned as weeds are useful edibles, while there are ornamentals that are tasty, too. The young, tender leaves of the lime tree (<em>Tilia</em>) and the ice plant (<em>Hylotelephium spectabile</em>) can both be used in salads.

      "bodyText": "Fears of coronavirus-induced shortages have sparked a desire to grow our own food, but getting hold of supplies isn\u2019t easy when popping to the garden centre is out of the question. Here\u2019s how to overcome some of the common obstacles to harvesting your first crop. You haven\u2019t got a clue Being on hand at home to care for your plants\u2019 needs means you will quickly learn what makes them thrive. But you must set out with the right mindset. Treat everything you grow as an experiment: if you manage a small harvest, that\u2019s a perk rather than the goal. Don\u2019t assume that you can plant seeds of 20 different veg now, and within a month be able to spurn supermarket produce. Although a few crops can be ready in just a few weeks, such as radishes and salad leaves, most take months to reach maturity, and even the most seasoned gardeners experience failures because of pests (slugs: I mean you), late frosts that kill fruit-tree blossom or a bad batch of seed. It\u2019s the process of growing that is your reward: you\u2019ll soon become addicted to the thrill of spying your very first flash of green leaf against compost as your seeds sprout. If there are children in your household, get them involved. They are much more likely to eat something they helped to cultivate, and every aspect of growing involves some kind of home-schooling activity, from counting out seeds and writing labels for younger children to learning about photosynthesis and transpiration for older ones. Reach back in your mind to school biology lessons, and you will remember that all plants have the same basic needs: water and nutrients for the roots, and light, air and warmth for the leaves. Beyond that, every vegetable has its own ideal growing conditions. Some \u2013 such as tomatoes, chillies, courgettes and aubergines \u2013 need a long season to mature, so these need to be sown now if you want any chance of a crop. Others, such as lettuce, mature more quickly and can be sown in small amounts throughout the growing season. The internet is awash with advice, a great deal of it misleading \u2013 so ignore those viral videos about sowing herbs in glass jars; it won\u2019t work. However, you can\u2019t go far wrong starting with the Royal Horticultural Society website, while the charity Garden Organic has plenty of guides to growing organically. You haven\u2019t got any seeds If the panic-buying run on vegetable seeds has left your local shops lacking, and you can\u2019t face yet another online order, have a rummage. If you locate some packets, unopened or opened, at the back of a drawer, it\u2019s worth sowing them, as many seeds remain viable long after the \u201cbest before\u201d date. Even if you draw a blank on that, your kitchen is full of other possibilities: there\u2019s no harm in sowing seeds plucked from the inside of a pepper or strained from the pulp of a tomato, although the results may be less predictable than those from a packet. If you have whole seeds of coriander, dill, fennel or fenugreek, you can sprout them as microgreens (see \u201cNo outdoor space\u201d, below). You can also regrow the bases of celery, onions and lettuce by placing them in a shallow dish of water. And you can raise pea shoots from dried peas. Growers are discouraged from planting sprouted spuds from the veg rack \u2013 certified disease-free seed potatoes specially produced for the grow-your-own market are safer \u2013 but many people report great harvests from discarded potatoes. For more ideas, get hold of the book No-Waste Kitchen Gardening by Katie Elzer-Peters. If you have your own outside space, there may be things already thriving there that you can eat: some plants maligned as weeds are useful edibles, while there are ornamentals that are tasty, too. The young, tender leaves of the lime tree (Tilia) and the ice plant (Hylotelephium spectabile) can both be used in salads. But for safety\u2019s sake, make sure no one has been spraying weedkiller around, stick to your own space and remember many plants are highly toxic, such as giant hogweed and foxglove. Start with plants you can identify without a shadow of doubt, such as dandelions and nettles, and expand your knowledge using the Plants for a Future website or Adele Nozedar\u2019s book The Garden Forager. Stick a bucket over a patch of dandelions and within a few days you will have blanched bitter leaves with many uses in the kitchen, from salads and sauteed greens to soups and pasta dishes. Soaking greens in a large bowl of heavily salted water then rinsing thoroughly removes dirt and unwanted hitchhikers, such as aphids. You haven\u2019t got any soil Like seeds, compost is harder to source right now. Many of the DIY sheds are offering click-and-collect services for compost, however, while some garden centres will deliver to your door; Dalefoot and Fertile Fibre, two high quality peat-free compost brands, offer a mail-order service. If none of these is an option for you, all is not lost. If you have some lawn, cut away the turf using a spade (stack it into black plastic sacks and it will rot down into crumbly soil in about a year) and prepare a veg bed. Those with compost heaps already on the go are at an advantage, as good compost takes a few months to make: scrape off the top layer of uncomposted material, and you may find treasure below \u2013 it\u2019s ready when the worms have moved on to leave black, crumbly compost the consistency of a wrung-out sponge behind. Homemade compost isn\u2019t suitable for seed sowing, but you can add it as a layer of mulch to the top of veg beds and pots or dig it into the soil to add vital nutrients and organic matter. If you have flowerbeds with perennials, plant up bare patches with perennial vegetables such as welsh onions, rhubarb, perennial kale and sorrel, as well as perennial herbs, such as rosemary, chives, sage and thyme. You can also sow nasturtium seeds direct \u2013 the leaves and flowers are edible \u2013 or, beyond the end of May, when all danger of frost is past, plant out tender veg, such as tomatoes and courgettes. Just make sure you provide these hungry plants with extra nutrients through a liquid or granular feed. Tempting though it may be, don\u2019t fill pots with garden soil, as it\u2019s almost always too heavy to drain properly, and may well be full of eggs of slugs and other pests.

Add slow-release fertiliser such as Chase Seaweed Meal and your revived compost is ready to go.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday, the council declared the pilot scheme a success because it had improved cycling safety while not hindering traffic.

      "bodyText": "Walkers have been urged not to take to the hills during the lockdown after 18 paramedics and mountain rescuers were required to help a woman who sustained a leg injury on moorland over the Easter weekend. The woman was treated at the scene at Blackstone Edge near Littleborough in Greater Manchester on Saturday night during an operation that lasted for three hours and 15 minutes. Oldham mountain rescue team (OMRT) said its volunteers had been asked by North West ambulance service to assist after the walker sustained a lower leg injury while \u201cout enjoying the Easter sun\u201d. She was carried by stretcher to the team\u2019s Land Rover and driven to a roadside where she was transferred to an ambulance. \u201cAll of this was done while following OMRT\u2019s Covid-19 protocol and observing social distancing wherever possible, as well as further time back at base disinfecting kit and making sure we\u2019re ready to respond to the next call,\u201d the organisation said in a Facebook post. \u201cCan we please take this opportunity to ask that people stick to government advice and STAY AT HOME.\u201d Mountain Rescue England and Wales (MREW), which represents local rescue teams, has also recently expressed disappointment that walkers had ignored current national guidelines by travelling to national parks and other areas. \u201cAnd, it is assumed, expecting MR volunteers to risk their own lives (and those of their families and colleagues) to come to a walker\u2019s aid if called,\u201d it added. Mike France, MREW\u2019s chairman, added: \u201cThe hills and upland areas will still be there to be enjoyed once the restrictions are lifted. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge drop in the number of callouts in the past couple of weeks and we\u2019re very grateful for that. But it is vitally important that people continue to be responsible and that everyone stays at home over the Easter weekend.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In a small shop-turned-kitchen on the ground floor of a block of flats in Kuala Lumpur, Mohammad Jaber, 60, is preparing a feast: 20 portions of bechamel macaroni with minced chicken and lentil soup, accompanied by basbousa, a traditional semolina sweet cake he and his family often ate back in Syria before they fled to Malaysia in 2012. \u201cWe have so many desserts in Syria, but Malaysians seem to like basbousa the most,\u201d his 21-year-old son, Tarek Jaber, says. Cooking is what Mohammad Jaber does. For almost 30 years before war broke out in Syria, he ran a restaurant in Damascus. Since 2013, he has been catering for restaurants and private events out of this small kitchen in Kuala Lumpur\u2019s Taman Melati neighbourhood. Now though, Mohammad and his assistant Mahmoud Mohammed Salad, a 22-year-old Somalian, are feeding a different community: frontline health workers at the Ampang hospital, a public healthcare facility in the Malaysian capital. They are part of a group of 15 refugees from Syria, Palestine, Yemen, Iraq and Afghanistan who have joined forces to feed those on the frontline of the Covid-19 crisis. Here, cases have risen above 4,000, and 70 deaths have been recorded. Three weeks ago when the Malaysian government imposed a movement control order prohibiting the operation of all but essential services, two advocacy groups, the Syrian Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and Malaysian Beyond Borders Malaysia, put a call out to members of their community to form a refugee kitchen. The response was immediate and overwhelming. \u201cJust on the same day, 10 chefs came forward. We said we had nothing to pay them, but they said they wanted to help,\u201d says Hasan Al-Akraa who founded the Al-Hasan Volunteer Network and launched the refugee kitchen with Malaysian film-maker Mahi Ramakrishnan. \u201cIn the end, Mahi and I raised some funds and gave each of them enough for two days of groceries. They have responsibilities and children to feed.\u201d They have now cooked more than 400 meals for nurses and doctors and other frontline staff since they opened their kitchen on 23 March. The first time he took part, Jaber \u2013 who now cooks wearing gloves and a protective face mask \u2013 made mandi chicken with rice, a popular Arabic staple. \u201cMy father feels it is his duty to provide services for the people of Malaysia who have been affected by this difficult situation,\u201d Tarek says as his father stirs saucepans in the kitchen. The refugee chefs \u2013 12 women and three men \u2013 start cooking in the morning and have the food ready by 11am. A volunteer or hired driver picks it up and takes it to the health workers at the hospital. Al-Akraa helps to coordinate all this from his room at Nottingham University\u2019s Malaysia campus, or even while out running errands.

      "bodyText": "A senior Chinese official has acknowledged accusations of authorities discriminating against black people in the city of Guangzhou as \u201creasonable concerns\u201d. Amid an increased focus on people with coronavirus arriving in mainland China from abroad, health authorities in Guangzhou have been accused of racially targeting Africans, including with forced evictions, repeated testing for Covid-19 without providing the result, and refusing service or business. The south-eastern city is known for its African community but also has a troubled history of discrimination, and the wave of allegations \u2013 accompanied by videos and photographs on social media \u2013 have drawn strong rebuke from the international community. Tony Mathias, an exchange student from Uganda, told Agence France-Presse he was forced from his apartment. \u201cI\u2019ve been sleeping under the bridge for four days with no food to eat ... I cannot buy food anywhere, no shops or restaurants will serve me,\u201d he said. Thiam, an exchange student from Guinea, said: \u201cAll the people I\u2019ve seen tested are Africans. Chinese are walking around freely but if you\u2019re black you can\u2019t go out.\u201d On Saturday a group of African ambassadors in Beijing wrote to the state councillor, Wang Yi, the Chinese government\u2019s top diplomat, \u201cimmediately demand[ing] the cessation of forceful testing, quarantine, and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans\u201d. A foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said on Sunday the department was staying in close communication with Guangdong authorities and would \u201ccontinue responding to the African side\u2019s reasonable concerns and legitimate appeals\u201d. In a lengthy statement, Zhao said the government had \u201czero tolerance for discrimination\u201d and that the Guangdong authorities were \u201cworking promptly to improve their working method\u201d. He did not reference the ambassadors\u2019 letter. In text messages seen by the Guardian, a purported Guangzhou resident said they and seven other Africans in their building were taken to a hotel by police. \u201cThey [the police] said they will do some test after the quarantine,\u201d the message said. \u201cI have explained to them, I have not left China since October of last year and I have already done my Covid-19 test \u2026 which I brought to the police station yesterday for registration. \u201cI did everything correctly. Now I seriously don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m here at this hotel and they are asking me to pay.\u201d A Canadian man said he was \u201cmandated to stay indoors because I am black\u201d. On Sunday the US state department accused the Chinese officials of \u201cxenophobia\u201d towards Africans, and said the abuse and mistreatment showed how \u201chollow\u201d the China-Africa partnership was. The US consul general in Guangzhou has advised African-Americans or those who Chinese officials may suspect of having contact with African nationals to avoid the area \u201cuntil further notice\u201d. It said the \u201cescalating scrutiny of foreign nationals\u201d, including mandatory testing and quarantine, was occurring \u201cregardless of recent travel history or previous quarantine completion\u201d. \u201cWithout advance warning, officials might require such individuals to submit to a Covid-19 test and undergo 14 days of supervised quarantine at their own expense,\u201d the consulate warned. Despite the acknowledgement from the foreign ministry spokesman, responses from Chinese officials over the weekend have been mixed. The Chinese embassy in Zimbabwe dismissed the accusations, saying foreigners and Chinese people were treated equally and it was \u201charmful to sensationalise incidents\u201d. In an article on Saturday on China\u2019s English-language state media outlet, the Global Times, the accusations were labelled \u201ca western trap to stir enmity\u201d. \u201cChinese analysts said that twisted reports were stoking a long-existing controversy over Africans in Guangzhou to a new high, and urged the local governments to be more transparent and to respond to controversies in a timelier manner to avoid the issue being exploited by the west to damage China-Africa relations,\u201d it said. The director of the foreign ministry information department, Hua Chunying, said the China-Africa friendship would \u201cnever be shaken by [a] wedge-driving attempt\u201d, and asked the US state department to explain the documented acts of racism against Asian Americans. Eric Olander, the managing editor of The China Africa Project website and podcast, said China was struggling to respond to the crisis because the usual tactics of dismissing allegations as \u201crumours\u201d do not hold up in the face of video and photographic evidence on social media. \u201cFurthermore, the accusation that western media is behind this also isn\u2019t gaining much traction, because the vast majority of the news coverage about the crisis is taking place in Africa, and not in the US or Europe,\u201d Olander said. \u201cThe problem here is that the Chinese are using a technocratic approach to respond to a hugely emotional issue for Africans who feel betrayed and disrespected by the sight of so many migrants being forced to sleep on the streets and endure maltreatment by landlords and local authorities.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>About half of all Covid-19 deaths appear to be happening in care homes in some European countries, according to early figures gathered by UK-based academics who are warning that the same effort must be put into fighting the virus in care homes as in the NHS.</p> \n<p>Snapshot data from varying official sources shows that in Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium between 42% and 57% of deaths from the virus have been happening in homes, according to the report by academics based at the London School of Economics (LSE).</p> \n<p>Published official data for care homes in England and Wales are believed to significantly underestimate deaths in the sector, with the Office for National Statistics only recording 20 coronavirus-related deaths in all care homes in the week ending 27 March.

      "bodyText": "About half of all Covid-19 deaths appear to be happening in care homes in some European countries, according to early figures gathered by UK-based academics who are warning that the same effort must be put into fighting the virus in care homes as in the NHS. Snapshot data from varying official sources shows that in Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium between 42% and 57% of deaths from the virus have been happening in homes, according to the report by academics based at the London School of Economics (LSE). Published official data for care homes in England and Wales are believed to significantly underestimate deaths in the sector, with the Office for National Statistics only recording 20 coronavirus-related deaths in all care homes in the week ending 27 March. New figures are due out on Tuesday, but are unlikely to be up to date. Last week the industry body Care England told the Guardian the total figure was probably approaching 1,000, with deaths reaching into double figures at numerous homes. Over the weekend details of more deaths emerged, including 13 residents who have died at the 71-capacity Stanley Park care home in County Durham, and there have reportedly been five deaths at Almond Court in Glasgow. On Monday Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said 13.5% of the UK\u2019s care homes had a confirmed case of coronavirus among their residents, up from 9% last week, with 92 more homes detecting cases in the previous 24 hours. But the spread of the virus and its lethality in care homes in five EU countries appears to be higher, according to academics who are calling for better UK data and a more urgent response to the crisis in care homes. In its first review of early international evidence, researchers from the International Long Term Care Policy Network (LTCPN) found the most robust data was available in Ireland where, as of Saturday, 54% of deaths from coronavirus occurred in care homes, according to centralised government figures. In Italy, a government survey covering deaths in 10% of the nations\u2019 care homes suggested 45% of all deaths in that country could be in care homes, while central government data in France released at the weekend showed the same proportion of the 13,832 deaths in that country happened in care. In Belgium, health ministry figures showed 42% of Covid-19 deaths happened in care homes, and in Spain leaked regional government data suggested 57% of the country\u2019s death toll from 8 March to 8 April was from care homes. The figures came from different sources and the academics stressed that differences in testing availability and policies and approaches to recording deaths make international comparisons difficult. But one of the report\u2019s author\u2019s, Adelina Comas-Herrera, of the LSE\u2019s care policy and evaluation centre, said that given the fast-moving situation \u201cwe\u2019re trying to document it as it happens and share it\u201d. \u201cIf we wait for perfect standards of evidence it will be too late to make any difference,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me it shows we will have to give equal resourcing in dealing with Covid between the NHS and social care.

Alaska not shown.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Internet service providers (ISPs) have said networks are performing well despite increases in traffic, but the M-Lab analyses of IP address connection speeds found those claims conceal what is happening at an individual level.</p> <p>ISPs are failing to meet the US government\u2019s standard for download speed, which impacts uses such as video streaming, for most of their customers, according to M-Lab. In 29.4% of counties, most customers are not getting the government-required upload speed.</p> <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says 21 million Americans lack high-speed internet access but <a href=\"https://broadbandnow.com/research/fcc-underestimates-unserved-by-50-percent\">other studies </a>have estimated the number at close to 42 million.</p> <h2>\u2018One report found 42 million Americans were without internet\u2019</h2> <p>Then, there is the wide swath of the country which has no internet at all.</p> <p>The FCC said more than 21.3 million people don\u2019t have any internet access, though many experts think this is an undercount because <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/the-fccs-horrible-broadband-mapping-system-is-finally-getting-an-upgrade/\">the FCC\u2019s reporting system is flawed</a>. Broadband Now, a company which helps people find ISPs, said in a February report the number is close to 42 million. Microsoft researchers have pinned the number without access at 163 million Americans.</p> <p>To address that gap, students without access to internet have been forced to roam their home towns looking for open wifi networks. Facing a remote learning crisis, some school districts are paying for their students\u2019 internet to make remote learning possible.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2020/04/01/coronavirus-internet-speed-broadband-online-learning-school-closures/5091051002/\">A school in Texas</a> set up a stationary wifi hotspot in the parking lot of its football stadium where students can park and connect. <a href=\"https://wamu.org/story/20/03/18/as-classes-move-online-what-happens-to-students-without-internet-or-computers/\">In Prince George\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://wamu.org/story/20/03/18/as-classes-move-online-what-happens-to-students-without-internet-or-computers/\">county</a>, just east of Washington DC, the school district plans to distribute laptops to students who don\u2019t have a computer at home and pay for internet for students who do not have it. Miami-Dade county public schools have distributed more than <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/education/article241772356.html\">82,000 laptops to students</a>.</p> <h2>\u2018Bronx county, the poorest of New York\u2019s boroughs, saw a sharp drop in broadband speeds\u2019</h2> <p>The internet is key to accessing information about the coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/03/25/closing-digital-divide-critical-covid-19-response#\">Human Rights Watch</a> said that closing the digital divide was necessary to preserve human rights during the outbreak.</p> <p>People seeking medical care are being told to avoid hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices in favor of video or phone calls with their doctors. And while a delayed connection might be irritating in an office video conference, in a healthcare setting, it can lead to worse quality care. In May 2017, the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) urged the US government to recognize broadband access as a social determinant to health.</p> <p>\u201cThe solutions we have to shelter in place, but carry on, it just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Meinrath.</p> <p>After looking at the internet connection speeds for individual IP addresses, M-Lab found that more than 50% of customers in 325 US counties stopped getting internet download speeds that met the government definition of broadband between the final two weeks of February and the final two weeks of March. The research was conducted and visualized by a team from M-Lab; the digital equity group, X-Lab; and the non-profit, Institute for Local Self-Reliance.</p> <p>The drop in connectivity is affecting both rural and urban areas with populations already underserved by the medical system or racked with poverty.</p> <p>Bronx county in New York, the poorest of New York City\u2019s five boroughs, has witnessed a sharp drop in broadband speeds. More than 1.41 million people live in the Bronx, a 42.4 sq mile (110 sq km) area, and their median broadband speed dropped 10Mbps \u2013 megabits per second.</p> <p>ISPs must also deliver a connection which has a minimum 3Mbps upload speed to meet the FCC standard for broadband.</p> <p>In a household where students are being asked to teleconference their teachers while their parents dip in and out of work meetings on Zoom and other platforms, the upload speed needed is far beyond the 3Mbps minimum.</p> <p>M-Lab found the number of counties which did not reach the government standard for upload speed increased by 4.4% between February and March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902gTvj2tGdod0F/index_upload.html\" data-alt=\"Title for internet upload speed map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902gTvj2tGdod0F/index_upload.html\">Title for internet upload speed map</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958e316ecc108e746a58b47417d8afc441023bb5/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=29edf98017e52750caf60049f8df373c&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958e316ecc108e746a58b47417d8afc441023bb5/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=1cc11bb6e444b345f7a511e41f10bc2b&amp;label_before=Feb&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e954a536c57297c82b7ab62796a47cfb095d2edc/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=cef17b8a2ccc64e02e995d2cb66f1e17&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e954a536c57297c82b7ab62796a47cfb095d2edc/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=eb93bfaad857c227c595622418563e81&amp;label_after=Mar&amp;analytics_label=Upload speeds&amp;type=fader&amp;\" data-alt=\"Map of internet upload speeds\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958e316ecc108e746a58b47417d8afc441023bb5/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=29edf98017e52750caf60049f8df373c&desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/958e316ecc108e746a58b47417d8afc441023bb5/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=1cc11bb6e444b345f7a511e41f10bc2b&label_before=Feb&mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e954a536c57297c82b7ab62796a47cfb095d2edc/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=cef17b8a2ccc64e02e995d2cb66f1e17&desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e954a536c57297c82b7ab62796a47cfb095d2edc/0_0_2824_1847/master/2824.jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=eb93bfaad857c227c595622418563e81&label_after=Mar&analytics_label=Upload speeds&type=fader&\">Map of internet upload speeds</a> <figcaption>Guardian graphic | Source: MLab. *3Mbps is the federal regulation for internet upload speed.

With most of the country on lockdown and millions relying on the internet for work, healthcare, education and shopping, research by M-Lab, an open source project which monitors global internet performance, showed that internet service slowed across the country after the lockdowns. \u201cThis is going to kill people,\u201d said Sascha Meinrath, co-founder of M-Lab. In late March, most people in 62% of counties across the US did not have the government\u2019s minimum download speed for broadband internet, according to M-Lab. Between February and mid March, when the pandemic was only just beginning to hit the US, there was a 10% increase in how many counties saw download speeds fall below the government standard, representing about one in 10 US counties, M-Lab found. \u201cNow that people\u2019s livelihoods, schools and lives, are literally on the line, we can\u2019t survive,\u201d Meinrath said. \u201cThese communities that are underserved are not going to be able to transition to an online workplace or school environment.\u201d Internet service providers (ISPs) have said networks are performing well despite increases in traffic, but the M-Lab analyses of IP address connection speeds found those claims conceal what is happening at an individual level. ISPs are failing to meet the US government\u2019s standard for download speed, which impacts uses such as video streaming, for most of their customers, according to M-Lab. In 29.4% of counties, most customers are not getting the government-required upload speed. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says 21 million Americans lack high-speed internet access but other studies have estimated the number at close to 42 million. \u2018One report found 42 million Americans were without internet\u2019 Then, there is the wide swath of the country which has no internet at all. The FCC said more than 21.3 million people don\u2019t have any internet access, though many experts think this is an undercount because the FCC\u2019s reporting system is flawed. Broadband Now, a company which helps people find ISPs, said in a February report the number is close to 42 million. Microsoft researchers have pinned the number without access at 163 million Americans. To address that gap, students without access to internet have been forced to roam their home towns looking for open wifi networks. Facing a remote learning crisis, some school districts are paying for their students\u2019 internet to make remote learning possible. A school in Texas set up a stationary wifi hotspot in the parking lot of its football stadium where students can park and connect. In Prince George\u2019s county, just east of Washington DC, the school district plans to distribute laptops to students who don\u2019t have a computer at home and pay for internet for students who do not have it. Miami-Dade county public schools have distributed more than 82,000 laptops to students. \u2018Bronx county, the poorest of New York\u2019s boroughs, saw a sharp drop in broadband speeds\u2019 The internet is key to accessing information about the coronavirus. Human Rights Watch said that closing the digital divide was necessary to preserve human rights during the outbreak. People seeking medical care are being told to avoid hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices in favor of video or phone calls with their doctors. And while a delayed connection might be irritating in an office video conference, in a healthcare setting, it can lead to worse quality care. In May 2017, the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) urged the US government to recognize broadband access as a social determinant to health. \u201cThe solutions we have to shelter in place, but carry on, it just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Meinrath. After looking at the internet connection speeds for individual IP addresses, M-Lab found that more than 50% of customers in 325 US counties stopped getting internet download speeds that met the government definition of broadband between the final two weeks of February and the final two weeks of March. The research was conducted and visualized by a team from M-Lab; the digital equity group, X-Lab; and the non-profit, Institute for Local Self-Reliance. The drop in connectivity is affecting both rural and urban areas with populations already underserved by the medical system or racked with poverty. Bronx county in New York, the poorest of New York City\u2019s five boroughs, has witnessed a sharp drop in broadband speeds. More than 1.41 million people live in the Bronx, a 42.4 sq mile (110 sq km) area, and their median broadband speed dropped 10Mbps \u2013 megabits per second. ISPs must also deliver a connection which has a minimum 3Mbps upload speed to meet the FCC standard for broadband. In a household where students are being asked to teleconference their teachers while their parents dip in and out of work meetings on Zoom and other platforms, the upload speed needed is far beyond the 3Mbps minimum. M-Lab found the number of counties which did not reach the government standard for upload speed increased by 4.4% between February and March. Meinrath, a professor at Penn State University, experienced this firsthand when his internet \u201cfailed miserably\u201d while he was on a teleconference, coincidentally, with network engineers about network capacity. He suspected it was because one of his children was probably teleconferencing with a teacher during his work call. ISPs such as Comcast, Verizon and AT&amp;T have noted an increase in traffic but said networks are performing well. \ufeffThese companies are also among the 650 ISPs which have agreed not to terminate service for customers and businesses who are unable to pay their bills because of the economic cost of the coronavirus outbreak as part of the FCC\u2019s \u201cKeep America Connected Pledge\u201d. In Congress, the Democratic House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, included $2bn for schools and libraries to help keep people connected in a draft version of an economic stimulus bill responding to coronavirus, but it was scrubbed out of the final legislation. Instead $200m is being directed to telehealth initiatives and $125m to distance learning. \u2018If you don\u2019t have internet access you\u2019re cut off from society\u2019 Gigi Sohn, a former senior staff member at the FCC, said this was far from enough money to meet the broadband needs of people during the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cCongress didn\u2019t take it seriously,\u201d said Sohn. People fighting to shrink the digital divide, like Sohn, are concerned the increase in internet use is hitting a nation that already had significant disparities in broadband access. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame it\u2019s taken a pandemic for people to realize if you don\u2019t have internet access you\u2019re cut off from participation in society,\u201d said Sohn, a distinguished fellow at the Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law and Policy. Sohn, Meinrath and others have testified that the digital divide was exacerbating disparities in the US, but it\u2019s the coronavirus outbreak which has brought these concerns to the forefront. \u201cNow we have something where actually we have no choice but to rely on the connectivity we were told was there, but actually it isn\u2019t,\u201d Meinrath said. \u201cNow that\u2019s coming crashing down.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "As of 23 March, the FCO has been advising UK nationals who are travelling abroad to return home immediately if commercial flights are still available. This article was first published 28 February. It was last updated on 13 April at 1pm (GMT). UK nationals who are usually based in the UKare urged to return home if possible: \u201cInternational travel is becoming very limited as air routes close, land borders close and new restrictions are put in place that prevent flights from leaving,\u201d the FCO website says. \u201cWe are working with airlines to keep routes open, and calling for international action to keep routes open to enable British people [to] return home on commercial flights. We are also working around the clock to support those British travellers who are already finding difficulties in coming back to the UK. If you are a permanent resident overseas, you should stay and follow the advice of the local authorities in the country you live in.\u201d UK nationals who are unable to return home should follow the advice of local authorities, including local measures to help minimise exposure. This may include remaining in a hotel room or other accommodation for 14 days; being moved to quarantine facilities; being tested for coronavirus and, if positive, in some cases being admitted to hospital. Travellers with visa enquiries or visas that may soon be expiring should contact local immigration authorities in the country or the UK-based embassy. On 30 March, the government announced it was partnering with airlines to charter flights to help bring stranded UK nationals home. Details will be published on the FCO travel advice pages and here when available. In some cases, the government may be able to offer an emergency loan to pay for flights back to the UK. The Foreign Office (FCO) is advising UK nationals against all but essential international travel. This advice took effect on 17 March, for an initial period of 30 days, but was extended on 4 April for an indefinite period. Border closures and other travel restrictions are increasing globally. Within the UK, the government is calling on people to avoid travelling at all unless essential. \u201cEssential travel does not include visits to second homes, campsites, caravan parks or similar, whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People should remain in their primary residence. Not taking these steps puts additional pressure on communities and services that are already at risk.\u201d The following countries have travel restrictions in place that may affect UK nationals (who do not have residences in other countries). These include quarantine measures, border closures, flight suspensions, health screenings and other measures. Countries permitting entry are likely to ask travellers to present a health certificate stating that they do not have coronavirus. Restrictions are constantly changing and we are updating as quickly as possible: Europe * EU proposes suspension of non-essential travel The EU has proposed that all non-essential travel be suspended to the European Union for 30 days.

      "body": "<p>The response to Covid-19 has in many ways played out to our expectations. We are seeing the responses we\u2019ve grown to expect in a crisis: <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/04/covid-19-surveillance-threat-to-your-rights/\">intensification of surveillance</a>,<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/epa-regulations-air-pollution-coronavirus/\"> rolling back of protections</a> and<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/25/still-too-big-fail-us-is-primed-bail-out-corporations-again/\"> financial support for irresponsible industries</a>, to name a few.

Regressive policies and enforcement procedures are being scaled back in surprising numbers. While sectors under federal control \u2013 immigration policy, higher education, healthcare, election reform \u2013 have had few Covid-related changes, those controlled by city and state governments \u2013 criminal justice, housing, transportation, utilities \u2013 have had many.</p> <p>These changes were put in place to slow viral transmission and stabilize the economy, not to benefit social welfare. But what\u2019s interesting is how much overlap there is between them. Sector by sector, the pandemic has unintentionally sparked changes pushed by reformers for decades. What couldn\u2019t be done in years has now happened in a matter of weeks. Policy changes that before Covid were dismissed as unreasonable are now seen not only as reasonable but as necessary.</p> <p>It shows us how <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-tsa-liquid-purell-paid-leave-rules.html\">absurd so many of our rules</a> were to begin with. But does it also show us how easy they\u2019ve been to change all along?</p> <p>Many of these changes still don\u2019t go far enough, come with caveats and fine print, are subject to absurd means-testing, or are only temporary. For those of us who believe that America needs serious change \u2013 and that this is the time to do it \u2013 what will it take to make many of these temporary changes permanent? These aren\u2019t necessarily the changes we want, but they give us a glimpse of what\u2019s possible.</p> <p>We are collecting more of these examples at <a href=\"https://pandemicpolicy.us/\">pandemicpolicy.us</a>.

All but 10 states have passed <a href=\"https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/covid-19-map/#close\">emergency tenant protections</a>.</p> <p>The same cannot be said for measures to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-rent-suspension-evictions-bill-payments/\">suspend rent</a>, which affects far more people nationwide. <a href=\"https://thenewinquiry.com/rent-strike-2020/\">Organized rent strikes</a> have <a href=\"http://www.kentwired.com/latest_updates/article_14cb43ce-73b8-11ea-b90d-37ed50b3e4b6.html\">popped up</a> around the country, with <a href=\"https://antievictionmappingproject.github.io/covid-19-map/#close\">60 ongoing strikes</a> in California alone.</p> <p>Eviction suspensions help, but they don\u2019t eliminate the rent burden \u2013 tenants will still have to make up payments, even with lost income. That means that evictions are still on the horizon, only delayed.</p> <h2><strong>Free shelter</strong></h2> <p>For people without housing, there\u2019s been a movement to provide shelter, albeit temporary, in vacant or currently empty spaces, such as <a href=\"https://www.theday.com/article/20200331/NWS01/200339914\">nursing homes</a> in Connecticut and <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/san-francisco-plan-to-shelter-homeless-in-luxury-hotels\">hotels</a> in San Francisco. Other shelters have been made in <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/homeless-orleans-coronavirus/289-10615f3f-a4ec-4e0d-96c0-2194d69c31e0\">New Orleans</a>, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/491182-virginia-offering-hotel-rooms-to-homeless-to-curb-spread-of-coronavirus\">Virginia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-19/coronavirus-outbreak-homeless-hospital-shelter\">Los Angeles</a> and throughout the rest of <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/03/18/governor-newsom-takes-emergency-actions-authorizes-150-million-in-funding-to-protect-homeless-californians-from-covid-19/\">California</a>.</p> <p>However, for the unhoused \u2013 who are already among the most vulnerable to infection \u2013 these expanded shelters are only temporary (and have problems of their own), while existing <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-homeless/\">shelters</a> are unsafe and overcrowded. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://thecity.nyc/2020/04/cast-adrift-by-the-virus-the-newly-homeless-seek-a-refuge.html\">landlords</a> have been recorded kicking people out of their homes after testing positive.</p> <h2><strong>Halting water, gas and electricity shutoffs</strong></h2> <p>Access to water is always essential, but especially in managing a pandemic. In cities like Detroit, where <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/views/2020/03/17/detroit-organizers-long-demanding-water-justice\">water access has been a longstanding issue</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/detroit-water-shutoffs-unpaid-bills-coronavirus\">water shutoffs have been suspended</a> and service is being restored. Similar suspensions have occurred throughout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/90-us-cities-and-states-suspend-water-shutoffs-to-tackle-coronavirus-pandemic\">almost 90 other cities and states</a>.</p> <p>Water access remains a problem elsewhere. Two-fifths of Americans currently rely on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/millions-us-at-risk-losing-running-water-amid-layoffs-triggered-coronavirus-pandemic\">water utilities which have not suspended shutoffs.</a> In Flint, the government has cited the pandemic in its decision to delay <a href=\"https://www.michiganradio.org/post/covid-19-outbreak-delays-flint-s-lead-pipe-replacement-program\">the long-overdue replacement of lead pipes</a>.</p> <p>Many electric and gas companies <a href=\"https://cleanenergy.org/blog/live-utilities-that-have-and-have-not-suspended-disconnects-amid-covid-19/\">are suspending shutoffs as well</a>. More than<a href=\"https://cleanenergy.org/blog/live-utilities-that-have-and-have-not-suspended-disconnects-amid-covid-19/\"> 20 states</a> have issued government orders to halt disconnections, and utility companies in places such as <a href=\"https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2020-articles/georgia-power-assures-customers-safe-and-reliable-service-will-continue-during-covid-19-pandemic.html\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvenergy.com/alwayson/cannon-message-covid19\">Nevada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pge.com/en/about/newsroom/newsdetails/index.page?title=20200312_pges_pandemic_response_includes_precautionary_health_and_safety_actions_moratorium_on_customer_shutoffs_for_nonpayment\">California</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2020/03/13/new-jersey-new-york-suspending-utility-shut-offs-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-1266923\">New York and New Jersey</a> have chosen to suspend disconnections.</p> <h2><strong>Protecting internet access</strong></h2> <p>With the magnified importance of digital connectivity, internet service providers have also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-internet-fcc/major-u-s-internet-firms-agree-to-not-cancel-service-over-next-60-days-fcc-says-idUSKBN2102MH\">agreed to suspend service shutoffs</a> and in some cases have <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v74qzb/atandt-suspends-broadband-usage-caps-during-coronavirus-crisis\">removed data caps as well as speed caps</a> used by ISPs to purposely slow down internet speeds. The Federal Communications Commission has also requested that internet service providers <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/2/3/239084db-83bd-4641-bf59-371cb829937a/A99E41ACD1BA92FB37BDE54E14A97BFA.letter-to-isps-on-covid-19-final-v2.-signed.pdf\">find a way to provide free broadband</a> to those who normally don\u2019t have access.</p> <p>In all of these cases, these services are recognized as essential, and so consistent access to them has been prioritized throughout the crisis. But they are no less essential even under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances. So why is access limited then?</p> <h2><strong>Reducing arrests and prosecutions</strong></h2> <p>With the goal of increasing social distancing and slowing the spread of Covid in overpopulated prisons, the pandemic has inadvertently sparked changes that criminal justice reformers have been pushing for years.</p> <p>Police departments in cities such as<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/u-s-police-shift-priorities-as-novel-coronavirus-crisis-grows\"> Fort Worth</a>,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/los-angeles-coronavirus-inmates-early-release\"> Los Angeles</a>,<a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/03/16/colorado-coronavirus-jails-arrests/\"> Denver</a> and<a href=\"https://communityimpact.com/nashville/southwest-nashville/public-safety/2020/03/20/metro-nashville-police-encouraged-to-issue-citations-in-lieu-of-physical-arrests-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\"> Nashville</a> have reduced arrests, whether by opting not to go after low-level misdemeanors, issuing civil summons in lieu of arrests, or choosing to<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/coronavirus-police.html\"> warn people rather than arrest them</a>.</p> <p>To reduce \u201c<a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/virus/virusresponse.html\">jail churn</a>\u201d \u2013 the large numbers of people going in and out of local jails \u2013 many district attorney offices have decided <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/487987-brooklyn-da-says-his-office-wont-prosecute-some-low-level-offenses-amid\">not to prosecute low-level offenses</a> that are <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-ci-cr-mosby-prisoner-release-20200318-u7knneb6o5gqvnqmtpejftavia-story.html\">not considered a threat</a> to public safety. They have also released people from <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-philadelphia-court-stout-criminal-justice-center-cjc-larry-krasner-20200315.html?outputType=amp\">pre-trial detention</a>, where about <a href=\"https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html\">550,000 unconvicted</a> people sat in US jails in 2020, most because they were too poor to post bail.</p> <h2><strong>Releasing people from jails and prisons</strong></h2> <p>Meanwhile, across the US, jails and prisons have <a href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/3/26/21196581/illinois-prisons-coronavirus-halt-admissions\">halted new admissions</a> and have released people not considered a threat to public safety, such as <a href=\"https://www.wsfa.com/2020/04/02/ivey-order-allows-release-some-local-inmates/\">detainees held on minor offenses</a> in Alabama, <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/03/24/l-a-county-releases-1700-inmates-from-jail-early-to-prevent-coronavirus-outbreak-behind-bars/\">1,700 people </a>convicted of non-violent misdemeanors with fewer than 30 days left on their sentence in Los Angeles, <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/coronavirus/ct-coronavirus-woman-babies-released-prison-20200327-t6rfew4m6jbuxmw4lrw5v47dfi-story.html\">incarcerated pregnant mothers</a> in Chicago, and <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/2020/04/coronavirus-got-900-inmates-out-of-cuyahoga-countys-troubled-jail-when-inmate-deaths-didnt-some-say-the-changes-should-stick.html\">900 non-violent inmates</a>, including the sick and elderly, from a Cleveland jail considered so \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/news/erry-2018/11/9b3d3f3cc89150/us-marshals-cuyahoga-county-de.html\">inhumane</a>\u201d that it prompted an FBI investigation last year. \u201cWhere we are right now is where we should have been all along,\u201d said the presiding municipal judge.</p> <p>But if all these people aren\u2019t a threat to public safety, why are they being arrested and detained in the first place?</p> <h2><strong>Streamlining social services bureaucracy</strong></h2> <p>Access to social services in the US is notorious for its byzantine bureaucratic maze of means testing and other barriers. To reduce contact, programs like <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/adjusting-interview-requirements-covid-19-blanket-waiver\">Snap</a> and <a href=\"https://krcgtv.com/news/local/wic-program-removes-in-person-requirement-and-allows-food-substitutes\">WIC</a> no longer require in-person interviews. In Utah, <a href=\"https://www.modernhealthcare.com/medicaid/utah-suspends-medicaid-work-requirement-due-covid-19\">work requirements for Medicaid have been suspended</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Free food and childcare</strong></h2> <p>Elsewhere, services have been expanded, such as <a href=\"https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/03/13/coronavirus-san-francisco-emergency-child-care-centers-libraries-rec-facilities/\">public childcare centers in San Francisco</a> or <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/food/free-grab-and-go-meals-now-available-anyone-need\">providing free meals in New York</a> and <a href=\"https://civileats.com/2020/04/07/with-schools-closed-some-districts-are-feeding-more-people-than-food-banks/\">Los Angeles</a>, outgrowths of initiatives put in place after school closures <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/28/21197965/coronavirus-school-shutdown-free-meals\">deprived many students of meals they relied on</a>. (Interestingly, America\u2019s free meal programs took off with the Black Panther party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2016/2/16/11002842/free-breakfast-schools-black-panthers\">Free Breakfast for Children</a> program, which not only provided meals to students but also organized communities.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/food-banks-surge-demand-coronavirus-covid-19/\">food banks are struggling to keep up with increased demand</a> \u2013 with cities such as Pittsburgh seeing a <a href=\"https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/2020/03/12/coronavirus/\">543% increase</a> \u2013 while shuttered restaurants and decreased demand for prepared food has led to food waste and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/food-waste-coronavirus-pandemic-164557\">produce languishing in fields</a> against the usual backdrop of <a href=\"http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA-Food-and-Farm-stimulus-4-sign-on-letter-final.pdf\">inadequately protected and paid</a> workers.</p> <h2><strong>Direct cash transfers</strong></h2> <p>There have also been a number of cash transfer program proposals to provide financial relief (a <a href=\"https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/media/research/comparing-cash-transfer-legislation/\">breakdown of the proposals is here</a>), many of which would have been unheard of just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Unfortunately these proposals took the form of the recently passed Cares Act, which is both insufficient and means-tested. Its passage, however, further demonstrates that the \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-stimulus-package-spending/\">how will you pay for it</a>\u201d question is more about stopping progressive policies than genuine concern.</p> <h2><strong>People with foreign medical degrees can provide hospital care</strong></h2> <p>As hospitals lack beds and equipment and millions of Americans lose their jobs \u2013 and thus their health insurance \u2013 the inadequacies and cruelty of the American healthcare system (if not already obvious) is now undeniable. However, to keep up with increased need, outdated restrictions have been relaxed or lifted.</p> <p>In New York, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/gmaniatis/status/1242852834707746816\">people with foreign medical degrees are now allowed to provide hospital care</a> \u2013 foreign-trained medical workers with advanced degrees <a href=\"https://commonwealthmagazine.org/health-care/foreign-trained-medical-professionals-waiting-to-help/\">are often relegated to low-wage, precarious work, such as driving for Uber</a>, because their degrees aren\u2019t recognized in the US. <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/states-are-temporarily-letting-doctors-chase-covid-19-across-state-lines-make-it-permanent/\">Restrictions on medical workers working across state lines</a> have been relaxed as well, while <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/490824-fda-loosens-restrictions-on-gay-men-donating-blood-amid-coronavirus\">archaic restrictions on blood donation from gay men have been eased</a> (though not entirely removed).</p> <h2>Price of insulin capped</h2> <p>As the world scrambles for Covid-19 treatments, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to secure exclusive rights on anything that looks promising. Gilead, notorious among other things for its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, applied for and received <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/23/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-treatment-orphan-drug-status/\">orphan drug status</a> for its possible Covid-19 treatment remdesivir, a status normally reserved for drugs that treat rare illnesses (Gilead later<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/25/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-drug/\"> walked back the claim</a>).</p> <p>At the same time, Eli Lilly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/medical-devices-and-prescription-drug-policy/491685-drugmaker-caps-insulin-costs\">capped insulin costs to $35</a> in response to the pandemic. Normally, Eli Lilly\u2019s (and other manufacturers\u2019) insulin is so unaffordable that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing\">people die from rationing it to save money</a>.<br></p> <h2><strong>Remote working and paid sick leave</strong></h2> <p>To maintain productivity throughout the pandemic, many employers previously resistant to remote work arrangements are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kwuchu/status/1240261206566461441\">suddenly open to them</a>. The expansion of remote work has been a long-denied <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/covid-19-is-proving-the-value-of-remote-work\">demand of disabled workers</a>, but only now are employers willing to consider it.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175538/amazon-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-all-employees-relief-fund\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/walmart-apple-olive-garden-are-among-major-employers-updating-sick-leave-policies-coronavirus-cases-spread/\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173287/instacart-coronavirus-sick-pay-workers-in-store-shoppers-covid19\">Instacart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/tech/uber-coronavirus-sick-leave/index.html\">Uber</a> have revised their sick leave policies to include employees who are typically denied such benefits. But in basically all cases, this sick leave is accessible only after testing positive for Covid-19 (a difficult requirement given the scarcity of tests) and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/\">in the absence of other necessities like protective equipment and hazard pay</a>.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-uber-still-call-drivers-contractors/\">Uber persistently resist classification of their drivers as proper employees</a>, and this very limited expansion of benefits is not really a substantial change away from that policy. At the very least, however, the recently passed <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">ares Act expands unemployment benefits to independent contractors</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Many academic books accessible for free</strong></h2> <p>Education has been fundamentally reshaped as schools move online, with educators scrambling to adjust teaching styles and materials to remote learning. Many university presses have <a href=\"https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database\">made their titles accessible for free</a> in response. But most notable is the admittedly tiny \u2013 but unprecedented \u2013 shift in the system of indebtedness that American higher education system is built on.</p> <h2><strong>Debt collection suspended</strong></h2> <p>New York has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1239970795348094983\">suspended state debt collection</a>, including student and medical debt. At the federal level, initially a far more modest <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/487496-trump-waives-federal-student-loan-interest-in-response-to-coronavirus\">suspension of interest accrual</a> for federal loans was announced, but was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/student-loan-debt-suspension-economy/index.html\">updated to suspend payments and collections</a> as well.</p> <p>This still pales in comparison to measures taken by other countries, such as Venezuela, which announced <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/venezuela-prohibits-company-layoffs-and-suspends-credit-collections-over-coronavirus-2020\">country-wide six-month rent and credit payment freezes</a>. In the US, <a href=\"https://time.com/5814424/coronavirus-stimulus-student-loans/\">private lenders</a> are not required to take any such measures.</p> <p>Yet these moves seem to at least tacitly acknowledge the social harms of widespread debt burdens. This has not, however, stopped <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/debt-collection-industry-deems-itself-essential-to-financial-health-of-consumers-fights-covid-shutdown/\">the debt collection industry from trying to claim itself \u201cessential\u201d</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Free public transit</strong></h2> <p>City living is hugely influenced by access to reliable and affordable transit.

      "bodyText": "The response to Covid-19 has in many ways played out to our expectations. We are seeing the responses we\u2019ve grown to expect in a crisis: intensification of surveillance, rolling back of protections and financial support for irresponsible industries, to name a few. And this is amid inadequate protection of workers, monopolizing of mask equipment, anti-labor retaliation, industry opportunism, staggering unemployment and more. At the same time, other responses have revealed something most of us already knew (or at least suspected) \u2013 the arbitrariness of American misery. Regressive policies and enforcement procedures are being scaled back in surprising numbers. While sectors under federal control \u2013 immigration policy, higher education, healthcare, election reform \u2013 have had few Covid-related changes, those controlled by city and state governments \u2013 criminal justice, housing, transportation, utilities \u2013 have had many. These changes were put in place to slow viral transmission and stabilize the economy, not to benefit social welfare. But what\u2019s interesting is how much overlap there is between them. Sector by sector, the pandemic has unintentionally sparked changes pushed by reformers for decades. What couldn\u2019t be done in years has now happened in a matter of weeks. Policy changes that before Covid were dismissed as unreasonable are now seen not only as reasonable but as necessary. It shows us how absurd so many of our rules were to begin with. But does it also show us how easy they\u2019ve been to change all along? Many of these changes still don\u2019t go far enough, come with caveats and fine print, are subject to absurd means-testing, or are only temporary. For those of us who believe that America needs serious change \u2013 and that this is the time to do it \u2013 what will it take to make many of these temporary changes permanent? These aren\u2019t necessarily the changes we want, but they give us a glimpse of what\u2019s possible. We are collecting more of these examples at pandemicpolicy.us. You can fill out the Google forms sheet here. Freezing mortgage payments and evictions To prevent people from leaving their homes during the outbreak, many cities and states \u2013 such as Florida, New York, San Francisco, New Orleans, Oakland, Seattle and Philadelphia \u2013 are temporarily suspending mortgage payments and residential evictions. All but 10 states have passed emergency tenant protections. The same cannot be said for measures to suspend rent, which affects far more people nationwide. Organized rent strikes have popped up around the country, with 60 ongoing strikes in California alone. Eviction suspensions help, but they don\u2019t eliminate the rent burden \u2013 tenants will still have to make up payments, even with lost income. That means that evictions are still on the horizon, only delayed. Free shelter For people without housing, there\u2019s been a movement to provide shelter, albeit temporary, in vacant or currently empty spaces, such as nursing homes in Connecticut and hotels in San Francisco. Other shelters have been made in New Orleans, Virginia, Los Angeles and throughout the rest of California. However, for the unhoused \u2013 who are already among the most vulnerable to infection \u2013 these expanded shelters are only temporary (and have problems of their own), while existing shelters are unsafe and overcrowded. Meanwhile, landlords have been recorded kicking people out of their homes after testing positive. Halting water, gas and electricity shutoffs Access to water is always essential, but especially in managing a pandemic. In cities like Detroit, where water access has been a longstanding issue, water shutoffs have been suspended and service is being restored. Similar suspensions have occurred throughout almost 90 other cities and states. Water access remains a problem elsewhere. Two-fifths of Americans currently rely on water utilities which have not suspended shutoffs. In Flint, the government has cited the pandemic in its decision to delay the long-overdue replacement of lead pipes. Many electric and gas companies are suspending shutoffs as well. More than 20 states have issued government orders to halt disconnections, and utility companies in places such as Georgia, Nevada, California, New York and New Jersey have chosen to suspend disconnections. Protecting internet access With the magnified importance of digital connectivity, internet service providers have also agreed to suspend service shutoffs and in some cases have removed data caps as well as speed caps used by ISPs to purposely slow down internet speeds. The Federal Communications Commission has also requested that internet service providers find a way to provide free broadband to those who normally don\u2019t have access. In all of these cases, these services are recognized as essential, and so consistent access to them has been prioritized throughout the crisis. But they are no less essential even under \u201cnormal\u201d circumstances. So why is access limited then? Reducing arrests and prosecutions With the goal of increasing social distancing and slowing the spread of Covid in overpopulated prisons, the pandemic has inadvertently sparked changes that criminal justice reformers have been pushing for years. Police departments in cities such as Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Denver and Nashville have reduced arrests, whether by opting not to go after low-level misdemeanors, issuing civil summons in lieu of arrests, or choosing to warn people rather than arrest them. To reduce \u201cjail churn\u201d \u2013 the large numbers of people going in and out of local jails \u2013 many district attorney offices have decided not to prosecute low-level offenses that are not considered a threat to public safety. They have also released people from pre-trial detention, where about 550,000 unconvicted people sat in US jails in 2020, most because they were too poor to post bail. Releasing people from jails and prisons Meanwhile, across the US, jails and prisons have halted new admissions and have released people not considered a threat to public safety, such as detainees held on minor offenses in Alabama, 1,700 people convicted of non-violent misdemeanors with fewer than 30 days left on their sentence in Los Angeles, incarcerated pregnant mothers in Chicago, and 900 non-violent inmates, including the sick and elderly, from a Cleveland jail considered so \u201cinhumane\u201d that it prompted an FBI investigation last year. \u201cWhere we are right now is where we should have been all along,\u201d said the presiding municipal judge. But if all these people aren\u2019t a threat to public safety, why are they being arrested and detained in the first place? Streamlining social services bureaucracy Access to social services in the US is notorious for its byzantine bureaucratic maze of means testing and other barriers. To reduce contact, programs like Snap and WIC no longer require in-person interviews. In Utah, work requirements for Medicaid have been suspended. Free food and childcare Elsewhere, services have been expanded, such as public childcare centers in San Francisco or providing free meals in New York and Los Angeles, outgrowths of initiatives put in place after school closures deprived many students of meals they relied on. (Interestingly, America\u2019s free meal programs took off with the Black Panther party\u2019s Free Breakfast for Children program, which not only provided meals to students but also organized communities.) Meanwhile, food banks are struggling to keep up with increased demand \u2013 with cities such as Pittsburgh seeing a 543% increase \u2013 while shuttered restaurants and decreased demand for prepared food has led to food waste and produce languishing in fields against the usual backdrop of inadequately protected and paid workers. Direct cash transfers There have also been a number of cash transfer program proposals to provide financial relief (a breakdown of the proposals is here), many of which would have been unheard of just a few weeks ago. Unfortunately these proposals took the form of the recently passed Cares Act, which is both insufficient and means-tested. Its passage, however, further demonstrates that the \u201chow will you pay for it\u201d question is more about stopping progressive policies than genuine concern. People with foreign medical degrees can provide hospital care As hospitals lack beds and equipment and millions of Americans lose their jobs \u2013 and thus their health insurance \u2013 the inadequacies and cruelty of the American healthcare system (if not already obvious) is now undeniable. However, to keep up with increased need, outdated restrictions have been relaxed or lifted. In New York, people with foreign medical degrees are now allowed to provide hospital care \u2013 foreign-trained medical workers with advanced degrees are often relegated to low-wage, precarious work, such as driving for Uber, because their degrees aren\u2019t recognized in the US. Restrictions on medical workers working across state lines have been relaxed as well, while archaic restrictions on blood donation from gay men have been eased (though not entirely removed). Price of insulin capped As the world scrambles for Covid-19 treatments, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to secure exclusive rights on anything that looks promising. Gilead, notorious among other things for its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, applied for and received orphan drug status for its possible Covid-19 treatment remdesivir, a status normally reserved for drugs that treat rare illnesses (Gilead later walked back the claim). At the same time, Eli Lilly capped insulin costs to $35 in response to the pandemic. Normally, Eli Lilly\u2019s (and other manufacturers\u2019) insulin is so unaffordable that people die from rationing it to save money. Remote working and paid sick leave To maintain productivity throughout the pandemic, many employers previously resistant to remote work arrangements are suddenly open to them. The expansion of remote work has been a long-denied demand of disabled workers, but only now are employers willing to consider it. Companies such as Amazon, Walmart, Instacart and Uber have revised their sick leave policies to include employees who are typically denied such benefits. But in basically all cases, this sick leave is accessible only after testing positive for Covid-19 (a difficult requirement given the scarcity of tests) and in the absence of other necessities like protective equipment and hazard pay. Companies such as Uber persistently resist classification of their drivers as proper employees, and this very limited expansion of benefits is not really a substantial change away from that policy. At the very least, however, the recently passed Cares Act expands unemployment benefits to independent contractors. Many academic books accessible for free Education has been fundamentally reshaped as schools move online, with educators scrambling to adjust teaching styles and materials to remote learning. Many university presses have made their titles accessible for free in response. But most notable is the admittedly tiny \u2013 but unprecedented \u2013 shift in the system of indebtedness that American higher education system is built on. Debt collection suspended New York has suspended state debt collection, including student and medical debt. At the federal level, initially a far more modest suspension of interest accrual for federal loans was announced, but was updated to suspend payments and collections as well. This still pales in comparison to measures taken by other countries, such as Venezuela, which announced country-wide six-month rent and credit payment freezes. In the US, private lenders are not required to take any such measures. Yet these moves seem to at least tacitly acknowledge the social harms of widespread debt burdens. This has not, however, stopped the debt collection industry from trying to claim itself \u201cessential\u201d. Free public transit City living is hugely influenced by access to reliable and affordable transit. Increased access to mobility has long been an important issue, but only now are we seeing changes. With pushback against fare hikes and ailing infrastructure already an issue before Covid, cities such as Houston, Cincinnati, New York and Santa Monica have suspended bus fares, and some bike-share services are offering free rides, such as in Detroit, Memphis and Kansas City. However, this is against a backdrop of insufficient protective measures for transit workers, some of whom have already died from Covid-19 infection. More bike lanes and pedestrianized streets In New York City, where cycling increased by 52% after physical distancing measures, two new temporary protected bike lanes have been put in place. Though no other US cities have followed suit, outside the US, Bogot\u00e1 opened 47 miles of temporary bike lanes, and Mexico City just announced a plan for a fourfold increase in bike infrastructure. Many cities have opened streets to pedestrians by implementing car bans, such as Philadelphia, St Paul, Cleveland and Denver, to provide space for cyclists and pedestrians to maintain social distancing, part of an ongoing movement to pedestrianize roads permanently. Fewer deportations There\u2019s been little change on the immigration front, but US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) recently announced it would \u201ctemporarily adjust its enforcement posture\u201d to arrest only \u201cpublic safety risks and individuals subject to mandatory detention\u201d \u2013 in other words, they would stop rounding up and deporting people just for being undocumented. Advocates and federal judges in Los Angeles and Pennsylvania ordered the federal government to release detainees, but there\u2019s been no answer from the Trump administration.",

      "bodyText": "Amid a humanitarian crisis compounded by mass layoffs and collapsing economic activity, the last course our legislators should be following is the one they appear to be on right now: bailing out shareholders and executives who, while enriching themselves, spent the past decade pushing business corporations to the edge of insolvency. The very survival of working-class households is now at stake. Yet the $500bn dollars of public money that Congress\u2019s relief bill provides will be used for a corporate bailout, with the only oversight in the hands of an independent council similar to the one used in the 2008 financial crisis. While that body was able to report misuses of taxpayer money, it could do nothing to stop them. Moving forward, we need a guarantee from Congress that public money will not help billionaire shareholders or corporate executives protect, and even augment, their personal wealth. As currently structured, there is nothing to keep this bailout from, like its predecessor, putting cash directly into the hands of those at the top rather than into the hands of workers. Without strong regulation and accountability, asking corporations to preserve jobs with these funds will be nothing more than a simple suggestion, leaving millions of everyday Americans in financial peril. Productive work and consumer spending are the dual engines that keep our economy running, which is why this pandemic poses such an acute threat. Therefore, the purpose of further government support must be to keep as many employees working as long and as productively as possible. Working people were not prepared for this disaster. There are still tens of millions of American households that haven\u2019t recovered from the Great Recession; nearly 50% of Americans were already living paycheck to paycheck before millions lost their jobs in the last few weeks, and 40% did not have enough savings accrued to cover a $400 emergency. It\u2019s imperative that they be given the lifelines that they desperately need to survive. Keeping Americans indoors to reduce their risk of spreading Covid-19 has almost completely shut down our massive service economy. It is fundamental that we ensure every company\u2019s employees are able to be both productive and safe, and we can do that only by using every cent of corporate cash to put paychecks into their hands. America\u2019s working class, not corporate executives, are the ones on the frontlines of America\u2019s factories and service industries; they produce what these companies sell and make up the majority of our consumer economy.

After Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect in 2018, corporations took the windfall and collectively spent over $1tn on buybacks, for the sole purpose of adding to the incomes of shareholders and executives. Over the past five years alone, airline executives \u2013 who were first in line clamoring for a bailout \u2013 spent $52bn in corporate cash on buybacks, at the expense of employee wage increases, capital expenditures and investments in innovation. Now that these businesses are being handed government funds, we need to make sure that top executives and wealthy shareholders don\u2019t do this again: channel money into their own bank accounts while leaving employees wondering how they are going to pay their bills.

      "body": "<p>The men who beat Mehboob Ali did so without mercy. Dragging him to a field in the village of Harewali, on the fringes of north-west Delhi, the group hit him with sticks and shoes until he bled from his nose and ears. Ali was a Muslim, recently returned home from a religious gathering, and the Hindu mob was quite certain he was part of a so-called Islamic conspiracy to spread coronavirus to Hindus nationwide. His attackers believed the devout 22-year-old must be punished before he carried out \u201ccorona jihad\u201d.</p> <p>The allegations were entirely false, but according to video footage and his family, the men who beat Ali on 5 April were in little doubt of his guilt, demanding: \u201cTell us who else is behind this conspiracy.\u201d Ali was then taken to a nearby Hindu temple and told to renounce Islam and convert to Hinduism before they would allow him to go to hospital. </p> <p>Five days after the attack Ali\u2019s family was still in fear of also being accused of spreading the virus. \u201cIf we file a police case, the Hindus will not let us live in the village,\u201d said one family member, who asked not to be named. Police confirmed that due to his attendance at a Muslim convention in Bhopal a few weeks back, Ali was being held in the isolation ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi as a \u201ccorona suspect\u201d, though he had no symptoms.</p> <p>The attack on Ali is symptomatic of the growing demonisation of India\u2019s Muslim community, who are being accused, without any basis, of conducting a malevolent campaign to spread Covid-19 to the Hindu majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">Inside Delhi: beaten, lynched and burnt alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Already a minority under attack \u2013 it is just weeks since Hindu mobs attacked Muslims <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">in religious riots in Delhi</a> \u2013 Muslims have now seen their businesses across India boycotted, volunteers distributing rations called \u201ccoronavirus terrorists\u201d, and others accused of spitting in food and infecting water supplies with the virus. Posters have appeared barring Muslims from entering certain neighbourhoods in states as far apart as Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh.</p> <p>The troubles began when the gathering of an Islamic missionary organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, held in mid-March in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin, was singled out by police and government as being responsible for the spread of coronavirus across India. The convention, which had been given the go-ahead by the Delhi authorities, was attended by about 8,000 people, including hundreds of foreigners. It soon became apparent that many at the convention had unknowingly picked up Covid-19 and brought it back to towns and villages across India.</p> <p>Across the country, police were ordered to round up anyone associated with the organisation. So far, more than 27,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in about 15 states. In Uttar Pradesh, the police offered up to 10,000 rupees (\u00a3105) for information on anyone who had attended the gathering.</p> <p>In a statement this week, the Indian Scientists\u2019 Response to Covid-19 group said \u201cthe available data does not support the speculation\u201d that the blame for the coronavirus epidemic in India lies mainly with Tablighi Jamaat. The scientists emphasised that while testing for coronavirus is extremely low across India, a disproportionate number have been of members of Tablighi Jamaat, as per a government order, therefore heavily skewing the figures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet the test results were swiftly seized upon by members of the ruling ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who claimed Tablighi Jamaat members had intended to infect millions as part of an Islamic conspiracy and were carrying out \u201ccorona terrorism\u201d.</p> <p>Senior BJP leaders accused Tablighi Jamaat of carrying out a \u201cTalibani crime\u201d, described their members as \u201chuman bombs, but in the guise of coronavirus patients\u201d, and called for Tablighi Jamaat leaders to be both hanged and shot. Kapil Mishra, a local BJP leader notorious for hate speeches, tweeted: \u201cTablighi Jamaat people have begun spitting on the doctors and other health workers. It\u2019s clear, their aim is to infect as many people as possible with coronavirus and kill them.\u201d</p> <p>Though quickly debunked, the rumours of Tablighi Jamaat members refusing to go into quarantine, assaulting hospital staff and throwing bottles of urine at Hindus quickly spread.</p> <p>Hashtags such as \u201ccoronaJihad\u201d, \u201cCoronaTerrorism\u201d and \u201cCoronaBombsTablighi\u201d began to trend on Twitter in India. Mainstream Indian media repeatedly asserted that Tablighi Jamaat members were coronavirus \u201csuperspreaders\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Dr Zafarul-Islam Khan, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, said that while Tablighi Jamaat had been shortsighted in holding the convention, there were \u201cdozens of examples of government, political parties and other religious groups who also flouted the coronavirus restrictions and gathered in large numbers\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cBut the whole focus is being directed only on Muslims. In the past few days, we have noted a new wave of attacks on Muslims across the country. There is talk of social boycott of Muslims, harassment of Muslims by Hindutva groups and Muslims are even being harassed by police in various areas.\u201d</p> <p>There has been a concentration of attacks against Muslims in Karnataka, where a BJP MP, Anant Kumar Hegde, has denounced Tablighi Jamaat as terrorists. Shortly after, an audio clip began to be shared widely over WhatsApp, urging people not to allow Muslim fruit and vegetable sellers into their areas, claiming they were spreading the virus through their produce.</p> <p>Sayed Tabrez, 23, and his mother, Zareen Taj, 39, were among seven Muslim volunteers who were assaulted by a gang of local BJP members on 4 and 6 April, as they tried to distribute food to impoverished people in the Marathahalli and Dasarahalli districts of Karnataka.</p> <p>\u201cSome 20 local BJP members came on motorbikes and started shouting at us, saying, \u2018You are not allowed to give out rations \u2013 you are Muslims so you all are terrorists spreading the disease. We know you are spitting in the rations and have come from Tablighi Jamaat to spread the virus\u2019,\u201d said Tabrez. Two days later, about 25 local BJP members followed them in vehicles before attacking Tabrez, his mother and the other volunteers with bats. Police have since arrested two people.</p> <p>It is not an isolated incident. Manohar Elavarthy of the NGO Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been distributing lockdown rations, said dozens of attacks had been carried out against their Muslim volunteers in the past few days, including some by police.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730d9b3c3e3f78cb5c2ff935cadef52fd37c02ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730d9b3c3e3f78cb5c2ff935cadef52fd37c02ad/0_343_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ambulances waiting to take members of the Islamic group Tablighi Jamaat to a quarantine facility.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ambulances waiting to take members of the Islamic group Tablighi Jamaat to a quarantine facility.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Mangalore this week, posters started appearing that said Muslims were no longer allowed in certain neighbourhoods. \u201cNo Muslim trader will be allowed access to our hometown until the coronavirus is completely gone,\u201d read a sign in Alape.

      "bodyText": "The men who beat Mehboob Ali did so without mercy. Dragging him to a field in the village of Harewali, on the fringes of north-west Delhi, the group hit him with sticks and shoes until he bled from his nose and ears. Ali was a Muslim, recently returned home from a religious gathering, and the Hindu mob was quite certain he was part of a so-called Islamic conspiracy to spread coronavirus to Hindus nationwide. His attackers believed the devout 22-year-old must be punished before he carried out \u201ccorona jihad\u201d. The allegations were entirely false, but according to video footage and his family, the men who beat Ali on 5 April were in little doubt of his guilt, demanding: \u201cTell us who else is behind this conspiracy.\u201d Ali was then taken to a nearby Hindu temple and told to renounce Islam and convert to Hinduism before they would allow him to go to hospital. Five days after the attack Ali\u2019s family was still in fear of also being accused of spreading the virus. \u201cIf we file a police case, the Hindus will not let us live in the village,\u201d said one family member, who asked not to be named. Police confirmed that due to his attendance at a Muslim convention in Bhopal a few weeks back, Ali was being held in the isolation ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital in Delhi as a \u201ccorona suspect\u201d, though he had no symptoms. The attack on Ali is symptomatic of the growing demonisation of India\u2019s Muslim community, who are being accused, without any basis, of conducting a malevolent campaign to spread Covid-19 to the Hindu majority. Already a minority under attack \u2013 it is just weeks since Hindu mobs attacked Muslims in religious riots in Delhi \u2013 Muslims have now seen their businesses across India boycotted, volunteers distributing rations called \u201ccoronavirus terrorists\u201d, and others accused of spitting in food and infecting water supplies with the virus. Posters have appeared barring Muslims from entering certain neighbourhoods in states as far apart as Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana and Madhya Pradesh. The troubles began when the gathering of an Islamic missionary organisation, Tablighi Jamaat, held in mid-March in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin, was singled out by police and government as being responsible for the spread of coronavirus across India. The convention, which had been given the go-ahead by the Delhi authorities, was attended by about 8,000 people, including hundreds of foreigners. It soon became apparent that many at the convention had unknowingly picked up Covid-19 and brought it back to towns and villages across India. Across the country, police were ordered to round up anyone associated with the organisation. So far, more than 27,000 Tablighi Jamaat members and their contacts have been quarantined in about 15 states. In Uttar Pradesh, the police offered up to 10,000 rupees (\u00a3105) for information on anyone who had attended the gathering. In a statement this week, the Indian Scientists\u2019 Response to Covid-19 group said \u201cthe available data does not support the speculation\u201d that the blame for the coronavirus epidemic in India lies mainly with Tablighi Jamaat. The scientists emphasised that while testing for coronavirus is extremely low across India, a disproportionate number have been of members of Tablighi Jamaat, as per a government order, therefore heavily skewing the figures. Yet the test results were swiftly seized upon by members of the ruling ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who claimed Tablighi Jamaat members had intended to infect millions as part of an Islamic conspiracy and were carrying out \u201ccorona terrorism\u201d. Senior BJP leaders accused Tablighi Jamaat of carrying out a \u201cTalibani crime\u201d, described their members as \u201chuman bombs, but in the guise of coronavirus patients\u201d, and called for Tablighi Jamaat leaders to be both hanged and shot. Kapil Mishra, a local BJP leader notorious for hate speeches, tweeted: \u201cTablighi Jamaat people have begun spitting on the doctors and other health workers. It\u2019s clear, their aim is to infect as many people as possible with coronavirus and kill them.\u201d Though quickly debunked, the rumours of Tablighi Jamaat members refusing to go into quarantine, assaulting hospital staff and throwing bottles of urine at Hindus quickly spread. Hashtags such as \u201ccoronaJihad\u201d, \u201cCoronaTerrorism\u201d and \u201cCoronaBombsTablighi\u201d began to trend on Twitter in India. Mainstream Indian media repeatedly asserted that Tablighi Jamaat members were coronavirus \u201csuperspreaders\u201d. Dr Zafarul-Islam Khan, chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, said that while Tablighi Jamaat had been shortsighted in holding the convention, there were \u201cdozens of examples of government, political parties and other religious groups who also flouted the coronavirus restrictions and gathered in large numbers\u201d. He added: \u201cBut the whole focus is being directed only on Muslims. In the past few days, we have noted a new wave of attacks on Muslims across the country. There is talk of social boycott of Muslims, harassment of Muslims by Hindutva groups and Muslims are even being harassed by police in various areas.\u201d There has been a concentration of attacks against Muslims in Karnataka, where a BJP MP, Anant Kumar Hegde, has denounced Tablighi Jamaat as terrorists. Shortly after, an audio clip began to be shared widely over WhatsApp, urging people not to allow Muslim fruit and vegetable sellers into their areas, claiming they were spreading the virus through their produce. Sayed Tabrez, 23, and his mother, Zareen Taj, 39, were among seven Muslim volunteers who were assaulted by a gang of local BJP members on 4 and 6 April, as they tried to distribute food to impoverished people in the Marathahalli and Dasarahalli districts of Karnataka. \u201cSome 20 local BJP members came on motorbikes and started shouting at us, saying, \u2018You are not allowed to give out rations \u2013 you are Muslims so you all are terrorists spreading the disease. We know you are spitting in the rations and have come from Tablighi Jamaat to spread the virus\u2019,\u201d said Tabrez. Two days later, about 25 local BJP members followed them in vehicles before attacking Tabrez, his mother and the other volunteers with bats. Police have since arrested two people. It is not an isolated incident. Manohar Elavarthy of the NGO Swaraj Abhiyan, which has been distributing lockdown rations, said dozens of attacks had been carried out against their Muslim volunteers in the past few days, including some by police. In Mangalore this week, posters started appearing that said Muslims were no longer allowed in certain neighbourhoods. \u201cNo Muslim trader will be allowed access to our hometown until the coronavirus is completely gone,\u201d read a sign in Alape. In the Hindu-dominated village of Ankanahalli, a video seen by the Guardian shows Mahesh, the village panchayat president, issuing a warning that if any Hindu in the village is caught fraternising with a Muslim \u201cyou will be fined 500 to 1,000 rupees\u201d. The hijacking of coronavirus as an excuse for discrimination comes after a growing state-sponsored campaign to turn Muslims into second-class citizens in India, as part of the BJP\u2019s agenda of Hindu nationalism. Attacks on Muslims have become commonplace and the recent citizenship amendment act, passed by the BJP in December, prompted millions to take to the streets in protest, saying it discriminated against Muslims. The situation got so bad last week that it prompted Equality Labs, a US-based south Asian human rights organisation researching Islamophobic hate speech, to release a statement urging the World Health Organization to \u201cissue further guidelines against Covid-19 hate speech and disconnect it to religious communities\u201d. \u201cJust weeks after the Delhi pogrom where hundreds of Muslim houses and shops were vandalised, an uptick in misinformation and harmful communal language are leading to violence,\u201d said Equality Labs\u2019 executive director, Thenmozhi Soundararajan. \u201cThe threat of another pogrom still looms.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The most ambitious oil production cuts in history will not keep global oil prices afloat in the coming months as the coronavirus continues to take its toll, according to investors. Oil prices began to slide hours after the world\u2019s biggest producers agreed to make record cuts to their output, prompted by fears that the plan to shore up the global market may not be enough. Despite plans from the Opec oil cartel and its allies to hold back about 10% of the world\u2019s supplies, or nearly 10m barrels a day, the price of Brent crude retreated to just above $30 a barrel on Monday morning. The oil price steadied at just below $32 a barrel by the afternoon, but remained well below the $36 mark reached earlier this month in anticipation of the deal. The oil market began the year at $65 a barrel. The rare global co-operation pact hammered out over the Easter weekend was backed by G20 nations outside of the Opec+ alliance including the US, Canada and Norway. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, told reporters the deal would help deepen the Opec+ production cuts to about 19.5m barrels of oil a day in total. He said the G20 nations plan to cut about 3.7m barrels of oil a day from the world\u2019s global production. At the same time the Internal Energy Agency has agreed to buy 200m barrels of oil over the next few months which will be held in strategic reserve. But industry experts fear the plan will not counter the debilitating effectthe coronavirus pandemic has had on global oil demand and leave the market oversupplied with crude for most of the year. Goldman Sachs warned that the \u201chistoric but insufficient\u201d deal would not go far enough to prevent supplies from overwhelming the world\u2019s oil storage facilities and forcing producers to shut their wells. The US bank said oil prices would fall further in the coming weeks because the voluntary production cuts brokered by Opec were \u201cstill too little and too late\u201d to tackle a 19m barrel a day demand slump during April and May. Market analysts at the French investment bank BNP Paribas said the deal may \u201cat best\u201d help to set a floor on the market\u2019s sliding oil prices before a recovery was possible later this year. Donald Trump said the plan to cut 20m barrels a day from global oil production would ensure that the energy industry is \u201cstrong again, far faster than currently anticipated\u201d. \u201cHaving been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that Opec+ is looking to cut is 20 million barrels a day, not the 10 million that is generally being reported,\u201d the US president said on Twitter. Opec plans to keep a hold on oil production until April next year. This may help to buoy prices in the second half of the year as demand for oil to produce transport fuels begins to recover as coronavirus travel restrictions ease. Morgan Stanley lifted its forecasts for oil prices for the second half of the year by $5 to between $30 and $35 a barrel, and Citi believes prices could climb to between $35 and $45 a barrel. Energy market experts at Rystad Energy said oil prices would be unlikely to return to pre-coronavirus levels this year, despite production cuts, because surplus oil supplies have already created a glut in the market. \u201cIt will take some time for the stocks to fall back,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cAfter weeks of volatility, the market is now reacting with more caution to speculation and waits for concrete agreements to risk hiking prices to different levels.\u201d Brent crude climbed from 18-year lows of below $23 a barrel earlier this month to more than $36 a barrel last week, as talks between Saudi Arabia and Russia appeared to signal an end to a bitter price war that threatened to compound the impact of the pandemic on the oil market. Riyadh and Moscow planned to pump record oil volumes this year to increase their market share before agreeing to lower production. Saudi Arabia appears to have changed tack by offering buyers discounted prices on oil deliveries next month to maintain a competitive edge while it adheres to the new deal. The kingdom\u2019s biggest discounts, of between $3 and $5.50 below the market price for Brent crude, will be offered to buyers in Asia, according to a statement from the state oil company Saudi Aramco.",

      "bodyText": "Motorists have been caught driving at \u201cextreme speeds\u201d on otherwise-quiet roads over the Easter weekend, police have said, including one driver who was clocked at 151mph on the M1 near London. The number of motorists exceeding speed limits has doubled in some parts of the UK since the start of the coronavirus lockdown, increasing the risk to pedestrians taking their daily exercise. The Metropolitan police said the average speed on some 20mph roads had risen to 37mph as some drivers were tempted to put their foot down with fewer vehicles on the road. Over the Easter weekend, when highways would usually be busy with holidaymakers, traffic on some major roads fell by as much as 86%. However, police warned that some drivers were taking advantage of the quieter motorways by travelling at breakneck speeds. Supt Andy Cox, the Met\u2019s head of road and transport policing, said on Monday that some motorists were still travelling at \u201cextreme speeds\u201d in London. He posted footage of a police chase involving a driver caught doing 151mph on the M1 at the weekend, while another was spotted doing 97mph on the A10. In Greater Manchester, police arrested a Mercedes driver for travelling at what appeared to be more than 100mph on a 40mph stretch of the A580 East Lancashire Road on Saturday. The driver was \u201ctotally unaware of the police car behind him\u201d, the police tweeted, adding that he was \u201coff to court\u201d for speeding and breaching the coronavirus lockdown. The driver of a VW Golf was also caught speeding, at 106mph, on the M61 on Saturday, according to Greater Manchester police. The coronavirus outbreak has led to Britain\u2019s roads becoming much quieter, with car travel plummeting by as much as 73% to levels not seen since 1955, three weeks after the government ordered people to stop all non-essential travel to curb the spread of the disease. But police chiefs have raised concerns that people are becoming restless and bored after three weeks of lockdown, leading to some getting back in their cars. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, revealed last week that 40% of cars in the region were exceeding the speed limit, double the rate of 20-25% from before the lockdown. He said the number of cars on the road in Greater Manchester had \u201cdropped quite significantly\u201d to about 2m, but that there had been a significant rise in the number of speeding vehicles \u2013 reaching 45% of all cars at one point. Burnham said: \u201cThat will be worrying in any event, but it\u2019s particularly worrying when more families are out and about taking walks, people are running, cycling, just more people on our pavements. The worry is with so many people out taking exercise on the pavements more crowded than normal. This poses risks to public safety.\u201d A motorbike rider was arrested last week after being caught speeding at 150mph along the M23 in West Sussex. Giles York, the chief constable of Sussex police, said at the weekend that a number of his officers had been \u201cverbally abused, spat and coughed on in the line of duty\u201d and that there were still a few people who \u201cthink they are above or outside\u201d the lockdown regulations. He added: \u201cPlease respect the work of my officers and my staff. They are taking risks, they are showing courage in continuing to deliver policing on the frontline. Please follow the simple message: stay at home and save lives.\u201d In the West Midlands, police seized nine off-road bikes and arrested a 15-year-old boy and three men for \u201cturning deserted streets into racetracks\u201d over the bank holiday. They said the group were \u201crunning amok on our quieter roads during the government restrictions\u201d. John Apter, the chair of the Police Federation, which represents frontline officers, said it was \u201cpretty outrageous\u201d that people were flouting the lockdown. Speaking to LBC radio, Apter said the authorities would be justified in closing parks or beaches if a minority failed to break the lockdown: \u201cThe problem is if people ignore the rules and we find that these parks and beaches are getting packed with people \u2013 and it\u2019s clearly not daily exercise where they\u2019re having BBQs or picnics or sunbathing \u2013 I think the local authorities are right to react to that.\u201d",

Helena Croft, executive director of Streetlight, said the charity had seen an increase in suicide attempts among women using its service since the lockdown began. \u201cFor drugs users in prostitution it has tipped some over the edge because they are utterly desperate and cannot get access to drugs,\u201d she said. \u201cThis situation is dire, it is desperate and the longer it goes on the more difficult it becomes.\u201d She urged the men buying sex to heed government advice and stay at home. \u201cIf someone is turning up at a woman\u2019s door, they are making that choice. The women are putting themselves at more more risk through potentially seeing more people \u2013 but many have no other choice. No one is forcing anyone to go out and buy sex.\u201d \u2018Living by a thread\u2019: Sasha*, 33 For the past year Sasha*, who has two children and lives in Lewisham, has been working in a parlour as a sex worker while her children were in school. \u201cThe extra money was what kept me afloat,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford luxuries but it meant that I had food in the fridge and the kids weren\u2019t just eating bread and jam. When they started speaking about a virus I didn\u2019t think about what it would mean. Then the customers stopped coming.\u201d The parlour where the 33-year-old worked closed two weeks ago. Like many mothers, she cannot work from home. \u201cI thought about camming but how can I do that when I have children at home?,\u201d she says. She has applied for universal credit but when the payment arrives, it will not be enough to cover her rent. \u201cAs the bills come in I stack them up on a shelf and try to forget about them. I spend my whole day anxious. There is no let-up. I have the worry of the children, the worry of my mother who is old and on her own, the worry of my sister who has mental problems. I feel like I am living by a thread \u2013 I am exhausted and scared for our future.\u201d *Names have been changed",

Here are 12 sporting films to watch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Away from the courts, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tennis acts as a courier of commotion in its own way. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/26/maria-sharapova-returns-with-win-stuttgart-open\">Maria Sharapova returned </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/apr/26/maria-sharapova-returns-with-win-stuttgart-open\">in 2017</a> amid deafening arguments about whether she should be granted wildcards after her doping ban, the FFT president Bernard Giudicelli decided to reveal the French Open wildcards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/may/16/maria-sharapova-denied-wildcard-entry-french-open-ban\">and her rejection</a>, via a Facebook live broadcast. In 2018, Giudicelli was found guilty of defamation towards a former French player. After consequently being deemed ineligible from the ITF board for four years, he took the ITF to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.</p> <p>Last month, in the middle of a quiet Tuesday afternoon, the FFT set fire to the tennis world by announcing that it was unilaterally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/17/french-open-tennis-postponed-until-late-september-due-to-coronavirus\">uprooting the French Open from May to September</a>, two weeks after the US Open. The ATP and WTA were blindsided, players were in shock and other tournaments were threatened. As things stand, the French Open sits on the same dates as nine ATP and WTA events.</p> <p>The consequences of chaos have been fascinating. After the cancellation of Indian Wells on 9 March, initially, the tours could not even agree on a sufficient provisional period of suspension; the ATP erased six weeks of tournaments shortly after Indian Wells, the ITF settled on five weeks and the WTA slowly culled its calendar week by week. The disjointed reactions of the governing bodies further reflected a broken system.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88148f5a96596fe711e1f1619bba20b6b52fe9aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88148f5a96596fe711e1f1619bba20b6b52fe9aa/0_0_5228_3425/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The French Open\u2019s move to September has  forced various governing bodies to unite.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"655\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The French Open\u2019s move to September has forced various governing bodies to unite.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The rogue French Open forced the various governing bodies to unite for a coordinated response and it seems to have reaffirmed the need for closer cooperation. As the coronavirus outbreak continues to unfold, the ATP and WTA now work in unison and send out joint statements. On Friday the tours took things further by announcing \u201cTennis United\u201d, a YouTube web show featuring male and female players together. Presently, the ATP and WTA social media accounts don identical avatars and coordinated posts.</p> <p>These are irrelevant details to the wider sporting audience but it is a surreal sight to see them directly cooperating and happily packaging the sport as one. Tennis is alucrative, rare top-level sport where the men and women enter the same spaces, battle in the same arenas and, in the biggest events, earn the same money, but their joint presence has usually led to friction.<br><br>\u201cI think [male players] have been really tough, especially when it came to equality, as a general point,\u201d said Maria Sharapova last year. \u201cI mean, sitting at a press conference in Wimbledon five, seven years ago, there was not a lot of warmth coming from that side or that perspective. That\u2019s tough.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/10/tim-henman-insists-andy-murray-can-still-play-on-at-wimbledon\">Tim Henman insists Andy Murray can still play on at Wimbledon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last week the new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, <a href=\"https://www.ubitennis.net/2020/04/atp-chairman-gaudenzi-need-stop-infighting-everything-forgiven-french-open/\">gave his first extensive interview since his appointment</a>. Gaudenzi was clear about his intention to pursue unity in the sport and perhaps his most striking comment was his discussion of the business opportunities ahead. Rather than mentioning only his organisation, he reframed the entire discussion by positing the popularity of the women\u2019s game as an asset to embrace rather than as an obstacle to surmount.</p> <p>\u201cWe are a top five sport both in the men\u2019s and in the women\u2019s game, while other sports revolve almost exclusively around men,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can spend the next few years fighting over leftovers, while there is a world of opportunity out there.\u201d</p> <p>Dysfunction has been the prevailing topic in tennis since its inception. As tennis, like many other sports, comes to terms with one of its most serious crises, a silver lining of chaos is that it has forced its stakeholders to confront these existential problems together. The question is whether these new alliances will endure.</p>",

Paire is as likely to scythe an opponent to pieces with a million perfect drop shots as he is to be booed off the court at home by his own supporters after another trademark meltdown. Between Paire, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, French players are agents of chaos on the court. Away from the courts, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Tennis acts as a courier of commotion in its own way. When Maria Sharapova returned in 2017 amid deafening arguments about whether she should be granted wildcards after her doping ban, the FFT president Bernard Giudicelli decided to reveal the French Open wildcards, and her rejection, via a Facebook live broadcast. In 2018, Giudicelli was found guilty of defamation towards a former French player. After consequently being deemed ineligible from the ITF board for four years, he took the ITF to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Last month, in the middle of a quiet Tuesday afternoon, the FFT set fire to the tennis world by announcing that it was unilaterally uprooting the French Open from May to September, two weeks after the US Open. The ATP and WTA were blindsided, players were in shock and other tournaments were threatened. As things stand, the French Open sits on the same dates as nine ATP and WTA events. The consequences of chaos have been fascinating. After the cancellation of Indian Wells on 9 March, initially, the tours could not even agree on a sufficient provisional period of suspension; the ATP erased six weeks of tournaments shortly after Indian Wells, the ITF settled on five weeks and the WTA slowly culled its calendar week by week. The disjointed reactions of the governing bodies further reflected a broken system. The rogue French Open forced the various governing bodies to unite for a coordinated response and it seems to have reaffirmed the need for closer cooperation. As the coronavirus outbreak continues to unfold, the ATP and WTA now work in unison and send out joint statements. On Friday the tours took things further by announcing \u201cTennis United\u201d, a YouTube web show featuring male and female players together. Presently, the ATP and WTA social media accounts don identical avatars and coordinated posts. These are irrelevant details to the wider sporting audience but it is a surreal sight to see them directly cooperating and happily packaging the sport as one. Tennis is alucrative, rare top-level sport where the men and women enter the same spaces, battle in the same arenas and, in the biggest events, earn the same money, but their joint presence has usually led to friction. \u201cI think [male players] have been really tough, especially when it came to equality, as a general point,\u201d said Maria Sharapova last year. \u201cI mean, sitting at a press conference in Wimbledon five, seven years ago, there was not a lot of warmth coming from that side or that perspective. That\u2019s tough.\u201d Last week the new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, gave his first extensive interview since his appointment. Gaudenzi was clear about his intention to pursue unity in the sport and perhaps his most striking comment was his discussion of the business opportunities ahead. Rather than mentioning only his organisation, he reframed the entire discussion by positing the popularity of the women\u2019s game as an asset to embrace rather than as an obstacle to surmount. \u201cWe are a top five sport both in the men\u2019s and in the women\u2019s game, while other sports revolve almost exclusively around men,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can spend the next few years fighting over leftovers, while there is a world of opportunity out there.\u201d Dysfunction has been the prevailing topic in tennis since its inception. As tennis, like many other sports, comes to terms with one of its most serious crises, a silver lining of chaos is that it has forced its stakeholders to confront these existential problems together. The question is whether these new alliances will endure.",

The only break in the ceremony was from 20 May 1940 to 6 September 1944, when Ypres was under German occupation.</p> <p>Known as Ieper to the Belgians, and Wipers to the British forces who fought there, Ypres held a strategic position in the first world war, sitting on the path of Germany\u2019s planned sweep across the rest of Belgium and into France, giving access to the Channel ports. Five major battles were waged around the town. Allied troops would pass through the original gate on their way to the western front.</p> <p>Such was the slaughter in the muddy fields, the soldier and war poet Siegfried Sassoon wrote of Ypres that it was \u201cthe world\u2019s worst wound\u201d.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/triumphal-arch\">triumphal arch\u2019s</a> Hall of Memory contains the names of 54,393 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died here but whose bodies were never identified or found. When completed it was not large enough to hold all the names, so the names of another 34,984 soldiers missing after 15 August 1917 were engraved on the nearby <a href=\"https://www.cwgc.org/find/find-cemeteries-and-memorials/85900/tyne-cot-memorial\">Tyne Cot Memorial</a>.</p> <p>The last post was first played in a 1927 ceremony by buglers from the Somerset Light Infantry. A year later five locals, including the local chief of police, commander of the fire brigade and a store owner, Aime Gruwez \u2013 Mottrie\u2019s grandfather \u2013 formed the Last Post Association.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the intention of the Last Post Association to maintain this daily act of homage in perpetuity,\u201d its <a href=\"https://www.lastpost.be/en/home\">website</a> says.</p> <p>Mottrie added: \u201cOur mission is to respect the dead and make people reflect on what happened here, especially younger generations. If we do not learn and remember our history there\u2019s a risk of falling into the same trap.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every evening, at 8pm on the dot, a group of buglers sound the last post under Menin Gate at Ypres in Belgium. The daily ceremony, held in all weathers since 1928 apart from a pause during the second world war, honours the 89,880 British and Commonwealth soldiers \u2013 among the 300,000 who died in this part of western Flanders \u2013 who were lost with no known grave. In normal times, police stop all traffic and a crowd gathers to witness the homage, which was instigated by grateful citizens of the Ypres Salient who set up the Last Post Association after the war in recognition of the soldiers\u2019 sacrifice. Last month, however, the ceremony was threatened when the association was ordered to stop as part of Belgium\u2019s lockdown rules but after delicate negotiations also involving local authorities and the Commonwealth War Graves commission it now takes place with a lone bugler and no crowds. \u201cThis ceremony is to honour those who died around Ypres, not the public, but it\u2019s important around the world that people see we are continuing this tradition even in times of difficulty,\u201d said Benoit Mottrie, the association\u2019s chairman. \u201cWe have done this since 1928 and we will continue to do it.\u201d The buglers are all members of the local volunteer fire brigade, whose uniform they wear. The only break in the ceremony was from 20 May 1940 to 6 September 1944, when Ypres was under German occupation. Known as Ieper to the Belgians, and Wipers to the British forces who fought there, Ypres held a strategic position in the first world war, sitting on the path of Germany\u2019s planned sweep across the rest of Belgium and into France, giving access to the Channel ports. Five major battles were waged around the town. Allied troops would pass through the original gate on their way to the western front. Such was the slaughter in the muddy fields, the soldier and war poet Siegfried Sassoon wrote of Ypres that it was \u201cthe world\u2019s worst wound\u201d. The triumphal arch\u2019s Hall of Memory contains the names of 54,393 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died here but whose bodies were never identified or found. When completed it was not large enough to hold all the names, so the names of another 34,984 soldiers missing after 15 August 1917 were engraved on the nearby Tyne Cot Memorial. The last post was first played in a 1927 ceremony by buglers from the Somerset Light Infantry. A year later five locals, including the local chief of police, commander of the fire brigade and a store owner, Aime Gruwez \u2013 Mottrie\u2019s grandfather \u2013 formed the Last Post Association. \u201cIt is the intention of the Last Post Association to maintain this daily act of homage in perpetuity,\u201d its website says. Mottrie added: \u201cOur mission is to respect the dead and make people reflect on what happened here, especially younger generations. If we do not learn and remember our history there\u2019s a risk of falling into the same trap.\u201d",

Li-Da Kruger and Prue Leith in Cambodia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bright Button Media/CHANNEL 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Knowing that she escaped the Khmer Rouge meant Kruger didn\u2019t struggle with the feelings of rejection and abandonment common to many adopted children. Kruger\u2019s birth parents most likely did not <em>choose </em>to give her up in any conventional sense: it was a question of survival. \u201cAdopted people I know who don\u2019t have this big epic horror story behind their adoption find it in some ways harder [to deal with],\u201d Kruger says, \u201cbecause it is about rejection and abandonment.\u201d</p> <p>This is not Kruger\u2019s first attempt to trace her birth mother: she returned to Cambodia at the age of 27 with the same intention, <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/from-pol-pot-to-prue-leith-02krg62vz7q\">making a documentary about it for ITV</a>. Kruger explains that she felt compelled to give it another shot after going through the process of adopting a two-year-old boy. \u201cI literally had to fill in this form with every address I\u2019d ever lived at and the dates I left and why,\u201d Kruger says. \u201cAnd I suddenly realised that, actually, all those details really matter to me. They\u2019ve always mattered. I wanted to be able to fill in the gaps of my own history for my son.\u201d</p> <p>Returning to Cambodia, Kruger was aware that she was unlikely to find her birth parents: the Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of approximately one-quarter of Cambodia\u2019s population in just four years. Even if her birth parents had survived, most records had been destroyed. But the journalist John Pilger, who helped draw the world\u2019s attention to the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, gave Kruger some invaluable advice. \u201cHe said: \u2018Try to find as many concrete, tangible things from your past, even if you don\u2019t find names of people,\u2019\u201d Kruger says. \u201c\u2018Because it all helps validate your existence.\u2019 That was the most important piece of advice I ever heard. It made me try to get the best out of what I\u2019ve got to make sense of my past \u2026 all of it gives me a fuller picture and ultimately validates who I am.\u201d</p> <p>While in Cambodia, Leith and Kruger track down one woman, Hong Soth, who might be Kruger\u2019s birth mother. Waiting for the results of DNA testing, Leith was torn. \u201cI remember desperately hoping she was Li-Da\u2019s mother, because I knew how important it was for Li-Da to find her,\u201d she says \u201cBut part of me thought: Oh God, it\u2019s not just Hong Soth, she has a whole family. I\u2019ve had Li-Da for 45 years. Am I prepared for her to focus on the Cambodian side of her family, and see much less of her?\u2019</p> <p>DNA testing subsequently rules Hong Soth out, although not before she tells the women something disturbing: she never intended to give her baby up for adoption. Her baby was taken from her whilst she was hospitalised for depression. Did Leith worry that Kruger\u2019s birth mother might similarly have been coerced into giving her up, against her will? \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to overthink these things,\u201d Leith responds. \u201cBut obviously, in war there are people who will exploit situations.\u201d</p> <p>Although this trip was not successful, it threw up some leads: DNA testing linked Kruger to a Cambodian village, and she is working with locals there to establish how she may be related to them. Leith has always supported Kruger in her efforts to find her birth parents. \u201cYou said the most amazing thing to me,\u201d says Kruger, addressing her mother. \u201cBefore I first went to Cambodia. You said: \u2018I support you 100% trying to find your birth parents, but just know that if you never come back, I am so privileged to have spent 27 years of your life with you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For her part, Leith found the trip to Cambodia unexpectedly moving. During filming, the famously matter-of-fact chef was often moved to tears by the sight of small children. \u201cThe little ones looked so much like Li-Da when she was a baby,\u201d says Leith. \u201cI kept thinking, that was a bit of Li-Da\u2019s life that I missed, and I wasn\u2019t there for her, I was just happy with my little boy in England, and she was starving and her mother was probably being killed.\u201d She shakes her famously bright spectacles from side to side. \u201cAwful.\u201d</p> <p>Watching Leith and Kruger interact on camera, their bond is undeniably strong. What has life been like for Kruger since her mother stepped back into the spotlight to present Bake Off? \u201cWhen I was really little, I felt that Mum was quite famous,\u201d Kruger responds. \u201cWe would get stopped in the street, and people who were interested in cooking always knew who Mum was. But then Bake Off came along and it was <em>extraordinary.</em> Mum would be stopped in toilets for selfies. It was a whole new level.\u201d Leith interjects. \u201cDaniel was the one who has always been embarrassed by me.\u201d Kruger shakes her head: \u201cHe\u2019s proud now. We\u2019ve both really proud. You deserve it.\u201d</p> <p>I grab the opportunity to ask Leith about Bake Off. When filming resumes, post-coronavirus, one of the hosts, Sandi Toksvig, is set to be replaced by the comedian Matt Lucas, having surprised audiences by exiting the much-loved Channel 4 show. Leith squashes rumours that Toksvig had been unhappy on Bake Off for a while. \u201cI know her very well and I know she\u2019s a great actress, but you can\u2019t look that merry without it being real,\u201d Leith says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5afe57e44e667e69791db45974d77e7ffc532fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5afe57e44e667e69791db45974d77e7ffc532fb/30_270_3439_2064/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leith with Sandi Toksvig, Noel Fielding and Paul Hollywood in The Great British Bake Off.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leith with Sandi Toksvig, Noel Fielding and Paul Hollywood in The Great British Bake Off.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C4/Love Productions/Mark Bourdillon/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leith is talking to me from what looks like a well-stocked kitchen: behind her, I can see glass jars of spaghetti and grains. Across the nation, as we speak, neighbours are furtively swapping sourdough starters. Does Leith have any tips for those embracing cooking for the first time? \u201cMy tip would be to get a really simple cookbook and just do what it says,\u201d she says seriously. \u201cNothing too fancy or written by a really classy chef. It won\u2019t necessarily look perfect or be perfect, but it will work.\u201d</p> <p>Every story about adoption has another life implicit within it: the life that was not led, the family that was not your own, the path that was not followed. \u201cThat could have been you,\u201d observes Leith to Kruger, pointing to a Cambodian street vendor during their travels. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life trying to close the gap between those two lives,\u201d says Kruger. \u201cThe life I live now, and the life that could have been.\u201d Seeing mother and daughter together on film, it seems Li-Da ended up exactly where she belonged.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/prue-leith-journey-with-my-daughter\">Prue Leith: Journey with my Daughter </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/prue-leith-journey-with-my-daughter\">is on Tuesday 14 April, 9pm, Channel 4</a></em></p>",

Kruger\u2019s birth parents most likely did not choose to give her up in any conventional sense: it was a question of survival. \u201cAdopted people I know who don\u2019t have this big epic horror story behind their adoption find it in some ways harder [to deal with],\u201d Kruger says, \u201cbecause it is about rejection and abandonment.\u201d This is not Kruger\u2019s first attempt to trace her birth mother: she returned to Cambodia at the age of 27 with the same intention, making a documentary about it for ITV. Kruger explains that she felt compelled to give it another shot after going through the process of adopting a two-year-old boy. \u201cI literally had to fill in this form with every address I\u2019d ever lived at and the dates I left and why,\u201d Kruger says. \u201cAnd I suddenly realised that, actually, all those details really matter to me. They\u2019ve always mattered. I wanted to be able to fill in the gaps of my own history for my son.\u201d Returning to Cambodia, Kruger was aware that she was unlikely to find her birth parents: the Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of approximately one-quarter of Cambodia\u2019s population in just four years. Even if her birth parents had survived, most records had been destroyed. But the journalist John Pilger, who helped draw the world\u2019s attention to the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, gave Kruger some invaluable advice. \u201cHe said: \u2018Try to find as many concrete, tangible things from your past, even if you don\u2019t find names of people,\u2019\u201d Kruger says. \u201c\u2018Because it all helps validate your existence.\u2019 That was the most important piece of advice I ever heard. It made me try to get the best out of what I\u2019ve got to make sense of my past \u2026 all of it gives me a fuller picture and ultimately validates who I am.\u201d While in Cambodia, Leith and Kruger track down one woman, Hong Soth, who might be Kruger\u2019s birth mother. Waiting for the results of DNA testing, Leith was torn. \u201cI remember desperately hoping she was Li-Da\u2019s mother, because I knew how important it was for Li-Da to find her,\u201d she says \u201cBut part of me thought: Oh God, it\u2019s not just Hong Soth, she has a whole family. I\u2019ve had Li-Da for 45 years. Am I prepared for her to focus on the Cambodian side of her family, and see much less of her?\u2019 DNA testing subsequently rules Hong Soth out, although not before she tells the women something disturbing: she never intended to give her baby up for adoption. Her baby was taken from her whilst she was hospitalised for depression. Did Leith worry that Kruger\u2019s birth mother might similarly have been coerced into giving her up, against her will? \u201cIt\u2019s tempting to overthink these things,\u201d Leith responds. \u201cBut obviously, in war there are people who will exploit situations.\u201d Although this trip was not successful, it threw up some leads: DNA testing linked Kruger to a Cambodian village, and she is working with locals there to establish how she may be related to them. Leith has always supported Kruger in her efforts to find her birth parents. \u201cYou said the most amazing thing to me,\u201d says Kruger, addressing her mother. \u201cBefore I first went to Cambodia. You said: \u2018I support you 100% trying to find your birth parents, but just know that if you never come back, I am so privileged to have spent 27 years of your life with you.\u2019\u201d For her part, Leith found the trip to Cambodia unexpectedly moving. During filming, the famously matter-of-fact chef was often moved to tears by the sight of small children. \u201cThe little ones looked so much like Li-Da when she was a baby,\u201d says Leith. \u201cI kept thinking, that was a bit of Li-Da\u2019s life that I missed, and I wasn\u2019t there for her, I was just happy with my little boy in England, and she was starving and her mother was probably being killed.\u201d She shakes her famously bright spectacles from side to side. \u201cAwful.\u201d Watching Leith and Kruger interact on camera, their bond is undeniably strong. What has life been like for Kruger since her mother stepped back into the spotlight to present Bake Off? \u201cWhen I was really little, I felt that Mum was quite famous,\u201d Kruger responds. \u201cWe would get stopped in the street, and people who were interested in cooking always knew who Mum was. But then Bake Off came along and it was extraordinary. Mum would be stopped in toilets for selfies. It was a whole new level.\u201d Leith interjects. \u201cDaniel was the one who has always been embarrassed by me.\u201d Kruger shakes her head: \u201cHe\u2019s proud now. We\u2019ve both really proud. You deserve it.\u201d I grab the opportunity to ask Leith about Bake Off. When filming resumes, post-coronavirus, one of the hosts, Sandi Toksvig, is set to be replaced by the comedian Matt Lucas, having surprised audiences by exiting the much-loved Channel 4 show. Leith squashes rumours that Toksvig had been unhappy on Bake Off for a while. \u201cI know her very well and I know she\u2019s a great actress, but you can\u2019t look that merry without it being real,\u201d Leith says. Leith is talking to me from what looks like a well-stocked kitchen: behind her, I can see glass jars of spaghetti and grains. Across the nation, as we speak, neighbours are furtively swapping sourdough starters. Does Leith have any tips for those embracing cooking for the first time? \u201cMy tip would be to get a really simple cookbook and just do what it says,\u201d she says seriously. \u201cNothing too fancy or written by a really classy chef. It won\u2019t necessarily look perfect or be perfect, but it will work.\u201d Every story about adoption has another life implicit within it: the life that was not led, the family that was not your own, the path that was not followed. \u201cThat could have been you,\u201d observes Leith to Kruger, pointing to a Cambodian street vendor during their travels. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my life trying to close the gap between those two lives,\u201d says Kruger. \u201cThe life I live now, and the life that could have been.\u201d Seeing mother and daughter together on film, it seems Li-Da ended up exactly where she belonged.

      "body": "<p>Tim Brooke-Taylor, who has died aged 79 of coronavirus, was one of those Oxbridge graduates who brought surreal, anarchic humour first to the stage, then television, where he was one of the trio adding slapstick to the mix in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2007/mar/01/comedy.television\">The Goodies</a>.</p> <p>Typical of the humour of The Goodies was a medieval vasectomy sketch with Brooke-Taylor standing in a park, back to the camera and trousers around his ankles, while a knight on a charger rushes him with a lance aimed at the appropriate area. He once reflected: \u201cThere are moments when I\u2019m standing in the middle of some high street dressed as a rabbit and I say to myself, \u2018I\u2019ve not only got a degree, but I\u2019m an honorary doctor of laws. <em>Doctor</em> Tim Brooke-Taylor. What am I doing hopping down this high street in floppy ears and a furry tail?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>With his fellow Cambridge graduates Graeme Garden and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/bill-oddie\">Bill Oddie</a>, Brooke-Taylor created The Goodies, which ran on the BBC for 10 years from 1970 to 1980. All three wrote the scripts at the start, while in later years they were provided by Garden and Oddie. ITV revived the show with a 1981 Christmas special and a six-part series the following year. Cartoon-style humour came from the three contrasting characters portrayed on screen \u2013 the pompous Brooke-Taylor, the professorial Garden and the untidy but raffish Oddie.</p> <p>The programme was most striking for its sight gags \u2013 such as Brooke-Taylor, dressed as an Edwardian nanny, falling into a river \u2013 with significant location filming and special effects. \u201cOur pre-production meetings with the art designers and production designers were almost more important than the writing of the scripts,\u201d he revealed.</p> <p>A cat toppling over the Post Office Tower in London was the centrepiece of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb59dEHRt5Q\">Kitten Kong</a> episode, which won the Silver Rose at the 1972 Montreux television festival. Three years later, the same award went to a Goodies show paying homage to the silent film greats that included Brooke-Taylor grappling with a lion.</p> <p>Nevertheless, radio was the medium where Brooke-Taylor made his most enduring contribution to comedy. He was a panellist and occasional writer throughout all nine series of BBC Radio\u2019s anarchic, revue-style sketch show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009zbr2/episodes/guide\">I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again</a> (1964-73), a cocktail of silly voices, awful puns and smutty humour. Alongside Garden and Oddie, as well as others including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/john-cleese\">John Cleese</a>, Jo Kendall and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jun/16/broadcasting.guardianobituaries\">David Hatch</a>, Brooke-Taylor was most memorable as the screeching Lady Constance de Coverlet, an ageing dowager reputed for her size, variously heard in the guise of Anne of Cleavage or an elephant in a parody of the TV adventure <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z438rv_BMGc\">Daktari</a>.</p> <p>The show was spun off into the even longer-running <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnwb\">I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue</a>, a parody of panel games, with those taking part given \u201csilly things to do\u201d and Brooke-Taylor ever-present from its launch in 1972 until his death. It became one of BBC Radio 4\u2019s most popular programmes and the original presenter, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/25/radio.bbc\">Humphrey Lyttelton</a>, described him as \u201cprone to argue with the chairman, slightly vulnerable, perspires a lot, a favourite with the crowd\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e2fd1dcbe15a5db70806ff0d75d0c9d4940a8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e2fd1dcbe15a5db70806ff0d75d0c9d4940a8e6/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Brooke-Taylor with fellow panellist Victoria Wood for a 2009 recording of BBC Radio 4\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Brooke-Taylor with fellow panellist Victoria Wood for a 2009 recording of BBC Radio 4\u2019s I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim was born in Buxton, Derbyshire, to Rachel (nee Pawson), a former games teacher at Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 college who played lacrosse at international level, and Edward Brooke-Taylor, a solicitor and veteran of the first world war, who won the Military Cross for gallantry and was then a home guard commander during the second world war.</p> <p>Following the death of his father when he was 12, Tim attended Winchester college, then spent a year teaching at schools in Hertfordshire and Derbyshire before gaining a law degree from Pembroke College, Cambridge. He joined the university\u2019s Footlights drama club in 1960, performing alongside his fellow students Oddie, Cleese and Graham Chapman. He was Footlights president when A Clump of Plinths, its 1963 revue for the Edinburgh festival, transferred to the West End, retitled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/jul/11/cambridge-circus-footlights-review-john-cleese-bill-oddie\">Cambridge Circus</a>, then in 1964 to Broadway.</p> <p>Just as Alan Bennett, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/27/sir-jonathan-miller-obituary\">Jonathan Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/28/guardianobituaries.media\">Dudley Moore</a> found a path into television satire following the success of their revue Beyond the Fringe, an Oxford-Cambridge collaboration, Brooke-Taylor headed for BBC radio, joining I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again.</p> <p>No BBC television opportunities were immediately presented to him, so in 1965 he joined ITV\u2019s topical consumer affairs show On the Braden Beat, parodying a rightwing business executive in satirical sketches. He then joined the scriptwriting team \u2013 along with Oddie and most of the future <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/04/monty-python-at-50-a-half-century-of-silly-walks-edible-props-and-dead-parrots\">Monty Python</a> members \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/sep/01/sir-david-frost\">David Frost</a>\u2019s BBC satirical show The Frost Report (1966-67), then was both a writer and performer in two comedy series starring Marty Feldman \u2013 At Last the 1948 Show (1967) and Marty (1968-69).</p> <p>Broaden Your Mind (1968-69) was a sketch show that proved to be the precursor to The Goodies. Brooke-Taylor and Garden created it, and were joined in the second series by Oddie. Brooke-Taylor, John Junkin and Barry Cryer also wrote and starred in the BBC Radio 2 sketch show Hello Cheeky (1973-79), but their 1976 TV version was less successful.</p> <p>Sitcoms extended Brooke-Taylor\u2019s career beyond such programmes. After taking a supporting role as the neighbour Toby Burgess in His and Hers (1970-72), he teamed up with Junkin to script and star as two flatmates on the look out for women in the 1971 pilot The Rough With the Smooth, followed by a 1975 series.</p> <p>In Me and My Girl (1984-88), he played Derek Yates, supporting his widowed best friend and ad agency partner Simon Harrap (Richard O\u2019Sullivan) in bringing up a teenage daughter. He then starred in You Must Be the Husband (1987-88) as Tom Hammond, coming to terms with the success his wife, Alice (Diane Keen), finds in writing a racy romantic novel.</p> <p>Bolstered by Oddie\u2019s musical skills, the Goodies had a string of chart singles, including the Top 10 hits <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzum25lHoqE\">The Inbetweenies</a>/Father Christmas Do Not Touch Me (1974) and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQfecoM1kpo\">The Funky Gibbon</a>/Sick Man Blues (1975), both double A-sides. They also voiced the superhero cartoon TV series Bananaman (1983-88).</p> <p>Brooke-Taylor was appointed OBE in 2011. He is survived by his wife, Christine (nee Wheadon), whom he married in 1968, and their sons, Ben and Edward.</p> <p>\u2022 Timothy Julian Brooke-Taylor, actor and writer, born 17 July 1940; died 12 April 2020</p>",

He was a panellist and occasional writer throughout all nine series of BBC Radio\u2019s anarchic, revue-style sketch show I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again (1964-73), a cocktail of silly voices, awful puns and smutty humour. Alongside Garden and Oddie, as well as others including John Cleese, Jo Kendall and David Hatch, Brooke-Taylor was most memorable as the screeching Lady Constance de Coverlet, an ageing dowager reputed for her size, variously heard in the guise of Anne of Cleavage or an elephant in a parody of the TV adventure Daktari. The show was spun off into the even longer-running I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue, a parody of panel games, with those taking part given \u201csilly things to do\u201d and Brooke-Taylor ever-present from its launch in 1972 until his death. It became one of BBC Radio 4\u2019s most popular programmes and the original presenter, Humphrey Lyttelton, described him as \u201cprone to argue with the chairman, slightly vulnerable, perspires a lot, a favourite with the crowd\u201d. Tim was born in Buxton, Derbyshire, to Rachel (nee Pawson), a former games teacher at Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 college who played lacrosse at international level, and Edward Brooke-Taylor, a solicitor and veteran of the first world war, who won the Military Cross for gallantry and was then a home guard commander during the second world war. Following the death of his father when he was 12, Tim attended Winchester college, then spent a year teaching at schools in Hertfordshire and Derbyshire before gaining a law degree from Pembroke College, Cambridge. He joined the university\u2019s Footlights drama club in 1960, performing alongside his fellow students Oddie, Cleese and Graham Chapman. He was Footlights president when A Clump of Plinths, its 1963 revue for the Edinburgh festival, transferred to the West End, retitled Cambridge Circus, then in 1964 to Broadway. Just as Alan Bennett, Jonathan Miller and Dudley Moore found a path into television satire following the success of their revue Beyond the Fringe, an Oxford-Cambridge collaboration, Brooke-Taylor headed for BBC radio, joining I\u2019m Sorry I\u2019ll Read That Again. No BBC television opportunities were immediately presented to him, so in 1965 he joined ITV\u2019s topical consumer affairs show On the Braden Beat, parodying a rightwing business executive in satirical sketches. He then joined the scriptwriting team \u2013 along with Oddie and most of the future Monty Python members \u2013 on David Frost\u2019s BBC satirical show The Frost Report (1966-67), then was both a writer and performer in two comedy series starring Marty Feldman \u2013 At Last the 1948 Show (1967) and Marty (1968-69). Broaden Your Mind (1968-69) was a sketch show that proved to be the precursor to The Goodies. Brooke-Taylor and Garden created it, and were joined in the second series by Oddie. Brooke-Taylor, John Junkin and Barry Cryer also wrote and starred in the BBC Radio 2 sketch show Hello Cheeky (1973-79), but their 1976 TV version was less successful. Sitcoms extended Brooke-Taylor\u2019s career beyond such programmes. After taking a supporting role as the neighbour Toby Burgess in His and Hers (1970-72), he teamed up with Junkin to script and star as two flatmates on the look out for women in the 1971 pilot The Rough With the Smooth, followed by a 1975 series. In Me and My Girl (1984-88), he played Derek Yates, supporting his widowed best friend and ad agency partner Simon Harrap (Richard O\u2019Sullivan) in bringing up a teenage daughter. He then starred in You Must Be the Husband (1987-88) as Tom Hammond, coming to terms with the success his wife, Alice (Diane Keen), finds in writing a racy romantic novel. Bolstered by Oddie\u2019s musical skills, the Goodies had a string of chart singles, including the Top 10 hits The Inbetweenies/Father Christmas Do Not Touch Me (1974) and The Funky Gibbon/Sick Man Blues (1975), both double A-sides. They also voiced the superhero cartoon TV series Bananaman (1983-88). Brooke-Taylor was appointed OBE in 2011. He is survived by his wife, Christine (nee Wheadon), whom he married in 1968, and their sons, Ben and Edward. \u2022 Timothy Julian Brooke-Taylor, actor and writer, born 17 July 1940; died 12 April 2020",

At the Monday briefing, the PM\u2019s spokesman said that in the 24-hour period up to 9am on Sunday, 18,000 tests were carried out in Great Britain. He said that 2,630 of those tests involved NHS staff being tested at drive-through sites, and that a total of 42,812 NHS staff and their family members had now been tested. That marked \u201csignificant progress on where we were a little over a week ago\u201d, the spokesman claimed. When it was put to him that the government was still a long way off the 100,000-a-day target set by Hancock, the spokesman said he did not accept that. \u201cNew capacity is coming on stream all the time,\u201d he said, stressing that there were now 23 drive-through centres open where NHS staff could get tested.

So far he\u2019s cooked an average of 10 a night by himself with ingredients provided at a discount from the neighbouring butcher and greengrocer. In Harrogate, North Yorkshire, the curry house Cardamom Black is cooking free meals for a local church to distribute to homeless and vulnerable people and giving a 50% discount to NHS staff. Rangrez, a Punjabi restaurant in Ealing, west London, is working with suppliers and volunteers to deliver free meals to local people in need and to hospital staff. In Lancashire, the gluten- and dairy-free brand Kirsty\u2019s is supplying more than 7,000 ready meals worth over \u00a313,000 to vulnerable people in self-isolation in Lancashire. Older people in self-isolation face being almost entirely cut off from the outside world unless they have broadband and associated gadgets. Audley Group, which runs retirement villages, is trying to match residents with young penpals so that letters bridge the gap. The company hopes to recruit local schools for regular correspondence so that pupils can learn the life stories of an older generation. A similar need inspired the personalised postcard app Touchnote to offer a free card for customers to send to someone self-isolating. More than 8,500 have so far been sent. Altruism is not ordinarily associated with mobile phone giants, but Vodafone, EE, O2, Three and BT have collaborated to ensure that customers on pay as you go mobiles or low incomes have free access to NHS website information on coronavirus. The idea was the brainchild of a design studio, Snook, which partnered with Nominet, a domain name registry, to win the support of the mobile providers. Vodafone is also giving unlimited data for 30 days to customers registered as vulnerable or as NHS workers. For those who do possess the technology, Ascenti is offering free online physiotherapy sessions to over-65s and NHS workers. Video-call appointments will give advice on how to manage health at home. \u201cPeople are staying indoors and it\u2019s possible that those with mobility issues could see their physical health deteriorate,\u201d said Ascenti\u2019s chief executive, Stephanie Dobrikova. \u201cThis could have a big impact on older people in particular and so we wanted to do something to support them.\u201d The often forgotten heroes are care workers and care home staff who are fighting coronavirus in the community. Jamie Harkin, an A-level pupil from County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, has created a calendar with an inspirational quote for every day in memory of a teacher who died from cancer. His 366 Pockets of Positivity began in December as a fundraiser for a local charity, Care for Cancer. He is now sending additional copies at his own expense to lift the spirits of care workers nominated by wellwishers and has so far posted 100. Solicitor Jodie Hill has forfeited her salary and dedicated lockdown to helping those left in limbo by the collapsing economy. Her company, Leeds-based Thrive Law, has set up a free helpline for individuals and businesses in crisis and has so far helped more than 500 people. \u201cWe have continued to pay our staff in full so we can interpret government guidance for vulnerable people who cannot afford legal advice,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people want to do the right thing, they just don\u2019t know how to do it. I always want to challenge the public perception that lawyers are inaccessible and expensive.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear of more companies serving their communities during the crisis.

What Salesforce \u201creally meant wasn\u2019t \u2018come and be a CEO\u2019 in the way I\u2019d been a CEO at Virgin Money, but \u2018come and be a super sales director of our UK business within the matrix of a fantastically successful US company\u2019. So for me that felt like a step back rather than a step forward.\u201d Gadhia stayed on as adviser at Salesforce, and has since joined a special committee overseeing a cultural overhaul at the insurance market Lloyds of London after a raft of bullying and harassment allegations last year. It is a natural fit for the former banker, who is known for designing the Women in Finance charter aimed at increasing gender equality in the financial sector. While the Lloyds of London committee is still holding virtual meetings to address the problem, Gadhia hopes the lockdown may spark a \u201cbit more civility\u201d from perpetrators that tend to be behave better in front of their families than their colleagues. But even with Snoop about to launch, Gadhia says it has been difficult to find a purpose after leaving a top banking job. \u201cI feel I\u2019m still searching for the complete answer post-Virgin Money, for sure.\u201d",

It\u2019s a BBC recording of one of those, on 30 June that year, with the New Philharmonia Chorus and Teresa \u017bylis-Gara, Janet Baker, George Shirley and Theo Adam as the soloists, which is now being streamed on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K98zzC2FUtQ\">the Philharmonia\u2019s website</a>. These days Klemperer\u2019s performances, especially from the tail-end of his career, tend to be characterised as thick-textured and predominantly slow, but this account of the Ninth at least partly belies that. His approach is, of course, thoroughly traditional, with larger forces than we\u2019re used to hearing in this work nowadays \u2013 Klemperer doubled up the woodwind parts, as Beethoven apparently specified for the work\u2019s premiere. And by today\u2019s standards too, the tempi are certainly on the slow side. But there isn\u2019t a moment when the performance seems to drag, while the textures often seem miraculously light \u2013 the scherzo positively dances. If the first movement is relatively routine it\u2019s a performance of gradually increasing power, and by the finale Klemperer\u2019s seemingly minimal gestures to the orchestra have conjured up something truly remarkable. <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b651552c4e3977e198c6fbca3b2d921112da19f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b651552c4e3977e198c6fbca3b2d921112da19f5/0_580_3284_1970/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Splendidly sinister ...

In <a href=\"http://www.alessandrotalevi.com/biography.html\">Alessandro Talevi</a>\u2019s Opera North staging, the boundaries between innocence and corruption constantly blur, throwing us continuously off balance, and few other productions have quite so consistently, or indeed so disturbingly, maintained the fundamental ambiguity as to whether the ghosts are genuine supernatural entities, or projections of the Governess\u2019s disordered mind. There are some splendidly sinister moments, as shadows behave independently of bodies, and the children become increasingly like the ghosts that may or may not possess them. And the final moments of Act I are genuinely marrow-freezing. Tensely conducted by Leo McFall, it\u2019s exceptionally well sung across the board. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/09/how-to-make-britten-fly-soprano-sarah-tynan-on-fusing-les-illuminations-with-circus\">Sarah Tynan</a> is outstanding as the tormented Governess, while Tim Gasiorek\u2019s tragic, chilling Miles is probably the best you will ever see. <strong>Tim Ashley</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8199c52f1ee6c88382c0b6ef26c16bcea7f92a70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8199c52f1ee6c88382c0b6ef26c16bcea7f92a70/0_121_1583_949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Musically superb ...

Graham Vick\u2019s production for the 2013 <a href=\"https://www.rossinioperafestival.it/en/\">Rossini festival in Pesaro</a> revels in further, sometimes gnomic juxtapositions. Thus the Act II love duet sees tenor and soprano confessing adoration not only across enemy lines but also, bafflingly, amid a herd of life-sized model horses. But don\u2019t be put off: musically, this performance is superb, more than redeeming any frustrations with the staging. In the pit, rising star <a href=\"http://www.mariotticonductor.com/\">Michele Mariotti </a>drives the excellent chorus and orchestra of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna with an unapologetically Italianate sense of momentum. <a href=\"https://www.juandiegoflorez.com/\">Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez</a> is on top form as Swiss romantic hero Arnold, all earnest expressivity and clarion top notes, while <a href=\"http://www.stagedoor.it/en/artist/nicola%20alaimo/Baritono/W/Biography/\">Nicola Alaimo</a>\u2019s Tell is both physically and vocally imposing. As Tell\u2019s son Jemmy, <a href=\"https://www.amandaforsythe.com/\">Amanda Forsythe</a> is irresistible, her tone luminous. Leading the Habsburg occupiers (all dressed in pre-first world war Austro-Hungarian bling), Luca Tittoto\u2019s Gesler is deliciously thuggish. But the standout performance is <a href=\"https://marinarebeka.com/\">Marina Rebeka</a>\u2019s Mathilde: her voice rich with a steely edge and crystalline high notes, her stage presence intensely convincing even in closeup. Catch it free while you can.<em> </em>(<a href=\"https://operavision.eu/en/library/performances/operas/guillaume-tell-rossini-opera-festival\">Available until 7 July</a>.)<strong> Flora Willson</strong></p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.operaonvideo.com/un-ballo-in-maschera-met-2012-radvanovsky-alvarez-hvorostovsky/#information\">Un Ballo in Maschera (Metropolitan Opera, New York)</a></h2> <p>Politics, affairs of the heart, betrayal: these are Verdi\u2019s essentials in a plot based on the 1792 assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden. It was politicking, too, that dictated the opera being set in different locations in slightly differing versions (confusion alert). In his debut production for New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera, director David Alden opted for the Swedish setting, but with contemporary Scandi noir. Against the suitably stark and sleek design, references to paintings of the Fall of Icarus, Busby Berkeley films, fishermen in macs and sou\u2019westers straight off a Peter Grimes set, not to mention the contents of soothsayer Ulrika\u2019s shiny patent handbag, add notes of whimsy. The late lamented Dmitri Hvorostovsky is a main attraction, expressing both the violent urge of vengeance as well as the tenderness of regret, with the famous aria Eri Tu a great outpouring of emotion. <strong>Rian Evans</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f19bd3f58a5bec51c6f7e7097591719cdf5ee117\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f19bd3f58a5bec51c6f7e7097591719cdf5ee117/19_0_1097_658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Music on a muse, Luisa Casati ...

This year\u2019s event was cancelled only days before the opening, but Ritratto\u2019s dress rehearsal had been filmed and is now available online. The portrait of the title is that of Luisa Casati, an Italian heiress who was the muse and model for a number of artists in the early decades of the 20th century. Jeths\u2019s opera depicts the efforts of Casati (sung by Verity Wingate) to become part of that artistic world, at a time when fascism was already beginning to take hold in Italy \u2013 Sergei Diaghilev, Man Ray, Jacob Epstein and Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio all feature in the cast list. Jeths\u2019s score is mainstream conservative, his vocal writing largely declamatory, but it\u2019s a concise, dramatically taut piece, stylishly staged by Marcel Sijm. <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p> <p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/16/classical-music-opera-livestream-at-home-coronavirus\">Lockdown listening </a>\u2013 our regularly updated list of online operas and concerts; critics\u2019 daily picks <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/opera-and-classical-your-home-watching-guide-critics-picks\">week one</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/30/free-opera-and-classical-for-watching-at-home-our-critics-picks-week-two\">week two</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/06/opera-and-classical-concerts-to-watch-at-home--critics-picks-week-three\">week three</a>.</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Philharmonia/Klemperer: Beethoven\u2019s Ninth (June 1970) Otto Klemperer made his final public appearance at the Royal Festival Hall in London in 1971, but the previous year he had conducted a Beethoven symphony cycle there with the New Philharmonia (as it was then called), that concluded with two performances of the Ninth Symphony. It\u2019s a BBC recording of one of those, on 30 June that year, with the New Philharmonia Chorus and Teresa \u017bylis-Gara, Janet Baker, George Shirley and Theo Adam as the soloists, which is now being streamed on the Philharmonia\u2019s website. These days Klemperer\u2019s performances, especially from the tail-end of his career, tend to be characterised as thick-textured and predominantly slow, but this account of the Ninth at least partly belies that. His approach is, of course, thoroughly traditional, with larger forces than we\u2019re used to hearing in this work nowadays \u2013 Klemperer doubled up the woodwind parts, as Beethoven apparently specified for the work\u2019s premiere. And by today\u2019s standards too, the tempi are certainly on the slow side. But there isn\u2019t a moment when the performance seems to drag, while the textures often seem miraculously light \u2013 the scherzo positively dances. If the first movement is relatively routine it\u2019s a performance of gradually increasing power, and by the finale Klemperer\u2019s seemingly minimal gestures to the orchestra have conjured up something truly remarkable. Andrew Clements The Turn of the Screw (Opera North) \u201cInnocence, you have corrupted me,\u201d the Governess sings at a climactic moment in Britten\u2019s adaptation of Henry James\u2019s insidious ghost story. In Alessandro Talevi\u2019s Opera North staging, the boundaries between innocence and corruption constantly blur, throwing us continuously off balance, and few other productions have quite so consistently, or indeed so disturbingly, maintained the fundamental ambiguity as to whether the ghosts are genuine supernatural entities, or projections of the Governess\u2019s disordered mind. There are some splendidly sinister moments, as shadows behave independently of bodies, and the children become increasingly like the ghosts that may or may not possess them. And the final moments of Act I are genuinely marrow-freezing. Tensely conducted by Leo McFall, it\u2019s exceptionally well sung across the board. Sarah Tynan is outstanding as the tormented Governess, while Tim Gasiorek\u2019s tragic, chilling Miles is probably the best you will ever see. Tim Ashley Guillaume Tell (Rossini festival) Rossini\u2019s French grand opera Guillaume Tell (William Tell) pits the personal repeatedly against the political. Graham Vick\u2019s production for the 2013 Rossini festival in Pesaro revels in further, sometimes gnomic juxtapositions. Thus the Act II love duet sees tenor and soprano confessing adoration not only across enemy lines but also, bafflingly, amid a herd of life-sized model horses. But don\u2019t be put off: musically, this performance is superb, more than redeeming any frustrations with the staging. In the pit, rising star Michele Mariotti drives the excellent chorus and orchestra of the Teatro Comunale di Bologna with an unapologetically Italianate sense of momentum. Juan Diego Fl\u00f3rez is on top form as Swiss romantic hero Arnold, all earnest expressivity and clarion top notes, while Nicola Alaimo\u2019s Tell is both physically and vocally imposing. As Tell\u2019s son Jemmy, Amanda Forsythe is irresistible, her tone luminous. Leading the Habsburg occupiers (all dressed in pre-first world war Austro-Hungarian bling), Luca Tittoto\u2019s Gesler is deliciously thuggish. But the standout performance is Marina Rebeka\u2019s Mathilde: her voice rich with a steely edge and crystalline high notes, her stage presence intensely convincing even in closeup. Catch it free while you can. (Available until 7 July.) Flora Willson Un Ballo in Maschera (Metropolitan Opera, New York) Politics, affairs of the heart, betrayal: these are Verdi\u2019s essentials in a plot based on the 1792 assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden. It was politicking, too, that dictated the opera being set in different locations in slightly differing versions (confusion alert). In his debut production for New York\u2019s Metropolitan Opera, director David Alden opted for the Swedish setting, but with contemporary Scandi noir. Against the suitably stark and sleek design, references to paintings of the Fall of Icarus, Busby Berkeley films, fishermen in macs and sou\u2019westers straight off a Peter Grimes set, not to mention the contents of soothsayer Ulrika\u2019s shiny patent handbag, add notes of whimsy. The late lamented Dmitri Hvorostovsky is a main attraction, expressing both the violent urge of vengeance as well as the tenderness of regret, with the famous aria Eri Tu a great outpouring of emotion. Rian Evans Ritratto (Dutch National Opera) Opera Forward, Dutch National Opera\u2019s annual festival of music theatre, should have launched last month with the world premiere of Ritratto by Willem Jeths, who was the Netherlands\u2019s first \u201cnational composer\u201d between 2014 and 2016. This year\u2019s event was cancelled only days before the opening, but Ritratto\u2019s dress rehearsal had been filmed and is now available online. The portrait of the title is that of Luisa Casati, an Italian heiress who was the muse and model for a number of artists in the early decades of the 20th century. Jeths\u2019s opera depicts the efforts of Casati (sung by Verity Wingate) to become part of that artistic world, at a time when fascism was already beginning to take hold in Italy \u2013 Sergei Diaghilev, Man Ray, Jacob Epstein and Gabriele D\u2019Annunzio all feature in the cast list. Jeths\u2019s score is mainstream conservative, his vocal writing largely declamatory, but it\u2019s a concise, dramatically taut piece, stylishly staged by Marcel Sijm.

At least 20 phone masts across the UK are believed to have been set alight or vandalised since the start of the pandemic in connection to false 5G claims, according to government and industry sources, who said this month they were increasingly concerned about the impact of the baseless theories. Facebook has since stepped up efforts to stop far-right groups from promoting conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to 5G. Ofcom is assessing comments made by the conspiracist David Icke during an interview broadcast by the local television station London Live, in which he suggested that the coronavirus pandemic was part of a plot by governments to destroy the economy and conduct mass surveillance. The media watchdog previously ruled that a local radio station had breached its rules after one of its guests suggested the Covid-19 outbreak was caused by the rollout of 5G mobile technology.

The move comes as the government faces mounting criticism of its response to the pandemic, amid concerns that frontline health workers have not received sufficient protective equipment and that hospitals urgently require more ventilators. The funds will bolster the NHS and local authorities, the Treasury said, with the addition of \u00a39bn to the initial \u00a35bn fund Sunak announced one month ago. The chancellor said: \u201cOur public services and its incredible workers are working with immense resolve and skill to keep us safe. \u201cWe depend on them, which is why we are doing everything we can to provide our NHS, local authorities and others, with the resources and tools they need to tackle the virus. \u201cFrom the start, I\u2019ve been clear our vital public services will get whatever they need to protect this country and its people from coronavirus.\u201d The Treasury said the \u00a314.5bn funding package included \u00a36.6bn of support to health services, which would be specifically targeted towards freeing up hospital beds and delivering \u201curgent priorities including acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff\u201d.

It declined to reveal how much of the \u00a314.5bn would come from each source of funds, or what form the government borrowing might take, saying only that it would outline further details in the next budget. The provision of the extra resources for public services comes as fears grow about how Sunak will pay for the huge requirement for Covid-19 funding, with the chancellor reported to have told colleagues that the UK\u2019s economic output could fall by as much as 30% between April and June, as cabinet colleagues have called for restrictions to be eased. The Times reported on Monday that ministers said Sunak discussed the possibility of a \u201c25% to 30%\u201d fall in the second quarter of this year, while City analysts have forecast an average contraction of around 15% in the economy caused by the coronavirus lockdown, although some economists have predicted the drop could be as severe as 24%.

      "bodyText": "When thecoronavirus lockdown came into force, Jayne Maxwell was forced to close her sewing shop in Rotherham and furlough her staff. She was expecting a quiet few weeks, yet the seamstress is now busier than ever, as she coordinates a growing local team of volunteers making scrubs for NHS staff facing a nationwide shortage. \u201cWe\u2019re getting messages every day through Facebook with orders, and we\u2019ve done 30 pairs in a week but it was hard going,\u201d said Maxwell, the owner of From Rags to Stitches. \u201cI dare not advertise it or we wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the demand.\u201d Staff from Doncaster, Bassetlaw and Rotherham hospitals, as well as from local GP surgeries, have all put orders in. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling, but we\u2019re trying to keep up,\u201d she added. Scrubs, the plain clothes worn by medics when dealing with patients, are being used by an increasing number of NHS staff as part of their personal protective equipment and changed more frequently in order to stop the spread of Covid-19, so volunteer sewers around the country have come together to make up the shortfall. They are not only making scrubs in a range of sizes, but also scrub caps, scrub bags so the clothes can be transported and washed safely by staff at home, and headbands to alleviate the pressure of face masks. Some people, such as Sarah Featherstone, a teacher self-isolating in Sheffield, are adding personal touches such as \u201cthank you\u201d messages on the label. \u201cI think when you\u2019re isolating, it feels really good to know you\u2019re part of a big network of people and part of the bigger picture, actually working to help people on the frontline,\u201d she said. \u201cScrub hubs\u201d have popped up all over the country to coordinate sewers willing to offer their services, while the For the Love of Scrubs Facebook group has gained nearly 40,000 members. A group in south London, one of the areas worst hit by coronavirus, has raised nearly \u00a310,000 for materials, with people from all walks of life getting involved. \u201cWe\u2019ve got grandmothers working on vintage Singer sewing machines churning out scrub bags, some professionals, some competent costume designers and some novice sewers,\u201d said one of the group\u2019s coordinators, Elizabeth Price, who has recruited more than 100 volunteers in just over a week. A costume designer for The Lion King stage show has even helped connect them with a tailor. \u201cIs there a case of saying this really shouldn\u2019t be necessary? It\u2019s unprecedented circumstances and I think the procurement process perhaps isn\u2019t sufficiently nimble for the current situation,\u201d Price said. \u201cBut I\u2019m constantly welling up and humbled by people\u2019s loveliness,\u201d she added. \u201cFrom people dropping off quarantined fabric in a socially distanced way with a shy smile, to the top West End tailors, everyone is just desperate to do what they can to help.\u201d Denise Cleal is the wardrobe supervisor at the Barn Theatre in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. After finding herself at a loose end when the theatre was shut, she has instead turned her sewing machine skills to making scrubs at home. \u201cYou do feel quite under pressure because you know that a surgery is sitting there waiting for you to finish making them,\u201d said Cleal, who has been using spare material from the theatre wardrobe. \u201cIt\u2019s not like a hobby or \u2018Oh yeah, I think I\u2019ll do a bit now\u2019. I\u2019m working 10 hours a day. \u201cBut the sewing is a pleasure and to be able to put it to such a worthy cause is tremendous for me,\u201d she said. While some hospitals specify plain dark fabrics, others have said they are happy for the scrubs to be made from different coloured or patterned material, meaning the sewers can use fabric donations such as good quality, clean bedding. For Maxwell, making the scrubs is an important way of supporting her daughter Emma, a nurse sister at Rotherham hospital working on the frontline treating Covid-19 patients. \u201cIt takes my mind off where she is and what she\u2019s doing because obviously as a parent I worry when I see things on the TV,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m doing it because it\u2019s the right thing to do, not for a round of applause. \u201cThe business might not come through this, and if it doesn\u2019t then so be it \u2013 we\u2019re trying to save lives and that\u2019s what it\u2019s got to be about now.\u201d \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

      "body": "<p>I have lost something. I am in my house, and it has suddenly become huge. Every room opens on to another room into a chamber of unfamiliar spaces. I have misplaced my daughter and her baby. They are here somewhere, but I can\u2019t find them as I wander around forgetting what I am looking for.</p> <p>Upon waking, I note this Covid anxiety dream and text my children. The dream logic stays with me all day. Indeed I have misplaced them. We cannot be together. This is how life is now for most people. We comply to lockdown as rational beings, but the subconscious rebels. This is not all right.</p> <p>To be OK is to not have the virus \u2013 to complain about anything else feels self-indulgent, but this is a struggle. It is a struggle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">shot through with every pre-existing inequality</a>: the co-morbidities exacerbated by austerity; poor-quality high-density housing; basically a caste system whereby migrants work our land and clean up our various messes for less than the minimum wage. We did not need a pandemic to know this, did we? Anyone who has been near a hospital in the past 10 years will have seen how stretched it all is, as well as having witnessed immensely dedicated medical staff.</p> <p>There are political scores to be settled, always. The government\u2019s daily press briefings demonstrate the abject failure of lobby journalism. The wrong questions elicit not even answers, just mantras. The Berkeley professor Alexei Yurchak coined the term \u201chypernormalisation\u201d to describe the dying years of the Soviet system. Modern society was too complex and failing, so politicians created narratives that suggested the world was still simple and functional \u2013 they pretended that everything was normal \u2013 to hang on to power.</p> <p>So here we are pretending that this is a war to be waged and our resolve will beat this thing. The computation of loss cannot be measured on a graph. We attempt these computations daily. And fail. How do you imagine 10,000 deaths and how do you imagine more to come? How does one grieve this many people? How are we to suspend our lives waiting for more death, which we are told is inevitable?</p> <p>What is there to feel beyond powerlessness?</p> <p>As CS Lewis said, grief feels a lot like fear. For everyone who is cheerily spring cleaning their house, there are those of us who are paralysed, lethargic, unable to concentrate. As I have said before, the last thing we need in lockdown is more policing of emotion; we just need to get by.</p> <p>The atomised populace may well be angry at the ill-preparedness of our Tory leaders, but it is quite hard to know what to do with this anger day to day. The nearest experience of such mass loss for me was in the 80s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-aids-epidemic-san-francisco\">when Aids </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-aids-epidemic-san-francisco\">devastated an entire generation</a>. Then, I knew what to do. We organised, angry and defiant. We could still sit alongside the dying and their suffering.</p> <p>Now human touch is gone and student nurses are being taught how to help ease the distress of someone who cannot see their faces and who is drowning. Those who are shielded can also never be touched. As we stay in with our box sets and competitive crafting, I wonder a lot about the anticipation of grief.</p> <p>One grieves when someone is dying and yet when they do die, it\u2019s a shock, and the grieving begins again. The knowledge of what is going to happen doesn\u2019t lessen the intensity of what happens. Anticipatory grief is something that shrinks argue about. No one knows if it lessens the experience of grief, post-death.</p> <p>In this time of huge loss we might recognise what is happening. It is a trauma. \u201cTraumatic events are extraordinary not because they occur rarely, but rather because they overwhelm the ordinary adaptations to life,\u201d wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/03/susie-orbach-books-to-understand-yourself\">Judith Herman in her great book Trauma and Recovery</a>.</p> <p>This pandemic is a global trauma. It has happened and and it will continue. This is the emotional truth of it. The tutting at the investment people have in the death of celebrities or Boris Johnson\u2019s recovery seem to me very unforgiving. We cling to these narratives in order to negotiate mortality and vulnerability. There are other narratives available that are more finessed and caveated, though they all come with lectures that support whatever political positions someone had pre-virus.</p> <p>As politicians scrabble around, desperate to appear in control, it is clear they are not. All this is acted out in this limbo of expected loss. Peaks on a graph mean the loss comes nearer. The man who has mended my shoes for 20 years and his father have died. Someone who was always there no longer is.</p> <p>This is real. \u201cFlattening the curve\u201d does not talk of our lost connections. We are dislocated. Dissociation, numbness, agitation, exhaustion, blunted affect. I cycle through these feelings. I recognise them: the reactions to trauma. They are what they are.</p> <p>The official discourses of certainty and invulnerability have never looked more of a charade. We cannot mourn what we cannot acknowledge. We grieve for those who have gone as well as those who will go. The accommodation of loss on such a scale feels impossible to live with. But we are all living with it. Somehow.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have lost something. I am in my house, and it has suddenly become huge. Every room opens on to another room into a chamber of unfamiliar spaces. I have misplaced my daughter and her baby. They are here somewhere, but I can\u2019t find them as I wander around forgetting what I am looking for. Upon waking, I note this Covid anxiety dream and text my children. The dream logic stays with me all day. Indeed I have misplaced them. We cannot be together. This is how life is now for most people. We comply to lockdown as rational beings, but the subconscious rebels. This is not all right. To be OK is to not have the virus \u2013 to complain about anything else feels self-indulgent, but this is a struggle. It is a struggle shot through with every pre-existing inequality: the co-morbidities exacerbated by austerity; poor-quality high-density housing; basically a caste system whereby migrants work our land and clean up our various messes for less than the minimum wage. We did not need a pandemic to know this, did we? Anyone who has been near a hospital in the past 10 years will have seen how stretched it all is, as well as having witnessed immensely dedicated medical staff. There are political scores to be settled, always. The government\u2019s daily press briefings demonstrate the abject failure of lobby journalism. The wrong questions elicit not even answers, just mantras. The Berkeley professor Alexei Yurchak coined the term \u201chypernormalisation\u201d to describe the dying years of the Soviet system. Modern society was too complex and failing, so politicians created narratives that suggested the world was still simple and functional \u2013 they pretended that everything was normal \u2013 to hang on to power. So here we are pretending that this is a war to be waged and our resolve will beat this thing. The computation of loss cannot be measured on a graph. We attempt these computations daily. And fail. How do you imagine 10,000 deaths and how do you imagine more to come? How does one grieve this many people? How are we to suspend our lives waiting for more death, which we are told is inevitable? What is there to feel beyond powerlessness? As CS Lewis said, grief feels a lot like fear. For everyone who is cheerily spring cleaning their house, there are those of us who are paralysed, lethargic, unable to concentrate. As I have said before, the last thing we need in lockdown is more policing of emotion; we just need to get by. The atomised populace may well be angry at the ill-preparedness of our Tory leaders, but it is quite hard to know what to do with this anger day to day. The nearest experience of such mass loss for me was in the 80s, when Aids devastated an entire generation. Then, I knew what to do. We organised, angry and defiant. We could still sit alongside the dying and their suffering. Now human touch is gone and student nurses are being taught how to help ease the distress of someone who cannot see their faces and who is drowning. Those who are shielded can also never be touched. As we stay in with our box sets and competitive crafting, I wonder a lot about the anticipation of grief. One grieves when someone is dying and yet when they do die, it\u2019s a shock, and the grieving begins again. The knowledge of what is going to happen doesn\u2019t lessen the intensity of what happens. Anticipatory grief is something that shrinks argue about. No one knows if it lessens the experience of grief, post-death. In this time of huge loss we might recognise what is happening. It is a trauma. \u201cTraumatic events are extraordinary not because they occur rarely, but rather because they overwhelm the ordinary adaptations to life,\u201d wrote Judith Herman in her great book Trauma and Recovery. This pandemic is a global trauma. It has happened and and it will continue. This is the emotional truth of it. The tutting at the investment people have in the death of celebrities or Boris Johnson\u2019s recovery seem to me very unforgiving. We cling to these narratives in order to negotiate mortality and vulnerability. There are other narratives available that are more finessed and caveated, though they all come with lectures that support whatever political positions someone had pre-virus. As politicians scrabble around, desperate to appear in control, it is clear they are not. All this is acted out in this limbo of expected loss. Peaks on a graph mean the loss comes nearer. The man who has mended my shoes for 20 years and his father have died. Someone who was always there no longer is. This is real. \u201cFlattening the curve\u201d does not talk of our lost connections. We are dislocated. Dissociation, numbness, agitation, exhaustion, blunted affect. I cycle through these feelings. I recognise them: the reactions to trauma. They are what they are. The official discourses of certainty and invulnerability have never looked more of a charade. We cannot mourn what we cannot acknowledge. We grieve for those who have gone as well as those who will go. The accommodation of loss on such a scale feels impossible to live with. But we are all living with it. Somehow.",

      "bodyText": "A second wave of desert locusts is threatening east Africa with estimates that it will be 20 times worse then the plague that descended two months ago. The locusts present \u201can extremely alarming and unprecedented threat\u201d to food security and livelihoods, according to the UN. A swarm of just more than a third of a square mile can eat the same amount of food in one day as 35,000 people. This second invasion from breeding grounds in Somalia includes more young adults which are especially voracious eaters. In its latest locust watch update, the UN said the situation was \u201cextremely alarming\u201d as an increasing number of new swarms form in north and central Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia. Uganda reported two swarms arriving last week from neighbouring Kenya, further destabilising food security and the livelihoods of people in the east and north of the country. The insects follow spring rains, seeking emerging crops and other vegetation. Hellen Adoa, a minister at Uganda\u2019s agriculture department, said: \u201cThis is very active, destructive and we are worried it has come at the time of lockdown. We are a bit overwhelmed. \u201cThe moment they arrive in a place the first thing they do is to eat anything green. They have destroyed some fields of crops and vegetation,\u201d she said. Kenyan officials have said coronavirus crackdowns have slowed efforts to fight the infestation, as crossing borders has become harder and pesticide deliveries are held up. Aerial spraying is the only effective means of controlling locusts but there have been complaints that the pesticides are affecting livestock. In February, eight east African countries experienced the worst outbreak in 70 years, exacerbated by climate change and war in Yemen. The insects can travel about 90 miles a day and eat their own body weight in crops. \u201cHeavy rains in late March established favourable breeding conditions for yet another generation of locusts in the Horn of Africa. These will emerge as young swarms in June, just as many farmers start to harvest,\u201d said Antonio Querido of the UN\u2019s food and agriculture agency in Uganda. \u201cBy now, most farmers have planted the first season annual crops.

      "bodyText": "Former Chilean military agents convicted of serious human rights violations under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet could be freed by a controversial new ruling that seeks to halt the spread of the coronavirus among the country\u2019s prison population. An urgent bill proposed by the ministry of justice would release some 1,300 low-risk prisoners from overcrowded prisons to serve out their sentences securely under house arrest. The measure would apply to people convicted of lesser crimes who are elderly, pregnant, have children younger than two years of age, or are terminally ill \u2013 as long as they have already served at least half of their sentences. But 14 government senators have argued that should also apply to inmates at the infamous Punta Peuco prison \u2013 a comfortable facility housing about 70 inmates convicted of dictatorship-era human rights violations. \u201cFaced by a global pandemic that is costing thousands of lives, our government is making an unethical and opportunistic attempt to free convicted human rights criminals,\u201d said Lorena Pizarro, the spokeswoman for the Association for the Families of Disappeared Detainees. \u201cAlthough our organisation is in favour of releasing prisoners who meet these conditions serving sentences for lesser crimes, this is an unthinkable concession in this political climate.\u201d The proposed amendment has divided the ruling Chile Vamos coalition and prompted a fierce opposition backlash. According to a 2018 report by Chile\u2019s national human rights institute, the private cells in Punta Peuco are spacious and well-lit, each with a private bathroom, and inmates had access to satellite television, computers, tennis courts and shaded barbecue areas. This situation is very different from that of other prison facilities in the country, which are overcrowded and often lack basic provisions. Against a backdrop of unresolved social tensions after six months of protests, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, the president, provoked further outrage last week for saying that human rights offenders also deserved to die with dignity. A 1991 report by Chile\u2019s National Truth and Reconciliation Commission detailed 3,428 cases of forced disappearance, killing, torture and kidnapping under the 17-year dictatorship. The whereabouts of many of the \u201cdisappeared\u201d remain unknown, and many perpetrators have refused to reveal how bodies were disposed of. Some of the dictatorship\u2019s most infamous exponents have passed through Punta Peuco, including Manuel Contreras, the leader of the feared Dina secret police from 1973 until 1977, who died in 2015.

A Downing Street spokesman said on Monday the prime minister had spoken to the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, who is currently deputising for Johnson, over the weekend. \u201cThe prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> \n<p>For the moment, it seems, Johnson is heeding the advice of medics, family, friends and cabinet colleagues and concentrating on getting well. And Chequers, set at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, and 40 miles (65km) away from the hustle and bustle of the government base in Whitehall, is the perfect place to do so, with its views of fields of cattle and sheep. To aid his recuperation, he can swim gentle lengths in the heated indoor swimming pool housed in the orangery.</p> \n<p>While in Downing Street, the prime minster was confined in his sealed-off flat with his meals left at the door between Nos 10 and 11.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is beginning his journey of recovery at Chequers, where he is not working or receiving official papers in his red boxes, and has not had any telephone calls with the Queen. Instead, the prime minister is understood to be enjoying walking in the 600-hectare (1,500-acre) grounds of the 16th-century manor house in Buckinghamshire, wrapped up against a cool spring wind, and with his pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, and jack russell-cross terrier, Dilyn, at his side. He is expected to remain at Chequers, the official retreat of serving prime ministers since 1921, until his medical advisers believe he is well enough to return to Downing Street. It is believed doctors from St Thomas\u2019 hospital will keep in touch over the phone on a daily basis. For Johnson, Chequers offers a peaceful environment in which to recuperate following 10 days of self-isolation in his flat at 11 Downing Street after testing positive for coronavirus, and a week in St Thomas\u2019 including three nights in intensive care during which, he has said, \u201cthings could have gone either way\u201d. Having tested negative for Covid-19 on his hospital release on Easter Sunday, hewas reunited with Symonds, who also suffered symptoms of the virus. It is not yet known how involved he will be in day-to-day decision making. A Downing Street spokesman said on Monday the prime minister had spoken to the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, who is currently deputising for Johnson, over the weekend. \u201cThe prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work,\u201d the spokesman said. For the moment, it seems, Johnson is heeding the advice of medics, family, friends and cabinet colleagues and concentrating on getting well. And Chequers, set at the foot of the Chiltern Hills, and 40 miles (65km) away from the hustle and bustle of the government base in Whitehall, is the perfect place to do so, with its views of fields of cattle and sheep. To aid his recuperation, he can swim gentle lengths in the heated indoor swimming pool housed in the orangery. While in Downing Street, the prime minster was confined in his sealed-off flat with his meals left at the door between Nos 10 and 11. Chequers has its own kitchens, led by a head chef well used to providing formal dinners for a rich variety of VIPs including the Queen, world leaders such as the US president, Donald Trump, and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and celebrities including Sir Elton John, Bryan Adams and David Bowie. Carol Thatcher once likened Chequers to a \u201cboutique hotel, albeit with top-level security\u201d and the \u201cperfect weekend retreat\u201d in complete contrast to the Downing Street terrace. Her father, Denis, used to enjoy practising his chipping and putting on the vast lawn, while her mother, Margaret, did her prime ministerial work in the study. David Cameron once told the former French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande that it was \u201ca good place for thinking \u2013 away from London\u201d. Chequers was given to the nation in 1917 by Sir Arthur Lee, a Conservative minister and a director-general of food production during the first world war, and in Lloyd George became its first prime ministerial occupant in 1921. As set out in the Chequers Estate Act 1917, it was hoped to draw the sitting PM to \u201cspend two days a week in the high and pure air of the Chiltern Hills and woods\u201d.",

There have been 14.81 deaths per 100,000 people in the UK.\u201d Doyle went on to suggest that the difference in the way the pandemic is progressing in the two countries is that Ireland took stronger action sooner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902qVI1DnWA2cPC/\" data-alt=\"graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902qVI1DnWA2cPC/\">graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhile Boris [Johnson] was telling the British people to wash their hands, our taoiseach was closing the schools. While Cheltenham was going ahead, and over 250,000 people were gathering in what would have been a massive super-spreader event, Ireland had cancelled St Patrick\u2019s Day,\u201d she wrote, adding that watching British media was \u201clike living in bizarro-world\u201d compared with the messages on Irish TV news.</p> \n<p>In the UK, the government urged against socialising, mass gathering and non-essential travel <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-16-march-2020\">from 16 March</a> and went into full lockdown on 23 March.</p> \n<p>\u201cTechnically, the UK went into lockdown *before* Ireland; but that\u2019s not a fair comparison, as we were already operating our \u2018delay phase\u2019 from 12-27 March,\u201d Doyle wrote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/deaths-comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>She also noted that, at the time of her post, figures suggested Ireland had performed 8.69 tests per 1,000 people, while the UK had performed four tests per 1,000 people \u2013 with 269,598 people tested in total as of 11 April in the UK. </p> \n<p>Dr William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, said Doyle had made some good points, noting that he and many of his colleagues had been concerned about the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">early response to coronavirus</a>, but cautioned that it was still too early to draw definitive conclusions.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are early on in the pandemic and it will remain to be seen how this will all pan out. However, it is unquestionable that major events such as the Cheltenham festival were major opportunities for super-spreading to occur,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd the resulting surge can reasonably be expected to have been more severe than it would have been otherwise.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Prof Sheila Bird, a former programme leader at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, stressed there were many factors to consider when attempting to compare countries, including whether deaths were reported in the same way, and whether delays in reporting deaths had been taken into account.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThird,\u201d she said, \u201c[is] urbanisation versus rurality of the respective populations \u2013 83% urban for UK, 63% for Ireland.\u201d In other words, a greater proportion of people in the UK live in towns or cities, which may contribute to the spread of a disease.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-statistics-what-can-we-trust-and-what-should-we-ignore\">Coronavirus statistics: what can we trust and what should we ignore?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bird said it was also important to consider how well people adhered to social distancing and lockdowns in different countries, while age was also a factor: older people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-coronavirus-study-reveals-increased-risks-from-middle-age\">are known to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/new-coronavirus-study-reveals-increased-risks-from-middle-age\">be at greater risk of death</a> from Covid-19. In the UK, Bird noted, 18% of the population was aged 65 or older, compared with only 13% in Ireland.</p> \n<p>Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the UK might have had proportionately more cases, which would mean more deaths. While he accepted that the later implementation of social distancing measures in the UK might have contributed to the different outcomes, he said there were other factors to consider, including that the UK had a higher proportion of people from BAME communities \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/bame-groups-hit-harder-covid-19-than-white-people-uk\">who have been found to be at higher risk from coronavirus </a>\u2013 and that the UK was also more densely populated, had many areas of high poverty, and hospitals in London were stretched.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Keith Neal, an emeritus professor in epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, added that the UK probably encountered its first infections earlier.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe risk of introduction is related to the number of travellers coming back with an infection,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough Ireland may have the same number of international travellers per head of population, your risk of first introductions is related to the number of travellers. The UK is 13 times larger in population than Ireland and London is much more of an international centre and hub than Dublin.\u201d</p> \n<p>That, said Neal, could be significant: \u201cWith doubling times of every two to three days, even a later introduction of the first infections by a week can have a very large effect.\u201d </p> \n<p>Professor Samuel McConkey, an infectious disease expert at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences in Dublin, said it was premature to compare Ireland and the UK. \u201cI\u2019d reserve judgment on this for two or three years,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said Ireland\u2019s earlier adoption of restrictions, as well as London\u2019s population density, may partly explain greater mortality rates in the UK. \u201cWe closed restaurants, pubs, creches, schools weeks before the UK.

      "bodyText": "Comparing how the Covid-19 outbreak is playing out in Ireland and the UK is a complex task, researchers have said after a Twitter thread by a former historian on the issue went viral. Writer and researcher Dr Elaine Doyle penned a series of tweets comparing the situations in the UK and Ireland, noting that both countries had similar numbers of intensive care beds per 100,000 people before the crisis began. But, she wrote, \u201cas of Saturday 11 April, there have been 6.5 deaths per 100,000 people in Ireland. There have been 14.81 deaths per 100,000 people in the UK.\u201d Doyle went on to suggest that the difference in the way the pandemic is progressing in the two countries is that Ireland took stronger action sooner. \u201cWhile Boris [Johnson] was telling the British people to wash their hands, our taoiseach was closing the schools. While Cheltenham was going ahead, and over 250,000 people were gathering in what would have been a massive super-spreader event, Ireland had cancelled St Patrick\u2019s Day,\u201d she wrote, adding that watching British media was \u201clike living in bizarro-world\u201d compared with the messages on Irish TV news. In the UK, the government urged against socialising, mass gathering and non-essential travel from 16 March and went into full lockdown on 23 March. \u201cTechnically, the UK went into lockdown *before* Ireland; but that\u2019s not a fair comparison, as we were already operating our \u2018delay phase\u2019 from 12-27 March,\u201d Doyle wrote. She also noted that, at the time of her post, figures suggested Ireland had performed 8.69 tests per 1,000 people, while the UK had performed four tests per 1,000 people \u2013 with 269,598 people tested in total as of 11 April in the UK. Dr William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, said Doyle had made some good points, noting that he and many of his colleagues had been concerned about the UK\u2019s early response to coronavirus, but cautioned that it was still too early to draw definitive conclusions. \u201cWe are early on in the pandemic and it will remain to be seen how this will all pan out. However, it is unquestionable that major events such as the Cheltenham festival were major opportunities for super-spreading to occur,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cAnd the resulting surge can reasonably be expected to have been more severe than it would have been otherwise.\u201d But Prof Sheila Bird, a former programme leader at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, stressed there were many factors to consider when attempting to compare countries, including whether deaths were reported in the same way, and whether delays in reporting deaths had been taken into account. \u201cThird,\u201d she said, \u201c[is] urbanisation versus rurality of the respective populations \u2013 83% urban for UK, 63% for Ireland.\u201d In other words, a greater proportion of people in the UK live in towns or cities, which may contribute to the spread of a disease. Bird said it was also important to consider how well people adhered to social distancing and lockdowns in different countries, while age was also a factor: older people are known to be at greater risk of death from Covid-19. In the UK, Bird noted, 18% of the population was aged 65 or older, compared with only 13% in Ireland. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the UK might have had proportionately more cases, which would mean more deaths. While he accepted that the later implementation of social distancing measures in the UK might have contributed to the different outcomes, he said there were other factors to consider, including that the UK had a higher proportion of people from BAME communities \u2013 who have been found to be at higher risk from coronavirus \u2013 and that the UK was also more densely populated, had many areas of high poverty, and hospitals in London were stretched. Keith Neal, an emeritus professor in epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, added that the UK probably encountered its first infections earlier. \u201cThe risk of introduction is related to the number of travellers coming back with an infection,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough Ireland may have the same number of international travellers per head of population, your risk of first introductions is related to the number of travellers. The UK is 13 times larger in population than Ireland and London is much more of an international centre and hub than Dublin.\u201d That, said Neal, could be significant: \u201cWith doubling times of every two to three days, even a later introduction of the first infections by a week can have a very large effect.\u201d Professor Samuel McConkey, an infectious disease expert at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences in Dublin, said it was premature to compare Ireland and the UK. \u201cI\u2019d reserve judgment on this for two or three years,\u201d he said. He said Ireland\u2019s earlier adoption of restrictions, as well as London\u2019s population density, may partly explain greater mortality rates in the UK. \u201cWe closed restaurants, pubs, creches, schools weeks before the UK. We had quite significant political cohesion. We had our national leader tell us, \u2018folks this is really bad\u2019.\u201d Se\u00e1n L\u2019Estrange, a University College Dublin sociologist who has compared international testing figures, challenged Ireland\u2019s claim to be in the top tier. Ireland claimed to follow South Korea\u2019s model of \u201ctest, track, trace, isolate\u201d but was in fact \u201cuncomfortably close\u201d to countries most removed from the strategy, such as the UK, he said. \u201cThere are very clear differences between the ROI and UK responses.

Nearly all US adults said the spread of infectious disease is a threat to the country, but people who made less than $50,000 per year were 10 percentage points more concerned about the threat posed by infectious disease than those with higher incomes in a survey conducted in March. Americans with less than a college degree were nine percentage points more likely to be concerned than those who have a college degree or more education. The Covid-19 outbreak has laid bare inequality in the US, where there is no requirement for employers to provide paid sick leave and health insurance is not guaranteed to every citizen. The outbreak has caused more than 16 million people to lose their jobs in the past three weeks. Reports show that immigrant communities, black people and Americans with lower incomes are more vulnerable to the economic and health affects of Covid-19. In general, Americans ranked infectious disease as more of a threat than terrorism, cyber attacks and climate change in the survey which took place from 3 to 29 March, while Covid-19 outbreaks prompted states and cities to lockdown. Nearly every American is now under a stay-at-home order. About eight in 10 people (79%) said infectious disease is a major threat to the country, while 19% said it was a minor threat. Roughly 2% of people said the spread of infectious disease was not a threat. This is an increase from the same poll in 2016 when 60% said the spread of infectious disease was a major threat. Pew did not survey people about the issue in similar polls in the years between then and 2020. Concern about climate change has increased steadily in the past seven years, with six in 10 Americans saying it is a major threat.

Det Supt Gareth Williams, head of intelligence and covert policing at British Transport Police (BTP), told the Guardian the restrictions on public transport during the coronavirus lockdown had not resulted in a reduction in the number of mostly juvenile drug runners identified across the country. County lines involves gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool using children as young as 11 to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones in smaller towns and rural areas across the country. The National Crime Agency revealed this month that more than 3,000 unique \u201cdeal lines\u201d were identified in 2019, of which 800 to 1,100 were estimated to be active during any given month. That is a 50% increase on the 2,000 identified in 2018. Despite the drug runners being heavily dependent on the rail network, in the last week the BTP county lines taskforce has made 10 county lines arrests and seized two consignments of drugs, three lots of weapons and \u00a38,000 in cash. Among the arrests made since lockdown conditions were imposed on 23 March was that of a 16-year-old girl in Preston who was found to have a sizeable quantity of cash.

Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire police have said the lockdown measures made it easier to spot drug dealers in the community, with neighbours reporting large numbers of people visiting certain properties for short periods of time. Det Supt Mike Allen, of the force\u2019s serious organised crime unit, told the Nottingham Post: \u201cThese citizens used to be at work in the day and did not see what was going on in their community, but now they suspect. Drug dealers rely on hiding in plain sight, but because of lockdown these tactics do not work and pose a problem. They do not have that luxury any more.\u201d He added that officers had been redeployed from roles such as policing city centre streets over the weekend to help the department out, while quieter roads had given them the opportunity to catch more dealers attempting to transport drugs in and out of the county.",

Almost half of the deaths (280) were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus. The civil protection authority said the number of people who were currently infected had risen by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, a further sign that the curve there is flattening.</p> <h2>Confirmed global death toll passes 116,000</h2> <p>At least 1.8 million people have been infected and 116,098 have died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have been tracking official and media reports. The tallies are likely to be underestimates due to different testing regimes and suspected underreporting of figures.</p> <h2>UK hospital deaths top 11,000</h2> <p>A total of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958#block-5e946cc48f08db3109f21958\">11,329 patients have died</a> in UK hospitals after testing positive, the UK\u2019s Department of Health said, up by 717 from 10,612 in 24 hours.</p> <h2>Belgium records 303 new deaths</h2> <p>Belgian health authorities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7#block-5e943efb8f082dfd549d56d7\">reported 303 more deaths in 24 hours</a>, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,903. Its death toll is lower than those in other European countries and the US due to its smaller population, but proportionally, the outbreak is now more deadly than in Italy.</p> <h2>Singapore records biggest daily jump in infections</h2> <p>Health authorities in Singapore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b#block-5e9490218f081a236f19297b\">confirmed 386 more cases</a>, the city-state\u2019s biggest daily jump since the outbreak began there.

Confirmed global death toll passes 116,000 At least 1.8 million people have been infected and 116,098 have died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who have been tracking official and media reports. The tallies are likely to be underestimates due to different testing regimes and suspected underreporting of figures. UK hospital deaths top 11,000 A total of 11,329 patients have died in UK hospitals after testing positive, the UK\u2019s Department of Health said, up by 717 from 10,612 in 24 hours. Belgium records 303 new deaths Belgian health authorities reported 303 more deaths in 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,903. Its death toll is lower than those in other European countries and the US due to its smaller population, but proportionally, the outbreak is now more deadly than in Italy. Singapore records biggest daily jump in infections Health authorities in Singapore confirmed 386 more cases, the city-state\u2019s biggest daily jump since the outbreak began there. That takes its total to 2,918 cases. A large number of the new cases are linked to outbreaks in migrant workers\u2019 dormitories. German experts recommend easing of restrictions As time runs out on emergency measures to limit the outbreak in Germany, the country\u2019s National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina recommended a gradual relaxing of restrictions, as long as new infections stabilise and personal hygiene measures are maintained. WHO urges lockdown caution The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged caution over moves to lift some lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the behaviour of the virus and emphasised that case finding, testing and isolating were still crucial to controlling the outbreak. US nearing peak, expert says Robert Redfield, director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told NBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cWe are nearing the peak right now \u2026 You\u2019ll know when you\u2019re at the peak when the next day is actually less than the day before. We are stabilising right now.\u201d UK will not ease lockdown this week The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said it was \u201cstill far too early\u201d to change the advice, adding that the UK would be getting ahead of itself if ministers relaxed restrictions before medical experts advised them to. \u201cThere will come a time in the future where we can talk about relaxation or transition, but we are not there now,\u201d he said. Spain sees another fall in daily death toll Spain\u2019s overnight death toll fell by 102 to 517 in 24 hours, bringing the total to 17,489, the country\u2019s health ministry said, adding that it was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. Iran\u2019s death toll rises to 4,585, up by 111 The country\u2019s death toll rose to 4,585, with 111 deaths overnight, a health ministry official said, adding that the total number of infected cases had reached 73,303 in the most affected Middle Eastern country.",

But the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to accept that the government was behind schedule. He said that there were now 23 drive-through sites where people could be tested. \u201cNew capacity is coming on-stream all the time,\u201d he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The cabinet may not be involved in the decision on extending the lockdown, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman revealed.</strong> Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow. With Boris Johnson recovering at Chequers after his spell in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is deputising in his absence. <strong>The government has to take a decision about extending the lockdown by Thursday, which is when the regulations covering England need to be reviewed.</strong> The spokesman did not say exactly how or when this would be taken, but he said the main work coordinating the government\u2019s response to coronavirus was being taken by the morning No 10 meeting, which is chaired by Raab, and by the four coronavirus ministerial groups. The spokesman said that any decision to extend the lockdown would have to be reviewed again after three weeks. It is thought inevitable that the lockdown will be extended, and the spokesman told journalists that when the decision is formally announced, the government would \u201cset out the reasoning behind the decision as soon as it is taken\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson is not doing any government work in Chequers, the spokesman said.</strong> He told journalists: \u201cThe prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work.\u201d And the PM is not receiving red boxes containing government papers at the moment, the spokesman said. The spokesman said he did not receive any while he was in hospital. A briefing early last week suggesting that he would be getting red boxes turned out to be wrong, the spokesman said, because the PM\u2019s condition deteriorated.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman denied claims that No 10 had given misleading accounts of how ill the prime minister was.</strong> It was put to the spokesman that the PM\u2019s own account yesterday of how he might have died contrasted with reports that he was only admitted to hospital as a precaution and that he was \u201cin good spirits\u201d throughout his time there. The spokesman said all the information given to journalists \u201cwas provided by St Thomas\u2019 Hospital\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman defended the decision to test Michael Gove\u2019s daughter for coronavirus. </strong>After she developed coronavirus symptoms Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said he would be self-isolating with her and the rest of his family at home, in line with government guidelines, but today it emerged that Gove is no longer self-isolating because his daughter tested negative. The spokesman said this was done on the advice of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, because Gove is one of the figures leading the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. Asked why he could not work from home, the spokesman said Gove chairs one of the key ministerial groups dealing with coronavirus (the one covering the public sector as a whole) and it was \u201cbeneficial\u201d for him to be able to go into the office.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li>The spokesman said that the Department for Health and Social Care was committed to carrying out a full investigation into the death of every NHS worker from coronavirus.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T13:48:34.292Z\">at 2.48pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e945be38f081a236f192723\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:34:39.280Z\">1.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson described how ill Boris Johnson was during his stay in hospital:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As we set out, his condition did worsen over the course of last Monday afternoon and he had to be moved to the intensive care unit.</p> \n   <p>Now, clearly, if a person is moved to intensive care, that means that they are requiring a significant level of specialist treatment.</p> \n   <p>So, I think it was clear from the moment the prime minister was moved to intensive care that his condition had worsened.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:51:58.503Z\">at 1.51pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e94592d8f08db3109f21889\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/gregory-robinson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T12:22:36.736Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good afternoon.

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Prisoners were refused breakfasts, soap and cleaning materials during the current lockdown in jails, after they failed to register their requests on to a computer system, the Guardian has learned.</p> \n  <p>The sanctions were lifted after a lawyer wrote to the justice secretary saying cleanliness in these times is an \u201cissue of life or death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Last Monday, four prisoners at HMP Ashfield near Bristol, privately operated by Serco, were told they would not receive their breakfast packs for two weeks because they had failed to register their orders before the cut-off period.</p> \n  <p>During the current Covid-19 lockdown in all prisons, soap and cell-cleaning materials have been included in the packs at Ashfield.</p> \n  <p>When normal regimes are operating in prisons, inmates have extended association periods, in which they can shower, phone families and friends, and use computer terminals to book visits and medical appointments.</p> \n  <p>But with prisons in lockdown mode, inmates have only a short time in which to shower and make applications, including ordering meals on a dedicated computer terminal, which some prisoners find difficult to operate.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday, the barrister Paul Omar wrote to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, saying the reduction of the men\u2019s food allowance contravened prison rules. </p> \n  <p>The letter, seen by the Guardian, states that, \u201cwere the issue only food, it would be grave enough but given the packs contain personal hygiene and cleaning materials, this aggravates the matter, given the ongoing pandemic, when cleanliness is an issue of life or death.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The letter concludes: \u201cFor such a restriction to remain in place in this period, aggravating, as is does, issues of health and hygiene, is clearly unlawful.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Martin Booth, Serco\u2019s director at Ashfield, said: \u201cIt is a long standing practice that prisoners order their breakfasts from the terminals on the wings.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>\u201cIf for any reason a prisoner has failed to do so, they can make a request and a replacement pack will be provided, as was done in the case in question.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T07:55:04.826Z\">at 8.55am BST</time></p>

transporting personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing masks for frontline health workers to ensure they fit properly before use. </p> \n  <p>Firefighters have already agreed to drive

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The supply of clinical gowns in some NHS hospitals is \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d according to Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, which represents hospital trusts. </p> \n  <p>He said there are some concerns about a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in certain hospitals. </p> \n  <p>He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThere is a range of personal protective equipment that needs to be delivered at the front line ... nearly all of that material is flowing in the way that trusts would like. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe bit where there\u2019s a particular problem was gowns, where we know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. </p> \n  <p>\u201cNo trust, as far as I\u2019m aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very very low.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d. </p> \n  <p>He said the NHS ordered \u201ca whole load of stock\u201d weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the product sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. </p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cIf everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hopson said those trusts with a surplus were being asked to share their supplies with neighbouring trusts, while alternative gowns were being sourced from elsewhere. </p> \n  <p>Emergency supplies had also been delivered to those most in demand, Hopson said.

Boris Johnson praised the NHS for saving his life as he was discharged from hospital. </p> \n  <p>A New Zealand nurse who was praised by the prime minister for her care has been \u201cblown away\u201d by the recognition, her brother said. </p> \n  <p>Boris Johnson used a video post on Sunday to mention by name the medics who had looked after him, particularly \u201ctwo nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Johnson said the \u201cNHS has saved my life, no question\u201d after spending seven nights in St Thomas\u2019 in central London after contracting Covid-19 and was discharged at the weekend. </p> \n  <p>One of nurses mentioned by Johnson, Jenny from Invercargill on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, has been identified as Jenny McGee. </p> \n  <p>Her brother Rob told the New Zealand Herald the family had spoken with McGee just as she was \u201cabout to head off to do another night shift\u201d. </p> \n  <p>He told the paper: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris - but what she has been doing helping everyday people. </p> \n   <p>Whilst she is blown away by Boris\u2019s recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing - that made her really proud.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McGee attended the Verdon College in Invercargill, and they said the community was \u201cso proud\u201d and that she had wanted to be a nurse since leaving in 2002. <br></p> \n  <p>The school said: \u201cJenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThanks Jenny for your courage, outstanding work and the example you have provided for everyone at this difficult time. Your old school community is so proud of you!\u201d </p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the mayor of the city, Sir Tim Shadbolt, told Stuff.co.nz: \u201cIt\u2019s not very often a nurse from Invercargill saves the life of the British prime minister.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The other nurse mentioned by Johnson - Luis, from near Porto in Portugal - has been named as Luis Pitarma and has been thanked by Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. </p> \n  <p>A statement on the presidential website said: \u201cPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has already personally thanked the nurse Luis Pitarma, and ... also thanks the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who in Portugal and around the world are providing decisive help in the fight to the pandemic.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The statement added that the president offered \u201cencouragement that is also addressed to professionals of other nationalities who, reinforcing the National Health Service, provide an invaluable service to Portugal\u201d. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T07:13:17.139Z\">at 8.13am BST</time></p> \n</div>",

I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to reply to you all. Here\u2019s a roundup of what has happened today: The UK coronavirus death toll has risen to 11,329 as a further 717 patients died after testing positive, the Department of Health and Social Care has announced. A review of lockdown measures will take place later this week but Dominic Raab made clear it was too early for the advice to change. The foreign secretary also said the UK had \u201cnot yet passed the peak\u201d of the crisis. Nearly 200 members of the armed forces are being loaned to NHS ambulance services to support their work during the pandemic. Boris Johnson is not doing any government work in Chequers, his spokesman has said. He is \u201cfocusing on recovery\u201d. More than \u00a314bn from the coronavirus emergency response fund will go to public services, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has confirmed. The Nightingale hospital in Manchester is ready to take its first patients after being built within 14 days. The global live blog will continue if you would like to follow it: It has been three weeks since Boris Johnson told the country it was going into lockdown. The measures, the prime minister said, would be reviewed in three weeks time, and are due to be discussed this Thursday. One of the main takeaways from today\u2019s daily briefing is that it is highly unlikely the measures will be relaxed, with Dominic Raab saying \u201cit is still far too early\u201d to change the advice. He added: We are doing a lot of work in government to be guided by the science and the medical advice that you get and I think that, until you have got that evidence, we will be getting ahead of ourselves. There will come a time in the future where we can talk about relaxation or transition but we are not there now. At the daily briefing, Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give frontline staff reassurance over personal protective equipment (PPE). It comes amid renewed concern over a shortage of some supplies in parts of the country. He said: We understand the importance of getting PPE to the front line whether it\u2019s in care homes or the NHS. I think the strongest practical reassurance they will want and that we can give them is that over the bank holiday weekend over 16 million items were delivered and we are straining every sinew to roll them out even further and even faster. Northern Ireland has recorded another six coronavirus hospital deaths, PA Media reports. The overall toll has risen to 124. A total of 76 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed since Sunday, the Public Health Agency said. Doctors have again expressed concerns about lack of personal protective equipment. The Sinn F\u00e9in MP Paul Maskey said at least four deaths involved coronavirus at a west Belfast care home, Our Lady\u2019s Care Home in Beechmount. He said: There is an urgent need to ramp up testing in the community, particularly in care homes where clusters have been proven to be fatal for residents. A lack of testing means the possibility that the true scale of the crisis here is unknown. It is understood infection control measures have been put in place at the care home. Police stepped up their patrols at coastal beauty spots over the weekend and said the majority of people complied with restrictions designed to limit spread of the virus. More than 100 coronavirus-related fines have been issued in three days in Northern Ireland, the PSNI said. Officers broke up barbecues and a small number of large house parties, assistant chief constable Alan Todd said. Some parents were also believed to have left their children to play at friends\u2019 houses. Todd told the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Ulster programme: \u201cWe engage with people, it is only when people won\u2019t take the encouragement we end up having to enforce the matter.\u201d A total of 107 fines were imposed in three days over the Easter period by police patrols. Chris Whitty said he would like to see coronavirus testing increased in care homes. Asked if deaths were recorded properly in such settings, he said: \u201cEverybody who sadly dies, the doctor will make an assessment based on her or his view about what the cause of death is, that\u2019s what the death certificate says in all cases.\u201d He added: Doctors take it very seriously and try to make sure that they get as much information to give accurate data. One of the things we want to do is to extend the amount of testing of people in care homes as the ability to test ramps up over the next few weeks. Because clearly care homes are one of the areas where there are large numbers of vulnerable people and that is an area of risk and therefore we would very much ... like to have much more extensive testing. Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said he expects the death toll to increase this week before \u201cplateauing\u201d. On the number of hospital deaths of Covid-19, he said the UK is tracking behind Italy and \u201cfollowing the same sort of path\u201d. He added: I think this week we are going to see a further increase, thereafter we should see a plateau as the effects of social-distancing come through. That plateau may last for some time and begin to decrease. He said the number of people in hospital beds with Covid-19 is beginning to \u201cflatten off\u201d in many parts of the country. He said it is expected to continue to flatten and decrease as the effects of social-distancing \u201creally feed through into the illness we are seeing in hospital\u201d. Commenting on accusations the government lacks an exit strategy, Dominic Raab said: It\u2019s absolutely crucially important that we do not take our eye off the ball or the public\u2019s focus on the thing that has been a success so far in relative terms, which is our ability through widespread support for our social distancing measures to deprive this virus of the means to spread. Opening the daily press briefing, Dominic Raab said the government was united in its \u201cnational mission\u201d to defeat coronavirus. Raab also paid tribute to members of the public who followed government advice. He said: At the end of last week, we were concerned that people might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine. In fact the overwhelming majority of people stayed at home and understood the importance of doing so. By staying home this weekend, you\u2019ve saved lives. Thank you, your efforts are making all the difference. And please keep them up - we\u2019ve come too far, we\u2019ve lost too many loved ones and we\u2019ve sacrificed too much to ease up now. The daily briefing is now taking place and you can watch it above. In his opening speech, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has said there are some \u201cpositive signs\u201d from the data that show \u201cwe are starting to win this struggle\u201d but warned: \u201cWe are still not past the peak.\u201d He added: \u201cOur plan is working. Please stick with it and we\u2019ll get through this crisis together.\u201d An internal memo from Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust on Saturday alerted staff to the current shortages of PPE gowns and listed procedures where aprons could be worn. Under the heading \u2018What\u2019s New Today\u2019 the trust states: \u201cThere is a low supply of fluid-repellent long sleeved gowns nationally which is beginning to affect us.\u201d It confirms current guidance that some procedures can be carried out with plastic aprons only. But some frontline healthcare workers have complained that wearing aprons instead of gowns places them at risk and that nobody treating coronavirus patients should be so poorly protected. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what ward we are working on, whether we\u2019re in ITU or on another ward treating Covid patients we are all at risk,\u201d said one nurse. The nurse continued: Patients cough and spit in our faces all the time. Wearing the same kind of aprons we\u2019ve been wearing for years leaving our arms and other parts of us exposed does not protect us against the virus. We are told full PPE is only for \u2018aerosol-generating areas\u2019 but all healthcare workers are exposed to the risk of aerosol-generating Covid. I have resigned myself to getting the virus because I\u2019m not adequately protected. It is difficult enough looking after Covid patients without worrying about getting infected ourselves. We say that the ITU is \u2018close to heaven\u2019 because so many people die there. According toChinese authorities, although 1,500 healthcare workers were infected from the start of the outbreak in December, of the 42,600 healthcare staff who arrived from other parts of China to treat patients with the virus from late January until early March, none were infected because they were provided with much higher levels of PPE than the local staff fighting the outbreak in the early days were given. An Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust spokesperson said: We follow national guidance from Public Health England. On 10 April, PHE issued guidance \u2013 which was the focus of our email to staff \u2013 that it is safe to use coveralls as an alternative to long-sleeved gowns, when used in line with existing guidance. As well as telling staff about this small change, we reminded everyone that PHE advise long sleeved, fluid resistant gowns or coveralls are required only for certain types of procedures \u2013 known as aerosol generating procedures. For all other types of patient care that require staff to be within two metres of a patient, plastic aprons (along with gloves and surgical masks) are required. We will clarify this with our staff again today. The Prince of Wales has praised the work of British Sikhs during the Covid-19 crisis as the lockdown forces the community to celebrate the religious festival of Vaisakhi at home. Vaisakhi commemorates the creation in 1699 of the Khalsa, the collective body of initiated Sikhs, by Guru Gobind Singh. Marked on 13 April this year, celebrations in London\u2019s Trafalgar Square later this month have been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking in a video posted to Twitter, the Prince of Wales offered his sympathies with families and friends unable to celebrate the festival together. Charles hailed the \u201cvital role\u201d that Sikhs were playing on the \u201cfront line\u201d of the crisis. \u201cWhether in our hospitals or in other key roles; or through the remarkable work that is being done by gurdwaras to support local communities and the most vulnerable,\u201d he added. He also highlighted the \u201cheart-warming reports\u201d of other faith groups working together to share resources and offer \u201csupport and friendship\u201d. About half of all Covid-19 deaths appear to be happening in care homes in some European countries, according to early figures gathered by UK-based academics who are warning that the same effort must be put into fighting the virus in care homes as in the NHS. Snapshot data from varying official sources shows that in Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium between 42% and 57% of deaths from the virus have been happening in homes, according to the report by academics based at the London School of Economics (LSE). Published official data for care homes in England and Wales are believed to significantly underestimate deaths in the sector, with the Office for National Statistics only recording 20 coronavirus-related deaths in all care homes in the week ending 27 March. New figures are due out on Tuesday, but are unlikely to be up to date. Last week the industry body Care England told the Guardian the total figure was probably approaching 1,000, with deaths reaching into double figures at numerous homes. Over the weekend details of more deaths emerged, including 13 residents who have died at the 71-capacity Stanley Park care home in County Durham, and there have reportedly been five deaths at Almond Court in Glasgow. Read the full article here: Here\u2019s a clip of Scotland\u2019s interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith urging families of those who have died during the outbreak not to delay funerals. The tough restrictions enforced in Wales amid the coronavirus pandemic are working as the country braces itself for its fourth week in lockdown, the first minister of Wales has said. Mark Drakeford spoke out as Public Health Wales revealed the number of people who have died after contracting Covid-19 rose by 15 to 384, as a total of 5,610 have now tested positive for the virus. He said that the benefit of the public staying at home over the Easter bank holiday weekend and sticking to the strict social distancing guidelines would be seen in the weeks to come. He said: Thanks to everyone who\u2019s staying home. I know this is hard. For some people it\u2019s even tougher. Thank you for sticking to the rules, there are signs this is working. Our actions and decisions over the Easter break and weeks to come will have an impact. Last week Drakeford had warned the restrictions could get worse if people flouted social distancing rules. It comes after a weekend when two further NHS staff in Wales died after testing positive for the virus. Donna Campbell worked at the Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff as a healthcare support worker while Gareth Roberts was a nurse at the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. In other developments, former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has spoken of developing coronavirus-like symptoms, describing it as a \u201cblur\u201d. Wood said it neither she or her partner knew for certain whether they had coronavirus or not. \u201cIt looks like it\u2019ll be some time before tests are available to be able to know, which is a shame because if we have had it and are now immune, we could potentially be useful,\u201d she said. She said her 14-day quarantine period was up on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been a scary time, and I\u2019m sure there are plenty of others who have gone through similar and I know much worse in recent weeks.\u201d I\u2019ve had a few emails and messages about the number of tests in the tweet below. The reason the number of tests is higher than the number of people tested is that some people are tested more than once. One explanation is that patients who have recovered are tested again. Earlier we learned that Boris Johnson received a second coronavirus test when he was ready to be discharged from hospital. His spokesperson said this was standard practice. A nurse has died after contracting Covid-19 in London. Melujean Ballesteros, 60, originally from the Philippines, died at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington, London, on Sunday, two days after being admitted. Ballesteros is survived by her two sons, Rainier and Bryan, who live in the Philippines, and her husband, Luis, who lives in the UK. Her colleagues and friends have been raising money for her funeral on GoFundMe. Faz Ghooloo, who set the fund up, said she would be remembered for \u201cher cheese cake, her food, her smile, her generosity, her hard work, her kindness, her humbleness, her tenacity, her support and many other countless talents that she had\u201d. Rainier, who lives in Calauag in the Philippines, said his mother had a fever and cough in mid-March and self-isolated for nine days. But on Friday, Rainier said the family convinced her to visit the hospital due to her worsening condition, and so she was picked up by an ambulance and admitted. She died two days later. Speaking to PA Media, Rainier, 37, said: \u201cMy mum is a dedicated and very caring nurse. She started her career in the UK in 2003, she loved her work as a nurse.\u201d The news follows the deaths of two Filipino porters from John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford, Oscar King Jr and Elbert Rico, who died on Saturday. Leilani Dayrit, a Filipino nurse who worked at St Cross hospital in Rugby, died on 7 April. A Commons library report published last year found more than 18,000 Filipinos work in the NHS, third only to the numbers from Britain and India. The Philippine ambassador to the UK, Antonio Lagdameo, said: Filipino health workers have served tirelessly and courageously at the frontlines of the war against this pandemic, and their contribution to the ongoing effort to save lives is nothing but immense. The escalation of confirmed Covid-19 cases and Covid-19-related deaths point out the undeniable truth that this disease is an existential threat even to the most healthy and fit among us. The Nightingale hospital in Manchester is ready to take its first patients after being built within 14 days. NHS Nightingale Hospital North West is equipped to receive up to 750 coronavirus patients from across the region who do not need intensive care but still require treatment. Construction started on Saturday 28 March, with the entire main central hall of the former Manchester Central railway station, 10,000 square metres in total, designated as bed space. It will be staffed by consultants, junior doctors, nurses, healthcare support workers, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, social workers, and a huge range of non-clinical support workers and administrators. Michael McCourt, the chief executive of the temporary hospital in Manchester Central Convention Complex, wrote on Twitter: \u201cProud &amp; thankful to be able to say we take our first patients today. A spokesman for NHS England confirmed the hospital is ready to take patients but could not say when the first patients are likely to be admitted. The facility is one of seven Nightingale hospitals being built around the country. Temporary hospitals in Bristol, Harrogate, Wearside and Exeter are also being built. A temporary mortuary has also been opened in Greater Manchester as part of the contingency planning for the coronavirus outbreak. The facility, in Trafford Park, will be staffed by specially trained Greater Manchester Police officers and staff. The UK coronavirus death toll has risen to more than 11,000 as a further 717 patients died after testing positive, the Department of Health and Social Care has announced. There have been 667 new deaths recorded of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 10,261, NHS England has announced. Of the 667 new deaths announced today, 118 occurred on April 12 while 537 took place between 1 April and 11 April, PA Media reports. The remaining 12 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 26 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including new deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem tests to be processed, and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show that April 8 currently has the highest total for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day \u2013 737 \u2013 although this could change in future updates. Hi, this is Nicola Slawson in sunny Shropshire, UK. I\u2019m taking back the reins of the liveblog now. As before, please do share any thoughts, insight or news tips with me via any of the channels below. I might not have time to respond to all of you but I will certainly try and read them. Thank you. Twitter: @nicola_slawson Instagram: @nicola_slawson Email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com Public Health Wales said a further 313 people had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 5,610. Dr Robin Howe, from Public Health Wales, said: Fifteen further deaths have been reported to us of people who had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the number of deaths in Wales to 384. We offer our condolences to families and friends affected, and we ask those reporting on the situation to respect patient confidentiality.\u201d The This Morning co-host Eamonn Holmes has been criticised and branded \u201cirresponsible\u201d for comments he made on 5G and coronavirus. He spoke out on the ITV show after the presenter Alice Beer branded the conspiracy theories which link them as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cincredibly stupid\u201d. Holmes, who was co-presenting with his wife, Ruth Langsford, responded that \u201cit\u2019s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative\u201d. He added: I totally agree with everything you are saying but what I don\u2019t accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don\u2019t know it\u2019s not true. No one should attack or damage or do anything like that but it\u2019s very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative. That\u2019s all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind.\u201d Holmes made the remarks after scientists dismissed any link, calling it a \u201cphysical and biological impossibility\u201d and branding \u201cconspiracy theorists ... a public health danger\u201d. Here are the top lines from the lobby briefing today: Downing Street has said the number of tests being carried out for coronavirus is running at 18,000 a day. That is well short of the target of 100,000 tests a day set by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, for the end of the month, and short of the 25,000-a-day target that Boris Johnson said he hoped to achieve within a month on 18 March. But the prime minister\u2019s spokesman refused to accept that the government was behind schedule. He said that there were now 23 drive-through sites where people could be tested. \u201cNew capacity is coming on-stream all the time,\u201d he said. The cabinet may not be involved in the decision on extending the lockdown, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman revealed. Although it normally meets on a Tuesday, no meeting has been scheduled for tomorrow. With Boris Johnson recovering at Chequers after his spell in intensive care, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, is deputising in his absence. The government has to take a decision about extending the lockdown by Thursday, which is when the regulations covering England need to be reviewed. The spokesman did not say exactly how or when this would be taken, but he said the main work coordinating the government\u2019s response to coronavirus was being taken by the morning No 10 meeting, which is chaired by Raab, and by the four coronavirus ministerial groups. The spokesman said that any decision to extend the lockdown would have to be reviewed again after three weeks. It is thought inevitable that the lockdown will be extended, and the spokesman told journalists that when the decision is formally announced, the government would \u201cset out the reasoning behind the decision as soon as it is taken\u201d. Johnson is not doing any government work in Chequers, the spokesman said. He told journalists: \u201cThe prime minister is focusing on his recovery and he is not currently carrying out government work.\u201d And the PM is not receiving red boxes containing government papers at the moment, the spokesman said. The spokesman said he did not receive any while he was in hospital. A briefing early last week suggesting that he would be getting red boxes turned out to be wrong, the spokesman said, because the PM\u2019s condition deteriorated. The spokesman denied claims that No 10 had given misleading accounts of how ill the prime minister was. It was put to the spokesman that the PM\u2019s own account yesterday of how he might have died contrasted with reports that he was only admitted to hospital as a precaution and that he was \u201cin good spirits\u201d throughout his time there. The spokesman said all the information given to journalists \u201cwas provided by St Thomas\u2019 Hospital\u201d. The spokesman defended the decision to test Michael Gove\u2019s daughter for coronavirus. After she developed coronavirus symptoms Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said he would be self-isolating with her and the rest of his family at home, in line with government guidelines, but today it emerged that Gove is no longer self-isolating because his daughter tested negative. The spokesman said this was done on the advice of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, because Gove is one of the figures leading the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. Asked why he could not work from home, the spokesman said Gove chairs one of the key ministerial groups dealing with coronavirus (the one covering the public sector as a whole) and it was \u201cbeneficial\u201d for him to be able to go into the office. The spokesman said that the Department for Health and Social Care was committed to carrying out a full investigation into the death of every NHS worker from coronavirus. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson described how ill Boris Johnson was during his stay in hospital: As we set out, his condition did worsen over the course of last Monday afternoon and he had to be moved to the intensive care unit. Now, clearly, if a person is moved to intensive care, that means that they are requiring a significant level of specialist treatment. So, I think it was clear from the moment the prime minister was moved to intensive care that his condition had worsened.\u201d Good afternoon. I\u2019m Gregory Robinson, taking over the UK live blog for the next hour. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter to share insight or send tips, I\u2019m on @Gregoryjourno or send me an email at gregory.robinson@guardian.co.uk The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said that Boris Johnson tested negative for Covid-19 on leaving hospital. Asked about the prime minister being tested before he left hospital, Johnson\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cI\u2019m told it is standard practice in hospital to do that. And the results came back negative.\u201d Scotland\u2019s interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith has urged families of those who have died during the outbreak not to delay funerals, in a bid to stop a backlog. He said: The sector can cope if everyone understands and appreciates the circumstances that we find ourselves in and continues to arrange a funeral for loved ones as normal, and I do stress, without delay. At this time, it\u2019s very important that people do not delay funerals of their loved ones. It\u2019s important that people are able to grieve the passing of a loved one, but delaying the funeral in anticipation of social distancing measures being lifted could increase strain on funeral and mortuary services responding to coronavirus. Nicola Sturgeon has said that \u00a317m of a \u00a350m fund has been earmarked for charities supporting people through the crisis. The first minister said that \u00a310m of that had been allocated for \u201cimmediate priorities\u201d and the further \u00a37m would be handed out in small grants to around 2,000 charities. She added: \u201cWe know that third sector organisations are playing a vital part in protecting people\u2019s welfare and wellbeing during this crisis. \u201cWe want to do everything we can do to support them.\u201d The remaining \u00a333m is open to bids from charities, Sturgeon said as she encouraged third sector groups to apply. She also announced a new helpline to support people who are vulnerable but not in one of the shielded groups. The helpline, which will open on Tuesday, is intended for those who are elderly, pregnant, in need of mental health support or in receipt of the flu jab. The first minister said: \u201cIf you are in one of these groups and are not already receiving shielded support, this free helpline is open to you. \u201cThe number is 0800 111 4000.\u201d The helpline is intended to help those in the groups outlined by the first minister who do not have the family or community support to help them. Scotland\u2019s first minister has said she wants to give an assurance to those concerned about the number of cases in care homes that the government is working with the Care Inspectorate to take action. Nicola Sturgeon said: I want to give a very strong assurance firstly, that we\u2019re working hard with the Care Inspectorate to provide appropriate support to care homes, their staff and their residents. Secondly, we\u2019re working hard to ensure that we can publish full and robust information about numbers of cases in care homes, which we hope to do later this week. Nicola Sturgeon started her daily coronavirus briefing by thanking the people of Scotland who respected government guidelines over the Easter weekend. However, the first minister added that an upcoming review of the measures was unlikely to see them lifted. She added: \u201cWe must stick with it.\u201d A total of 575 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by nine from 566 on Sunday, Nicola Sturgeon said at the start of her daily briefing. The Scottish first minister said 6,067 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 155 from 5,912 the day before. She cautioned however that some health boards have not reported positive case figures yet, and that death figures are often lower after the weekend. There are 211 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 10 on Sunday, she added. And 1,797 people are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. My colleague Sarah Johnson would like to speak to paramedics about their work. Drop her an email if that\u2019s what you do and you want to talk. Her email is sarah.johnson@theguardian.com. The UK\u2019s fire services are at risk of being put on a \u201cdangerous knife-edge\u201d as the coronavirus pandemic forces almost 3,000 workers to self-isolate, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has warned. General secretary Matt Wrack said that while crews were currently maintaining services, this would become \u201cincreasingly difficult\u201d as the virus spreads. According to the FBU, the number of staff unable to work represents 5.1% of the sector\u2019s overall personnel of 58,426. This includes just under 2,600 operational firefighters and control room staff self-isolating, out of a total of 48,295. The union is calling for the government to roll out testing to allow those who do not have coronavirus to return to work. Wrack said: Currently, crews are maintaining services, but this will become increasingly difficult as the virus spreads. There are already thousands of firefighters and control staff in self-isolation, only a fraction of which will have the disease. If we aren\u2019t able to find out exactly who is infected, and more staff isolate unnecessarily, services will be put on a dangerous knife-edge. The FBU also warned that fire control rooms, which handle 999 calls and have fewer staff, have been the worst-hit in some areas, with some losing 15.9% of staff. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, chaired a meeting focused on the coronavirus outbreak on Monday morning, Downing Street said. The Ministry of Defence has also deployed 200 military personnel across the country in support of ambulance services. Downing Street said they would carry out a variety of roles including driving vehicles, taking calls, manning response centres and supporting paramedic crews. Parents of children with serious illnesses are failing to bring them to hospital out of fear their youngsters will catch Covid-19, according to a leading doctor. Dr Sanjay Patel, a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases at Southampton children\u2019s hospital, said fewer severely ill children were being brought to its emergency department with conditions such as appendicitis, dehydration and sepsis, PA Media reports. He said some parents were assuming that all illnesses were being caused by coronavirus or were not seeking healthcare due to fears over catching the virus. He has now helped develop national guidance on children\u2019s health to enable parents to assess when they should be seeking help. It consists of a red, amber and green traffic light system advising parents of which symptoms require them to seek urgent medical advice and the options available to them. Patel said: These are extremely challenging and worrying times for families and I can\u2019t stress how important it is to follow the government advice about social distancing in order to slow down the speed of Covid-19. However, I\u2019m really worried there is a very real risk that some children with illnesses such as appendicitis, dehydration or even sepsis are not being brought to see healthcare professionals as quickly as they would be normally. He continued: \u201cWe know that the message about Covid-19 is so powerful and parents are putting most children\u2019s illnesses down to this. \u201cThe other issue is that they are just too scared to bring their child to see a healthcare professional because they are worried that they might pick up Covid-19.\u201d A comment piece about the Nightingale hospital in East London published by HuffPost is being widely shared. The article by an anonymous ITU doctor raises concerns about whether the field hospital is fit for purpose. The doctor says: Critical care is not a specialty in which we can rapidly upskill people. I do not want to disparage those who\u2019ve already put themselves forward; I admire their dedication to the public. However, the nature of critical care requires difficult decisions to be made, often backed by years of experience. It is not a matter of watching a few instructional videos or reviewing a cobbled-together management guide as many of my colleagues have been asked to do. These are well-meaning and helpful, but do not replace years of clinical experience. Actor Christopher Eccleston has said he hopes the NHS will no longer be a \u201cpolitical football\u201d following the coronavirus pandemic. The ex-Doctor Who star said there should be \u201cno more threats to the NHS\u201d. Eccleston told TV show Lorraine: I\u2019m hoping now... that the world has changed, the NHS will no longer be a political football for any of the parties and that it is protected because it is the greatest expression of Britain we have. It\u2019s our nation\u2019s conscience and now it is saving our lives and a lot of people are doing it without protective equipment. Asked how he was coping with the lockdown, Eccleston said that keeping healthy was helping, but added he doesn\u2019t know how he would handle it if he was \u201cin a tower block without a back garden\u201d. He told the ITV show: \u201cExercise has helped me. I\u2019ve cut down on the booze ... because I\u2019m thinking if I can protect my immune system ... my aim is to be able to handle it without going to hospital. If I can keep myself away from the NHS, if somebody older ... needs a bed they\u2019d get the bed.\u201d This is Nicola Slawson taking over the liveblog. Thanks for joining me. Please do share any thoughts, insight or news tips me via any of the channels below. I might not have time to respond to all of you but I will certainly try and read them all. Thank you. Twitter: @nicola_slawson Instagram: @nicola_slawson Email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com Britain is at its best when faced with a crisis, the Duke of Cambridge has said, as he checked in on how small charities are coping during the coronavirus pandemic. William praised the community spirit that \u201ccomes rushing back\u201d in times of adversity as he spoke to some of the first beneficiaries of National Emergencies Trust (NET) funding. The future king has been appointed as the trust\u2019s first patron, and video-called members of grassroots charities to discuss the challenges they are facing and how the emergency funding is helping them to support their communities. Speaking to a representative of Moorlands Community Charity, he praised the public\u2019s response to the crisis. I think Britain is at its best, weirdly, when we\u2019re in a crisis. We all pull together and that community spirit and that community feel comes rushing back quicker than anything else. The NET said \u00a312.5m has been distributed since the emergency appeal was launched with William\u2019s help last month. In footage of the latest royal video call to be released amid the pandemic, William gave a \u201cvirtual high five\u201d to the Moorlands charity, passing on his good wishes for the \u201cfantastic job\u201d its members are doing. The organisation, which has seen a significant rise in referrals to the service since the outbreak of Covid-19, is delivering meals to isolated households and ensuring vital products such as baby powder and nappies - which were affected by panic-buying - are provided to those most in need. Around 50m pints of beer could go to waste if pubs remain closed into the summer because of lockdown. Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), estimates the UK\u2019s 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time. Kegs usually contain either 11 or 9 gallons each, and the best before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - is usually three to four months after delivery, while real ales and other unpasteurised beer can last 6-9 months. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer,\u201d Stainer told the BBC. \u201cPeople won\u2019t get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing.\u201d Alcohol sales in supermarkets rose by 22% last month, after pubs, restaurants and bars were closed on 20 March. The son of a doctor who died after contracting coronavirus, having previously raised concerns over the lack of protective equipment, said he was \u201cso proud\u201d of his father for holding the government accountable. Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury\u2019s son, Intisar, told Good Morning Britain: \u201cHe really didn\u2019t want to convey his own fears about his own life and the lives of his co-workers to me and my sister. \u201cWhen he wrote that letter [about the lack of PPE] he was in such an ill state, a painful state, he was unable to vocally communicate with me, or my sister or my mother. \u201cBut he still made sure that on behalf of his co-workers and colleagues that he would hold the government accountable for not providing enough protection for NHS frontline workers and I am so proud of him for that.\u201d Intisar went on to say that Priti Patel\u2019s statement in a press conference that she was \u201csorry if people feel there have been failings\u201d over PPE, was \u201cnot a real apology\u201d. \u201cThere have been failings, and I\u2019ve seen those failings happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government aren\u2019t on the frontline, our NHS workers are, so they need to make sure that our NHS workers are properly equipped to fight this disease and protect our society in general. \u201cThose NHS workers then have their own families that they need to protect - this was my father\u2019s message the whole time and I\u2019m just trying to convey that.\u201d More than 100 coronavirus-related fines have been issued in three days in Northern Ireland, police said. Officers broke up barbecues and a small number of large house parties, assistant chief constable Alan Todd said. Some parents were also believed to have left their children to play at friends\u2019 houses. Todd told the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Ulster programme: \u201cWe engage with people, it is only when people won\u2019t take the encouragement we end up having to enforce the matter.\u201d A total of 107 fines were imposed in three days over the Easter period. House parties involved some dozen or more people, although some were bigger, Todd said. Police stepped up their patrols at coastal beauty spots over the weekend and said the majority of people complied with restrictions designed to limit spread of the virus. The parents of a New Zealand nurse praised by the prime minister for the care she gave him have said they are \u201cexceptionally proud\u201d of their daughter. One of the nurses named by Boris Johnson in his video message yesterday as Jenny from Invercargill, on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, has been identified as Jenny McGee. Speaking to Television New Zealand, her mother, Caroline McGee, said: \u201cIt makes us feel exceptionally proud obviously. \u201cBut she has told us these things over the years and it doesn\u2019t matter what patient she is looking after, this is what she does.\u201d She added: \u201cI just find it incredible that she, any nurses, can do this for 12 hours, sit and watch a patient and twiddle away with all the different knobs and things they do to keep their patients alive, it\u2019s absolutely amazing.\u201d Jenny\u2019s father, Mike McGee, also said: \u201cI think over the years she has always told us that her job is one-on-one nursing with very critically ill people and that means she\u2019s there all the time for 12 hours. \u201cSo once we\u2019d heard that Boris Johnson had gone into intensive care it was obvious that at some stage Jenny would possibly run into him and be giving him the same level of care that she would have given anybody else the week before or next week and we\u2019re really proud of her.\u201d Johnson, who said the \u201cNHS has saved my life, no question\u201d after spending seven nights in St Thomas\u2019, was discharged at the weekend. A review of lockdown measures will take place later this week after the hospital coronavirus death toll rose above 10,000. Ministers have said they want to be sure the UK is past the peak of the outbreak before easing the restrictions, but 10 members of the cabinet are reportedly urging lockdown conditions to be eased amid concerns about the impact on the economy. The Times quoted an unnamed minister as saying it was important not to do \u201cmore damage\u201d, and measures could be eased after another three weeks. Scientific advisers will meet on Tuesday ahead of the formal review of the strict physical distancing measures on Thursday, the deadline set out in law. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who warned during his budget last month that the UK risks falling into recession as a result of disruption caused by coronavirus, has injected \u00a314bn from the coronavirus emergency response fund into the NHS and local authorities. If 60% of the population used the contact tracing app currently being developed by the NHS, the country\u2019s coronavirus epidemic could be suppressed, said Christophe Fraser, a professor at the University of Oxford helping to create it. \u201cIf 60% of population were to use this app and adhere to it, that could be enough to suppress the epidemic,\u201d the told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. However, smaller uptakes would also be effective he said. Explaining how the app works, Fraser said: \u201cIt enables different phones that have the app installed to exchange low energy Bluetooth signals \u201cOver a period of time, as you move around and have contacts with people, your phone has a recorded anonymised ID of people who you have been in contact with. \u201cIf you develop Covid, an anonymous message is sent to those contacts advising them to social distance and quarantine themselves, and look out for symptoms.\u201d He said people would be free to choose whether they download the app, and would consent to their phone exchanging the Bluetooth signals and sending out the anonymised details of your whereabouts in the case of an infection. The government\u2019s public health message on coronavirus has \u201cnot been culturally sensitive\u201d and language barriers could mean some are inadvertently breaching guidance, according to Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association. \u201cThere are issues around public health messaging; it has not been culturally sensitive and there are language barriers,\u201d Dr Nagpaul told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t getting that message across, it wouldn\u2019t take a lot for you to be inadvertently falling foul of this guidance.\u201d He also called for the government to urgently investigate if and why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are more vulnerable to the virus. He said it may be groups with higher instances of hypertension and coronary heart disease are more at risk, or socioeconomic factors. \u201cOvercrowding is much higher in black and ethnic minority populations,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in an overcrowded environment, you\u2019re not able to social distance. \u201cSome of these households are multi-generational, so younger workers could bring the virus home. Key workers can\u2019t socially distance and isolate.\u201d He also said that research has shown that BAME doctors are usually less likely to raise concerns. \u201cI really hope we\u2019re not in a situation where doctors from BME backgrounds are putting themselves in harm\u2019s way because they\u2019re not speaking out,\u201d he said. Wearing face masks and establishing \u201cneighbourhood health watches\u201d are effective means of tackling the spread of coronavirus, according to Dr David Nabarro, World Health Organization special envoy. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Nabarro said the world shortage of masks - particularly the more protective N95 masks - means health workers should be prioritised, but he thinks more widespread use of masks will come. He also said \u201cneighbourhood health watches\u201d and effective coronavirus helplines for people to get quick medical advice would help stop community transmission. He said the \u201cvirus isn\u2019t going anywhere\u201d and people will have to get used to physical distancing and wearing face masks as a way of life. \u201cIt is a revolution,\u201d he said. He added that environments where humans are in close contact with animals, such as the wet markets which have just reopened in Wuhan, do pose risks. \u201cThere are real dangers in these kind of environments for pathogens jumping between animals and humans,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s partly the markets but also other areas where animals and humans are in close contact ... we have similar concerns about bushmeat.\u201d Documents seen by Guardian show tech firms are using information to build a \u201cCovid-19 datastore\u201d. Technology firms are processing large volumes of confidential UK patient information in a data-mining operation that is part of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Palantir, the US big data firm founded by the rightwing billionaire Peter Thiel, is working with Faculty, a British artificial intelligence startup, to consolidate government databases and help ministers and officials respond to the pandemic. Data is also being used by Faculty to build predictive computer models around the Covid-19 outbreak. One NHS document suggests that, two weeks ago, Faculty considered running a computer simulation to assess the impact of a policy of \u201ctargeted herd immunity\u201d. Lawyers for Faculty said the proposed herd immunity simulation never took place. NHSX, the digital transformation arm of the National Health Service that has contracted the tech companies to help build the \u201cCovid-19 datastore\u201d, said the technology would give ministers and officials \u201creal-time information about health services, showing where demand is rising and where critical equipment needs to be deployed\u201d. Nearly 200 members of the armed forces are being loaned to NHS ambulance services to support their work during the pandemic, the Ministry of Defence has said. Personnel from all three strands of the armed forces will be sent to work at five ambulance trusts. Although their responsibilities will vary depending on the area, the new duties will include driving ambulances and taking calls from the public. Eighty service personnel will be sent to the South Central Ambulance Service NHS foundation trust where they will drive emergency response vehicles, larger ambulances and work at the response centre which covers five counties around London. In London, 21 medical personnel from the armed forces will form 10 critical care transfer teams to transport patients who need to be moved between intensive care units. Engineers from the army are also supporting the London ambulance service to maintain suction units used in ambulances. In Wales, 60 soldiers finished their two-day ambulance training at the Sennybridge Training Camp near Brecon on 7 April, ready to be deployed across Wales to assist paramedics with non-clinical tasks. Thirty-seven military personnel have been deployed to the East of England ambulance service, which covers six counties including Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire, to assist with tasks including driving and logistics. The group all volunteer as emergency responders in their free time and have previously trained with the service. Members of the RAF are already assisting the Scottish ambulance service with a trial of a medical isolation and transport system, using RAF Puma helicopters to take critically ill people to hospital. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said: Our armed forces always step forward at the appearance of threats to the country and its people. Across the United Kingdom, soldiers, sailors, airmen and women have got the backs of our NHS colleagues as they confront coronavirus. Members of the armed forces have helped with the response to the outbreak in a variety of ways. Military personnel were involved in the planning and building of the first NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCel exhibition centre in east London, as well as its equivalents across the country. Armed forces personnel, made up of 39 drivers and 63 drivers\u2019 mates, have also been trained to fill and transport oxygen tankers to NHS facilities. The Ministry of Defence said there were hundreds of personnel delivering supplies of PPE for the NHS. More than \u00a314bn from the coronavirus emergency response fund will go to public services, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has confirmed. The funds will bolster the NHS and local authorities, the Treasury said. The chancellor launched an initial \u00a35bn spending package for the coronavirus fund in the March budget. Sunak said: Our public services and its incredible workers are working with immense resolve and skill to keep us safe. We depend on them, which is why we are doing everything we can to provide our NHS, local authorities and others, with the resources and tools they need to tackle the virus. From the start, I\u2019ve been clear our vital public services will get whatever they need to protect this country and its people from coronavirus. The Treasury said the funding includes more than \u00a36bn \u201cto support our health services, free up hospital beds and deliver urgent priorities, including acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff\u201d. The spending involves \u00a36.6bn for health services, the Treasury said, and \u00a31.6bn for local authorities. The funding also includes \u00a33.5bn \u201cto ensure vital rail services continue to operate now and in the future for those who rely upon them for essential journeys\u201d, according to the government. Prisoners were refused breakfasts, soap and cleaning materials during the current lockdown in jails, after they failed to register their requests on to a computer system, the Guardian has learned. The sanctions were lifted after a lawyer wrote to the justice secretary saying cleanliness in these times is an \u201cissue of life or death\u201d. Last Monday, four prisoners at HMP Ashfield near Bristol, privately operated by Serco, were told they would not receive their breakfast packs for two weeks because they had failed to register their orders before the cut-off period. During the current Covid-19 lockdown in all prisons, soap and cell-cleaning materials have been included in the packs at Ashfield. When normal regimes are operating in prisons, inmates have extended association periods, in which they can shower, phone families and friends, and use computer terminals to book visits and medical appointments. But with prisons in lockdown mode, inmates have only a short time in which to shower and make applications, including ordering meals on a dedicated computer terminal, which some prisoners find difficult to operate. On Tuesday, the barrister Paul Omar wrote to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, saying the reduction of the men\u2019s food allowance contravened prison rules. The letter, seen by the Guardian, states that, \u201cwere the issue only food, it would be grave enough but given the packs contain personal hygiene and cleaning materials, this aggravates the matter, given the ongoing pandemic, when cleanliness is an issue of life or death.\u201d The letter concludes: \u201cFor such a restriction to remain in place in this period, aggravating, as is does, issues of health and hygiene, is clearly unlawful.\u201d Martin Booth, Serco\u2019s director at Ashfield, said: \u201cIt is a long standing practice that prisoners order their breakfasts from the terminals on the wings. \u201cIf for any reason a prisoner has failed to do so, they can make a request and a replacement pack will be provided, as was done in the case in question.\u201d With almost 3,000 fire and rescue workers in self-isolation across Britain, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) is calling for the government to roll out testing to allow those who do not have coronavirus to return to work. Fire crews have taken on extra tasks during the Covid-19 pandemic, including transporting personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing masks for frontline health workers to ensure they fit properly before use. Firefighters have already agreed to drive ambulances, deliver essential items such as food to vulnerable people and retrieve dead bodies in addition to their core roles. The FBU told the BBC that an eighth of staff in Bedfordshire are off work, while 10% of staff in London are self-isolating. It added that while there were planned testing programmes in Scotland and Wales, and firefighters in Northern Ireland have already been tested, there was no such system for England. The FBU general secretary, Matt Wrack, said services would be put on a \u201cdangerous knife edge\u201d if staff are forced to isolate unnecessarily. The supply of clinical gowns in some NHS hospitals is \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d according to Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, which represents hospital trusts. He said there are some concerns about a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in certain hospitals. He told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThere is a range of personal protective equipment that needs to be delivered at the front line ... nearly all of that material is flowing in the way that trusts would like. \u201cThe bit where there\u2019s a particular problem was gowns, where we know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. \u201cNo trust, as far as I\u2019m aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very very low.\u201d Hopson said the supply of gowns - imported from China - was \u201chand-to-mouth\u201d. He said the NHS ordered \u201ca whole load of stock\u201d weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the product sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He said: \u201cIf everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. \u201cThis is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply.\u201d Hopson said those trusts with a surplus were being asked to share their supplies with neighbouring trusts, while alternative gowns were being sourced from elsewhere. Emergency supplies had also been delivered to those most in demand, Hopson said. Good morning, I\u2019m Jessica Murray and I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak in the UK over the next few hours. Feel free to get in touch via jessica.murray@theguardian.com or via Twitter (@journojess_) As the UK death toll passed 10,000 yesterday, Boris Johnson praised the NHS for saving his life as he was discharged from hospital. A New Zealand nurse who was praised by the prime minister for her care has been \u201cblown away\u201d by the recognition, her brother said. Boris Johnson used a video post on Sunday to mention by name the medics who had looked after him, particularly \u201ctwo nurses who stood by my bedside for 48 hours when things could have gone either way\u201d. Johnson said the \u201cNHS has saved my life, no question\u201d after spending seven nights in St Thomas\u2019 in central London after contracting Covid-19 and was discharged at the weekend. One of nurses mentioned by Johnson, Jenny from Invercargill on New Zealand\u2019s South Island, has been identified as Jenny McGee. Her brother Rob told the New Zealand Herald the family had spoken with McGee just as she was \u201cabout to head off to do another night shift\u201d. He told the paper: We are all very proud of Jen, not just in the support she gave Boris - but what she has been doing helping everyday people. Whilst she is blown away by Boris\u2019s recognition, she is just really pleased to see the public recognition for the amazing work the NHS is doing - that made her really proud. McGee attended the Verdon College in Invercargill, and they said the community was \u201cso proud\u201d and that she had wanted to be a nurse since leaving in 2002. The school said: \u201cJenny is described by her past teachers as an absolutely delightful person and someone who had a caring and humble nature. \u201cThanks Jenny for your courage, outstanding work and the example you have provided for everyone at this difficult time. Your old school community is so proud of you!\u201d Meanwhile, the mayor of the city, Sir Tim Shadbolt, told Stuff.co.nz: \u201cIt\u2019s not very often a nurse from Invercargill saves the life of the British prime minister.\u201d The other nurse mentioned by Johnson - Luis, from near Porto in Portugal - has been named as Luis Pitarma and has been thanked by Portuguese president Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. A statement on the presidential website said: \u201cPresident Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has already personally thanked the nurse Luis Pitarma, and ... also thanks the commitment of all Portuguese health professionals who in Portugal and around the world are providing decisive help in the fight to the pandemic.\u201d The statement added that the president offered \u201cencouragement that is also addressed to professionals of other nationalities who, reinforcing the National Health Service, provide an invaluable service to Portugal\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi organisers of a race day billed as the world\u2019s richest have been left embarrassed after the trainer of the winning horse was indicted for doping, forcing them to withhold the entire $20m prize purse. The Saudi Cup, held on a purpose-built track in Riyadh from February 28-29, was supposed to showcase Saudi Arabia as a new global force in horse racing and add another showpiece to its fast-growing lineup of global sports. However, an announcement by the course\u2019s newly formed jockey club that all place-getters would forgo their earnings pending an investigation has cast a pall over the event and has raised fresh concerns about the kingdom\u2019s new-found enthusiasm for sport and the recognition Saudi leaders believe it confers. On Monday, race day organisers announced the suspension of winnings one month after trainer Jason Servis was charged with administering banned substances to his charges, including Maximum Security, the winning horse in at the inaugural race. US authorities laid the charges against Sevis just over a week after the Saudi Cup. The indictment alleged that Maximum Securitywas given a performance-enhancing drug before a meet last year. The winner\u2019s share of the $20m kitty was supposed to be $10m \u2013 a payday thought to be unrivalled in global racing.

Shame on him.</p> <p>Of course, we do not have any reliable government data relating to the number of deaths of HCPs. If Mr Hancock is so certain that staff are using PPE unnecessarily, he should publish this data so we can judge for ourselves; otherwise this is just a diversion and an attempt to cynically shift the blame for the lack of PPE on to overworked and distressed HCPs.</p> <p>Regarding the use by Mr Hancock and his colleagues of words like \u201cprecious resource\u201d, he will find none more precious than our daughter, who is watching her colleagues become ill, resulting in intensive care admission, patients left to die because they are too ill to rescue, and patients having to be left to die in isolation. Our most precious resource is going to be left with these images all her life.</p> <p>We wonder how Mr Hancock is sleeping at night.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "We are the parents of a GP trainee who had her rota changed at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and is now working in an A&amp;E department for the foreseeable future. You published a letter from us on 2 April, but we now feel the need to write a follow-up. On Friday Matt Hancock stated: \u201cWe need everyone to treat PPE like the precious resource it is \u2026 Everyone should use the equipment they clinically need, in line with the guidelines; no more and no less\u201d (NHS workers angered at Hancock\u2019s warning not to overuse PPE, 10 April), thereby implying that our daughter and her colleagues are using PPE unnecessarily, without any clinical need. Does he think our healthcare professionals (HCPs) are putting on cumbersome personal protective equipment not because they are at risk from a deadly virus, but because they like the look of it? This is an astonishing statement considering that this government is currently demonstrably failing to supply NHS employees with sufficient quantities of PPE. It is a monstrous diversion to claim that our daughter and her colleagues are somehow responsible for Mr Hancock\u2019s lack of foresight, planning and strategic management. Shame on him. Of course, we do not have any reliable government data relating to the number of deaths of HCPs. If Mr Hancock is so certain that staff are using PPE unnecessarily, he should publish this data so we can judge for ourselves; otherwise this is just a diversion and an attempt to cynically shift the blame for the lack of PPE on to overworked and distressed HCPs. Regarding the use by Mr Hancock and his colleagues of words like \u201cprecious resource\u201d, he will find none more precious than our daughter, who is watching her colleagues become ill, resulting in intensive care admission, patients left to die because they are too ill to rescue, and patients having to be left to die in isolation. Our most precious resource is going to be left with these images all her life. We wonder how Mr Hancock is sleeping at night. Name and address supplied",

Two weeks ago he lost his job installing lifts, making the 39-year-old one of the hundreds of thousands of Australians to find themselves newly unemployed in the wake of Covid-19. After days spent staring at his computer screen and applying for jobs, he\u2019d left the house to buy a coffee and smoke a cigarette.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just for a bit of sanity\u201d Tomo told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to do the right thing. I don\u2019t go outside, I don\u2019t go visiting people. But I\u2019m losing my mind in here. I\u2019ve been working since I was 14. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been laid-off and it\u2019s hard sitting at home.\u201d</p> <p>As he sat in his car smoking and looking out at the cruise ship and the locals fishing from the harbour, Tomo was approached by a police officer who asked him why he was there.</p> <p>\u201cI told him the truth. I said I was here to enjoy the view and see the boat while I had my coffee but I have no intention of leaving my car,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Tomo was told he would be fined $1,000 for not having a valid reason for being outside of his home. </p> <p>\u201cHis exact words to me were, \u2018if you want to keep doing this, it\u2019s a good way to get poor\u2019,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to cause a scene or argue with the police because who knows what could happen. I copped it sweet but I was really upset. I\u2019ve never broken the law in my life. He could have easily just told me to go home and I would have. I\u2019ve just lost my job, I\u2019m trying to pay a mortgage, it\u2019s the last thing I need.\u201d</p> <p>NSW police later said Tomo had been issued with a warning, but no fine was processed.</p> <p>In other cases, police appear to have used unnecessary force or to have issued heavy fines in cases where there were concerns for the person\u2019s welfare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/we-need-to-live-restricted-lives-for-at-least-six-months-police-enforced-lockdowns-are-unnecessary\">We need to live restricted lives for at least six months \u2013 police enforced lockdowns are unnecessary | Peter Collignon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Saturday, police fined two men in Condell Park in south-west Sydney who were spotted \u201ceating pizza\u201d in a car.

One of the men was in handcuffs.</a></p> <p>On the same day in Newcastle, a 47-year-old became one of the first to be hit by a new law which allows police to issue a $5,000 fine to people who spit at healthcare workers.</p> <p>Police had been called after the woman was seen exposing herself to a light rail vehicle. When they arrived, officers called paramedics because they were \u201cconcerned for her welfare\u201d. When she was being placed onto a gurney, she spat at a paramedic.</p> <p>Sydney lawyer Peter O\u2019Brien, who specialises in civil cases against police, said the broad discretion the orders gave officers meant their enforcement was \u201carbitrary\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cReasonable minds may differ very significantly on what a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019 is and when you\u2019re leaving it to young police officers on the beat to decide what\u2019s reasonable it is almost going to be arbitrary in the way it\u2019s going to be applied,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThese laws are going to manifest in the same way as all police powers tend to: in a concentration of the use of power against the already vulnerable, the mentally ill, the people who are already over-policed.\u201d</p> <p><em>Do you know more?

      "bodyText": "A woman in Victoria says she was left feeling \u201cheartbroken\u201d and like a criminal after uniformed police officers carrying weapons interrupted her father\u2019s funeral over the Easter long weekend to enforce social distancing rules. It comes as state police forces rapidly escalate the number of people fined for breaching public health orders despite falling infection rates, and amid concerns from law and justice experts the laws are being inconsistently and arbitrarily enforced. Helen Kolovos, who buried her father on Saturday, says she was \u201cinconsolable\u201d after two police officers entered the church and began counting the number of people attending the funeral as her father\u2019s coffin was carried down the aisle. Funerals have been strictly limited to 10 guests since March, part of the government\u2019s strict social distancing measures introduced to slow the spread of Covid-19 in Australia. \u201cBeing from a Greek family it was already mission impossible to do that, but we did, we literally had to pick and choose our own family and say you can come, you can\u2019t come,\u201d Kolovos told the Guardian. Despite living in the same house, Kolovos and her family sat in separate pews during the service. Then, at the end of the service, two police officers entered the church as her father\u2019s coffin was being carried out. \u201cTo see the police come in at that moment, it broke my heart into a million pieces,\u201d Kolovos said. \u201cIt was just totally disrespectful, to carry a gun in a Greek church, it\u2019s totally against our religion. But the way they came in, they didn\u2019t bow their heads or anything. They just started speaking to some of the people who were working in the church and taking notes as we\u2019re carrying out my dad. \u201cJust pause what you\u2019re doing for one moment, bow your head, just give that man a little shred of respect. I was inconsolable. That whole moment of farewelling my dad, that moment was taken away from me.\u201d Since March a string of public health orders issued by health ministers have re-shaped Australian life, giving police unprecedented power to control almost all aspects of everyday movement. In most states officers now have the power to fine or arrest people caught gathering in groups of more than two, or for being outside of their homes without a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d. And yet as the rate of infection from Covid-19 in Australia continues to fall, the number of fines issued by police has rapidly increased. By 5 April, Victoria Police had issued 199 fines for breaches of the orders. In the eight days since, they\u2019ve issued another 931. In the same period the state recorded only 146 new Covid-19 cases. In New South Wales, police have fined 464 people and issued 57 court attendance notices for breaches of public health orders since 17 March. On Monday the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said more than 155 of those had been issued over the Easter long weekend. \u201cI don\u2019t expect those numbers will continue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is an example that some people just aren\u2019t listening to the warnings.\u201d Governments say the measures are necessary to control the spread of Covid-19, and that officers use \u201ccommon sense\u201d in enforcing the restrictions but a Guardian callout for readers\u2019 examples of police interactions found dozens of examples of inconsistent, heavy-handed or over-the-top policing. Last week, George Tomo drove a few kilometres from his home in Wollongong, south of Sydney, to Port Kembla where the infamous Ruby Princess cruise ship was docked. Two weeks ago he lost his job installing lifts, making the 39-year-old one of the hundreds of thousands of Australians to find themselves newly unemployed in the wake of Covid-19. After days spent staring at his computer screen and applying for jobs, he\u2019d left the house to buy a coffee and smoke a cigarette. \u201cIt was just for a bit of sanity\u201d Tomo told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to do the right thing. I don\u2019t go outside, I don\u2019t go visiting people. But I\u2019m losing my mind in here. I\u2019ve been working since I was 14. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been laid-off and it\u2019s hard sitting at home.\u201d As he sat in his car smoking and looking out at the cruise ship and the locals fishing from the harbour, Tomo was approached by a police officer who asked him why he was there. \u201cI told him the truth. I said I was here to enjoy the view and see the boat while I had my coffee but I have no intention of leaving my car,\u201d he said. Tomo was told he would be fined $1,000 for not having a valid reason for being outside of his home. \u201cHis exact words to me were, \u2018if you want to keep doing this, it\u2019s a good way to get poor\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to cause a scene or argue with the police because who knows what could happen. I copped it sweet but I was really upset. I\u2019ve never broken the law in my life. He could have easily just told me to go home and I would have. I\u2019ve just lost my job, I\u2019m trying to pay a mortgage, it\u2019s the last thing I need.\u201d NSW police later said Tomo had been issued with a warning, but no fine was processed. In other cases, police appear to have used unnecessary force or to have issued heavy fines in cases where there were concerns for the person\u2019s welfare. On Saturday, police fined two men in Condell Park in south-west Sydney who were spotted \u201ceating pizza\u201d in a car. On Monday, News Corp reported video footage which showed 10 officers at the scene. One of the men was in handcuffs. On the same day in Newcastle, a 47-year-old became one of the first to be hit by a new law which allows police to issue a $5,000 fine to people who spit at healthcare workers. Police had been called after the woman was seen exposing herself to a light rail vehicle. When they arrived, officers called paramedics because they were \u201cconcerned for her welfare\u201d. When she was being placed onto a gurney, she spat at a paramedic. Sydney lawyer Peter O\u2019Brien, who specialises in civil cases against police, said the broad discretion the orders gave officers meant their enforcement was \u201carbitrary\u201d. \u201cReasonable minds may differ very significantly on what a \u2018reasonable excuse\u2019 is and when you\u2019re leaving it to young police officers on the beat to decide what\u2019s reasonable it is almost going to be arbitrary in the way it\u2019s going to be applied,\u201d he said. \u201cThese laws are going to manifest in the same way as all police powers tend to: in a concentration of the use of power against the already vulnerable, the mentally ill, the people who are already over-policed.\u201d Do you know more?

      "bodyText": "Tax reform including a GST increase and higher land tax will be needed to avoid the debt burden of the $214bn Covid-19 economic response falling on young people, an academic tax expert has warned. Prof Robert Breunig, who leads the Australian National University\u2019s tax and transfer policy institute, has warned Australia\u2019s overreliance on income and corporations tax will see the bill \u201cfall very heavily on the future incomes of young people, which will now be lower as a consequence of the pandemic\u201d. The warning comes after federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, suggested on Sunday that the Coalition would seek to shrink debt through economic growth despite deputy prime minister Michael McCormack\u2019s more pessimistic assessment that tax reform would be required. The Morrison government has spent $214bn in three economic stimulus and support packages, including $130bn of wage subsidies, dwarfing the fiscal response to the global financial crisis. Frydenberg told ABC\u2019s Insiders the debt \u201cwill be paid back in the years ahead\u201d and claimed despite the recent spending the Liberal party is \u201cthe party of lower tax\u201d. \u201cThe way to meet that growing debt burden will be to grow the economy,\u201d he said. Deloitte Access economics has suggested that \u2013 as Australia did after the second world war \u2013 the government can simply shrink the debt as a proportion of the economy by returning to economic growth because austerity \u201crarely makes sense\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll be borrowing about an extra 10% of national income,\u201d it said. \u201cIf we choose not to pay back a single cent of that, the growth in our economy over time will halve [it] to about 5% of national income in 18 years, and then halve again to 2.5% in a further 18 years.\u201d Deloitte estimates that \u2013 given the record low borrowing cost \u2013 the annual interest bill on new borrowings will be $1.6bn, which could be paid by raising the Medicare levy from 2% to 2.14%. But Breunig said Australia\u2019s tax system was \u201cantiquated and not well set up to encourage growth in the economy\u201d because it relies on company and income tax which \u201chave a negative impact on growth\u201d. Breunig told Guardian Australia the tax system has \u201cgenerated inequality between young people\u201d \u2013 who pay income tax and GST \u2013 and older people who have experienced \u201ca huge run-up in their wealth\u201d from buying houses and benefit from \u201ctax-free income from their superannuation\u201d. Fiscal stimulus and lower interest rates to combat economic crises \u201cpump money into the economy\u201d in a way that drives up asset prices such as shares and real estate, exacerbating wealth inequality. Breunig supports increasing the GST because it \u201chas the extra benefit of taxing people\u2019s accumulated wealth as they spend it\u201d. \u201cWe should also switch from stamp duty to land tax to better capture the value of increased asset prices and make it easier for people to buy and sell houses,\u201d he said. \u201cAnother option is to include owner-occupied housing in the asset test for the age pension and introduce a government-run reverse-mortgage program to help people to spend their assets while alive.\u201d Asked about the stage two and three income tax cuts, legislated in mid-2019 after the re-election of the Morrison government, Breunig warned the government \u201cmay have to delay them if it can\u2019t replace the revenue from other sources\u201d. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the highest budget priority should be \u201cto support people, organisations, businesses and communities through a really difficult period\u201d. \u201cThat comes with a massive price tag, but so long as that money is responsibly spent \u2013 not wasted or rorted \u2013 and it saves lives, jobs and communities then it will be worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the conversation turns to repaying the debt, we need to ensure that the burden doesn\u2019t fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable people in our society.\u201d On Sunday, McCormack said \u201cthe recovery out the other side is going to need that [tax reform]\u201d and did not rule out the possibility of increasing GST.",

      "body": "<p>Hundreds of thousands of non-essential employees in Spain have returned to work as European countries grapple with the question of when lockdown restrictions should be eased amid fears of a renewed spike in the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>Police handed workers masks at transport hubs in the capital, Madrid, on Monday and businesses in the construction and manufacturing sectors tentatively reopened, after the government relaxed some lockdown measures put in place two weeks ago that confined most people to their homes.</p> \n<p>The controversial return to work for an estimated 300,000 non-essential staff got off to a slow start. Monday is a public holiday in much of the country, including some of the most populous regions such as Catalonia and Valencia. Few commuters were visible at Madrid\u2019s usually bustling Atocha railway station.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/spanish-pm-survival-eu-rests-response-coronavirus-crisis\">prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez</a>, has insisted the country remains firmly in lockdown despite the easing of some restrictions. Shops, bars and public houses will remain closed until at least 26 April. The health ministry has called on those returning to work to stagger arrival times and to wear masks where physical distancing is not possible.</p> \n<p>Regional leaders have criticised the move amid fears that the hard-fought public health gains of recent days may be lost. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from the virus fell to 517 on Monday from 619 on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to 17,489, the health ministry said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Spain\" data-alt=\"Spain deaths graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Spain\">Spain deaths graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>It was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. Overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019. The health minister, Salvador Illa, said the epidemic had passed its peak. The challenge now was to consolidate the second stage of the struggle against the virus and to reduce new infections, he said.</p> \n<p>The trend across Europe appears to show a similar modest flattening of infection and death rates. Italy reported 566 deaths on Monday, 135 more than on Sunday. Almost half of the deaths \u2013 280 \u2013 were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-live-news-global-cases-italy-new-york-death-tolls-slow-latest-updates\">Coronavirus latest news: death toll in Italy passes 20,000; more than 1.87m cases reported worldwide</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The civil protection authority said the number of people who are currently infected rose by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, in a further sign that the curve is flattening. The number of intensive care beds in use continues to decline, as does the number of people hospitalised for the virus.</p> \n<p>European countries face the same dilemma as Spain: whether to ease some lockdown restrictions in order to salvage their battered economies, or to persevere with draconian measures until the decline in cases is conclusively achieved.</p> \n<p>Italy\u2019s government has set up a taskforce led by the former chief executive of Vodafone Vittorio Colao to navigate the country\u2019s exit from the coronavirus lockdown. The team of 17 will be responsible for devising a plan as part of \u201cphase two\u201d of the emergency.</p> \n<p>It includes Enrico Giovannini, a former labour minister and professor at Tor Vergata University of Rome, as well as other economists, businesspeople, lawyers, sociologists and psychologists. Italy\u2019s lockdown is in place until 4 May, after which the country is expected to gradually reopen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, will decide on Wednesday whether to extend restrictions imposed in mid-March. They are due to expire on Sunday. The latest figures from the Robert Koch public health institute show the rate of infection slowing, with 2,537 new cases on Monday, taking the tally in Germany to 123,016.</p> \n<p>The country\u2019s Academy of Sciences Leopoldina has recommended a gradual relaxing of measures. It said schools should reopen as soon as possible, starting with primary and middle schools, followed by shops and restaurants. All government officials should return to work, it said.</p> \n<p>Austria is to allow small shops to reopen from Tuesday, and larger ones from 1 May. All restaurants and hotels are due to resume business from mid-May. Denmark will reopen schools and day care centres from Wednesday, although restrictions on public gatherings and on bars and restaurants remain.</p> \n<p> The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged caution over moves by countries to lift lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the behaviour of the virus, and emphasised that case finding, testing and isolating was still crucial to controlling the outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-the-most-cases-and-deaths\">Coronavirus world map: which countries have the most cases and deaths?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe know that in some countries, Covid-19 cases are doubling every three to four days. However, while Covid-19 accelerates very fast, it decelerates much more slowly. In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up.\u201d</p> \n<p>S\u00e1nchez said Spain\u2019s decision to reboot some sectors of the economy was taken following consultations with a committee of scientific experts. Any further winding \u2013 down would depend on gains made against the virus, he stressed.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of non-essential employees in Spain have returned to work as European countries grapple with the question of when lockdown restrictions should be eased amid fears of a renewed spike in the coronavirus pandemic. Police handed workers masks at transport hubs in the capital, Madrid, on Monday and businesses in the construction and manufacturing sectors tentatively reopened, after the government relaxed some lockdown measures put in place two weeks ago that confined most people to their homes. The controversial return to work for an estimated 300,000 non-essential staff got off to a slow start. Monday is a public holiday in much of the country, including some of the most populous regions such as Catalonia and Valencia. Few commuters were visible at Madrid\u2019s usually bustling Atocha railway station. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has insisted the country remains firmly in lockdown despite the easing of some restrictions. Shops, bars and public houses will remain closed until at least 26 April. The health ministry has called on those returning to work to stagger arrival times and to wear masks where physical distancing is not possible. Regional leaders have criticised the move amid fears that the hard-fought public health gains of recent days may be lost. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from the virus fell to 517 on Monday from 619 on Sunday, bringing the total death toll to 17,489, the health ministry said. It was the smallest proportional daily increase since tracking began. Overall cases rose to 169,496 from 166,019. The health minister, Salvador Illa, said the epidemic had passed its peak. The challenge now was to consolidate the second stage of the struggle against the virus and to reduce new infections, he said. The trend across Europe appears to show a similar modest flattening of infection and death rates. Italy reported 566 deaths on Monday, 135 more than on Sunday. Almost half of the deaths \u2013 280 \u2013 were registered in Lombardy, the northern region worst affected by the virus. The civil protection authority said the number of people who are currently infected rose by 1,363 (1.3%) to 103,616, in a further sign that the curve is flattening. The number of intensive care beds in use continues to decline, as does the number of people hospitalised for the virus. European countries face the same dilemma as Spain: whether to ease some lockdown restrictions in order to salvage their battered economies, or to persevere with draconian measures until the decline in cases is conclusively achieved. Italy\u2019s government has set up a taskforce led by the former chief executive of Vodafone Vittorio Colao to navigate the country\u2019s exit from the coronavirus lockdown. The team of 17 will be responsible for devising a plan as part of \u201cphase two\u201d of the emergency. It includes Enrico Giovannini, a former labour minister and professor at Tor Vergata University of Rome, as well as other economists, businesspeople, lawyers, sociologists and psychologists. Italy\u2019s lockdown is in place until 4 May, after which the country is expected to gradually reopen. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, will decide on Wednesday whether to extend restrictions imposed in mid-March. They are due to expire on Sunday. The latest figures from the Robert Koch public health institute show the rate of infection slowing, with 2,537 new cases on Monday, taking the tally in Germany to 123,016. The country\u2019s Academy of Sciences Leopoldina has recommended a gradual relaxing of measures. It said schools should reopen as soon as possible, starting with primary and middle schools, followed by shops and restaurants. All government officials should return to work, it said. Austria is to allow small shops to reopen from Tuesday, and larger ones from 1 May. All restaurants and hotels are due to resume business from mid-May. Denmark will reopen schools and day care centres from Wednesday, although restrictions on public gatherings and on bars and restaurants remain. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, urged caution over moves by countries to lift lockdown conditions. He said much was still unknown about the behaviour of the virus, and emphasised that case finding, testing and isolating was still crucial to controlling the outbreak. He said: \u201cWe know that in some countries, Covid-19 cases are doubling every three to four days. However, while Covid-19 accelerates very fast, it decelerates much more slowly. In other words, the way down is much slower than the way up.\u201d S\u00e1nchez said Spain\u2019s decision to reboot some sectors of the economy was taken following consultations with a committee of scientific experts. Any further winding \u2013 down would depend on gains made against the virus, he stressed. So far 500,000 people have been fined an average of \u20ac300 (\u00a3260) for breaking lockdown. In other developments: Russia introduced a new digital permit system for anyone seeking to travel around Moscow during its lockdown. However, the website offering Muscovites a QR-code went offline just hours after launch. Moscow\u2019s mayor blamed an attack by foreign bots. China reported 108 new cases, 98 of which were imported from overseas, its highest figure since early March. The country where the disease first emerged has largely brought its domestic outbreak under control, but it faces a fresh battle against imported infections, mostly involving Chinese nationals returning home. Indonesia announced 316 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections to 4,557, according to data provided by a health ministry official, Achmad Yurianto. Yurianto said there were also 26 new coronavirus-related deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 399. Japan said it saw no reason at the moment to extend its state of emergency beyond Tokyo and a handful of other cities.

      "bodyText": "The lockdown may be stretching the country\u2019s patience to the limit, but it hasn\u2019t deterred fundraisers trying to support the NHS and the workers on the frontline of the crisis. One running challenge has gone viral and has already raised \u00a31m; a BBC Big Night In will likely raise much more. Running challenge raises \u00a31m for NHS A 5km running challenge has raised over \u00a31m for NHS staff in just over two weeks after going viral on social media. The Run for Heroes campaign challenges people to use their permitted daily exercise to run 5km, donate \u00a35 to help frontline NHS workers, and then tag five others to do the same. It has quickly spread on social media, with more than 200,000 runners taking part across 10 different countries. \u201cYour love and support has raised money to go towards wellbeing packs, accommodation and travel for NHS workers and volunteers, provide longer-term mental health support for staff and families effected, and help patients leave hospital quickly and safely,\u201d Run for Heroes said in a post announcing the \u00a31m total. A number of high-profile celebrities have taken up the challenge, including singer Ellie Goulding, Olympic medal winner Mo Farah, footballer John Terry and DJ Chris Moyles. The campaign was launched by London-based documentary producer Olivia Strong, 27, on 28 March with the run.for.heroes Instagram page. She originally aimed to raise \u00a35,000, but after reaching her target in just four days, she decided to extend the challenge. Star-studded lineup for the BBC\u2019s Big Night In Matt Baker, Zoe Ball, Lenny Henry, Davina McCall and Paddy McGuinness have been confirmed as hosts of the BBC\u2019s Big Night In, airing next week. The programme, a first-time collaboration between BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief, will celebrate the acts of kindness and the spirit of hope that have sustained the nation during the Covid-19 pandemic. Peter Kay, Catherine Tate and Gary Barlow will also be taking part from home, with further stars to be announced. Ball said: \u201cWe are always so blown away by folks\u2019 generosity each year supporting Comic Relief and Children in Need and now, during these extraordinary times, more than ever people in our communities are in need of our love and support.\u201d The show will air live on Thursday 23 April from 7pm, with music, comedy sketches and competitions, and any money raised will be matched pound for pound by the Treasury, as announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week. The money will be split equally between BBC Children in Need and Comic Relief to provide essential support to local charities, projects and programmes across the UK, to help people most in need of all ages and backgrounds. Opera-singing doctor entertains NHS staff A doctor who has returned to the NHS to help treat Covid-19 patients has been entertaining his colleagues with his opera singing. Tenor Alex Aldren, or \u201cDr Opera\u201d, has been serenading fellow medics by singing on the wards in his scrubs, even while wearing a face mask. A&amp;E nurse Mikaela posted a video of Aldren singing at Newham hospital in London, saying, \u201cMusic can heal the wounds which medicine cannot touch\u201d, and adding that he was \u201can amazing opera singer\u201d. Aldren trained in medicine but left the profession to become a tenor, and has recently returned to his old job, along with hundreds of others who recently left the NHS, to offer his skills in the fight against the pandemic. In another video posted on Twitter, emergency doctor Russell said, \u201cHe\u2019s treating the team to some shows during quieter periods! Bravo!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain missed three opportunities to be part of an EU scheme to bulk-buy masks, gowns and gloves and has been absent from key talks about future purchases, the Guardian can reveal, as pressure grows on ministers to protect NHS medics and care workers on the coronavirus frontline. European doctors and nurses are preparing to receive the first of \u20ac1.5bn (\u00a31.3bn) worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) within days or a maximum of two weeks through a joint procurement scheme involving 25 countries and eight companies, according to internal EU documents. The EU\u2019s swift work has led to offers of medical equipment, including masks, overalls and goggles, in excess of the number requested, a spokesman for the European commission said. The EU is separately establishing stockpiles within member states, with the first being set up in Romania. The development comes as anger grows over PPE shortages in Britain, with particular concerns at the weekend over stocks of full-sleeve gowns running out. The gowns are designed to resist droplets which can spread coronavirus and were shown to be highly effective at protecting medics in Italy. A survey by the Doctors\u2019 Association UK found that only 52% of clinicians carrying out the highest-risk procedures said they had access to the correct full-sleeve gowns, while the Guardian understands that a consignment of at least 100,000 gowns from China had to be rejected when it was found to be substandard. Other consignments thought to be gowns had been mislabelled and were other equipment. On Monday Dominic Raab, acknowledged PPE shortages \u2013 rather than distribution issues only \u2013 for the first time. The foreign secretary, who is deputising for the prime minister as Boris Johnson recovers from Covid-19, told the daily Downing Street briefing that cost was not an issue but admitted to problems with PPE supply due to \u201ca competitive market out there\u201d. He declined to apologise, saying only that 16m items of equipment were delivered over the bank holiday weekend. \u201cWe are straining every sinew to roll them out even further and even faster,\u201d he said. The UK government has previously said it was unable to join the EU\u2019s procurement schemes as it had not received an email of invitation. As a result, the government missed out on mass procurement of medical ventilators, and has called on UK manufacturers to build tens of thousands more. But it has also not been involved in two rounds of bulk purchasing of PPE, which were launched by the EU on 28 February and 17 March. The EU\u2019s procurement of 28 February initially failed due to a lack of interest from suppliers but was relaunched on 15 March, providing additional time for the UK to get involved if it had chosen to do so. It is understood that officials in Whitehall only realised after those three rounds had been put out to tender that they had not received invitations to join the Joint Procurement Agreement steering committee where the orders are organised. The UK only took part in its first meeting on joint procurement on 19 March after informing the commission that emails of invitation were being sent to an outdated address, the Guardian has learned. Despite that belated show of interest, British officials did not attend a separate meeting of health officials on 25 March where participants were invited to spell out their requirements for future purchases to the commission by the next day. The UK is also not involved in joint procurement of laboratory equipment. The EU is also planning joint procurement of therapies for coronavirus, but the UK is yet to state its position on its involvement. Shortages of protective equipment have triggered anxiety, alarm and fear among NHS medics and care home staff. The death toll among doctors and nurses continues to rise, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, saying on Saturday that 19 NHS workers had died. He said it was \u201cimpossible\u201d to say when hospitals would have all they needed but added: \u201cWe aren\u2019t aware of any links from shortages of PPE to any of these deaths.\u201d New examples of the shortage of equipment seen by the Guardian include a district nurse in London being issued with just three disposable masks for a week and a care home nurse in Devon claiming her employer was limiting drinks to every four hours to avoid multiple changes of masks and gloves. The Royal College of Nursing has added to the pressure by advising nurses they should refuse to treat patients with Covid-19 \u201cas a last resort\u201d if they could not access the full PPE they needed. The EU procurement scheme has not been entirely successful, however. While deliveries of masks, gowns and gloves will be made in tranches over the next two to 18 weeks, the procurement of ventilators will be slow, according to a leaked EU document. \u201cCompanies indicated long delivery times, from 10 to 52 weeks,\u201d the commission warned member states of the \u00a3690m purchase.

They do not include the UK.</p> <h2>4 February</h2> <p>EU countries share observations on the state of supplies of PPE in a meeting of officials from member states and the World Health Organization. An official from the UK attends the meeting in Luxembourg.</p> <h2>24 February</h2> <p>A meeting of officials, to which the UK was invited, hears an update from the European commission on the joint procurement of PPE. Commission officials call on countries to confirm \u201ctheir exact needs latest today \u2026 to move forward with next steps\u201d. No representative from the UK attends the meeting.</p> <h2>28 February</h2> <p>The EU launches its first joint procurement of \u00a31.2m worth of gloves and gowns/overalls. The UK is not one of the 20 member states involved.</p> <h2>12 March</h2> <p>The procurement fails due to a lack of suitable suppliers. It is relaunched on 15 March. The UK is still not involved.</p> <h2>17 March</h2> <p>The EU launches two more rounds of joint procurement for masks and goggles and ventilators. The UK is not one of the 25 member states involved.</p> <h2>19 March</h2> <p>The UK belatedly takes up an invitation to join the joint procurement agreement steering committee, which makes decisions on mass purchases. The UK does not join a procurement for laboratory supplies that is put out to tender on the same day.</p> <h2>23 March</h2> <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, admits there have been \u201cchallenges\u201d with the supply of PPE after complaints by doctors and nurses around the country. He drafts in the army to help with distribution.</p> <h2>24 March</h2> <p>No 10 says it has not joined EU procurement schemes as the UK is not in the EU and is \u201cmaking our own efforts\u201d. The government later U-turns to say it failed to receive an email inviting it to be part of the initiative.</p> <h2>25 March</h2> <p>Health officials from EU countries convene an audio meeting. Representatives of the member states raise the possibility of further procurements and are asked to inform the commission by the following day about their requirements. The UK has been invited to join the meeting, but no representative takes part.</p> <h2>26 March</h2> <p>The government says it has 8,175 ventilators, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/how-the-uk-plans-to-source-30000-ventilators-for-nhs-coronavirus\">turns to British industry to help produce 30,000</a> in a matter of weeks.

Priti Patel, the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/priti-patel-says-sorry-if-people-feel-there-have-been-failings-over-ppe\">offers what critics call a non-apology</a>, saying she is \u201csorry if people feel there has been a failure to supply sufficient PPE\u201d.</p> <h2>13 April</h2> <p>Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, says gaps remain and calls for the government to publicly acknowledge the problem and the reason for it.

      "bodyText": "31 January 2020 A UK representative joins EU member states and commission officials to discuss \u201cthe cluster of pneumonia cases associated with novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China\u201d. Four countries indicate a potential need for personal protective equipment (PPE) \u201cin case of an expanding situation in the EU\u201d. They do not include the UK. 4 February EU countries share observations on the state of supplies of PPE in a meeting of officials from member states and the World Health Organization. An official from the UK attends the meeting in Luxembourg. 24 February A meeting of officials, to which the UK was invited, hears an update from the European commission on the joint procurement of PPE. Commission officials call on countries to confirm \u201ctheir exact needs latest today \u2026 to move forward with next steps\u201d. No representative from the UK attends the meeting. 28 February The EU launches its first joint procurement of \u00a31.2m worth of gloves and gowns/overalls. The UK is not one of the 20 member states involved. 12 March The procurement fails due to a lack of suitable suppliers. It is relaunched on 15 March. The UK is still not involved. 17 March The EU launches two more rounds of joint procurement for masks and goggles and ventilators. The UK is not one of the 25 member states involved. 19 March The UK belatedly takes up an invitation to join the joint procurement agreement steering committee, which makes decisions on mass purchases. The UK does not join a procurement for laboratory supplies that is put out to tender on the same day. 23 March The health secretary, Matt Hancock, admits there have been \u201cchallenges\u201d with the supply of PPE after complaints by doctors and nurses around the country. He drafts in the army to help with distribution. 24 March No 10 says it has not joined EU procurement schemes as the UK is not in the EU and is \u201cmaking our own efforts\u201d. The government later U-turns to say it failed to receive an email inviting it to be part of the initiative. 25 March Health officials from EU countries convene an audio meeting. Representatives of the member states raise the possibility of further procurements and are asked to inform the commission by the following day about their requirements. The UK has been invited to join the meeting, but no representative takes part. 26 March The government says it has 8,175 ventilators, but turns to British industry to help produce 30,000 in a matter of weeks. The engineering company Dyson reveals plans for an entirely new medical ventilator working to specifications set down by the government. 29 March The death of two surgeons from Covid-19, the first doctors to die from the disease, intensifies the pressure on ministers to accelerate the supply of PPE. 10 April Hancock calls on workers to \u201ctreat PPE as the precious resource it is\u201d following weeks of criticism, leading to claims that he is blaming medics for shortages. 11 April Hancock confirms 19 deaths among healthcare workers from coronavirus, a day after it was claimed in the daily Downing Street press conference that it would be inappropriate to provide such information. Priti Patel, the home secretary, offers what critics call a non-apology, saying she is \u201csorry if people feel there has been a failure to supply sufficient PPE\u201d. 13 April Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, says gaps remain and calls for the government to publicly acknowledge the problem and the reason for it. Dominic Raab, deputising for the prime minister, admits to supply problems, saying there is \u201ca competitive market out there\u201d, but declines to apologise.",

By throwing his weight behind Biden, Sanders, is sending a clear signal to his legions of loyal followers that they should align behind the party\u2019s nominee to defeat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cToday, I am asking all Americans, I\u2019m asking every Democrat, I\u2019m asking every independent, I\u2019m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,\u201d the senator from Vermont said, appearing via live stream on a split screen next to Biden, who was hosting the broadcast.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need you in the White House,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make Trump a one-term president. I will do all that I can to make that happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary race last week after falling far behind Biden in the delegate count. In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, he will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates.</p> \n<p>Biden, a former Delaware senator and vice-president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, thanked Sanders for his support.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America,\u201d Biden told Sanders. \u201cYou don\u2019t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIf I am the nominee \u2013 which it looks like now you just made me \u2013 I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern,\u201d Biden told Sanders.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/joe-biden-skeptical-sanders-supporters\">\u2018I know what's at stake\u2019: can Biden win over skeptical Sanders supporters?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Biden still faces deep skepticism from young progressive voters, many of whom supported Sanders by lopsided margins. On Monday, Biden and Sanders announced that their staff had set up six taskforces to help find common ground on policy differences. Those groups will cover the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration, climate change and healthcare.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences. And we\u2019re not going to paper them over, that\u2019s real,\u201d Sanders said. But he expressed an optimism that the working groups would be able to forge policy agreements and concessions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249770830373978112\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Unity. <a href=\"https://t.co/cZxaRCY8jr\">pic.twitter.com/cZxaRCY8jr</a></p>\u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1249770830373978112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 13, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Determined not to repeat the mistakes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a>, when the party struggled to unify, Biden has already started to ramp up his outreach to the party\u2019s left. In recent weeks, he has engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice.</p> \n<p>He has also made overt gestures, adopting a plan by his former rival, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system, embracing elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal and unveiling a plan to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322\">lower</a> the age of eligibility for the Medicare government health insurance program for seniors from 65 to 60.</p> \n<p>Though there are indications Biden will continue to move left on issues like climate change, he is unlikely to adopt Medicare for All, Sanders\u2019 signature policy. Asked recently if the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> changed his position on universal healthcare, Biden said it hadn\u2019t and argued expanding the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/25/obama-healthcare-law-upheld-supreme-court\">Affordable Care Act</a> was still the most effective and efficient way to insure more Americans.</p> \n<p>In a sign of the work that lies ahead, the progressive New York congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, one of Sanders\u2019 most high-profile surrogates, called Biden\u2019s Medicare proposal \u201calmost insulting\u201d and said he would have to go much further if he expects a full-throated endorsement.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s working,\u201d she said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/politics/aoc-progressives-joe-biden.html\">in an interview with the New York Times</a>. \u201cAnd if Biden is only doing things he\u2019s comfortable with, then it\u2019s not enough.\u201d</p> \n<p>There are also limits to Sanders\u2019 ability to deliver the support of his devoted followers, particularly those attracted to his outsider status as an independent railing against the political establishment.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders endorsed his former rival Joe Biden for president on Monday, during a surprise appearance on a live stream related to the US response to the coronavirus pandemic. Sanders\u2019 support of the former vice-president comes at a critical moment in the 2020 campaign, as Biden attempts to unify the party after a fiercely contested primary. By throwing his weight behind Biden, Sanders, is sending a clear signal to his legions of loyal followers that they should align behind the party\u2019s nominee to defeat Donald Trump. \u201cToday, I am asking all Americans, I\u2019m asking every Democrat, I\u2019m asking every independent, I\u2019m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,\u201d the senator from Vermont said, appearing via live stream on a split screen next to Biden, who was hosting the broadcast. \u201cWe need you in the White House,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make Trump a one-term president. I will do all that I can to make that happen.\u201d Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary race last week after falling far behind Biden in the delegate count. In an effort to continue influencing the Democratic platform, he will remain on the ballot in states with remaining primaries to gain delegates. Biden, a former Delaware senator and vice-president, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for the White House, thanked Sanders for his support. \u201cYou\u2019ve been the most powerful voice for a fair and more just America,\u201d Biden told Sanders. \u201cYou don\u2019t get enough credit, Bernie, for being the voice that forces us to take a hard look in the mirror.\u201d \u201cIf I am the nominee \u2013 which it looks like now you just made me \u2013 I really need you, not just to win the campaign but to govern,\u201d Biden told Sanders. Biden still faces deep skepticism from young progressive voters, many of whom supported Sanders by lopsided margins. On Monday, Biden and Sanders announced that their staff had set up six taskforces to help find common ground on policy differences. Those groups will cover the economy, education, criminal justice, immigration, climate change and healthcare. \u201cIt\u2019s no great secret out there, Joe, that you and I have our differences. And we\u2019re not going to paper them over, that\u2019s real,\u201d Sanders said. But he expressed an optimism that the working groups would be able to forge policy agreements and concessions. Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify, Biden has already started to ramp up his outreach to the party\u2019s left. In recent weeks, he has engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice. He has also made overt gestures, adopting a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system, embracing elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal and unveiling a plan to lower the age of eligibility for the Medicare government health insurance program for seniors from 65 to 60. Though there are indications Biden will continue to move left on issues like climate change, he is unlikely to adopt Medicare for All, Sanders\u2019 signature policy. Asked recently if the coronavirus outbreak changed his position on universal healthcare, Biden said it hadn\u2019t and argued expanding the Affordable Care Act was still the most effective and efficient way to insure more Americans. In a sign of the work that lies ahead, the progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of Sanders\u2019 most high-profile surrogates, called Biden\u2019s Medicare proposal \u201calmost insulting\u201d and said he would have to go much further if he expects a full-throated endorsement. \u201cThe whole process of coming together should be uncomfortable for everyone involved \u2013 that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s working,\u201d she said in an interview with the New York Times. \u201cAnd if Biden is only doing things he\u2019s comfortable with, then it\u2019s not enough.\u201d There are also limits to Sanders\u2019 ability to deliver the support of his devoted followers, particularly those attracted to his outsider status as an independent railing against the political establishment. Though Sanders has been careful not to attack Biden in personal terms, some of his most visible backers continue to assail the former vice-president, raising questions about his mental acuity and overall fitness \u2013 a line of attack that Trump has also used against his likely opponent. Despite a hard-fought primary, the former competitors and one-time Senate colleagues displayed sincere affection for one another \u2013 a warm relationship Sanders never shared with his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton. \u201cI appreciate your friendship, and I promise you I will not let you down,\u201d Biden told Sanders. In reply, Sanders said: \u201cI know you are the kind of guy who is going to be inclusive. You want to bring people in \u2013 even people who disagree with you.\u201d After exchanging questions on raising the minimum wage, and the US economy, they joked that they should end the live-cast by playing a game of chess. \u201cWe\u2019ll bore everybody for a few hours,\u201d Sanders said.",

OCE was set up by a series of 1990s ballot measures \u201c<a href=\"https://oce.oregon.gov/content/OCE_About_Us.asp\">to operate like a private sector business</a>\u201d; on average inmates <a href=\"https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2019/apr/2/oregon-prison-industry-program-nets-record-285-million-prisoners-earn-125hour/\">reportedly </a>get paid $1.25 an hour working for the program.</p> <p>Although the inmate wrote that TRCI has introduced some social distancing measures at the prison, including by staggering inmate exercise and dining and barring outside visitors (\u201cno visitors, no education teachers, no church services\u201d), he argued that these efforts are being undone by the working conditions in OCE\u2019s wood shop and its laundry facility.</p> <p>Work at the facilities has continued even after <a href=\"https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/23/coronavirus-gov-kate-brown-orders-oregonians-stay-home-combat-covid-19/2899879001/\">proclamations</a> by the governor regarding social distancing, and as major clients like schools and outdoor recreational facilities are on lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cSeveral laundry workers and wood shop workers have been sick with colds but none have been tested only examined by nurses and told to stay at home until they feel better,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>According to his letter, inmates at work at the facilities are not able to practice adequate social distancing, and are being lined up and patted down on their way in and out of the workshops, with some but not all supervisors wearing gloves. They worry that workers at the laundry facility are handling hospital linen that is potentially contaminated with the virus.</p> <p>In the OCE break room, he said, inmates are \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d, and unable to socially distance. Large numbers of prisoners are handling hot water and milk dispensers, which are not being frequently cleaned. OCE workers only have access to one small bathroom.</p> <p>\u201cWe all use the same bathroom 5 stalls and one urinal,\u201d the inmate wrote. \u201cWe all touch the same soap dispenser and same buttons to wash hands after using bathroom. We also all touch the same spray bottles of disinfectant to spray off toilet seat before you use it. We all touch the same door,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Inmates are being threatened with punishment by TRCI if they refuse to work OCE shifts, he said in the letter. He told his mother that inmates refusing to work risked being sent to more crowded medium-security accommodation, and that if he would quit the job he would risk losing his honor housing, benefits and special privileges.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29b18f37088d838a8bffa98ad9675662f9bd0aa6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29b18f37088d838a8bffa98ad9675662f9bd0aa6/0_0_2042_906/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We all touch the same soap dispenser and same buttons to wash hands after using bathroom.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"444\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We all touch the same soap dispenser and same buttons to wash hands after using bathroom.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Inmate at Two Rivers correctional institution</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though independent of Oregon\u2019s department of corrections (ODOC), as a quasi-government business, OCE uses inmate labor in facilities within prison complexes to make goods like furniture and signage, often for schools, outdoor recreation sites and the prison system itself.

Keeping the AICs engaged in work helps keep the prisons safer (they are occupied and have something to focus time and attention to).

Laundry is washed in accordance with decontamination practices recommended by the CDC,\u201d the March 2020 issue brief says.</p> <p>ODOC\u2019s approach to the coronavirus crisis has been uneven and confused, Juan Chavez, the director of the Civil Rights Project at the Oregon Justice Resource Center, told the Guardian. Chavez is leading a class-action suit launched against ODOC that alleges that the department has \u201cwillfully and wantonly ignored the public health threat caused by this global pandemic\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A handwritten plea from an Oregon prisoner to his family a week ago describes conditions in the state\u2019s prison system as a public health catastrophe waiting to happen, amid a lack of social distancing practices in the system\u2019s moneymaking arm. \u201cThere is no way it should be legal for a few hundred inmates to be forced to work around each other so close with the potential risk and how far [the coronavirus] could spread,\u201d wrote the inmate at the Two Rivers correctional institution (TRCI) near Umatilla, Oregon. The Guardian is withholding the inmate\u2019s name due to his fears of retribution from prison authorities. \u201cI see all the stay at home orders of non-essential workers and can\u2019t believe we are still being made to work,\u201d the inmate added. Prison protests in Oregon and Washington on Wednesday night highlighted growing concerns among inmates about the way authorities in the Pacific north-west states are managing the safety of incarcerated people amid the coronavirus pandemic. State government documents obtained by the Guardian suggest that authorities in at least some of the states were informed of best practices recommended by public health authorities, but accounts from inmates and advocates indicate their implementation may be scattered at best. The prisoner, who is held in minimum security at Two Rivers correctional institution, said that inmates are being exposed to unsafe conditions as they perform work in facilities run by Oregon Correctional Enterprises (OCE), the state\u2019s prison industry program. OCE was set up by a series of 1990s ballot measures \u201cto operate like a private sector business\u201d; on average inmates reportedly get paid $1.25 an hour working for the program. Although the inmate wrote that TRCI has introduced some social distancing measures at the prison, including by staggering inmate exercise and dining and barring outside visitors (\u201cno visitors, no education teachers, no church services\u201d), he argued that these efforts are being undone by the working conditions in OCE\u2019s wood shop and its laundry facility. Work at the facilities has continued even after proclamations by the governor regarding social distancing, and as major clients like schools and outdoor recreational facilities are on lockdown. \u201cSeveral laundry workers and wood shop workers have been sick with colds but none have been tested only examined by nurses and told to stay at home until they feel better,\u201d he wrote. According to his letter, inmates at work at the facilities are not able to practice adequate social distancing, and are being lined up and patted down on their way in and out of the workshops, with some but not all supervisors wearing gloves. They worry that workers at the laundry facility are handling hospital linen that is potentially contaminated with the virus. In the OCE break room, he said, inmates are \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d, and unable to socially distance. Large numbers of prisoners are handling hot water and milk dispensers, which are not being frequently cleaned. OCE workers only have access to one small bathroom. \u201cWe all use the same bathroom 5 stalls and one urinal,\u201d the inmate wrote. \u201cWe all touch the same soap dispenser and same buttons to wash hands after using bathroom. We also all touch the same spray bottles of disinfectant to spray off toilet seat before you use it. We all touch the same door,\u201d he said. Inmates are being threatened with punishment by TRCI if they refuse to work OCE shifts, he said in the letter. He told his mother that inmates refusing to work risked being sent to more crowded medium-security accommodation, and that if he would quit the job he would risk losing his honor housing, benefits and special privileges. Though independent of Oregon\u2019s department of corrections (ODOC), as a quasi-government business, OCE uses inmate labor in facilities within prison complexes to make goods like furniture and signage, often for schools, outdoor recreation sites and the prison system itself. OCE workers also perform services like laundry. OCE\u2019s director, Ken Jeske, and representatives of the ODOC offered no substantive reply to the Guardian\u2019s repeated, detailed questions on Scott\u2019s allegations. He said OCE\u2019s communications director, Jennifer Starbuck, \u201cwill follow up with DOC on your request in a reasonable amount of time\u201d. In correspondence with an inmate\u2019s concerned relative on 27 March, however, Starbuck emphasized OCE\u2019s financial requirements, and claimed that continuing work made the prisons safer. \u201cAll of the OCE staff working are essential,\u201d Starbuck wrote. She continued: \u201cOCE funding comes from the services and products we produce, through the work and training opportunities we provide to the AICs [Adults in Custody] in our shops. Keeping the AICs engaged in work helps keep the prisons safer (they are occupied and have something to focus time and attention to). All of the work assignments in OCE are voluntary.\u201d Starbuck offered no evidence for her claims about work and safety, and OCE did not respond to specific requests for such evidence. In an issues brief and in emails between Starbuck and the concerned relative, OCE acknowledged that hospital laundry is being handled by its workers, but claims that its processes comply with CDC directives. \u201cOCE laundry follows all guidelines set forth by the CDC for washing and drying of healthcare linen. Laundry is washed in accordance with decontamination practices recommended by the CDC,\u201d the March 2020 issue brief says. ODOC\u2019s approach to the coronavirus crisis has been uneven and confused, Juan Chavez, the director of the Civil Rights Project at the Oregon Justice Resource Center, told the Guardian. Chavez is leading a class-action suit launched against ODOC that alleges that the department has \u201cwillfully and wantonly ignored the public health threat caused by this global pandemic\u201d. ODOC did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s repeated request for comment on the suit. \u201cHalf-measures\u201d have been adopted in some places, Chavez said, but overall the system showed a \u201cpatchwork of solutions\u201d. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s one step forward, three steps back.\u201d Meanwhile, in the neighboring state of Washington, an outbreak in Monroe prison led to a riot on Wednesday, as prisoners objected to what they saw as inadequate protections in the facility. Several prisoners at Monroe have tested positive for Covid-19. But last month Washington\u2019s department of health (WDOH) circulated a literature review outlining scholarly literature and a body of guidelines from other states and countries indicating best practices and ways to prepare for epidemics in prison settings. The literature, and the document itself, spells out a list of dangers that reflect the concerns of prisoners, including the Oregon inmate. \u201cKey concerns for correctional facilities and pandemic preparedness include crowding, shared living spaces, high turnover, population flow patterns, health care resources, staff absenteeism, and interaction with the general population\u201d, the literature review says. The document lists a number of studies and guidelines which offer clear and specific preparations and action plans for prisons. A 2006 document, Infectious Diseases in Corrections Report, contains a section entitled Pandemic flu preparedness and response in corrections facilities, produced by a researcher at the Institute for Biosecurity at Saint Louis University school of public health. The document counsels that prisoners are especially vulnerable in pandemics. \u201cDuring an influenza pandemic,\u201d the document says, \u201cinmates may be particularly vulnerable to infection due to the close quarters in which most live as well as the relatively high prevalence of co-morbid health conditions.\u201d It says that \u201cprison overcrowding \u2013 a serious problem in many facilities \u2013 is a major contributor to disease spread\u201d. It goes on to warn about anticipated problems like access to hospitals, staff absenteeism and the difficulty of isolation and treatment in a prison setting. A 2009 document collated in the literature review, Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Planning, was produced by a consortium of US correctional medical officers and scientists. It offers clear guidelines for preparing correctional facilities for pandemics, including: \u201cAssess the need to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, surgical masks, respirators, and protective clothing\u201d; \u201cEnsure that alternative supervision strategies are compatible with the pandemic plans of public health, law enforcement, the judiciary, and (other) correctional facilities\u201d; and \u201cminimize the number of face-to-face contacts\u201d. Neither WDOH nor WDOC responded to repeated, detailed requests for comment on whether they had jointly discussed this literature since the review\u2019s release on 3 March, and whether WDOC had implemented any of the recommendations and guidelines. The not-for-profit Columbia Legal Services this week filed an emergency motion to force Washington to take greater measures to address the outbreak in Monroe prison. Nick Straley, an attorney and assistant deputy director of advocacy with the organization, said: \u201cThere\u2019s an almost unanimous sense among public health officials that releases have to occur in order to reduce the number of people in prisons in Washington. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another facilities that are overcrowded. We\u2019ve got people sleeping on the floor of cells designed for two people. They\u2019re crammed with people, people are on top of each other,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the extent that department of corrections to date has refused to release anyone, we think that they have clearly not stepped up and done what\u2019s essential.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As some of the world\u2019s richest countries became centres of the coronavirus pandemic, politicians and populations temporarily glimpsed the abyss. By simultaneously attacking citizens\u2019 health and threatening their incomes, the spread of the disease presented an unprecedented challenge to societies in which economic stability was taken for granted. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">Safety nets had to be re</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\" title=\"\">invented</a> overnight to protect individuals and businesses during lockdown, while health service capacity was urgently ramped up.

As the virus spreads in sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and the Middle East, the same twin threats to life and livelihoods are now faced by heavily indebted states with under-resourced healthcare systems. But the kind of financial stimulus undertaken in the west is an impossibility. Without significant and immediate assistance from the global community, the consequences could be catastrophic.</p> <p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"http://northafricapost.com/39929-who-urges-african-states-to-do-more-tests-as-coronavirus-peak-approaches.html\" title=\"\">has warned</a> that Africa may soon face \u201ca huge peak\u201d in coronavirus infections. Yemen, where the health system has been broken by five years of war, announced its first case on Friday. In many of the countries now bracing for the worst, limited access to clean water and cramped communal living conditions will hamper the battle against the virus\u2019s spread. There are acute shortages of testing equipment and ventilators. In locked-down rural economies, food supplies may be jeopardised.</p> <p>The global fall in commodity prices <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/sub-saharan-africa-g20-imf-world-bank-debt-relief-coronavirus\" title=\"\">has already hit sub-Saharan Africa</a> hard, slowing exports and depriving countries of vital hard currency. Capital flight to the dollar, as investors seek a safe haven during the crisis, has further exposed fragile economies. As the picture grows ever bleaker, the World Bank has predicted the region\u2019s first recession for 25 years. A study for the UN has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-push-half-a-billion-people-into-poverty-oxfam-warns\" title=\"\">estimated</a> that measures taken to combat the pandemic could nullify 30 years of progress in the fight against poverty.</p> <p>This week, G20 finance ministers, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can coordinate the action necessary when they meet for online spring conferences. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/dozens-poorer-nations-seek-imf-help-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">More than 80 poor and middle-income countries</a> have already written to the IMF seeking urgent financial help.

      "bodyText": "As some of the world\u2019s richest countries became centres of the coronavirus pandemic, politicians and populations temporarily glimpsed the abyss. By simultaneously attacking citizens\u2019 health and threatening their incomes, the spread of the disease presented an unprecedented challenge to societies in which economic stability was taken for granted. Safety nets had to be reinvented overnight to protect individuals and businesses during lockdown, while health service capacity was urgently ramped up. In London, Washington, Berlin and Paris, measures costing billions of pounds were rightly signed off by governments with scarcely a second thought. What the developed countries did for their own economies is now desperately required for the poorest nations of the world. As the virus spreads in sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and the Middle East, the same twin threats to life and livelihoods are now faced by heavily indebted states with under-resourced healthcare systems. But the kind of financial stimulus undertaken in the west is an impossibility. Without significant and immediate assistance from the global community, the consequences could be catastrophic. The World Health Organization has warned that Africa may soon face \u201ca huge peak\u201d in coronavirus infections. Yemen, where the health system has been broken by five years of war, announced its first case on Friday. In many of the countries now bracing for the worst, limited access to clean water and cramped communal living conditions will hamper the battle against the virus\u2019s spread. There are acute shortages of testing equipment and ventilators. In locked-down rural economies, food supplies may be jeopardised. The global fall in commodity prices has already hit sub-Saharan Africa hard, slowing exports and depriving countries of vital hard currency. Capital flight to the dollar, as investors seek a safe haven during the crisis, has further exposed fragile economies. As the picture grows ever bleaker, the World Bank has predicted the region\u2019s first recession for 25 years. A study for the UN has estimated that measures taken to combat the pandemic could nullify 30 years of progress in the fight against poverty. This week, G20 finance ministers, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can coordinate the action necessary when they meet for online spring conferences. More than 80 poor and middle-income countries have already written to the IMF seeking urgent financial help. So far, additional loans have been made available to governments desperately needing to boost healthcare capacity. Far more is needed. There must be a moratorium on debt repayments from poorer nations to lender countries, multilateral institutions and private creditors (around $44bn is due from Africa alone). This money must stay where it will be needed to provide income support and save lives. Even more importantly, the IMF should be given the funds to finance health spending and an economic stimulus on the vast scale that will be required. The IMF estimated last month that the financing needs of distressed emerging economies will be at least $2.5tn. Its member states should agree to allow the fund to make money available through additional special drawing rights, the mechanism devised after the 2008 crash to boost international liquidity. As the coronavirus crisis has unfolded, there has thus far been a lamentable absence of global leadership. History will judge the more prosperous nations harshly if they fail to act decisively to help the world\u2019s poor in this hour of need.",

A dearth of such essentials puts the lives of doctors, nurses and care workers at risk, and causes unbearable sadness. Instead of saying sorry for the shortages, ministers use the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/priti-patel-says-sorry-if-people-feel-there-have-been-failings-over-ppe\" title=\"\">shameful evasion</a> of acknowledging <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tory-alok-sharma-says-hes-21853572\" title=\"\">their regret</a> if the public feels let down. A sincere ministerial apology is long overdue.</p> <p>The Sars-CoV-2 virus is deadlier and spreads faster than earlier viral pathogens. The timing of the outbreak could not have been exactly foretold. But it was likely and getting likelier because of climate change, rising population growth and the globalisation of travel. Ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/uk-strategy-to-address-pandemic-threat-not-properly-implemented\" title=\"\">cannot avoid responsibility</a> for the unfolding catastrophe. They underestimated the resilience of the population to a repressive lockdown, citing modellers\u2019 warnings that this \u201c<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873723/03-potential-effect-of-non-pharmaceutical-interventions-npis-on-a-Covid-19-epidemic-in-the-UK.pdf\" title=\"\">would result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted</a>\u201d. Yet within days the government shifted its view. While the advice \u2013 and even the advisers \u2013 can change, it is the task of those in office to take decisions. Ministers can be guided by counsel, but they cannot hide behind it. To contain the virus, nations must quickly develop a test and use it to identify infected people, isolate them and trace those they\u2019ve had contact with. Two countries with comparable populations to the UK \u2013 Germany and South Korea \u2013 have done so. We did not. Germany is testing more than five times as many of its citizens as the UK, and its death toll is less than a third. South Korea, a country of 52 million people, has recorded just <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\" title=\"\">217 deaths</a> \u2013 43 times fewer deaths per head of population than the UK, where more than 11,000 have died.</p> <p>Ministers say they took \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/foreign-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-9-april-2020\" title=\"\">the right decisions at the right time</a>\u201d. Yet the evidence is that shutting down Britain earlier would have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/laineydoyle/status/1249127908876128259\" title=\"\">saved lives</a>. By the time ministers acted, the Covid-19 virus had spread faster and wider than might have been the case, by which point the materials and equipment needed were harder to procure. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, compares his job stocking the NHS with personal protective equipment every week to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-52248190/coronavirus-hancock-says-ppe-distribution-a-herculean-logistical-effort\" title=\"\">a task of Hercules</a>. A more apt figure from Greek mythology might be Sisyphus, who was condemned by the gods to push a rock to the top of a mountain, only for it to roll back down again so he had to repeat the punishment.</p> <p>Both <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d979c0e9-4806-4852-a49a-bbffa9cecfe6\" title=\"\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing\" title=\"\">South Korea</a> have well-resourced health systems and a political culture of being responsive to their citizens. The UK has spent the last decade rewarding the NHS with the <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/spending-english-nhs/\" title=\"\">lowest funding settlement</a> for decades and its frontline staff with tiny pay rises. Covid-19 has shown that a well-run and properly funded state is the difference between living and dying. A decade of Conservative administrations, with an antipathy to the public sector, has meant it is safer to be in Seoul than London. The job of government is to protect its citizens. It is an indictment of ministers\u2019 actions that the UK state has proved not resilient and strong enough to do so.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Coronavirus is a disaster that we should have been prepared for, because it was expected. In 2015, the government\u2019s national risk register of potential calamities calculated that there was between a one in 20 and a one in two chance of pandemic influenza hitting the United Kingdom within five years, with catastrophic results. You would not bet against those odds. But we did. Rather than using the risk assessment to justify major investments, the country stockpiled an inadequate supply of masks, ventilators and gowns in hospitals, and body bags in mortuaries. A dearth of such essentials puts the lives of doctors, nurses and care workers at risk, and causes unbearable sadness. Instead of saying sorry for the shortages, ministers use the shameful evasion of acknowledging their regret if the public feels let down. A sincere ministerial apology is long overdue. The Sars-CoV-2 virus is deadlier and spreads faster than earlier viral pathogens. The timing of the outbreak could not have been exactly foretold. But it was likely and getting likelier because of climate change, rising population growth and the globalisation of travel. Ministers cannot avoid responsibility for the unfolding catastrophe. They underestimated the resilience of the population to a repressive lockdown, citing modellers\u2019 warnings that this \u201cwould result in a large second epidemic once measures were lifted\u201d. Yet within days the government shifted its view. While the advice \u2013 and even the advisers \u2013 can change, it is the task of those in office to take decisions. Ministers can be guided by counsel, but they cannot hide behind it. To contain the virus, nations must quickly develop a test and use it to identify infected people, isolate them and trace those they\u2019ve had contact with. Two countries with comparable populations to the UK \u2013 Germany and South Korea \u2013 have done so. We did not. Germany is testing more than five times as many of its citizens as the UK, and its death toll is less than a third. South Korea, a country of 52 million people, has recorded just 217 deaths \u2013 43 times fewer deaths per head of population than the UK, where more than 11,000 have died. Ministers say they took \u201cthe right decisions at the right time\u201d. Yet the evidence is that shutting down Britain earlier would have saved lives. By the time ministers acted, the Covid-19 virus had spread faster and wider than might have been the case, by which point the materials and equipment needed were harder to procure. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, compares his job stocking the NHS with personal protective equipment every week to a task of Hercules. A more apt figure from Greek mythology might be Sisyphus, who was condemned by the gods to push a rock to the top of a mountain, only for it to roll back down again so he had to repeat the punishment. Both Germany and South Korea have well-resourced health systems and a political culture of being responsive to their citizens. The UK has spent the last decade rewarding the NHS with the lowest funding settlement for decades and its frontline staff with tiny pay rises. Covid-19 has shown that a well-run and properly funded state is the difference between living and dying. A decade of Conservative administrations, with an antipathy to the public sector, has meant it is safer to be in Seoul than London. The job of government is to protect its citizens. It is an indictment of ministers\u2019 actions that the UK state has proved not resilient and strong enough to do so.",

That is why I am announcing the strict lockdown will continue until Monday 11 May.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate the effort I am asking of you,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is new hope but nothing is won at the moment \u2026 the epidemic is not under control.\u201d</p> <p>It was Macron\u2019s fourth televised address since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis and expectations were high, not just that he would make concrete announcements but that he would give some direction and reassurance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=France\" data-alt=\"French deaths\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=France\">French deaths</a> </figure>  <p>Hospital admissions and death rates appear to have levelled off \u2013 though as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of France\u2019s health authority, has repeated, they remain at a \u201chigh level\u201d \u2013 and the French were keen to know if and when the four-week lockdown restrictions may be eased.</p> <p>In a 30-minute speech marked by a tone of humility, Macron gave an explanation, a response and a calendar for the next few weeks.</p> <p>He admitted several times that there had been failings in dealing with the pandemic, particularly with the lack of masks and equipment, but promised that by 11 May there would be enough tests for \u201cthe elderly, health workers and the most vulnerable\u201d and masks for everyone.</p> <p>\u201cWere we prepared? No. Clearly not enough. There were failings, there was a lack of material,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Macron added that the coming four weeks would be used to obtain more tests, masks and equipment, and organise financial aid not only for businesses but for those families in a precarious situation.</p> <p>\u201cThese are difficult days and we are now feeling afraid and anxious for our parents and ourselves,\u201d Macron said.</p> <p>From 11 May, creches, schools, colleges and lyc\u00e9es will be \u201cprogressively opened\u201d as a priority, he said.</p> <p>\u201cMany children are missing out of school and there is an inequality in that there are those who don\u2019t have access to the internet and can\u2019t be helped by their parents.\u201d</p> <p>While schools will open from 11 May, Macrons said restaurants, cafes, hotels, museums and cultural sites must stay closed and large festivals and events may only be allowed after mid-July.</p> <p>Macron made reference to EU solidarity and the need to support African countries, including the possibility of cancelling their debt.</p> <p>He said France\u2019s borders with non-EU countries would remain closed. This is not thought to include the UK, as Britain is still in the Brexit transition period.</p> <p>He concluded: \u201cWe have to reinvent ourselves, and me first of all \u2026 We are vulnerable. When can we hope for an end to this? I understand you have many questions and I would like to answer all of them. But I say in all humility, we don\u2019t have definitive answers today.</p> <p>\u201cWe will share with you what we know and what we don\u2019t know, we will come out of this, but we still have several months of living with this virus.\u201d</p> <p>Macron added: \u201cTake care of yourselves and each other and we will get through this.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, has announced that the country will remain in coronavirus lockdown for another month. In a national address on Monday evening, he said that only by respecting the confinement rules would the battle against Covid-19 be won. Macron said France would start returning to normal life on 11 May, if citizens were \u201ccivic, responsible and respected the rules\u201d \u2013 and if the number of cases of coronavirus continued to drop. \u201cWe have to continue our efforts; the more the rules are respected the more lives will be saved. That is why I am announcing the strict lockdown will continue until Monday 11 May.\u201d \u201cI appreciate the effort I am asking of you,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThere is new hope but nothing is won at the moment \u2026 the epidemic is not under control.\u201d It was Macron\u2019s fourth televised address since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis and expectations were high, not just that he would make concrete announcements but that he would give some direction and reassurance. Hospital admissions and death rates appear to have levelled off \u2013 though as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of France\u2019s health authority, has repeated, they remain at a \u201chigh level\u201d \u2013 and the French were keen to know if and when the four-week lockdown restrictions may be eased. In a 30-minute speech marked by a tone of humility, Macron gave an explanation, a response and a calendar for the next few weeks. He admitted several times that there had been failings in dealing with the pandemic, particularly with the lack of masks and equipment, but promised that by 11 May there would be enough tests for \u201cthe elderly, health workers and the most vulnerable\u201d and masks for everyone. \u201cWere we prepared? No. Clearly not enough. There were failings, there was a lack of material,\u201d he said. Macron added that the coming four weeks would be used to obtain more tests, masks and equipment, and organise financial aid not only for businesses but for those families in a precarious situation. \u201cThese are difficult days and we are now feeling afraid and anxious for our parents and ourselves,\u201d Macron said. From 11 May, creches, schools, colleges and lyc\u00e9es will be \u201cprogressively opened\u201d as a priority, he said. \u201cMany children are missing out of school and there is an inequality in that there are those who don\u2019t have access to the internet and can\u2019t be helped by their parents.\u201d While schools will open from 11 May, Macrons said restaurants, cafes, hotels, museums and cultural sites must stay closed and large festivals and events may only be allowed after mid-July. Macron made reference to EU solidarity and the need to support African countries, including the possibility of cancelling their debt. He said France\u2019s borders with non-EU countries would remain closed. This is not thought to include the UK, as Britain is still in the Brexit transition period. He concluded: \u201cWe have to reinvent ourselves, and me first of all \u2026 We are vulnerable. When can we hope for an end to this? I understand you have many questions and I would like to answer all of them. But I say in all humility, we don\u2019t have definitive answers today. \u201cWe will share with you what we know and what we don\u2019t know, we will come out of this, but we still have several months of living with this virus.\u201d Macron added: \u201cTake care of yourselves and each other and we will get through this.\u201d",

Any colleagues who had potential contact with the man have been placed into isolation as a precaution.</p> <p>BHP said in a statement that the worker\u2019s diagnosis was due to the successful operation of screening processes for remote workers before they return to mine sites. It said strict social distancing, hygiene and cleaning practices were in place at the mine.</p> <p>The CFMEU mining and energy division\u2019s Queensland president Stephen Smyth has raised concerns about \u201cmultiple points of potential cross-contamination\u201d, including on machinery, transport to mine sites, mess facilities and camp accommodation.<br><br>\u201cWorkers across the whole operation needed reassurance that all of these risks have been identified, that they are being managed, and that all potential exposure will be appropriately tracked,\u201d Smyth said.</p> <p>The Queensland government this month closed its borders to non-essential fly-in workers, but large numbers continue to cycle through communities from Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton.</p> <p>Among miners, the situation has exposed a schism dividing many of those who base themselves in nearby communities and those who live remotely and stay in camps during their roster periods.</p> <p>Many locals are fearful of the impact of any coronavirus outbreak in a remote location and want the regular stream of fly-in and drive-in workers stopped.</p> <p>In Moranbah, for instance, there are seven hospital beds, two ventilators and no intensive care unit.

      "bodyText": "Community leaders in central Queensland say they fear it is now \u201ctoo late\u201d to impose tougher restrictions on the mass movements of workers heading to isolated mining communities, after the first coronavirus case was confirmed of a Bowen Basin coalminer. Locals in towns including Moranbah, Clermont and Emerald have told Guardian Australia they are increasingly anxious that large numbers of remote workers continue to cycle through camps and mine sites on a weekly basis. Some are refusing shifts out of concern for their health. BHP confirmed on Friday that a Rockhampton-based worker at the BHP-Mitsubishi Alliance Blackwater mine had tested positive for Covid-19. He was last at the mine site on 1 April. Anne Baker, the mayor of the Isaac Regional Council, which covers the northern section of the Bowen Basin, said isolated resources communities would be devastated by any potential outbreak. Baker said the situation was also a risk to mine operators, who would be forced to cease operations if workers on site became infected. \u201cFor weeks now we have been calling on [Queensland] government to implement tighter restrictions on mass movements of workers coming into region,\u201d Baker said. \u201cConfirmed community transmission is too late to trigger stronger action. \u201cOur regional health system, the critical resources industry and our hard-working communities will all be devastated by an outbreak in our regional areas where mining continues to underpin the national economy.\u201d \u201cGet them into our region healthy and safely, and keep them here longer as has been adopted within resources industry in other states.\u201d It is understood the infected mineworker travelled from Rockhampton to Blackwater and back by bus during his last roster period, returning on 1 April. Any colleagues who had potential contact with the man have been placed into isolation as a precaution. BHP said in a statement that the worker\u2019s diagnosis was due to the successful operation of screening processes for remote workers before they return to mine sites. It said strict social distancing, hygiene and cleaning practices were in place at the mine. The CFMEU mining and energy division\u2019s Queensland president Stephen Smyth has raised concerns about \u201cmultiple points of potential cross-contamination\u201d, including on machinery, transport to mine sites, mess facilities and camp accommodation. \u201cWorkers across the whole operation needed reassurance that all of these risks have been identified, that they are being managed, and that all potential exposure will be appropriately tracked,\u201d Smyth said. The Queensland government this month closed its borders to non-essential fly-in workers, but large numbers continue to cycle through communities from Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton. Among miners, the situation has exposed a schism dividing many of those who base themselves in nearby communities and those who live remotely and stay in camps during their roster periods. Many locals are fearful of the impact of any coronavirus outbreak in a remote location and want the regular stream of fly-in and drive-in workers stopped. In Moranbah, for instance, there are seven hospital beds, two ventilators and no intensive care unit. A local GP, Margaret Swenson, told the ABC last week that if coronavirus spread to work camps \u201cthen we\u2019re in real strife\u201d. A drive-in, drive-out worker based at Mackay told Guardian Australia he was considering declining future work over concerns about incidental contamination on transport to mine sites. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen the mining companies are going so far out of their way to keep people doing the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure they have stopped 99% of contacts. But I still look around every time and think, if one bugger has the virus then there\u2019s no way they can do anything to stop more people getting it. \u201cIt\u2019s starting to get heated too, some of the stuff that\u2019s said to [drive-in, drive-out] guys, or some of the stuff you read on social media. There\u2019s always a bit of a divide between the two groups but it\u2019s almost nasty. If one person does the wrong thing then we\u2019ll all be blamed.\u201d Baker said the solution was to drastically reduce movements of people by seeking to house remote workers in mining communities for the foreseeable future. \u201cIt will be hard for workers to live away for extended periods of time, however this may be a small price to keep families safe, workers employed and doing their essential role to support an economy desperate for productivity,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe must keep the mines open and people in jobs, but not at the expense of lives.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Democratic governors in the north-east and west coast on Monday announced separate pacts to coordinate efforts to begin reopening society amid the coronavirus pandemic. On the east coast, New York\u2019s Governor Andrew Cuomo announced several north-east states would work together on determining when to reopen the economy. Cuomo said each of the six states would participate in a working group to make decisions on how and when stay-at-home orders can be relaxed without jeopardizing public health. Meanwhile the governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar project for the west coast. The governors made separate announcements just hours after Donald Trump said on Twitter that it was his decision to decide when to \u201copen up the states\u201d, a claim that has been contradicted by constitutional experts. The governors did not announce specific plans on how to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses. Instead, both groups said they would coordinate those decisions while first considering the health of residents. Cuomo said the state governments\u2019 decisions about how to reopen the economy would be \u201cguided by experts, data and science\u201d and would not be done \u201cin a political way\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s be smart, let\u2019s be cooperative and let\u2019s learn from each other,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThe house is still on fire. We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we\u2019re going to need \u2026 to make sure this doesn\u2019t reignite,\u201d said Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey. Rhode Island\u2019s Governor Gina Raimondo added: \u201cThe reality is, this virus doesn\u2019t care about state borders, and our response shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d On the west coast, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington \u2013 together home to more than 50 million people \u2013 announced a similar \u201cwestern states pact\u201d that would rely on a shared approach to reopening their economies and containing the virus\u2019s spread. In a joint statement on Monday, Gavin Newsom, Kate Brown and Jay Inslee, respectively the governors of California, Oregon and Washington, said that while each state is building a state-specific plan, the three states have agreed to a framework that focuses on working together, putting their residents\u2019 health first, and relying on health outcomes and science to guide their decisions. \u201cCovid-19 has preyed upon our interconnectedness.

      "bodyText": "Running for high office in the midst of a pandemic has forced candidates in South Korea to abandon tried and tested campaigning methods, as the country prepares to become the first to hold a national election since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. With a few exceptions, they have swapped handshakes for elbow bumps and delivered speeches from behind masks to small groups rather than hold mass rallies. Kissing babies is out of the question. In less tumultuous times, the 15 April elections would have been dominated by job creation, wages and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. But they have been overshadowed by president Moon Jae-in\u2019s response to the pandemic. Early indications are that the virus has failed to deter voters, with predictions of a record turnout by the time all the votes for the 300-seat national assembly have been cast on Wednesday evening. On Friday, more than 5 million people cast their ballots early \u2013 a record high since advance voting was introduced seven years ago. Like millions of his compatriots, Moon arrived at a polling station wearing a mask, and was not allowed to vote until he had passed a temperature test, washed his hands and put on plastic gloves. South Korea has won praise from the World Health Organization for its success in bringing the outbreak under control, with more than a dozen world leaders seeking Seoul\u2019s advice on quarantine measures and requesting test kits. Nearly 60% of survey respondents approved of Moon\u2019s response to the pandemic. \u201cIn times of a national disaster or crisis, the ruling camp would usually be on the defensive. But the recent slowing of the outbreak appears to have turned the tide in their favour,\u201d said Yang Seung-ham, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul. South Korea has brought daily known infections to about 50 or below, down from the late February peak of more than 900, through a combination of aggressive testing, monitoring, social distancing and strict quarantine for overseas arrivals. It has had a total of 10,537 cases, with 217 deaths, as of the afternoon of Monday 13 April, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Well over 7,000 infected people have recovered from the illness. The country\u2019s response is expected to give Moon\u2019s Democratic party of Korea an unexpected boost, after a year of political scandals and criticism of his record on jobs and young people\u2019s living standards. His approval ratings reached a 16-month high last week, a poll by researchers at Realmeter showed, while his party\u2019s popularity was 15% higher than the conservative main opposition United Future party. \u201cWe were terrified several weeks ago, but thanks to the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, we think we will do much better than we had previously thought,\u201d a senior ruling party official said. The virus has transformed the mechanics of voting for millions of South Koreans amid concern that polling stations could trigger a second wave of infections, just as the country appears to be bringing the outbreak under control. More than 3,500 polling stations have been disinfected and all voters are required to use hand sanitiser and wear a mask and gloves. Those who fail a temperature check are directed to special booths, while separate polling stations have been set up for more than 3,000 Covid-19 patients and 900 medical workers in Seoul and the city of Daegu, until recently the centre of South Korea\u2019s infections. People in quarantine will be allowed to vote by mail from home. Many voters agreed that the elections should go ahead, even if it meant longer waits outside polling stations. \u201cAs long as people take all the necessary precautions, the elections should go ahead,\u201d said Jeon Young-gyun, a 55-year-old resident of Suwon in Gyeonggi province. \u201cVoting is the best way to protect democracy \u2026 it\u2019s our right as citizens.\u201d But Lee Yong-joo, a 79-year-old voter from Seoul, was having second thoughts. \u201cI have voted all my life so I hope to do the same this week, but I\u2019m afraid about going out these days,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number of infections is falling, but the mortality rate among older people is still worrying so I\u2019m not sure if I should risk it.\u201d Some were critical of parties for turning the campaign into a bidding war, with rival offers of cash payouts for voters whose livelihoods have been ruined by the outbreak. \u201cThe candidates should stop exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to win votes,\u201d said Park Seon-min, a young voter in the capital who was appalled to see some candidates hugging voters and shouting political slogans despite not wearing a mask. \u201cThe parties are offering different compensation packages, and it\u2019s not good to see.
