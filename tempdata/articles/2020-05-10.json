      "bodyText": "This blog has now closed. Please follow our continuing coverage below: The novel coronavirus has killed at least 277,127 people since the outbreak first emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by news agency AFP. At least 4,001,437 cases of coronavirus have been registered in 195 countries and territories. Of these, at least 1,312,900 are now considered recovered. The tallies, using data collected by AFP from national authorities and information from the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections, as many countries are testing only the most serious cases. The US has the highest number of total deaths worldwide at 78,320, with the UK second-highest at 31,587 deaths. Italy, Spain and France follow, with China, the home of the virus, recording less than 5000 fatalities. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Russia hit by 10,000 new cases as total infections near 200,000 Russia has been hit with more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last day, as the country approaches nearly 200,000 confirmed infections and lockdown measures continue. Lagos could be put on lockdown again after social distancing rules disregarded Nigeria\u2019s largest city, Lagos, could return to lockdown if residents continue to ignore social distancing rules, its governor warned on Saturday. UK death toll rises by 346 as coastguard warns lockdown flouters The UK death toll has risen by 346 to 31,587 across all settings, while 215,260 have tested positive, an increase of 3,896 cases on Friday. Meanwhile, the coastguard recorded the highest number of incidents in one day since the lockdown began as people \u201cignored\u201d the government\u2019s message to stay at home. Indonesia records biggest daily increase in infections Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in infections, with 533 new confirmed cases, taking the total to 13,645. But with Indonesia\u2019s low testing rate criticised by medical experts, the number of infections in the country \u2013 which has the fourth biggest population in the world \u2013 is feared to be far higher than official figures show. Germany\u2019s plans to restart football suffer setback Germany\u2019s plans to restart competitive football next Saturday suffered an early setback after the entire Dynamo Dresden team were placed in a two-week quarantine following two positive coronavirus tests among the players. Germany\u2019s plans to restart competitive football next Saturday suffered an early setback after the entire Dynamo Dresden team were placed in a two-week quarantine following two positive coronavirus tests among the players. The Bundesliga 2 club announced on their website that tests taken on Friday had revealed two new positive cases and local health authorities had ordered the team into quarantine. Dresden were scheduled to play Hannover 96 next Sunday in their first game back following the stoppage caused by the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cAfter an intensive analysis of the situation, the health authority in Dresden \u2026 decided on Saturday that the entire second division squad, including the coaching and support team, must now go into a 14-day quarantine at home,\u201d the club said. \u201cDue to the quarantine measures, [we] will not be able to travel to Lower Saxony for the away game on matchday 26 as planned.\u201d. Read the rest of the article here: Here\u2019s an article we published a few days ago which explains the background to this. Nigeria\u2019s largest city Lagos could return to lockdown to halt the coronavirus if residents continue to ignore social distancing rules, the governor warned on Saturday. The city emerged on Monday from a five-week stay at home order that left the city\u2019s large number of poor struggling to make ends meet. But since the easing of the restrictions people have been seen thronging markets and banks despite orders remaining in place to avoid mass gatherings. \u201cIt is disappointing to see the crowd at banks and markets across the state flouting the guidelines,\u201d Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe will be forced to take the painful decision of bringing the state under lockdown if it remains clear that Lagosians are determined to flout the rules.\u201d Nigeria has confirmed 3,912 infections and 117 deaths from the novel coronavirus. Lagos, a city of some 20 million people, has been the country\u2019s main hotspot and the daily increase in recorded cases has doubled in the past few days. Sanwo-Olu said that Lagos state would change its \u201cisolation strategy\u201d and that district healthcare facilities would handle \u201cmild-to-moderate\u201d cases. Half of Nigeria\u2019s 200 million population live in dire poverty, making it a major challenge to impose lockdowns cutting them off from daily earnings. Measures introduced in place of the total lockdown include a night-time curfew and the mandatory wearing of masks in public. At least 12 Russian clerics have died since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a list published by \u201cOrthodoxy and the World\u201d, an online media outlet that focuses on religious and social issues. Father Andrei Molchanov, the latest Russian Orthodox priest to die from the novel coronavirus, was buried on Saturday by his heartbroken daughter who said she wished the Moscow church where he served had closed earlier. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, called in late March for believers to pray at home. However tough government lockdown measures at the end of that month, which closed down restaurants and most stores, and told people to stay at home, did not order churches to shut. \u201cI believe above all else that we should have closed churches, along with restaurants and other places,\u201d Anastasia Molchanova, the late priest\u2019s daughter, told Reuters after his burial. Despite the patriarch\u2019s call, most churches in Moscow, including Molchanov\u2019s, remained open until mid-April before Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog, a government agency, issued an order to shut them. The consumer health watchdog and the Russian Orthodox Church did not immediately respond to requests for comment, according to Reuters. The number of people who have died from coronavirus infections in France rose by 80 to 26,310 on Saturday, the health ministry said. This is a much smaller daily increase than the previous day when it was 243. The ministry said the number of people in intensive care units \u2013 a key measure of a health system\u2019s ability to deal with the epidemic \u2013 fell by 56, or about 2%, to 2,812. That is less than half the peak of 7,148 seen on 8 April. The number of people in hospital with the coronavirus also fell, to 22,614 from 22,724, continuing an uninterrupted three-week fall, and down 30% from a 14 April peak of 32,292. France will start lifting its almost two-month-old national lockdown from Monday. Three children in New York have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to the coronavirus, governor Andrew Cuomo told a daily briefing on Saturday. Cuomo had on Friday disclosed the death of a five-year-old linked to the coronavirus and a syndrome that shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, which was the first known fatality tied to the rare illness in New York. The governor told a daily briefing on Saturday that the illness had now taken the lives of at least three young people across the state. He did not provide details of their ages or the circumstances of their deaths. But Cuomo said he was increasingly worried that the syndrome posed a newly emerging risk for children, who had previously been thought to be largely immune to severe illness from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. Indian authorities used drones and fire engines to disinfect the city of Ahmedabad on Saturday, AFP reports. The city of 5.5 million people in Narendra Modi\u2019s home state has become a cause for concern , accounting for 343 of the almost 2,000 coronavirus deaths reported nationwide and almost 10% of India\u2019s cases. Other cities in Gujarat state have also been badly hit. Locals watched from their balconies as drones sprayed disinfectant while fire engines and other vehicles toured the empty streets sending out clouds of the cleaning agent. The acting chief administrator, Rajiv Gupta, said all zones of the city would be disinfected. India has been in the grip of the world\u2019s biggest lockdown since 25 March, and measures were tightened in Ahmedabad on Friday because of the accelerated spread of the virus. Hundreds of paramilitaries kept people off the streets and virtually all stores have been closed for at least a week. The virus is spreading quickly in other cities including the capital, Delhi, and the finance hub of Mumbai. While the number of fatalities is low compared with the US and the worst-hit European nations, health specialists say India\u2019s pandemic curve may not peak until June and July. Shamika Ravi, an economic adviser to the government, said on Saturday that the \u201cinfection is way ahead of our knowledge\u201d in Gujarat and Maharashtra, which includes Mumbai, because authorities were not carrying out enough tests. Hi, this is Nicola Slawson in the UK. I\u2019m taking over the reins of the live blog from Simon now. Please do share any thoughts, insight or news tips with me via any of the channels below. I might not have time to respond to all of you but I will certainly try and read them. Thank you. Twitter: @nicola_slawson Instagram: @nicola_slawson Email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com A child was among 16 migrants rescued four miles off the coast of France when their makeshift vessel bound for Britain ran into difficulties in the middle of the night, authorities said. The group was picked up 3.8 miles off the French port of Calais after calling for help, French maritime authorities confirmed to AFP. A French maritime surveillance vessel rescued the migrants at around 5am and transported them to the Channel port of Dunkirk, where they were handed over to border police. A charity leader said last month that migrants living in makeshift camps in northern France are dangerously exposed to Covid-19, warning that conditions were \u201cthe worst I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. Vladimir Putin has told Russians they are invincible when they stand together, as he sought to send a message of unity after the country\u2019s tally of Covid-19 cases reached the fifth highest in the world. Addressing the nation in a speech as he presided over Victory Day celebrations, a sombre Putin invoked the memory of the country\u2019s veterans who fought in the second world war. \u201cOur veterans fought for life and against death, and we will always try to live up to their spirit of unanimity and resilience,\u201d he said after laying a bouquet of red roses at the Eternal Flame war memorial near the Kremlin. We are united by our shared memory, hopes and aspirations, as well as a sense of shared responsibility for the present and the future. We know and strongly believe that when we stand together, we are invincible.\u201d It comes after Russia\u2019s total confirmed infections neared 200,000. Victory Day, marking the defeat of Nazi Germany, is one of Russia\u2019s most revered public events and provides Putin with a platform to promote the patriotism that is a cornerstone of his popular support. But the pandemic forced him to postpone the main highlight, a huge annual parade on Moscow\u2019s Red Square showcasing Moscow\u2019s most sophisticated military hardware. In his first public appearance for weeks, Putin took part in a low-key remembrance ceremony, but he made clear he still planned to hold the usual parade to mark the anniversary when the time was right. South Korea\u2019s capital, Seoul, has shut down thousands of nightclubs, hostess bars and discos after a cluster of Covid-19 infections were linked to clubbers who went out last weekend after the country relaxed social distancing rules. More than 2,100 venues have been ordered to close in measures imposed today by Seoul\u2019s mayor, Park Won-soon, reports Associated Press. The national government urged venues to close or otherwise enforce anti-virus measures including distancing, temperature checks, keeping customer lists and requiring employees to wear masks. The entry bans will be maintained until the city concludes that risks of infection have been meaningfully lowered, Park added. South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier in the day that 18 new cases were reported in the 24 hours to midnight yesterday, all but one of them linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three clubs in Seoul\u2019s Itaewon district last Saturday before testing positive days later. South Korea has confirmed at least 10,840 cases of the coronavirus, and 256 deaths. It is a city more commonly associated with the vast wealth of the financial world, but more than 1,000 people queued up in Geneva on Saturday to get free food parcels. In a sign of the devastating impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on Switzerland\u2019s poorest, including undocumented migrants, a line of people stretched more than half a mile outside of an ice rink where volunteers handed out around 1,500 parcels. Some of those queuing had arrived as early as 5am. A small child was pictured among the crowd waiting in line. \u201cAt the end of the month, my pockets are empty. We have to pay the bills, the insurance, everything,\u201d Ingrid Berala, a Geneva resident from Nicaragua who works part-time, told Reuters. \u201cThis is great, because there is food for a week, a week of relief \u2026 I don\u2019t know for next week.\u201d As many as 660,000 people in the country of 8.6 million were poor in 2018, according to charity Caritas, particularly single parents and those with a low level of education unable to find work after losing work. More than 1.1 million people were at risk of poverty, meaning they receive less than 60% of the median income, which was 6,538 Swiss francs ($6,736) for a full-time job in 2018. Geneva is the second-most expensive global city for a family of three to live in, behind only Zurich. Although average incomes are also high, that helps little for people struggling to make ends meet. \u201cI think a lot people are aware of this, but it is different to see this with your own eyes,\u201d said Silvana Matromatteo, head of the aid group Geneva Solidarity Caravan. We had people in tears who said \u2018It is not possible that it is happening in my country\u2019. But it is here and maybe the Covid-19 brought everything out and this is good, because we will be able to take measures to support all these workers, because they are workers above all.\u201d Patrick Wieland, chief of mission for the Doctors Without Borders group, said a survey last week showed just over half the food recipients interviewed were undocumented, while others had attained legal status, were Swiss or were seeking asylum. Just over 3% had been tested positive for Covid-19, three times the overall rate in Geneva, which he attributed to poor and overcrowded housing. One undocumented immigrant who called himself Fernando said he lost his restaurant job during the crisis and had no pay. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful to receive this help and if the situation changes for me, I am committing to do the same thing that they are doing for me,\u201d he said. In the UK, a trade body has said that an expected 14-day quarantine period for all travellers coming to the country would have a devastating impact on the aviation industry and wider economy. It is anticipated that Boris Johnson will announce the quarantine tomorrow as part of measures to prevent a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic. It will affect people arriving at airports, ports and Eurostar railway stations, including Britons returning from abroad. Under the plan, set to be in place by the end of early June, arrivals will be asked to provide the address at which they will self-isolate for two weeks by filling out a digital form. But Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said it would \u201cnot only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy\u201d. However, some have questioned why the quarantine measure was not introduced sooner, and what the scientific reasoning is for it to be introduced at this point in the government\u2019s response. Other countries including Australia and New Zealand ordered 14-day isolation periods for visitors as early as March. I\u2019m back at the helm of the live blog again now, with thanks to my colleague, Jedidajah Otte, for covering while I was away. The Israeli government has approved a series of steps to relax lockdown restrictions, including allowing group prayer, partial reopening of the economy and stores, and fines for not wearing masks in public, as the number of daily infections decreases, the Haaretz newsaper reports. There have been signs that lockdown fatigue is spreading in the population, with images showing hundreds gathering at beaches on Friday. So far 16,444 coronavirus cases have been recorded in Israel, of which 11,313 have recovered, according to the health ministry. Eighty-one people are in serious condition, of whom 65 are on ventilators. The number of coronavirus deaths remains at 245. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, 527 people have tested positive and two people have died. In the Gaza Strip, 20 people were diagnosed, 12 of whom have recovered. One in four Portuguese with a monthly household income of 650 euros ($705) or less have lost all their income because of the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a study by the National School of Public Health. About 22% of Portugal\u2019s 4.9 million workers take home the minimum monthly wage of 635 euros, the lowest in western Europe, Reuters reports. \u201cPreliminary data seems to indicate COVID-19 is noticeably unequal,\u201d the study said, adding that inequalities can increase people\u2019s risk of being infected by the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus because they might have no option but to leave their homes to work. The researchers surveyed around 4,000 people between 25 April and 1 May. Since the pandemic hit Portugal, 25% of people with a household income of up to 650 euros lost all their earnings, and only 6% of those with a monthly household income of 2,500 euros or more lost it all, the study showed. Portugal, which has reported 27,268 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 1,114 deaths, started cautiously easing its lockdown restrictions on Monday. A total of 91,500 people registered as unemployed between the beginning of Portugal\u2019s lockdown on 18 March and the end of April, official figures showed, bringing total unemployment to just under 370,000 people. Hello, I\u2019m briefly taking over while Simon Murphy takes a break. Please feel free to get in touch with updates via Twitter or email me. Thousands of people, including elderly second world war veterans, have turned out for Belarus\u2019s Victory Day military parade despite the coronavirus epidemic. As Spain\u2019s daily death toll fell to its second lowest level since mid-March on Saturday, half of the country prepared to move into the next phase of exit from one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns. Russia has been hit with more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last day, as the country approaches nearly 200,000 confirmed infections with lockdown measures continuing. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has offered the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, support in tackling the coronavirus, state media said on Saturday. As debates rage in other countries about the return of professional football, games will be played on the Faroe Islands on Saturday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in infections, with 533 new confirmed cases, taking the total to 13,645. And a French MP has failed in her bid to to get \u201clove\u201d added to the list of \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d that must be given for anyone to travel more than 100km (62 miles) in the country. In Beijing, there is welcome news for fitness fanatics as several of the city\u2019s gyms reopen after being closed for nearly three months. \u201cAfter coming back to the gym I\u2019ve been able to get my blood, my circulation going again and get my muscles flexed again,\u201d said Lu, 38, a gym enthusiast at Mi Fitness, one of the facilities that was allowed to reopen at the end of April. \u201cThis kind of feeling is fantastic,\u201d he told Reuters, after a few sets of lateral raises. So far, only gyms stationed above ground level are allowed to operate, provided they follow rules. Temperature checks are made upon entry, and names and contacts are noted. Gym-goers are required to wear a mask unless they have difficulty breathing, and must maintain a distance of two metres from others. Mi Fitness is also subject to three spot checks a day, from the city\u2019s sports authorities, the local government and the building\u2019s management. A breach of the rules may shut down the business. The fitness studio is on the eighth floor of an office building in west Beijing. During a visit by Reuters on Friday, all those working out observed the mask rule, although some admitted it was a little uncomfortable to wear one while exercising. But student Peng Weichen, 21, was determined to see the positive side of things. \u201cI treat it as a form of resistance training,\u201d Peng said. \u201cThat is, resistance training with a reduced oxygen intake. It\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s fine. I can take it.\u201d As Spain\u2019s daily death toll fell to its second lowest since mid-March on Saturday, half of the country prepared to move into the next phase of exit from one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns. The first phase includes a considerable easing of measures, allowing people to move around their province as well as attending concerts and the theatre. Gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed. On Monday, 51% of the population will progress to phase one of a four-step easing plan after the government decided the regions in which they lived met the necessary criteria. In regions that made the cut, including the Canary and Balearic Islands, bars, restaurants and shops will open at reduced capacity, and museums, gyms and hotels will open their doors for the first time in nearly two months. However, the country\u2019s two biggest cities \u2013 Madrid and Barcelona \u2013 do not currently meet the criteria for easing. It comes as the Covid-19 daily death toll in the country fell to 179 on Saturday, down from 229 the previous day and a fraction of highs above 900 in early April. The cumulative death total rose to 26,478, while the number of diagnosed cases rose to 223,578 from 222,857 the day before, the health ministry said. It is known as the city of love so it\u2019s perhaps fitting that in Paris last night there was a touching amendment requested to the French government\u2019s \u201cstate of health emergency\u201d bill when MPs debated it at the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. Discussing the bill, which will extend the coronavirus measures until 23 July, MP Mireille Clapot suggested that \u201clove\u201d be added to the \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d that must be given for anyone to travel more than 100km (62 miles). Presenting what she called her \u201clovers amendment\u201d, the MP for Emmanuel Macron\u2019s ruling LREM party said the strict lockdown \u2013 which will be eased from Monday \u2013 had led to couples being separated since mid-March. \u201cThe law has put so many restraints on public freedoms that it has more or less banned love,\u201d Clapot told the house. She said the current reasons justifying long journeys after Monday for \u201ccompelling professional or family reasons\u201d meant couples who were geographically separated \u2013 whether married, in civil partnerships or simply together \u2013 were suffering. The health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said the government did not want to increase the number of exceptions to the rules and could not accept the amendment. However, before anyone could accuse him of being hard-hearted, he thanked the MP for \u201cthis tender moment\u201d in the house. In Afghanistan, at least six people have been killed after protesters clashed with police over claims that food aid is being distributed unfairly amid the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a local member of parliament in Afghanistan\u2019s western Ghor province where the incident occurred, seven people were killed. But a government spokesman said six had died, including four civilians and two police officers. Fourteen others wounded during the protest, sparked by growing concern that distributions have been favouring people with political connections, said Gulzaman Nayeb, a politician representing Ghor, a province in central Afghanistan. Reuters reported that Mohammad Arif Aber, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Ghor, claimed police started shooting after some of the protesters, who totalled around 300, threw stones and started firing guns, trying to enter the governor\u2019s house. The spokesman said police were among the wounded. He denied that aid was being unfairly distributed. Among the dead was Ahmad Naveed Khan, a local volunteer radio presenter who was sitting at his nearby shop and was hit in the head by a bullet, according to Ahmad Quraishi, the executive director of the Afghanistan Journalists Centre. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) said it was looking into the \u201cworrying reports of police firing on protesters\u201d. The government has been distributing food aid around the country as the restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic have led to many job losses and rising food prices. Update: Tariq Aryan, an interior ministry spokesman, claimed some \u201cirresponsible armed\u201d people among the protesters opened fire. Calling the incident \u201chorrific\u201d, he said six people, including four civilians and two police officers, were killed. A dozen police officers and nine civilians were wounded, he said. The country\u2019s first vice president, Amrullah Saleh, apologised for the incident in a Facebook post and said the case would be investigated. Czech Airlines will restart part of its operations later this month after a six-week interruption. The airline will resume some of its services on 18 May, with flights to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris and Stockholm among those reopened in the first wave. On 24 May the route to Kiev will reopen, followed by Odessa and Bucharest on 25 May, it said. Passengers will be required to wear face masks during the entire flight, and a distance of two metres from person to person will be enforced. The cabin will undergo disinfection before and after each flight, the airline said. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus infections, with 533 new confirmed cases taking the total number to 13,645. But with Indonesia\u2019s low testing rate criticised by medical experts, the number of infections in the country \u2013 which has the fourth biggest population in the world \u2013 is feared to be far higher than official figures show. Achmad Yurianto, a health ministry official, said 16 more people had died from the disease, taking the total to 959, while 2,607 had recovered. Nearly 108,700 people had been tested as of Saturday, he added, and he urged Indonesians to continue obeying stay-at-home orders. Meanwhile, Malaysia\u2019s health authorities reported 54 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, making a total of 6,589 in the country. One new death was recorded, bringing total fatalities to 108. Japan\u2019s capital, Tokyo, reported 36 new cases of coronavirus infections on Saturday, TV Asahi said, three fewer than a day earlier, meaning a seventh consecutive day that new infections remained below 100. The latest figures, for which the broadcaster cited unnamed sources, bring total coronavirus infections in Tokyo to 4,846. Spain\u2019s daily Covid-19 death tolls are continuing to fall, with 179 new fatalities reported on Saturday, down from 229 the previous day. Overall deaths rose to 26,478, from 26,299 on Friday, with the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rising to 223,578 from 222,857 the day before, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Elsewhere, Slovakia recorded no new cases of coronavirus on Friday for the first time since 10 March. The country of 5.5 million has had fewer cases and deaths than neighbouring nations, with cases totalling 1,455 and 26 people dying after contracting the disease. On Wednesday the country reopened all shops outside shopping malls, hotels, museums, galleries and outdoor tourist attractions and allowed religious services and weddings with limited numbers of guests. Schools remain closed, however, and international passenger travel is still not possible. People returning from abroad must go to state-run quarantine centres for 14 days Thousands of people, including elderly veterans of the second world war, have turned out for Belarus\u2019s Victory Day military parade despite the coronavirus epidemic. Images from the parade showed crowds packed on to parade bleachers as the country\u2019s leader, Alexander Lukashenka, boasted of holding the only parade in the former Soviet Union to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany. Russia and other countries have cancelled their s and move many of the celebrations online. \u201cIn this insane, disoriented world, there will be people who condemn us for the time and place of this sacred act,\u201d Lukashenka said defiantly. \u201cDon\u2019t rush to conclusions or condemn us, descendants of the victory of Belarusians. We couldn\u2019t have acted differently. We had no other choice. And even if we had one, we would have done the same.\u201d But one Belarusian journalist expressed concern at higher-risk attendees at the parade. Meanwhile, the BBC\u2019s Moscow correspondent wrote on Twitter: Lukashenka has publicly downplayed the epidemic, appearing at Orthodox Easter services and other public events and telling reporters that the virus is not as deadly as has been claimed. Belarus is the only country in Europe to continue holding football matches during the crisis. The country officially has 21,101 cases of coronavirus and 121 deaths from the disease. Local activists have played an important role in crowdfunding the country\u2019s response to the disease and making up for shortages at local hospitals. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin laid flowers at the eternal flame near the Kremlin this week and vowed to hold the parade and a memorial march called the Immortal Regiment by year\u2019s end. The former French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has spoken of his concern for women suffering domestic abuse during the lockdown, as he endorsed a new app to help female victims of violence. In an interview with the Guardian, Hollande called for schoolchildren to be taught that violence at home was unacceptable but that it affected every social group. \u201cThere\u2019s this idea that it\u2019s just a problem in working-class settings or immigrant areas, but this is so wrong. It happens in all types of families,\u201d he said. For too long violence against women has been pushed aside because it was considered part of the personal, the private, and not something that concerned society.\u201d Hollande was speaking to support a new phone app developed in France but also available in the UK and a dozen other countries, to help female victims of violence whether at home, in the workplace or in public. App-Elles, available for Android or iOS, allows women and girls to discreetly alert three trusted contacts when they are being attacked, allowing them to call the police if necessary. As well as a GPS alert, a recording is made of the attack in real time on the victim\u2019s and contacts\u2019 phones. The coronavirus death toll in the Philippines has passed 700 as the country recorded eight new fatalities. Confirmed Covid-19 infections increased by 147 to 10,610, the country\u2019s health ministry reported. Meanwhile, 108 recovered, bringing total recoveries to 1,842. The country recorded eight new coronavirus deaths, with the total climbing to 704, the health ministry said in a bulletin. On Tuesday the Philippines\u2019 biggest broadcaster, ABS-CBN, was forced off air by a cease-and-desist order that has been condemned as a brazen attack on press freedom. The media group, which has been repeatedly attacked by the country\u2019s president, Rodrigo Duterte, has faced months of uncertainty over its future, but it had been expected that the network would be allowed to continue broadcasting during the coronavirus lockdown, when access to reliable information is crucial to public health. Russia has been hit with more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last day, as the country approaches nearly 200,000 confirmed infections with lockdown measures continuing. The country\u2019s coronavirus taskforce confirmed 104 people had died overnight, bringing the nation\u2019s coronavirus death toll to 1,827. On Saturday, the total number of confirmed cases in Russia reached 198,676 after 10,817 new infections were recorded. It is a slightly higher rise than previous day, when there were 10,699 new cases. Russia\u2019s coronavirus cases overtook France and Germany this week to become the fifth highest in the world. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Afghanistan have passed 4,000 following the highest one-day rise in infections in the country\u2019s third largest city, Herat. Six patients died overnight, increasing the Covid-19 death toll in the country to 115, with the total number of infections reaching 4,033, including 392 health workers. Six health workers have died from Covid-19. Of the new infections, 71 were recorded in the western province of Herat, which borders Iran. More than 250,000 Afghans have returned home from Iran \u2013 which has recorded in excess of 100,000 confirmed cases \u2013 since the beginning of the year, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has warned of a human catastrophe amid intensified conflict with the Taliban, which killed 43 civilians in the first 10 days of Ramadan. Wahid Majroh, a deputy health minister, said on Saturday that a \u201cbig human catastrophe will take place\u201d if people continued to break lockdown rules, adding that concerns had reached the \u201chighest level\u201d. Despite a government-authorised lockdown in several provinces, cities are still crowded, raising fears among experts that the true number of Covid-19 infections may be significantly higher than official figures. Some 529 suspected patients have been tested in the last 24 hours in the war-torn country, with 253 positive results. The deputy health minister insisted that patients with severe symptoms were tested, adding that the ministry is increasing hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. Ferozuddin Feroz, the health minister, who was infected with the virus on Thursday, is in a \u201cgood condition\u201d, Majroh said. After three days of recording numbers below 20 in Kandahar, the number of transmissions increased in the southern province as 43 patients tested positive. The capital, Kabul, which is Afghanistan\u2019s worst-affected area, recorded four new patients with Covid-19 out of 43 tests, Majroh said. Singapore has recorded 753 new coronavirus cases, its health ministry said, taking the city-state\u2019s total to 22,460 infections. The vast majority of the newly infected people are migrant workers living in dormitories, the health ministry said in a statement. Nine are permanent residents. As debates rage in other countries about the return of professional football, games will be played on the Faroe Islands today for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak. The north Atlantic archipelago, located 370 miles north of Scotland with a population of just 50,000, will provide some much-needed respite to football fans when games restart in the country\u2019s 10-team top flight. Normally, matches in the country\u2019s league are watched by fewer than 1,000 fans in the terraces but now, given the lack of football elsewhere, TV audiences will be tuning in from Norway and Denmark for the first game, which is being held behind closed doors. Mikkjal Thomassen, manager of KL KLasksvik, the top league\u2019s reigning champions, told BBC Breakfast: \u201cIt\u2019s just strange times, we are excited of course, very excited to be back.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are privileged to be in the spotlight for a moment, we will enjoy it and give it our best.\u201d Thomassen said he was thankful no one had died on the Faroe Islands after contracting Covid-19. \u201cLast night, officially, we came down to zero incidents in the Faroes. There\u2019s been a really loyal and active fight against corona and people have respected and so it went very well. There\u2019s been no deaths, as you know.\u201d Any staff or players with symptoms have been tested and all have returned negative results, Thomassen added. \u201cThere has been a massive testing in the Faroes, more than 10% of the population has been tested,\u201d he said. South Korea\u2019s K league restarted yesterday and Germany\u2019s Bundesliga has been given the green light to resume on 16 May. The Belarusian Premier League prompted controversy by carrying on with matches despite the outbreak. China is set to reform its disease prevention and control system, a senior health official has confirmed, after mounting criticism that the country was initially slow to react to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Reuters, Li Bin, a vice-minister of the China National Health Commission, told reporters on Saturday: This coronavirus epidemic is a big test of our country\u2019s governance and governing ability, and it exposed the weak links in how we address major epidemic and public health systems.\u201d The commission will build a \u201ccentralised and efficient\u201d chain of command, and modernise the disease prevention and control system, he said. It is also aiming to improve the use of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to better trace and analyse diseases and distribute resources. Li Bin said the commission was also planning to step up research on core technology, improve medical insurance and ensure better availability of emergency materials. As China eases lockdown measures, it has not recorded any new deaths from coronavirus for 24 days. That\u2019s all from me - I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague in London, Simon Murphy, who will keep you updated with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. The head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, warned on Friday that economic forecasts could be revised down even further. The IMF\u2019s April projection for a 3% contraction in the global economy would mark the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. A continuing trade war between the US and China could jeopardize a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, she added. With no immediate medical solutions, more adverse scenarios might unfortunately materialise for some economies... It is the unknown about the behaviour of this virus that is clouding the horizon for projections,\u201d said Georgieva. Here is a full report: President Xi Jinping has offered North Korean leader Kim Jong-un support in tackling the coronavirus, state media said on Saturday. Xi said he was very concerned about the situation in North Korea and the health of its people, and said he was pleased that its efforts to control the respiratory illness had achieved positive results, state television said. A major operation to repatriate thousands of Indian nationals who are stranded overseas is under way, with more than 60 flights due to bring people back from 12 countries over the next week. In the early hours of Saturday, returnees arrived from UAE, while on Friday, hundreds of people were brought back from Bahrain, Singapore, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia, the Indian Express newspaper reported. A naval ship has also set sail, repatriating nearly 700 Indian citizens stuck in the Maldives. About 15,000 Indians are due to return on Air India flights, though this figure is expected to increase significantly over the coming weeks and months. Embassies abroad have received hundreds of thousands of applications from Indian nationals who want to travel home. India, which faced strict lockdowns for weeks, has recorded about 60,000 coronavirus cases. All returnees will be required to undergo quarantine for 14 days on arrival. Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreak: Egypt\u2019s president Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi on Saturday approved amendments to the country\u2019s state of emergency that grant him and security agencies additional powers, which the government says are needed to combat the coronavirus outbreak, Associated Press reports. An international rights group condemned the amendments, saying the government has used the global pandemic to expand, not reform, Egypt\u2019s emergency law. The new amendments allow the president to take measures to contain the virus, such as suspending classes at schools and universities and quarantining those returning from abroad. But they also include expanded powers to ban public and private meetings, protests, celebrations and other forms of assembly. The government has waged an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since 2013, when Sisi rose to power, and unauthorised protests have been banned for years. The amendments allow military prosecutors to investigate incidents when army officers are tasked with law enforcement or when the president orders it. The country\u2019s chief civilian prosecutor would have the final decision on whether to bring matters to trial. The amended law would also allow the president to postpone taxes and utility payments as well as provide economic support for affected sectors. Parliament, which is packed with Sisi supporters, approved the measure last month. Egypt has been under a state of emergency since April 2017, and the government extended it late last month for another three months. The law was originally passed to give the president broader powers to combat terrorism and drug trafficking. The government said the amendments were needed to address a legal vacuum revealed by the coronavirus outbreak. Egypt, with a population of 100 million, has reported at least 504 deaths among around 8,500 confirmed cases. Russia marks 75 years since the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany on Saturday, but the coronavirus outbreak has forced it to scale back celebrations, Reuters reports. With coronavirus infections rising, Vladimir Putin last month postponed the highlight of Victory Day celebrations, a massive parade on Red Square that showcases Moscow\u2019s most sophisticated military hardware, to an unspecified date. In previous years, Putin basked in national pride as he watched Russian tanks rumble across the square with world leaders by his side. But a recent poll gave him his lowest approval rating in more than two decades and the country\u2019s economy is slipping into a deep downturn. Putin has described Victory Day celebrations as sacred to Russians but said a big public event was too risky during the pandemic. As of Friday, Russia had reported 187,859 coronavirus cases and 1,723 deaths. In a slimmed-down celebration, Putin will lay flowers at the Eternal Flame war memorial outside the Kremlin walls and deliver a speech. Fireworks will be let off across Russia as much of the country remains in lockdown, and the Russian air force will carry out fly-pasts over more than 47 cities, as well as at its military base in Syria, with a full array of jets and helicopters. Public processions commemorating Soviet participants in the war that are normally held on 9 May have been moved online, with people uploading pictures of family members and telling their war stories. Thailand reported four new coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing its total number of recorded infections to 3,004. One new death was also confirmed, which means there have been a total of 56 fatalities. Thailand begun easing its lockdown measures on Sunday, when it allowed some businesses, including barber shops, pet groomers and outdoor markets, to reopen. A ban on alcohol sales has also been lifted, though a 10pm curfew remains in place. The US Food and Drug Administration commissioner Stephen Hahn will spend the next couple of weeks in self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. Hahn immediately took a diagnostic test and was tested negative himself for the novel coronavirus, FDA told Reuters. Politico reported earlier that it was Katie Miller, the US vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, whom Hahn had come into contact with. The FDA did not confirm this. Miller, also the wife of one ofTrump\u2019s senior advisers, tested positive on Friday, raising alarm about the virus\u2019 potential spread within the White House\u2019s innermost circle. The head of the International Monetary Fund suggested that the already bleak global economic forecasts could be revised down, and warned the United States and China against rekindling a trade war that could weaken a recovery. Meanwhile, the US accused China and Russia of cooperating to spread false narratives about the coronavirus, and tightened visa guidelines for Chinese journalists. The leaders of US congressional foreign affairs committees have written to more than 50 countries asking them to support Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the World Health Organization. Taiwan is excluded from the WHO due to diplomatic pressure from China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory. Donald Trump has said coronavirus is \u201cgoing to go away without a vaccine\u201d, but warned there could be \u201cflare-ups\u201d next year. Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who is married to one of Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers, has tested positive for coronavirus. Roy Horn, of the double act Siegfried and Roy, died after contracting Covid-19, his publicist confirmed. He died in Las Vegas on Friday, aged 75. Argentina said it will extend a quarantine covering its capital Buenos Aires but relax restrictions in the rest of the country. Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday that he aims to present plans next week to reopen the economy, as key sectors like carmaking look to begin business again after over a month of quarantine measures Donald Trump has said coronavirus will \u201cgo away without a vaccine\u201d and is expecting 95,000 or more deaths in the US, as Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary tested positive for coronavirus, reports Alison Rourke in our latest global report on the coronavirus pandemic. The president\u2019s comments, at an event with Republican lawmakers, capped a horror week in the US, in which it was revealed unemployment had risen to 14.7%, up from 3.5% in February, with 20 million people losing their jobs in April. The news that Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller had Covid-19, having recently tested negative, again brought the danger of the virus to the White House inner circle. Miller is married to the White House immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller. On Thursday one of Trump\u2019s personal valets tested positive for the virus. Malaysians will find out early next week if restrictions imposed across the country on 18 March 18 be further extended, the Malaysian Star newspaper has reported. Many are hoping the movement controls will be lifted when the current quarantine phase ends on 12 May. Most businesses have now begun operating, after curbs were eased to reduce pressures on the economy. On Friday, Malaysia reported 68 more Covid-19 cases, bringing the total to 6,535. China reported one new coronavirus case on Friday, unchanged from the day before, data from the national health authority showed on Saturday. The case was linked to foreign travel, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The commission also reported 15 new asymptomatic cases for Friday, versus 16 the previous day. China\u2019s total number of coronavirus cases now stands at 82,887, while the death toll from Covid-19, the disease it causes, remained unchanged at 4,633, the national health authority said. Roy Horn, of the double act Siegfried and Roy, has died after contracting Covid-19, according to US media reports. He died in Las Vegas on Friday, aged 75. The duo\u2019s performances - in which the illusionists would ride on elephants, cavort with tigers and make animals disappear - became one of Las Vegas\u2019s biggest attractions. In 2003, Horn was left in critical condition after being mauled by an albino tiger during their stage act. He eventually recovered and was able to return to the stage. The cause of his death was complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, Horn\u2019s publicist, Dave Kirvin told New York Times. The US issued a new rule on Friday tightening visa guidelines for Chinese journalists, saying it was in response to the treatment of US journalists in China. The United States and China have been engaged in a series of retaliatory actions involving journalists in recent months. In March, China expelled American journalists from three US newspapers, a month after the United States said it would begin to treat five Chinese state-run media entities with US operations the same as foreign embassies. One day after the US verdict on the state-run entities, Beijing expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents, two Americans and an Australian, following the publication of an opinion column that China denounced as racist. In issuing the new regulation on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security cited what it called China\u2019s \u201csuppression of independent journalism.\u201d The regulation, which will take effect on Monday, will limit visas for Chinese reporters to a 90-day period, with the option for extension. Such visas are typically open-ended and do not need to be extended unless the employee moves to a different company or medium. Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday that he aims to present plans next week to reopen the economy, as key sectors like carmaking look to begin business again after over a month of quarantine measures. \u201cThey\u2019re going to present me with an initial proposal on Monday,\u201d Lopez Obrador told reporters during a regular news conference. \u201cAnd we want to announce it to you and to the Mexican public on Wednesday or Thursday.\u201d The government has been under pressure at home and abroad to set out plans for a return to normal as it battles the pandemic that has killed nearly 3,000 people in the country. One sector facing heavy pressure is the automotive industry, which is the backbone of Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector and closely integrated with the rest of North America. This week, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Ford said they were targeting resuming production in North America on 18 May, but suppliers would need time to prepare. Industry sources say 18 May is also seen as the tentative date for reopening the sector in Mexico, provided it gets a green light from Lopez Obrador. The leaders of US congressional foreign affairs committees have written to more than 50 countries asking them to support Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the World Health Organization (WHO), Reuters has reported. Taiwan is excluded from the WHO due to diplomatic pressure from China, which considers Taiwan part of its territory. \u201cAs the world works to combat the spread of the Covid-19, a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, it has never been more important to ensure all countries prioritize global health and safety over politics,\u201d said the lawmakers\u2019 letter, sent on Friday, and seen by Reuters. Washington\u2019s growing support for Taiwan comes as tensions between China and the US over the origin of the coronavirus continue to escalate. The Trump administration has accused China of making the pandemic worse by hiding information. Last month, Trump announced that he was suspending aid to the WHO, accusing it of being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the outbreak, assertions the WHO denies. Argentina will extend a quarantine covering its capital Buenos Aires but relax restrictions in the rest of the country, President Alberto Fernandez said on Friday. The national quarantine began on 20 March and will be extended in the capital until 24 May. Until Friday, the country had registered 5,611 confirmed cases of the virus and 293 deaths. The head of the International Monetary Fund on Friday signalled a possible downward revision of global economic forecasts, and warned the United States and China against rekindling a trade war that could weaken a recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director, told an online event hosted by the European University Institute that recent economic data for many countries was coming in below the fund\u2019s already pessimistic forecast for a 3% contraction in 2020, Reuters reports. \u201cWith no immediate medical solutions, more adverse scenarios might unfortunately materialise for some economies,\u201d Georgieva said. \u201cIt is the unknown about the behaviour of this virus that is clouding the horizon for projections.\u201d The IMF\u2019s April projection for a 3% contraction the global economy would mark the steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The IMF forecast a partial rebound would follow in 2021, but warned that outcomes could be far worse, depending on the course of the pandemic. Donald Trump has threatened to punish China for its handling of the virus by imposing new tariffs, and on Friday suggested he could end a phase-one US-China trade deal. On Friday, Georgieva warned that a retreat into protectionism could weaken the prospects for a global recovery at a critical juncture. \u201cIt is hugely important for us to resist what may be a natural tendency to retreat behind our borders,\u201d she said. Hello this is Rebecca Ratcliffe, bringing you the latest global coronavirus updates. Global reported cases of coronavirus stand at 3,932,896, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, approaching the grim 4 million milestone. Across the world, 274,422 deaths have been registered, with the US on top with 77,126. The UK has recorded the second highest number of fatalities, with 31,315, followed by Italy on 30,201. Here are a summary of the top news lines so far: US unemployment has hit 14.7%, as 20 million Americans lost their jobs in April. This is up from 4.4% in March. Donald Trump has said that coronavirus is \u201cgoing to go away without a vaccine\u201d, but warned there could be \u201cflare-ups\u201d next year. Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who is married to one of Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers, has tested positive for coronavirus. The US accused China and Russia of cooperating to spread false narratives about the coronavirus, ratcheting up a war of words over the origin of the pandemic. Russia on Friday registered more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for a sixth day in a row. Madrid and Barcelona will not progress to the next phase of Spain\u2019s exit from lockdown, after failing to meet the Spanish government\u2019s criteria for an easing of restrictions. Local authorities in the German state North Rhine-Westphalia are set to reimpose some lockdown measures after seeing a rise in new coronavirus cases. Bogota will lift restrictions which required men and women to shop on separate days, the city\u2019s mayor has said. The rules, which have been in place for nearly a month, will end on Monday.

He was fined $1,000.</p> <p>How the Daily Telegraph got tipped to the story \u2013 they captured pictures of him shopping in Sydney and hanging out at Pearl Beach \u2013 remains the subject of intense conjecture. But most Liberals are are looking among their own colleagues for the culprit.</p> <p>\u201cHand on heart, it wasn\u2019t us,\u201d one Labor source said. \u201cThe Liberals catch and kill their own.\u201d</p> <p>Harwin was a big scalp for whoever weaponised the information. He\u2019s a leading figure in the moderate faction and part of Berejiklian\u2019s praetorian guard.</p> <h2>Fighting each other for so long, they can\u2019t stop</h2> <p>The problem for the Liberals in NSW is that the factions within the party have been fighting each other for so long, they just can\u2019t stop.</p> <p>The war began in the 1980s while the Coalition was in opposition and reached a crescendo in the 2000s with industrial-scale branch stacking, punch-ups at branch meetings and regular disposal of parliamentary leaders.</p> <p>Barry O\u2019Farrell finally managed to put an end to the overt warfare after the moderates appeared to win the battle for control of the parliamentary party, and a truce was called inside the organisational structure.</p> <p>But it has flared again in recent months.</p> <p>Some of the renewed angst is based on ideology: there are deeply held divisions within the Liberal factions on social issues which surfaced during the federal debate over marriage equality and the state debate over removing abortion from the criminal law, even though the law had not been enforced for nearly 50 years.</p> <p>But mostly the factions seem to be about control of the party machine and handing out the spoils of office. Some Liberals sheet home the problems of the recent past to Berejiklian\u2019s reshuffle after the election in 2019, which left some key members of the right unhappy.</p> <p>But it may also be something about the NSW division.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hand on heart, it wasn\u2019t us. The Liberals catch and kill their own</p> <footer> <cite>A Labor source</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Liberal party, like many organisations, has seen its membership dwindle in modern times.</p> <p>The exact numbers are secret but <a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/nsw-liberal-party-member-numbers-skyrocket/news-story/2f3268e2882110439f25f7a655fb2936\">the Australian reported</a> last year that 1,300 people, mainly from Pentecostal churches, had joined, raising the numbers by 10%. That implies the membership is now at around 14,000. It\u2019s a far cry from 1945 when the party of Menzies had 90,000 members, nationally.</p> <p>Among that relatively small membership, there are those who plan their career in politics from the day they join the Young Liberals or Young Nationals.</p> <p>These careerists seem to gravitate to state parliament, having served apprenticeships in ministers\u2019 offices as staff and in politically aligned consultancies.</p> <p>Perhaps they never learn to moderate the dark arts they honed while in university politics and the youth wings of the party. Some of the behaviours would certainly not be tolerated in most private sector workplaces.</p> <p>Which brings us to Constance and Barilaro.</p> <p>For those who haven\u2019t followed this soap opera, in the last fortnight Constance, the state MP for Bega and a Liberal, and Barilaro, the state MP for Monaro and a National, both put their hands up to run for the federal seat of Eden-Monaro, which will have a byelection sometime soon, after Labor\u2019s Mike Kelly said he was retiring for health reasons.</p> <p>On Monday Barilaro pulled out. The seat has been won by Liberals in the past but no National has won, so Barilaro faced a very difficult task in a three-cornered contest, particularly if Constance ran.</p> <p>But having said he was happy with his decision Barilaro then badmouthed the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, by text for his lack of support of his candidacy and reportedly called his former friend Constance \u201ca cunt\u201d. He has declined to comment on the allegation.</p> <p>Constance then declared he would not run, having made much of his decision to take the fight for his bushfire-ravaged community to Canberra.</p> <p>An emotional Constance did a press conference on Monday: \u201cWhen I said politics is stuffed in this country and some of the people in it needed to take a long hard look, I meant it and we\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t signed up to contest federally to be called that type of smear.\u201d</p> <h2>Barilaro and Constance turn on each other</h2> <p>Barilaro and Constance both had a reputation of playing rough politically and there was some glee among colleagues that they had turned on each other.</p> <p>Others put Constance\u2019s about-face down to the difficulties he would have faced in gaining preselection, as the seat includes some very conservative branches. Driven by Tony Abbott, the party has reformed its preselection processes to give the branches a bigger say.</p> <p>Even more sinister suggestions emerged that there were dirt sheets circulating and about to see the light of day. One MP was said to have compiled files on his colleagues and to have boasted about them. Nothing has emerged and the Guardian is not suggesting that either man had reason to fear exposure. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/nationals-trade-blows-over-john-barilaros-aborted-tilt-at-eden-monaro\">Nationals trade blows over John Barilaro's aborted tilt at Eden-Monaro</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Berejiklian has since announced that Constance will lose his House leader role so he can concentrate on the transport portfolio, prompting Labor\u2019s Ryan Park to quip: \u201cShe\u2019s punished the victim and rewarded the villain.\u201d</p> <p>But there is nothing Berejiklian can do about Barilaro, who is leader of the NSW Nationals, a separate party.

But for a premier whose message is keep calm and carry on, Barilaro\u2019s obsession to be in the news is not helpful.</p> <p>The factional tensions will escalate as we enter the last two years of this term of NSW parliament and preselections loom.

      "bodyText": "Since well before Christmas the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has been dealing with crises: first the drought, then bushfires that ravaged her state, then the Covid-19 pandemic that has affected everyone. Every morning at 8am Berejiklian fronts the media for her Covid-19 briefing, trying to project a sense of calm, order and empathy, urging the people of NSW to stick with the restrictions. But behind the scenes the men in her team \u2013 and it does seem to be men \u2013 are indulging in a kind of sabotage that should have been left behind when they graduated from the Young Liberals or Young Nationals. They leak against each other to the media, threaten each other with alleged dirt files, and indulge in the sort of \u201clook at me\u201d behaviour that no leader should have to put up with. Instead of explaining the path out of the coronavirus lockdown Berejiklian finds herself answering questions from the media about their antics, like a parent summoned to the principal\u2019s office. This week it was the spectacular about-face with pike by her transport minister, Andrew Constance, who appeared to be about to transition to federal politics and then wasn\u2019t, aided and abetted by her deputy premier and Nationals leader, John Barilaro. Three weeks ago it was Berejiklian\u2019s arts minister, Don Harwin, the leader in the upper house and her close confidante, who embarrassed her by being caught travelling between his Pearl Beach beach house and his city pad during the coronavirus lockdown. Harwin quickly did the honourable thing and resigned, even though he insists his travel was within the rules. He was fined $1,000. How the Daily Telegraph got tipped to the story \u2013 they captured pictures of him shopping in Sydney and hanging out at Pearl Beach \u2013 remains the subject of intense conjecture. But most Liberals are are looking among their own colleagues for the culprit. \u201cHand on heart, it wasn\u2019t us,\u201d one Labor source said. \u201cThe Liberals catch and kill their own.\u201d Harwin was a big scalp for whoever weaponised the information. He\u2019s a leading figure in the moderate faction and part of Berejiklian\u2019s praetorian guard. Fighting each other for so long, they can\u2019t stop The problem for the Liberals in NSW is that the factions within the party have been fighting each other for so long, they just can\u2019t stop. The war began in the 1980s while the Coalition was in opposition and reached a crescendo in the 2000s with industrial-scale branch stacking, punch-ups at branch meetings and regular disposal of parliamentary leaders. Barry O\u2019Farrell finally managed to put an end to the overt warfare after the moderates appeared to win the battle for control of the parliamentary party, and a truce was called inside the organisational structure. But it has flared again in recent months. Some of the renewed angst is based on ideology: there are deeply held divisions within the Liberal factions on social issues which surfaced during the federal debate over marriage equality and the state debate over removing abortion from the criminal law, even though the law had not been enforced for nearly 50 years. But mostly the factions seem to be about control of the party machine and handing out the spoils of office. Some Liberals sheet home the problems of the recent past to Berejiklian\u2019s reshuffle after the election in 2019, which left some key members of the right unhappy. But it may also be something about the NSW division. The Liberal party, like many organisations, has seen its membership dwindle in modern times. The exact numbers are secret but the Australian reported last year that 1,300 people, mainly from Pentecostal churches, had joined, raising the numbers by 10%. That implies the membership is now at around 14,000. It\u2019s a far cry from 1945 when the party of Menzies had 90,000 members, nationally. Among that relatively small membership, there are those who plan their career in politics from the day they join the Young Liberals or Young Nationals. These careerists seem to gravitate to state parliament, having served apprenticeships in ministers\u2019 offices as staff and in politically aligned consultancies. Perhaps they never learn to moderate the dark arts they honed while in university politics and the youth wings of the party. Some of the behaviours would certainly not be tolerated in most private sector workplaces. Which brings us to Constance and Barilaro. For those who haven\u2019t followed this soap opera, in the last fortnight Constance, the state MP for Bega and a Liberal, and Barilaro, the state MP for Monaro and a National, both put their hands up to run for the federal seat of Eden-Monaro, which will have a byelection sometime soon, after Labor\u2019s Mike Kelly said he was retiring for health reasons. On Monday Barilaro pulled out. The seat has been won by Liberals in the past but no National has won, so Barilaro faced a very difficult task in a three-cornered contest, particularly if Constance ran. But having said he was happy with his decision Barilaro then badmouthed the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack, by text for his lack of support of his candidacy and reportedly called his former friend Constance \u201ca cunt\u201d. He has declined to comment on the allegation. Constance then declared he would not run, having made much of his decision to take the fight for his bushfire-ravaged community to Canberra. An emotional Constance did a press conference on Monday: \u201cWhen I said politics is stuffed in this country and some of the people in it needed to take a long hard look, I meant it and we\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Daily Telegraph. \u201cI hadn\u2019t signed up to contest federally to be called that type of smear.\u201d Barilaro and Constance turn on each other Barilaro and Constance both had a reputation of playing rough politically and there was some glee among colleagues that they had turned on each other. Others put Constance\u2019s about-face down to the difficulties he would have faced in gaining preselection, as the seat includes some very conservative branches. Driven by Tony Abbott, the party has reformed its preselection processes to give the branches a bigger say. Even more sinister suggestions emerged that there were dirt sheets circulating and about to see the light of day. One MP was said to have compiled files on his colleagues and to have boasted about them. Nothing has emerged and the Guardian is not suggesting that either man had reason to fear exposure. Berejiklian has since announced that Constance will lose his House leader role so he can concentrate on the transport portfolio, prompting Labor\u2019s Ryan Park to quip: \u201cShe\u2019s punished the victim and rewarded the villain.\u201d But there is nothing Berejiklian can do about Barilaro, who is leader of the NSW Nationals, a separate party. He keeps his job unless colleagues think otherwise. Several within the Coalition believe he has become increasingly erratic and makes public statements on the fly aimed at gaining attention but that harm the government. Barilaro\u2019s most notorious intervention was in 2017 when he said Malcolm Turnbull was out of touch and should resign during an interview with broadcaster Alan Jones on 2GB, midway through a difficult byelection in the federal seat of Bennelong, which the Liberals were struggling to hold. A furious Turnbull accused Barilaro of trying to ingratiate himself with Jones. But the genie was out of the bottle and Barilaro ignited the narrative that would lead to Turnbull\u2019s defeat in the party room. In the last 12 months Barilaro has threatened to pull NSW out of the Murray-Darling Basin plan, backed logging in national parks, while defending brumbies in Kosciuszko national park, even though there is now overwhelming evidence their numbers are exploding and causing damage to the alpine park. To top this week off, Barilaro was questioned over travel to his farm on 2 May in southern NSW after having publicly called for everyone in NSW to avoid travelling to the regions. The travel was later deemed permissible by police because his family was there and the trip took place after 1 May when the rules on visiting family had been relaxed. Certainly Barilaro has a profile and gets plenty of media. But for a premier whose message is keep calm and carry on, Barilaro\u2019s obsession to be in the news is not helpful. The factional tensions will escalate as we enter the last two years of this term of NSW parliament and preselections loom. The question is whether Berejiklian is strong enough to keep her unruly ministers focused on the main game, like she is and like the public expect.",

It comes as the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, prepares to unveil his \u201croadmap\u201d to a new normality in a national broadcast and global infections pass four million. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, are all expected to work remotely due to potential exposure to Covid-19. Fauci\u2019s institute said that he has tested negative for Covid-19 and will continue to be tested regularly. It added that he is considered at relatively low risk based on the degree of his exposure, and that he would be taking appropriate precautions to mitigate the risk to personal contacts while still carrying out his duties. While he will stay at home and telework, Fauci will go to the White House if called and take every precaution, the institute said. Redfield will be teleworking for the next two weeks after it was determined he had a low-risk exposure to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms. A few hours earlier, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that Hahn had come in contact with someone who had tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He tested negative for the virus. All three men were scheduled to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday, and it\u2019s understood they will be allowed to do that via videoconference. Politico reported Hahn had come into contact with Katie Miller, vice president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who tested positive for the virus on Friday. Her husband, Stephen Miller, is a top advisor to Donald Trump. On Thursday the White House confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump\u2019s valets had also tested positive for Covid-19. Trump, who publicly identified Miller\u2019s positive test, said he was not worried about the virus spreading in the White House. However, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols. Redfield sought to use the exposure as a teachable moment. The CDC statement said if he must go to the White House to fulfil any responsibilities as part of the coronavirus task force, he will follow CDC practices for critical infrastructure workers. Those guidelines call for Redfield and anyone working on the task force to have their temperature taken and screened for symptoms each day, wear a face covering, and distance themselves from others. Trump has resisted wearing a mask. In a meeting with the nation\u2019s top military leaders on Saturday evening, he did not wear a mask during the brief portion that reporters were allowed to view. The generals around Trump were also unmasked, but participants did sit a few feet away from each other. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts. It already requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. Elon Musk, meanwhile, announced he was suing authorities in California over Covid-19 restrictions that have kept his Fremont factory closed and threatened to move his operation out of the state. \u201cIf we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependent on how Tesla is treated in the future,\u201d he tweeted. In Britain, Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a coronavirus warning system for England when he outlines plans to gradually ease the lockdown in an address to the nation on Sunday evening. It is understood that a warning system administered by a new \u201cjoint biosecurity centre\u201d will detect local increases in infection rates, with the aim of altering restrictions locally in England. The alerts will range from green at level one to red at level five. Johnson is expected to say that the nation as a whole is close to moving down from four to three. The UK has the second highest death toll from the virus, at 31,662, with more than 266,500 infections. On Saturday the government told airlines it would introduce a 14-day quarantine period for most people arriving from abroad to try to avoid a second peak of the coronavirus outbreak. South Korea\u2019s capital has ordered the closure of all clubs and bars after a burst of new cases sparked fears of a second coronavirus wave. In Mexico, coronavirus patients were being turned away from hospitals on Saturday, as both public and private medical facilities quickly filled up and the number of new infections continued to rise. Of the 64 public hospitals in the capital\u2019s sprawling metro area designated to receive Covid-19 patients, 26 were completely full, according to city government data. Mexico announced 1,938 new cases of the virus on Saturday, bringing the total to 33,460, along with 193 additional deaths, bringing fatalities to 3,353. In other coronavirus developments: The global tally of confirmed cases passed 4 million, with almost 280,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. President Trump on Saturday said the US would buy $3bn of dairy, meat and produce from farmers as unemployment soars and the prices that slaughterhouses pay farmers for animals have fallen in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Three children in New York have died from a rare inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to the novel coronavirus, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. China reported 14 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, the highest number since 28 April, and up from only one case a day earlier. Of the new cases, two were imported infections. The remaining 12 confirmed cases were locally transmitted, including 11 cases in the north-eastern province of Jilin. Australia\u2019s most populous state of New South Wales will begin easing its coronavirus restrictions from Friday, with 10 people permitted at outdoor gatherings, up from two. Air France will start checking passengers\u2019 temperatures when France\u2019s lockdown measures are eased on Monday.",

      "bodyText": "Diplomatic tensions between Australia and China may be reignited with an extraordinary threat by a Coalition backbencher to summons the Chinese ambassador to answer questions from a parliamentary committee. While the attempt to compel the ambassador to appear at a hearing in Canberra is almost certain to fail because of diplomatic immunity, the push interrupts a pause in public sparring between the two governments over the response to Covid-19. Queensland Coalition MP George Christensen, who has a record of threatening to cross the floor, issued the latest threat in his capacity as chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth. The committee was already conducting an inquiry into \u201cwhether there is a need to diversify Australia\u2019s trade markets and Australia\u2019s level of reliance on foreign investment\u201d \u2013 but Christensen wants to sharpen the focus on China and has raised the prospect of calling the Chinese ambassador, Cheng Jingye, to give evidence. Christensen appears to have not sought the backing of senior government members such as the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, for the plans and it is unclear whether the entire committee has held a vote yet to back the move. Responding to the development, Birmingham emphasised it should be seen in the context of political debate. \u201cWe live in a robust democracy where different views can be heard,\u201d the minister said in a statement, adding the government believed investment and exports were important to the jobs of Australians. Under article 31 of the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, diplomatic agents are \u201cnot obliged to give evidence as a witness\u201d. While diplomatic immunities could be waived by China, this is considered highly unlikely. Christensen wants Cheng to appear before the committee as early as August, according to a report in News Corp\u2019s Sunday Mail, which also reported the notice to appear could be sent to the ambassador \u201cas early as tomorrow\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d like to know why the ambassador felt the need to mention the possibility of a trade boycott in response to Australia\u2019s request for an international inquiry into the origins of the Wuhan coronavirus,\u201d the MP told the Sunday Mail. He is also setting up a \u201cChina inquiry\u201d website with a welcome message that says: \u201cWe must stand up for Australia\u2019s sovereignty and economic independence, and against threats from Communist China.\u201d The governments of China and Australia were entangled in a messy war of words last month over the shape of a proposed international inquiry into Covid-19 and Beijing\u2019s apparent threat to retaliate economically. At the height of those tensions, the Chinese embassy released details of a call from Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and in an attempt to embarrass the Morrison government, claimed the departmental secretary had conceded it was \u201cnot the time to commence the review now and Australia has no details of the proposal\u201d. Cheng, the ambassador, had warned earlier that consumer boycotts were possible as he argued Australia\u2019s push for an international inquiry was part of a US-backed \u201cpolitical campaign against China\u201d. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review published on 26 April, Cheng said Chinese tourists and students may rethink their plans to visit in the future \u201cif the mood is going from bad to worse\u201d, while consumers may also decide against buying Australian wine and beef. Scott Morrison maintained his call for an inquiry was \u201centirely reasonable and sensible\u201d and the public dispute appeared to have eased since the end of April. In the meantime Australia has played down a theory promoted by US political leaders that the virus may have started in a laboratory in Wuhan. In recent days, the prime minister has underlined the need for any inquiry to be seen as having \u201can honest intent and an honest motive\u201d. On Sunday, the health minister, Greg Hunt, said the government would support a European Union-drafted motion at the forthcoming World Health Assembly which he said included \u201can independent investigation, regulatory work on wet markets and also the potential for independent inspection powers\u201d. Hunt said the government had disagreed with the World Health Organization over Australia\u2019s decision on 1 February to close the border to visitors from China in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. \u201cWe believe that we made not just the right the decision but one of the most important decisions made by an Australian government in decades,\u201d Hunt told Sky News. Guardian Australia has contacted Christensen and the Chinese embassy for comment.",

      "bodyText": "No other nation has endured as much death from Covid-19 nor nearly as a high a death rate as has the United States. With 4.25% of the world population, America has the tragic distinction of accounting for about 30% of pandemic deaths so far. And it is the only advanced nation where the death rate is still climbing. Three thousand deaths per day are anticipated by 1 June. No other nation has loosened lockdowns and other social-distancing measures while deaths are increasing, as the US is now doing. No other advanced nation was as unprepared for the pandemic as was the US. We now know Donald Trump and his administration were told by public health experts in mid-January that immediate action was required to stop the spread of Covid-19. But according to Dr Anthony Fauci, \u201cthere was a lot of pushback\u201d. Trump didn\u2019t act until 16 March. Epidemiologists estimate 90% of the deaths in the US from the first wave of Covid-19 might have been prevented had social distancing policies been put into effect two weeks earlier, on 2 March. No nation other than the US has left it to subordinate units of government \u2013 states and cities \u2013 to buy ventilators and personal protective equipment. In no other nation have such sub-governments been forced to bid against each another. In no other nation have experts in public health and emergency preparedness been pushed aside and replaced by political cronies like Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who in turn has been advised by Trump donors and Fox News celebrities. In no other advanced nation has Covid-19 forced so many average citizens into poverty so quickly. The Urban Institute reports that more than 30% of American adults have had to reduce their spending on food. Elsewhere around the world, governments are providing generous income support. Not in the US. At best, Americans have received one-time checks for $1,200, about a week\u2019s worth of rent, groceries and utilities. Few are collecting unemployment benefits because unemployment offices are overwhelmed with claims. Congress\u2019s \u201cpayroll protection program\u201d has been a mess. Because funds have been distributed through financial institutions, banks have raked off money for themselves and rewarded their favored customers. Of the $350bn originally intended for small businesses, $243.4m has gone to large, publicly held companies. Meanwhile, the treasury and the Fed are bailing out big corporations from the debts they accumulated in recent years to buy back their shares of stock. Why is America so different from other advanced nations facing the same coronavirus threat? Why has everything gone so tragically wrong? Some of it is due to Trump and his hapless and corrupt collection of grifters, buffoons, sycophants, lobbyists and relatives. But there are also deeper roots. The coronavirus has been especially potent in the US because America is the only industrialized nation lacking universal healthcare. Many families have been reluctant to see doctors or check into emergency rooms for fear of racking up large bills. America is also the only one of 22 advanced nations failing to give all workers some form of paid sick leave. As a result, many American workers have remained on the job when they should have been home. Adding to this is the skimpiness of unemployment benefits in America \u2013 providing less support in the first year of unemployment than those in any other advanced country. American workplaces are also more dangerous. Even before Covid-19 ripped through meatpackers and warehouses, fatality rates were higher among American workers than European. Even before the pandemic robbed Americans of their jobs and incomes, average wage growth in the US had lagged behind average wage growth in most other advanced countries. Since 1980, American workers\u2019 share of total national income has declined more than in any other rich nation. In other nations, unions have long pushed for safer working conditions and higher wages. But American workers are far less unionized than workers in other advanced economies. Only 6.4% of private-sector workers in America belong to a union, compared with more than 26% in Canada, 37% in Italy, 67% in Sweden, and 25% in Britain. So who and what\u2019s to blame for the worst avoidable loss of life in American history? Partly, Donald Trump\u2019s malfeasance. But the calamity is also due to America\u2019s longer-term failure to provide its people the basic support they need.

Depending on which statistical data gatherer you believe, sales of alcohol online were up by as much as 50% in the first weeks of the crisis v \u201cnormal\u201d times. A lot of those sales went through the virtual tills of the supermarkets, of course. But the online wine specialists have been benefiting, too. If you\u2019re looking to dip a toe into online wine buying for the first time, many retailers are offering discounted mixed cases to get you started. <a href=\"https://www.slurp.co.uk/\">Slurp.co.uk</a>, for example, has a 10-bottle \u201cIndulge in Isolation\u201d case, which at \u00a3120 works out as a \u00a350 discount. There are some nice wines in there, although, personally, I\u2019d rather go \u00e0 la carte on slurp\u2019s extensive list, filling a case with bottles such as Shaw and Smith\u2019s superbly zingy, pristine sauvignon.</p> <p><strong>De Martino Viejas Tinajas Cinsault, Itata, Chile 2018 (\u00a314.95,<a href=\"https://www.virginwines.co.uk/\"> virginwines.co.uk</a>)</strong> One mixed case that I do like the look of is Virgin Wine\u2019s selection of contemporary German bottles, which, includes pinot blanc and pinot noir as well as a scintillating example of the country\u2019s most famous grape variety, Gunderloch Fritz\u2019s Riesling, Rheinhessen 2017 (a bottle of which is \u00a314.99 on its own; The Best of Modern Germany case of 12 bottles is \u00a3140). You could also include any of those Germans in a mixed case with a wine such as the gorgeously light, rosehippy-red fruited, clay amphora-made Viejas Tinajas from Chile. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s oldest wine retailer, and one of the first to make a success of online, Berry Bros &amp; Rudd, has a tempting 12 for \u00a3200 mix and match offer of 30 smart bottles, which is pretty good value for wines from the likes of De Martino, the Loire\u2019s Vincent Car\u00eame, Beaujolais\u2019 Julien Sunier and the Douro\u2019s Quinta de la Rosa.</p> <p><strong>The Society\u2019s White Burgundy 2018 (\u00a39.95, <a href=\"https://www.thewinesociety.com/\">thewinesociety.com</a>)</strong> With its stores closed to the public for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d, Majestic has become a de-facto online retailer, although to speed up delivery it recommends you email the local branch with your order rather than going through the website checkout.

Born and based in Minneapolis, he has published more than 25 books and received a Guggenheim fellowship in 2013</em></p> <p>Last year, I began a correspondence with a man who has been in prison since 2003. His letters have taken on new meaning in the wake of the pandemic and the \u201cstay at home\u201d orders. While I would never compare these constraints to incarceration, his words are nonetheless helpful. \u201cIt all boils down to limits,\u201d he recently wrote. \u201cWhether enforced by nature \u2013 biologic or social, tangible or abstractions \u2013 we all confront the parameters of our cage eventually. What we do when we reach those bars helps define us.\u201d</p> <p>As a photographer I\u2019m really struggling to respond to the pandemic, because I\u2019m not a crisis-response type photographer. I\u2019ve done little photographic experiments, and they\u2019ve been OK. But by far the most meaningful thing that\u2019s happened to me is this letter exchange. In terms of the image itself, I just took a picture of the letter with my iPhone, using the screen on my bedroom window to make the writing illegible, though a few words pop out here and there. I really do find it interesting to reflect on the constraints of prison, which are a million times worse than what I\u2019m going through, and all the psychological weight of incarceration that you can\u2019t even imagine.</p> <p>I feel like I\u2019m rattling my cage at the moment, but it\u2019s so not a cage. I\u2019m in a city but it\u2019s very spread out. I have a studio, which I have no problem getting to. I\u2019m biking a lot \u2013 thank God it\u2019s spring because Minnesota is the coldest part of the US and winters here are brutal. It\u2019s a distressing time, but really my life is not so very different at all.<strong> KF</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.vanessawinship.com/groups.php\">Vanessa Winship</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Folkestone, Kent</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc630032a1ff187dd6274040fa0ed76e5601ae22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc630032a1ff187dd6274040fa0ed76e5601ae22/0_0_3024_3780/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dandelion honey by Vanessa Winship\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dandelion honey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanessa Winship</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Lincolnshire-born</em><em> Vanessa Winship explores concepts of borders, identity and memory in her work, which was the subject of a major exhibition at the Barbican in 2018</em></p> <p>Before lockdown a friend sent me a link to a recipe for making <a href=\"https://veganonboard.com/vegan-dandelion-honey/\">vegan honey</a>. All you need is fresh dandelion flowers, sugar, a lemon and water. She suggested that perhaps it was something I could do with my granddaughter, Bella, because she knows we like making things together and doing things outside. Bella is six. In normal times we see each other quite a lot but because we\u2019re trying to obey the lockdown rules I haven\u2019t seen her for many weeks.</p> <p>Dandelions started to appear opposite my house and along the path where I take my daily walk, so even though I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be making the honey with her, I picked them and I\u2019m planning to follow the recipe. I\u2019m not vegan and neither is she but that is irrelevant, really \u2013 I just know it is something she would have loved to do.</p> <p>It was a coincidence that the cloth on our kitchen table the day I gathered the dandelions happened to have a pattern on it that looks like a beehive. But coincidence is a fantastic thing and I like it when it comes into my work.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been talking to Bella on Zoom and WhatsApp and because she is a child of the digital age she is very comfortable with that but I can\u2019t go outside with her and pick dandelions so the act of doing that by myself felt like a lovely link with her. What\u2019s really nice as well is that dandelions represent the sun and, in fact, yellow is her favourite colour. I also like the idea that after dandelions are dandelions they become clocks that we blow as a game, counting down the days to the end of our confinement. <strong>LO\u2019K</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.nadavkander.com/\">Nadav Kander</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8272df44b4c22086424d34c0aa7dac2b14b5d959\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8272df44b4c22086424d34c0aa7dac2b14b5d959/0_0_7702_6106/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From Inside 22.04.2020 \u00a9 Nadav Kander Courtesy Flowers Gallery\" width=\"1000\" height=\"793\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From Inside 22.04.2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Nadav Kander Courtesy Flowers Gallery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Winner of the outstanding contribution to photography prize at the 2019 Sony world photography awards, Nadav Kander is an acclaimed landscape and portrait photographer</em></p> <p>At the beginning of lockdown, my kneejerk reaction was to come to my studio, set things up and immediately start working. I realised quite quickly that this was an internal pressure I was putting on myself, it wasn\u2019t organic or authentic. I needed more time to process what I was feeling. I knew it was around solitude and touch but I wanted just to spend some weeks digesting it and then see how it comes out in my work rather than pushing.</p> <p>Part of that process was to bring a camera home and start looking more carefully at my house, turning my eyes on, in a way, and looking more deeply at my surroundings. I started taking pictures inside the house and spent a lot of time looking out of various windows at the plain blue sky without any streaks. One day we had this rainbow and I happened to notice it through the blind.</p> <p>I find it quite a gentle, poignant image. I like the way the blind drawn between inside and outside asks questions rather than answers them. The clear view would have been less ambiguous, I guess. This is veiled \u2013 I think that makes it more alluring.</p> <p>When lockdown was announced all my projects and the work I had just absolutely evaporated. But in many ways this period has been amazing, not frustrating. There are six of us at home \u2013 I have four children aged from 24 to 20 \u2013 and I feel very privileged to spend this time with them. I\u2019m actually in my element. I like everything being slower and having time to think and look. I feel more sorry for my children than myself: I think they are bursting to get out and hug people, see people and socialise. <strong>LO\u2019K</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/artists/35-eamonn-doyle/overview/\">Eamonn Doyle</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Dublin</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13fc13642231768795bdba65e021c580dcc5e1e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13fc13642231768795bdba65e021c580dcc5e1e4/0_0_6336_9504/667.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled, by Eamonn Doyle\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eamonn Doyle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>A record label owner and DJ, Eamonn Doyle returned to photography in 2008, focusing on working-class life on Dublin\u2019s north side.

While the lockdown was going on, I decided to move to his house in Sandycove, south Dublin, to be near my little nephew, who lives next door. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve lived out here since the late 80s, and I\u2019ve been taking a lot of photographs around the house where I grew up, which is up the road in Killiney. I\u2019ve been craving to go back into that house for decades and I\u2019d love to photograph it. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been wandering around the area, within two or three roads of the house, just photographing odd things \u2013 lampposts, markings on the ground, some surreal hedges \u2013 for a short-form publication.</p> <p>There was something about this trolley that drew me in, I\u2019m not sure what: the particular light, the wall behind it, the direction of the wheels\u2026 There aren\u2019t really any supermarkets nearby \u2013 the nearest Tesco is a couple of kilometres away \u2013 so somebody must have pushed it quite a bit. It\u2019s not part of a narrative or anything. I was just in the mode of focusing on singular objects.</p> <p>The lockdown has been fine for me. In terms of my day-to-day, it\u2019s been really nice to be out here by the sea, walking around, but I\u2019m very aware that it\u2019s a very unrealistic, unsustainable situation. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going through any heavy grieving or anything \u2013 the overriding emotion is one of absolute relief that my dad isn\u2019t dying in hospital right now.

Instead, I\u2019ve been reading books, watching movies and thinking about my new work, as well as doing some printing in my darkroom.

One of my ambitions in my photography is to make pictures that look like they were taken by a writer, but in a good way. They\u2019re not just pure emotion, they\u2019re constructed.</p> <p>I took this image in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within walking distance of my house. What drew me to the scene was the ladders. Ladders are a recurring theme in my work. They are full of metaphorical intensity: a ladder can take you up, but it can also bring you down. And, of course, in many religious positions, ladders suggest heaven. So I walk by this blue house and there\u2019s four ladders \u2013 it\u2019s slight ladder overkill. I tried to see what was going on and I saw the man and took a photo.</p> <p>That was my initial attraction. But once he turned around something had changed, because he was wearing a mask. And I was wearing a mask. The usual element of surveillance that we get in street photography has gone away because I couldn\u2019t identify him. He couldn\u2019t identify me. But a new tension had entered the exchange and that new tension felt to me like a new language that we were all learning to speak at the same time. There is also this cascade of association of what it means when somebody covers their face, and I thought about <em><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Beekeepers_and_the_Birdnester_-_WGA03528.jpg\">The Beekeepers and the Birdnester</a>,</em> a drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.</p> <p>Emotionally, this is a particularly difficult time to do work. It\u2019s not like: \u201cOh, it\u2019s a wonderful vacation!\u201d I\u2019m not sitting here writing <em>King Lear</em>. I cannot have that blithe attitude to it, because thousands of people are dying every day. But I think the images I\u2019ve made in the past six weeks have had even more focus and tension than they usually do. And tension is usually what I\u2019m looking for when I choose a photograph.<strong> TL</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lizjohnsonartur/?hl=en\">Liz Johnson Artur</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Brighton</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cecfc5e5bb83549d981a9d52b5c9a3dd5973003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cecfc5e5bb83549d981a9d52b5c9a3dd5973003/0_0_4128_6752/611.jpg\" alt=\"Lockdown image by Liz Johnson Artur\" width=\"611\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Ghanaian-Russian photographer Liz Johnson Artur documents the lives of people from the African diaspora. Her first solo show spanning three decades of work ran at the Brooklyn Museum last year</em></p> <p>I\u2019m based in London, but I live in Brighton with my family, and a couple of days before lockdown, I decided that probably London wasn\u2019t the place to be. So I went to Brighton. April was a very beautiful month in terms of the weather and this picture was taken in my garden there.</p> <p>The image is by a photographer called Peter Basch, a German \u00e9migr\u00e9 who lived in New York. He did a series of photographs of women in the 1960s, which he called \u201cexotic beauties\u201d. So I was looking at this book and it was badly bound and very windy in the garden, and suddenly all the pages flew off. While I was collecting them, I thought they actually looked quite nice in the garden. There\u2019s a lot of poetry in real life: sometimes it\u2019s there simply by picking something up and combining it with something else that you wouldn\u2019t usually combine it with.</p> <p>The work that I do as an artist and as a photographer has a lot to do with black and brown representation. On one side, I was aesthetically attracted by Basch\u2019s photographs, but at the same time, I was also irritated by the whole \u201cexotic beauties\u201d setup of the book. This picture felt like a way to give these \u201cexotic beauties\u201d my own kind of interpretation.</p> <p>It\u2019s a very painful time, and the people that I like to represent are especially affected. But there\u2019s a certain luxury for me in being able to slow down and look at things without any time pressure. In Brighton, I have a 35mm camera and black-and-white film. That\u2019s all I need. Big plans at the moment are hard to accomplish, so I like the idea of small steps and small gestures. This picture is part of that. <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.newshatavakolian.com/\">Newsha Tavakolian</a><br>Tehran</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"464409494c4251fce555e4a9876795b97be0af0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/464409494c4251fce555e4a9876795b97be0af0c/0_0_7433_5943/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Me at home being bored in the living room of my house, playing with my lighter., Tehran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Me at home being bored in the living room of my house, playing with my lighter, Tehran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Newsha Tavakolian/Magnum Photos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>The Iranian Magnum photojournalist is renowned for her coverage of conflict and social issues across the Middle East</em></p> <p>Iran was one of the first countries to be hit by coronavirus after China, so I wanted to show the outside world my experience of day-to-day life in self-quarantine. Stuck at home, you become more sensitive about details you might otherwise miss. For 17 years, I have been looking at this view of a lampshade at my home in Tehran, but I never thought of taking a picture of it. One night I was bored by myself and I was playing with my camera. I wanted to smoke, so I flicked on my lighter and noticed how the flame lined up nicely with the light from the bulb.</p> <p>My father passed away exactly a year before this was taken. We were meant to have a big ceremony for the anniversary, but we had to cancel it at the last minute. Instead, my mother, my sister and I went to the cemetery to visit his grave. I was shocked by how quiet it was \u2013 we were completely on our own. Then I came home and I was wondering: is this the new normal? It\u2019s like a scary film we are living. Fortunately or unfortunately, nearly two months later, I\u2019ve kind of got used to it. When I want to visit my mother, who lives close by, I put on my face mask without thinking.</p> <p>If I can say one thing to other photographers and artists , it\u2019s that they must act before this lifestyle becomes normal. Now is the best time to do projects, because everything is new. You\u2019ve got to capture that before you lose your appetite.<strong> KF</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.gilesduley.com/\">Giles Duley</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>Hastings</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12aa91d3d06227608402ebd6c6472c11d041c82d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12aa91d3d06227608402ebd6c6472c11d041c82d/0_0_7882_9531/827.jpg\" alt=\"Hastings, Wednesday 29 April 2020 by Giles Duley\" width=\"827\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hastings, Wednesday 29 April 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Duley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>A documentary photographer focusing on the long-term impact of war, Giles Duley is a triple amputee after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan</em></p> <p>This is the view from my window.

I am not sure if the sea reflects my mood or the mood of the sea is reflected in me but there is definitely a reciprocity of some kind. Often I\u2019ll wake up feeling a bit flat and I look at the sea and find it is a bit flat and grey too. This picture was taken on one of those days.</p> <p>I\u2019m in isolation on my own. It would be nice to have company but I guess photographers are loners by nature. I\u2019ve been cooking relentlessly \u2013 it\u2019s my way to relax \u2013 and the button burst off my trousers last week, so I\u2019ll have to watch that.</p> <p>I\u2019m spending the rest of the time trying to be useful. Through the charity I run, <a href=\"https://www.legacyofwarfoundation.com/\">Legacy of War Foundation</a>, I\u2019ve set up a group called Hastings Supports the NHS and we\u2019ve been providing free transport for NHS staff, buying PPE and hand sanitisers for them.

Then the other night, I realised I hadn\u2019t been out after dark for over a month. So I decided to go for some night wanders. The American photographer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/feb/24/robert-adams-photographs-american-west-paris\">Robert Adams</a> did a series of nightscapes in the 1970s called <em>Summer Nights, Walking</em>. I\u2019ve always really admired that work so I thought I\u2019d explore the area around where I live, in Holloway, north London.</p> <p>This photograph was taken around 10.30pm on a housing estate near the Emirates Stadium. The day had been warm, but the evening was chilly and there was a strong breeze. So you had the trees blowing, which is quite atmospheric, and then the warmth and pockets of light in the windows of the people getting ready for bed or having a late dinner. Most of my recent work has been shot in black-and-white, although this was digital, because I normally use an old-fashioned 5x4 plate camera. I might have been arrested if I\u2019d got that out.</p> <p>I was surprised, because it felt eerie and quite unsettling. I\u2019ve lived in London for more than 20 years and never really felt unsafe, but I didn\u2019t really enjoy it, and that probably sums up how I was feeling at that particular moment. There were people lurking in the shadows and it felt odd to be in a neighbourhood I\u2019m so familiar with yet not feel comfortable.</p> <p>After the lockdown is over, I\u2019ll probably look more towards stories around me. In the past, I\u2019ve never felt that inspired by what\u2019s on my doorstep, but you don\u2019t have to go to the Amazon or Antarctica to make interesting pictures. Also, photographers are all going to be completely skint, so we won\u2019t be able to afford to go away anyway! <strong>TL</strong></p> <h2><strong><a href=\"http://www.chrissteeleperkins.com/\">Chris Steele-Perkins</a></strong></h2> <p><strong>London</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"166cca33104f51fbdf6f8d9bea3eb9e4c1bf151c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/166cca33104f51fbdf6f8d9bea3eb9e4c1bf151c/0_0_3610_3628/995.jpg\" alt=\"Self portrait of Chris Steele-Perkins at the time of Covid-19 using i-phone Pano settings\" width=\"995\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self portrait at the time of Covid-19 using i-Phone pano settings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Steele-Perkins</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Magnum photographer Chris Steele-Perkins published The Teds, his seminal book on teddy boys, in 1979.

I rigged up the phone so that it would rotate, and then I jumped in front of the lens and followed it as it moved, turning my head and pulling faces. I had no real control over the outcome, which I found interesting. Sometimes it misses you entirely, and it does strange things to your face.

His letters have taken on new meaning in the wake of the pandemic and the \u201cstay at home\u201d orders. While I would never compare these constraints to incarceration, his words are nonetheless helpful. \u201cIt all boils down to limits,\u201d he recently wrote. \u201cWhether enforced by nature \u2013 biologic or social, tangible or abstractions \u2013 we all confront the parameters of our cage eventually. What we do when we reach those bars helps define us.\u201d As a photographer I\u2019m really struggling to respond to the pandemic, because I\u2019m not a crisis-response type photographer. I\u2019ve done little photographic experiments, and they\u2019ve been OK. But by far the most meaningful thing that\u2019s happened to me is this letter exchange. In terms of the image itself, I just took a picture of the letter with my iPhone, using the screen on my bedroom window to make the writing illegible, though a few words pop out here and there. I really do find it interesting to reflect on the constraints of prison, which are a million times worse than what I\u2019m going through, and all the psychological weight of incarceration that you can\u2019t even imagine. I feel like I\u2019m rattling my cage at the moment, but it\u2019s so not a cage. I\u2019m in a city but it\u2019s very spread out. I have a studio, which I have no problem getting to. I\u2019m biking a lot \u2013 thank God it\u2019s spring because Minnesota is the coldest part of the US and winters here are brutal. It\u2019s a distressing time, but really my life is not so very different at all. KF Vanessa Winship Folkestone, Kent Lincolnshire-born Vanessa Winship explores concepts of borders, identity and memory in her work, which was the subject of a major exhibition at the Barbican in 2018 Before lockdown a friend sent me a link to a recipe for making vegan honey. All you need is fresh dandelion flowers, sugar, a lemon and water. She suggested that perhaps it was something I could do with my granddaughter, Bella, because she knows we like making things together and doing things outside. Bella is six. In normal times we see each other quite a lot but because we\u2019re trying to obey the lockdown rules I haven\u2019t seen her for many weeks. Dandelions started to appear opposite my house and along the path where I take my daily walk, so even though I knew I wasn\u2019t going to be making the honey with her, I picked them and I\u2019m planning to follow the recipe. I\u2019m not vegan and neither is she but that is irrelevant, really \u2013 I just know it is something she would have loved to do. It was a coincidence that the cloth on our kitchen table the day I gathered the dandelions happened to have a pattern on it that looks like a beehive. But coincidence is a fantastic thing and I like it when it comes into my work. I\u2019ve been talking to Bella on Zoom and WhatsApp and because she is a child of the digital age she is very comfortable with that but I can\u2019t go outside with her and pick dandelions so the act of doing that by myself felt like a lovely link with her. What\u2019s really nice as well is that dandelions represent the sun and, in fact, yellow is her favourite colour. I also like the idea that after dandelions are dandelions they become clocks that we blow as a game, counting down the days to the end of our confinement. LO\u2019K Nadav Kander London Winner of the outstanding contribution to photography prize at the 2019 Sony world photography awards, Nadav Kander is an acclaimed landscape and portrait photographer At the beginning of lockdown, my kneejerk reaction was to come to my studio, set things up and immediately start working. I realised quite quickly that this was an internal pressure I was putting on myself, it wasn\u2019t organic or authentic. I needed more time to process what I was feeling. I knew it was around solitude and touch but I wanted just to spend some weeks digesting it and then see how it comes out in my work rather than pushing. Part of that process was to bring a camera home and start looking more carefully at my house, turning my eyes on, in a way, and looking more deeply at my surroundings. I started taking pictures inside the house and spent a lot of time looking out of various windows at the plain blue sky without any streaks. One day we had this rainbow and I happened to notice it through the blind. I find it quite a gentle, poignant image. I like the way the blind drawn between inside and outside asks questions rather than answers them. The clear view would have been less ambiguous, I guess. This is veiled \u2013 I think that makes it more alluring. When lockdown was announced all my projects and the work I had just absolutely evaporated. But in many ways this period has been amazing, not frustrating. There are six of us at home \u2013 I have four children aged from 24 to 20 \u2013 and I feel very privileged to spend this time with them. I\u2019m actually in my element. I like everything being slower and having time to think and look. I feel more sorry for my children than myself: I think they are bursting to get out and hug people, see people and socialise. LO\u2019K Eamonn Doyle Dublin A record label owner and DJ, Eamonn Doyle returned to photography in 2008, focusing on working-class life on Dublin\u2019s north side. Martin Parr called Doyle\u2019s 2014 book, i, \u201cthe best street photobook in a decade\u201d Just before the pandemic hit, my dad died after a short illness. While the lockdown was going on, I decided to move to his house in Sandycove, south Dublin, to be near my little nephew, who lives next door. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve lived out here since the late 80s, and I\u2019ve been taking a lot of photographs around the house where I grew up, which is up the road in Killiney. I\u2019ve been craving to go back into that house for decades and I\u2019d love to photograph it. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been wandering around the area, within two or three roads of the house, just photographing odd things \u2013 lampposts, markings on the ground, some surreal hedges \u2013 for a short-form publication. There was something about this trolley that drew me in, I\u2019m not sure what: the particular light, the wall behind it, the direction of the wheels\u2026 There aren\u2019t really any supermarkets nearby \u2013 the nearest Tesco is a couple of kilometres away \u2013 so somebody must have pushed it quite a bit. It\u2019s not part of a narrative or anything. I was just in the mode of focusing on singular objects. The lockdown has been fine for me. In terms of my day-to-day, it\u2019s been really nice to be out here by the sea, walking around, but I\u2019m very aware that it\u2019s a very unrealistic, unsustainable situation. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m going through any heavy grieving or anything \u2013 the overriding emotion is one of absolute relief that my dad isn\u2019t dying in hospital right now. That would have been so much worse. KF Rinko Kawauchi Chiba prefecture, near Tokyo Born in Shiga prefecture, Rinko Kawauchi is renowned for her intimate, dream-like images of family life and religious activity in Japan This is a photograph of my daughter and my friend\u2019s son. They are both three years old and they are looking for an insect in my back yard. It was taken 17 days before the Japanese government announced a state of emergency [on 16 April]. It was the last day of having time together with my friends before lockdown. The children are a metaphor of our future and I hope that future will be surrounded by brightness and light. The coronavirus crisis has reminded me of the Fukushima nuclear disaster nine years ago. I was living in Tokyo when it happened and I couldn\u2019t walk outside at that time. It\u2019s a different situation now, but I had a similar feeling that the world I live in was changing in a big way. I haven\u2019t been taking many photographs during the lockdown, apart from at home and at my neighbour\u2019s house. Instead, I\u2019ve been reading books, watching movies and thinking about my new work, as well as doing some printing in my darkroom. It\u2019s a good opportunity to catch up on things like that. KF Teju Cole Cambridge, Massachusetts Teju Cole is a Nigerian-American writer, photographer and critic, whose genre-crossing book Blind Spot was shortlisted for the 2017 Aperture/Paris photobook award I\u2019m a photographer and I\u2019m a writer, and I keep trying to bring those two things together. One of my ambitions in my photography is to make pictures that look like they were taken by a writer, but in a good way. They\u2019re not just pure emotion, they\u2019re constructed. I took this image in Cambridge, Massachusetts, within walking distance of my house. What drew me to the scene was the ladders. Ladders are a recurring theme in my work. They are full of metaphorical intensity: a ladder can take you up, but it can also bring you down. And, of course, in many religious positions, ladders suggest heaven. So I walk by this blue house and there\u2019s four ladders \u2013 it\u2019s slight ladder overkill. I tried to see what was going on and I saw the man and took a photo. That was my initial attraction. But once he turned around something had changed, because he was wearing a mask. And I was wearing a mask. The usual element of surveillance that we get in street photography has gone away because I couldn\u2019t identify him. He couldn\u2019t identify me. But a new tension had entered the exchange and that new tension felt to me like a new language that we were all learning to speak at the same time. There is also this cascade of association of what it means when somebody covers their face, and I thought about The Beekeepers and the Birdnester, a drawing by Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Emotionally, this is a particularly difficult time to do work. It\u2019s not like: \u201cOh, it\u2019s a wonderful vacation!\u201d I\u2019m not sitting here writing King Lear. I cannot have that blithe attitude to it, because thousands of people are dying every day. But I think the images I\u2019ve made in the past six weeks have had even more focus and tension than they usually do. And tension is usually what I\u2019m looking for when I choose a photograph. TL Liz Johnson Artur Brighton Ghanaian-Russian photographer Liz Johnson Artur documents the lives of people from the African diaspora. Her first solo show spanning three decades of work ran at the Brooklyn Museum last year I\u2019m based in London, but I live in Brighton with my family, and a couple of days before lockdown, I decided that probably London wasn\u2019t the place to be. So I went to Brighton. April was a very beautiful month in terms of the weather and this picture was taken in my garden there. The image is by a photographer called Peter Basch, a German \u00e9migr\u00e9 who lived in New York. He did a series of photographs of women in the 1960s, which he called \u201cexotic beauties\u201d. So I was looking at this book and it was badly bound and very windy in the garden, and suddenly all the pages flew off. While I was collecting them, I thought they actually looked quite nice in the garden. There\u2019s a lot of poetry in real life: sometimes it\u2019s there simply by picking something up and combining it with something else that you wouldn\u2019t usually combine it with. The work that I do as an artist and as a photographer has a lot to do with black and brown representation. On one side, I was aesthetically attracted by Basch\u2019s photographs, but at the same time, I was also irritated by the whole \u201cexotic beauties\u201d setup of the book. This picture felt like a way to give these \u201cexotic beauties\u201d my own kind of interpretation. It\u2019s a very painful time, and the people that I like to represent are especially affected. But there\u2019s a certain luxury for me in being able to slow down and look at things without any time pressure. In Brighton, I have a 35mm camera and black-and-white film. That\u2019s all I need. Big plans at the moment are hard to accomplish, so I like the idea of small steps and small gestures. This picture is part of that. TL Newsha Tavakolian Tehran The Iranian Magnum photojournalist is renowned for her coverage of conflict and social issues across the Middle East Iran was one of the first countries to be hit by coronavirus after China, so I wanted to show the outside world my experience of day-to-day life in self-quarantine. Stuck at home, you become more sensitive about details you might otherwise miss. For 17 years, I have been looking at this view of a lampshade at my home in Tehran, but I never thought of taking a picture of it. One night I was bored by myself and I was playing with my camera. I wanted to smoke, so I flicked on my lighter and noticed how the flame lined up nicely with the light from the bulb. My father passed away exactly a year before this was taken. We were meant to have a big ceremony for the anniversary, but we had to cancel it at the last minute. Instead, my mother, my sister and I went to the cemetery to visit his grave. I was shocked by how quiet it was \u2013 we were completely on our own. Then I came home and I was wondering: is this the new normal? It\u2019s like a scary film we are living. Fortunately or unfortunately, nearly two months later, I\u2019ve kind of got used to it. When I want to visit my mother, who lives close by, I put on my face mask without thinking. If I can say one thing to other photographers and artists , it\u2019s that they must act before this lifestyle becomes normal. Now is the best time to do projects, because everything is new. You\u2019ve got to capture that before you lose your appetite. KF Giles Duley Hastings A documentary photographer focusing on the long-term impact of war, Giles Duley is a triple amputee after stepping on a landmine in Afghanistan This is the view from my window. Every day since lockdown began I\u2019ve been walking across the road in front of my house and sitting on the bench on the other side to do this kind of meditation for 20 minutes, get my fresh air for the day and take a photograph of the sea. I moved to live by the sea 20 years ago because when I\u2019m working I am normally in conflict zones, which are tense and stressful places, so when I come back I need peace and I find the sea really helpful. I am not sure if the sea reflects my mood or the mood of the sea is reflected in me but there is definitely a reciprocity of some kind. Often I\u2019ll wake up feeling a bit flat and I look at the sea and find it is a bit flat and grey too. This picture was taken on one of those days. I\u2019m in isolation on my own. It would be nice to have company but I guess photographers are loners by nature. I\u2019ve been cooking relentlessly \u2013 it\u2019s my way to relax \u2013 and the button burst off my trousers last week, so I\u2019ll have to watch that. I\u2019m spending the rest of the time trying to be useful. Through the charity I run, Legacy of War Foundation, I\u2019ve set up a group called Hastings Supports the NHS and we\u2019ve been providing free transport for NHS staff, buying PPE and hand sanitisers for them. It\u2019s been great because the whole community has got involved. We\u2019re going to auction a print of this photograph to raise more money. I still shoot on film, and by chance one of the world\u2019s best darkroom printers, Robin Bell, lives around the corner from me. So I left the roll of film on my windowsill, and he popped around to collect it and brought back this print a few hours later. LO\u2019K Alys Tomlinson London Named photographer of the year at the 2018 Sony world photography awards, Alys Tomlinson studied anthropology as well as photography. Her 2019 book, Ex Voto, explores Christian pilgrimages Since the lockdown, I haven\u2019t felt really that inspired to take pictures. Then the other night, I realised I hadn\u2019t been out after dark for over a month. So I decided to go for some night wanders. The American photographer Robert Adams did a series of nightscapes in the 1970s called Summer Nights, Walking. I\u2019ve always really admired that work so I thought I\u2019d explore the area around where I live, in Holloway, north London. This photograph was taken around 10.30pm on a housing estate near the Emirates Stadium. The day had been warm, but the evening was chilly and there was a strong breeze. So you had the trees blowing, which is quite atmospheric, and then the warmth and pockets of light in the windows of the people getting ready for bed or having a late dinner. Most of my recent work has been shot in black-and-white, although this was digital, because I normally use an old-fashioned 5x4 plate camera. I might have been arrested if I\u2019d got that out. I was surprised, because it felt eerie and quite unsettling. I\u2019ve lived in London for more than 20 years and never really felt unsafe, but I didn\u2019t really enjoy it, and that probably sums up how I was feeling at that particular moment. There were people lurking in the shadows and it felt odd to be in a neighbourhood I\u2019m so familiar with yet not feel comfortable. After the lockdown is over, I\u2019ll probably look more towards stories around me. In the past, I\u2019ve never felt that inspired by what\u2019s on my doorstep, but you don\u2019t have to go to the Amazon or Antarctica to make interesting pictures. Also, photographers are all going to be completely skint, so we won\u2019t be able to afford to go away anyway! TL Chris Steele-Perkins London Magnum photographer Chris Steele-Perkins published The Teds, his seminal book on teddy boys, in 1979. He has photographed conflict and deprivation all over the globe, winning the Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1988 I took this self-portrait using the panoramic setting on my iPhone. I rigged up the phone so that it would rotate, and then I jumped in front of the lens and followed it as it moved, turning my head and pulling faces. I had no real control over the outcome, which I found interesting. Sometimes it misses you entirely, and it does strange things to your face. There\u2019s a brutal ugliness about it, and a randomness, which is what\u2019s so freaky about coronavirus \u2013 anybody could be struck down for any reason, almost. When the pandemic started, I didn\u2019t really want to go out, because I\u2019m at risk myself, in principle, and there was nothing I really wanted to document as a documentary photographer. This series (out of more than 150 photos, I got six that I\u2019m happy with) seems like a valid record of this time and how I\u2019m feeling. It expresses some sense of dread, or at least unease. I\u2019m not feeling like that all the time, thank God, though I\u2019ve had some pretty bleak moments late at night, thinking what else could go wrong with this whole situation. I\u2019m at home in south London, but my wife, who is Japanese, is in Japan. I was meant to be going over there too, but we left it a bit late. I call her every day. Actually, that\u2019s what I\u2019m using my camera for more than anything else: I\u2019ll go out and photograph the garden and then send her an image and say: \u201cHere\u2019s the magnolia coming out.\u201d It\u2019s an alternative to taking photos of my monstrous face.

Over the last two months, dozens of prospective tests have hit the market, and with many governments wanting to feed the results of large-scale testing into their decisions whether to end lockdowns, biological tests have rarely carried such weight.</p> \n<p>Most of the tests are enthusiastically marketed, boasting of their ability to accurately detect whether someone has previously been infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus.

      "bodyText": "At the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, Marion Koopmans and a team of scientists are going throught the laborious process of verifying antibody tests for Covid-19. Over the last two months, dozens of prospective tests have hit the market, and with many governments wanting to feed the results of large-scale testing into their decisions whether to end lockdowns, biological tests have rarely carried such weight. Most of the tests are enthusiastically marketed, boasting of their ability to accurately detect whether someone has previously been infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The painstaking job of proving whether the tests do what they say has fallen to a worldwide network of 12 independent centres, of which Koopmans\u2019s team is one. \u201cThere are now more than 200 tests being offered and that number is increasing by the day,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause people want to have testing up and running fast, there\u2019s this massive, almost aggressive marketing of test kits that promise a lot, but haven\u2019t gone through proper scrutiny.\u201d NHS doctors use a diagnostic called a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test \u2013 which picks up traces of the virus\u2019s genetic material in oral or nasal swabs \u2013 to confirm suspected cases of Covid-19. However, PCR tests only work when the virus is still present in the body. The aim of using antibody tests is to conduct what is known as serosurveillance or a serosurvey. This means testing a sample of a population to get an indication of how prevalent Covid-19 infections have been, including those who have been asymptomatic or only suffered mild symptoms. Antibody tests search for the Y-shaped proteins produced by the body in response to an infection that linger (in some cases permanently) in the blood for some time after recovery. The hope is that policymakers will be able to obtain accurate models of how far the epidemic has spread, and what the real infection tallies are, a topic that has become increasingly heated in recent weeks. At the start of April, Bruce Aylward \u2013 the World Health Organization delegate assessing China\u2019s response to the outbreak \u2013 declared that there was no evidence that current infection statistics are only the \u201ctip of a grand iceberg\u201d and suggested that the virus had only affected a very small proportion of communities.

Bhattacharya estimated true rates of exposure of up to 4%, but his work has since been criticised by other scientists on various grounds, not least after it emerged that his wife had recruited some of the study participants by emailing a local high school. Other early serosurveys conducted in New York City and the German town of Gangelt have found much higher prevalences ranging from 14-21%. However, these communities were particularly severely affected, so reservations have been expressed about whether they are representative of the entire population. Acquiring accurate antibody data will also be vital for vaccine developers to verify that their products are working as intended during clinical trials.

Only six out of 10 would support schools being allowed to even partially reopen before other places such as shops and restaurants, while a significant minority (16%) would oppose any kind of partial reopening. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"[https://www.parentkind.org.uk/News/Major-new-Parentkind-research---over-a-quarter-of-a-million-parents-have-a-say-on-school-closures-and-coronavirus-fears\">separate survey</a> of more than 250,000 parents carried out last week by the PTA charity Parentkind, nearly one in five parents said they would feel confident about sending their child back to school only when school leaders and teachers said it was safe to do so. One in 10 were even more cautious and said they would rather wait until all staff and pupils had been vaccinated against Covid-19 \u2013 even if that meant their children would spend up to 18 months being home-schooled.</p> <p>In Shrewsbury, the principal of Severndale specialist academy, Sabrina Hobbs, spent the early days of the lockdown crying in her car on her way to work. \u201cI was emotionally distraught on the way to school, thinking: how do I manage this? How do I keep everyone safe?\u201d</p> <p>All the pupils at her school have special needs. Some need help with going to the toilet and the vast majority need physical assistance or close contact with staff.</p> <p>Although Hobbs has recently managed to source PPE, including visors and goggles, for all her staff, she can fit only three children in a classroom if she socially distances the pupils. This leaves her with a maximum capacity of 50 pupils, on a rota throughout the week, instead of 405 every day. \u201cThe limitations are really around the availability of staff and the space we have available in school. I have a duty of care to protect my staff \u2013 but also to protect the children as well.\u201d</p> <p>According to the National Association of Headteachers, 83% of headteachers currently think an inability to implement appropriate social distancing measures would prevent schools from opening to more pupils. Only 48% report that over 70% of staff were available to attend school, while 25% said less than half their staff were available to attend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><br></h2> <h2>How Europe is reopening schools</h2> <p><em>Jon Henley</em></p> <h2><br></h2> <h2><strong>Denmark</strong></h2> <p>Denmark became the first country in Europe to begin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/children-as-likely-to-spread-coronavirus-as-adults-says-scientist\">reopening schools</a> after a month-long closure, with nursery, kindergarten and primary classes resuming on <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/coronavirus-countries-schools-education-covid19-reopen-classroom/\">15 April</a> \u2013 although many requested an extra week to adjust to strict physical distancing and health protocols. Two metres must be maintained between desks in classrooms; arrivals, departures and breaks must be organised in small groups; and hands must be washed frequently. Some parents opposed reopening on health grounds, with 40,000 joining a Facebook group called <a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/pg/mychildisnotaguineapig/posts/\">\u201cMy child is not a guinea pig\u201d</a>.

A decision on whether senior high schools (lyc\u00e9es) can reopen on 2 June will be taken at the end of May. Concerned parents are not obliged to send their children to school, and teachers can refuse to return on health grounds, although they must provide lessons online if they do not.

However, children under six whose parents cannot work from home will be able to return from 25 May.

      "bodyText": "It has been an emotional week for primary school headteacher Kate Baptiste: \u201cI have actually cried,\u201d she says. She is scared that the government will announce today that schools will reopen next month \u2013 even though it could be dangerous to do so. \u201cI\u2019m used to making decisions that are rooted in what is best for the children. This is all out of my hands, and it\u2019s terrifying.\u201d The failure of the government to lay out its medical and scientific case for reopening schools has been taking its toll on headteachers such as Baptiste. She has no idea how she can open her school, St Monica\u2019s Catholic primary school in north London, without turning it into a breeding ground for the virus. \u201cI feel torn in many different directions. It\u2019s exhausting trying to reassure everyone with what I feel are empty promises, as we may be forced to open schools when we genuinely don\u2019t feel it\u2019s safe to do so. This is my 14th year as a headteacher and I\u2019ve never felt so scared, unsure, tired or vulnerable.\u201d The problem, she says, is that she can fit a maximum of only six children into each of her classrooms if they need to maintain a social distance of two metres at all times. Her staff numbers have been vastly reduced, as some employees are members of vulnerable groups, leaving her with just 12 classroom teachers. The corridors in her school are less than two metres wide in many places, making it difficult for children and staff to pass each other safely, and she estimates that serving socially distanced school dinners to 300 children each day will take most of the afternoon. This is my fourteenth year as a headteacher and I\u2019ve never felt so scared, unsure, tired or vulnerable Plus, she says, it is unrealistic to expect young children to maintain a two-metre distance at playtime, which she is not prepared to ban. \u201cPlay is critical for children to be able to feel happy and to enjoy school life,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat will happen if we make them sit like little robots in chairs, two metres away from each other, and they don\u2019t have any interaction with their peers all day long? The following day you can just see it: tears and tantrums.\u201d They won\u2019t want to come into school, she says, and who could blame them? \u201cThey\u2019ll hate it \u2013 it will be such a different experience.\u201dUltimately, she thinks forcing young children to go to school in these circumstances would be counterproductive, and could seriously harm their well-being. \u201cI understand from an economic point of view that parents need to go back to work \u2013 but not at the expense of children\u2019s mental health.\u201d Sean Maher, head of Richard Challoner secondary school in Kingston, south-west London, has also spent the last week feeling stressed. He woke up at 4am on Thursday, worrying about how on earth he can reopen his school safely. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly running things around in your head. How can we manage that? What\u2019s going to happen if we do this?\u201d There is no possible way to safely social distance all the pupils in his school. \u201cLike most schools, we just don\u2019t have the space to allow that to happen.\u201d Even a partial reopening \u2013 allowing just the 160 children who will have to take their GCSEs next year to return to school \u2013 would be problematic. \u201cThe reality is, children are just not going to stay two metres apart. They just won\u2019t do it. \u201cThere aren\u2019t enough teachers to spread the children out into different classrooms, while still providing online learning for pupils in the year groups stuck at home. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got teachers in school teaching, how are they also going to be able to set work online? Unless we want them teaching every evening and every day \u2013 which I think might cause a few problems in the teaching unions.\u201d He has considered trying to source PPE for his staff, but is unsure where he would get it and has no funds to pay for it. \u201cI\u2019ve already got, thanks to the lockdown, a deficit in my budget of \u00a3120,000,\u201d he says. On Friday, unions for teachers and other school staff said schools must not reopen until a UK-wide \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d scheme is under way and PPE is provided to workers. An Opinium poll for the Observer shows 53% of parents with a secondary school-aged child and 38% of parents with a primary school-aged child would feel anxious if the government decided to reopen schools. Only six out of 10 would support schools being allowed to even partially reopen before other places such as shops and restaurants, while a significant minority (16%) would oppose any kind of partial reopening. In a separate survey of more than 250,000 parents carried out last week by the PTA charity Parentkind, nearly one in five parents said they would feel confident about sending their child back to school only when school leaders and teachers said it was safe to do so. One in 10 were even more cautious and said they would rather wait until all staff and pupils had been vaccinated against Covid-19 \u2013 even if that meant their children would spend up to 18 months being home-schooled. In Shrewsbury, the principal of Severndale specialist academy, Sabrina Hobbs, spent the early days of the lockdown crying in her car on her way to work. \u201cI was emotionally distraught on the way to school, thinking: how do I manage this? How do I keep everyone safe?\u201d All the pupils at her school have special needs. Some need help with going to the toilet and the vast majority need physical assistance or close contact with staff. Although Hobbs has recently managed to source PPE, including visors and goggles, for all her staff, she can fit only three children in a classroom if she socially distances the pupils. This leaves her with a maximum capacity of 50 pupils, on a rota throughout the week, instead of 405 every day. \u201cThe limitations are really around the availability of staff and the space we have available in school. I have a duty of care to protect my staff \u2013 but also to protect the children as well.\u201d According to the National Association of Headteachers, 83% of headteachers currently think an inability to implement appropriate social distancing measures would prevent schools from opening to more pupils. Only 48% report that over 70% of staff were available to attend school, while 25% said less than half their staff were available to attend. How Europe is reopening schools Jon Henley Denmark Denmark became the first country in Europe to begin reopening schools after a month-long closure, with nursery, kindergarten and primary classes resuming on 15 April \u2013 although many requested an extra week to adjust to strict physical distancing and health protocols. Two metres must be maintained between desks in classrooms; arrivals, departures and breaks must be organised in small groups; and hands must be washed frequently. Some parents opposed reopening on health grounds, with 40,000 joining a Facebook group called \u201cMy child is not a guinea pig\u201d. Pupils aged between 11 and 18 are due to return to class on 18 May following an agreement last week between Denmark\u2019s political parties. France Up to 85% of the 50,500 schools will reopen progressively from Tuesday, again with strict hygiene and distancing rules: frequent disinfection of classes and common areas, regular hand-washing or gel, mandatory masks for older pupils, no physical contact, a maximum of 15 per class in primary schools and 10 in pre-school. First to return will be the final year of pre-school and the first and final years of primary school, with most remaining under-16s returning on 18 May \u2013 but not in in \u201cred\u201d regions, including the greater Paris area, where the virus is still circulating widely. A decision on whether senior high schools (lyc\u00e9es) can reopen on 2 June will be taken at the end of May. Concerned parents are not obliged to send their children to school, and teachers can refuse to return on health grounds, although they must provide lessons online if they do not. Some municipalities, particularly in dense city centres such as Paris, are expected to open later because their school buildings make it more difficult to ensure the required physical distancing. Netherlands Dutch primary schools and pre-schools start reopening from tomorrow. About 80% will open for whole days, a survey by the state broadcaster NOS showed, with half the pupils being taught in school and the other half online on alternate days. Around 10% have opted to teach two half-days instead. Some teachers are expected to stay at home, with up to a third saying it was too early for schools to go back. Some families, particularly those with members in at-risk groups, are also thought likely to keep children at home for the time being. Secondary schools can begin preparing to reopen on 2 June, the Dutch government has said. Spain Under the government\u2019s four-stage national strategy, most of Spain\u2019s 8.2 million pupils are not due to return until September. However, children under six whose parents cannot work from home will be able to return from 25 May. The country\u2019s 17 regional governments \u2013 which enjoy considerable autonomy \u2013 are currently debating how and when schools should reopen. The Andaluc\u00edan regional government has said it aims to get administrative staff back into schools from 18 May, although no date has been set for the resumption of classes.

She didn\u2019t expect to become the story.</p> \n<p>In her other life, the MP for Tooting is an A&amp;E doctor and intensive care specialist and has been working 12-hour hospital shifts throughout the pandemic. Allin-Khan reported that the government\u2019s failures were contributing to a greater loss of life and she wanted answers on its testing strategy. The health secretary awkwardly responded by suggesting that Allin-Khan\u2019s testimony was untrue and moreover, that she \u201cmight do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state\u2019s book in terms of tone\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWatch your tone!\u201d Allin-Khan exhales, still in mild disbelief. \u201cI have written to the government several times since March, asking why we haven\u2019t followed WHO guidelines, asking for clearer messaging on social distancing, urging for more PPE. I\u2019ve had no response. I was bringing messages from the frontline,\u201d she says over the phone from her home in south London.</p> \n<p>The exchange went viral <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1257644583158251522\">after she tweeted it</a>, morphing into a meme online then as a talking point on Good Morning Britain, Sky News, BBC News, LBC and beyond.

      "bodyText": "When Rosena Allin-Khan stood up in the House of Commons last Tuesday to address the health secretary, Matt Hancock, she anticipated being stonewalled. She didn\u2019t expect to become the story. In her other life, the MP for Tooting is an A&amp;E doctor and intensive care specialist and has been working 12-hour hospital shifts throughout the pandemic. Allin-Khan reported that the government\u2019s failures were contributing to a greater loss of life and she wanted answers on its testing strategy. The health secretary awkwardly responded by suggesting that Allin-Khan\u2019s testimony was untrue and moreover, that she \u201cmight do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state\u2019s book in terms of tone\u201d. \u201cWatch your tone!\u201d Allin-Khan exhales, still in mild disbelief. \u201cI have written to the government several times since March, asking why we haven\u2019t followed WHO guidelines, asking for clearer messaging on social distancing, urging for more PPE. I\u2019ve had no response. I was bringing messages from the frontline,\u201d she says over the phone from her home in south London. The exchange went viral after she tweeted it, morphing into a meme online then as a talking point on Good Morning Britain, Sky News, BBC News, LBC and beyond. Being patronised by Hancock was one thing, but to be dismissed so audaciously on the day the UK reported the highest death toll in Europe galls her. \u201cI was very courteous in my delivery. If Matt Hancock found it difficult, that\u2019s on him. Addressing the fact that lives could have been saved and families\u2019 hearts might not have been broken had we got on top of testing earlier? These are legitimate questions that people all across the country have. I was very polite. He didn\u2019t like the content, so instead felt it easier to make a derogatory comment towards me.\u201d Allin-Khan says she is used to confounding people. Her mother is Polish and her father is Pakistani and she grew up in a poor household in the constituency she now represents as \u201ca proud British Muslim\u201d. She describes her upbringing as \u201cdifficult \u2026 turbulent\u201d. She won\u2019t elaborate out of sensitivity towards her parents, except to say it meant \u201cI failed my A-levels spectacularly\u201d. Nonetheless, at 24, Allin-Khan ended up reading medicine at Cambridge and gained a masters in public health before working as a doctor in disaster zones across the world. \u201cPeople are still confused by who I am or what I am,\u201d she says, of the layers of ignorance she has navigated her whole life. \u201cThe biggest learning journey I have had as a politician is seeing how much I can be hated for being eastern European, for being Pakistani, for being Muslim. I never came from a political background. The vitriol shocked me.\u201d At 42, alongside her constituency work, Allin-Khan serves as a shadow cabinet minister for mental health and is an amateur boxer, wife, and mother to two children under six. She stopped her campaign for Labour\u2019s deputy leadership in March and then went to work treating Covid-19 patients at St George\u2019s hospital in south London and at the newly opened Nightingale.

      "body": "<p>A commonplace criticism of political parties is that they have drifted \u201cinto their comfort zone\u201d, which mostly means that Labour talks a lot about raising spending, while the Conservatives talk about cutting taxes. But politicians have comfort zones that are operational as well as ideological: ways of working that they find more attractive than others.</p> <p>In late 2014, one ambitious young shadow cabinet minister asked his aides to draw up a 14-point plan to help him become leader of the Labour party. Step two involved an itemised list of Labour MPs, each of whom, he was told, he needed to wine and dine if he was to have any hope of making a successful bid at the job. The frontbencher in question contemplated evening after evening spent in conversation with his colleagues versus time spent with his wife and children. Surely, he reasoned, he could achieve the same end by writing thoughtful columns in the newspapers and delivering wide-ranging speeches? His leadership bid never recovered.</p> <p>The government has, similarly, fallen back into its comfort zone in the fight against coronavirus. There are few problems in life that Whitehall doesn\u2019t seek to solve through swallowing up our personal details: if the second coming were to take place in modern Britain, the authorities would doubtless immediately want Jesus to fill in 2,000 years of backdated tax returns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government regardless of its political hue</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Officialdom\u2019s addiction to hoovering up information has numerous benefits: it has allowed the Office for National Statistics to establish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">a link between ethnicity and the risk of dying</a> of Covid-19, because it was able to eliminate other explanations \u2013 income level, household type, occupation and so on \u2013 through the use of the vast reams of information that the state collects.</p> <p>But the downside of the government\u2019s appetite for surveillance can be found in the NHSX <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-contact-tracing-app-is-it-safe-and-will-people-use-it\">contact tracing app</a> that is a vital plank of any attempt to keep new infections down and isolate outbreaks once lockdown ends. Although the app asks only for a postcode, storing the information centrally will allow the government, armed with the huge amounts of data it already holds, to identify other facts and secrets about the app\u2019s users. That horrifies privacy campaigners, but the biggest problem in practice will be the efficiency of the app. As designed, it is a battery hog that saps the life from users\u2019 phones \u2013 probably a far bigger barrier to people downloading it than its implications for surveillance. A second app is now in development \u2013 one that will be free of the government\u2019s tendency to collect as much information as it can about citizens.</p> <p>The endless desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government, regardless of its political hue. But this government has also reverted to a comfort zone that is distinct to itself: treating the battle against the virus as if it were a battle against a rival political party, one to be defeated by a savvy media strategy and careful leaks to preferred outlets. Genuine transparency should be kept to a minimum, with real news confined to setpiece events featuring the government\u2019s biggest gun, the prime minister.</p> <p>As a method to dispatch Labour in 2019, it worked like a charm. As an approach to defeating Covid-19 it lacks a certain something. Leaks beget leaks \u2013 cabinet ministers see that leaks are emerging from \u201cDowning Street\u201d and grumble to journalists; civil servants surmise that their bosses are spreading stories too, and also complain to the press. The process has also led to a muddled understanding of what exactly is being eased and when.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer 'a collaborator' in any politically painful decisions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The reality is that the changes to how we live \u2013 people to be able to go out for exercise twice a day, garden centres to be reopened \u2013 are minor and sensible. The disease spreads less effectively in the open air, provided people observe physical distancing. It\u2019s easy to observe social distancing in garden centres, which will, in any case, probably fold if they cannot reopen over the coming months, which are as important to them as Christmas is to the high street. But the drip-drip of headlines suggesting an \u201cend\u201d to lockdown has made some voters think the government is taking unnecessary risks, and encouraged others to take unnecessary risks of their own, safe in the apparent certainty that the lockdown will soon be ended.</p> <p>The comfort zone strategy has real long-term downsides, too. MPs generally agree that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/pmqs-verdict-floundering-johnson-meets-calm-and-focused-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a> has had a good week: the Labour leader\u2019s call for the government to publish its lockdown exit plan has been validated twice over, once by the unhelpful culture of leaks and hints about what is to come, and once because, when all is said and done, the government will have actually produced and published an exit strategy.</p> <p>The fear among Labour MPs, however, is that the government will try to bind Starmer to any unpopular measures he signs up to. One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer \u201ca collaborator\u201d in any politically painful decisions. Hardly anyone believes that the global increase in the popularity of incumbent governments will last all the way to the next general election, but many think it will be harder for Starmer to criticise the government\u2019s unpopular decisions \u2013 of which, it\u2019s assumed, there will be many, due to the economic consequences of the lockdown \u2013 if he has been brought into the fold.</p> <p>Boris Johnson has had regular conversations with the opposition parties, but he has thus far failed to establish any crucial moments at which Starmer\u2019s hands are also at the tiller. The leaks have also allowed the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, neither of which have been without fault during the crisis, to assert their distinctiveness from Westminster simply by clearly communicating a near-identical approach openly and transparently, rather than through the pages of favoured papers.</p> <p>But the comfort zone approach has obscured an issue that ought to be a real source of political pain for Johnson and Starmer. The way out of lockdown isn\u2019t a mystery: governments must first reduce the rate of new transmissions to as close to zero as possible, and then have the necessary infrastructure to test at scale, track the movements of possible carriers, and isolate the infected as and when new outbreaks emerge.</p> <p>There are two barriers in the UK\u2019s path to that destination. The first is logistical: Britain doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to implement a system of testing, tracking and isolating infections. That is a painful area for the Conservatives, as it means discussing whether they have fallen short in procurement, or if the spending decisions taken since 2010 have left the state ill prepared for crisis.</p> <p>But the second barrier is painful for both parties: a functioning system of testing, tracing and isolating new cases would require a major reduction in our liberties and a prolonged period of increased surveillance. It\u2019s far from clear that there is a majority in parliament for that approach, and it\u2019s not a natural political position for Johnson or Starmer. Both are commonly said to be \u201cinstinctive liberals\u201d, though their records at the big organisations they ran, whether as mayor of London or director of public prosecutions, are muddier than that.</p> <p>What matters more is that most British people are not liberals, instinctive or otherwise. It\u2019s easy to forget that while New Labour\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/may/27/theresa-may-scrapping-id-cards\">ID cards scheme</a> was unpopular within the party and in parliament, it enjoyed <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2018/05/12/majority-brits-support-introducing-id-cards\">majority support</a> in the country as a whole. The great British public has enthusiastically embraced CCTV, and no successful political party in the democratic era has been without a generous bung to the police.

      "bodyText": "A commonplace criticism of political parties is that they have drifted \u201cinto their comfort zone\u201d, which mostly means that Labour talks a lot about raising spending, while the Conservatives talk about cutting taxes. But politicians have comfort zones that are operational as well as ideological: ways of working that they find more attractive than others. In late 2014, one ambitious young shadow cabinet minister asked his aides to draw up a 14-point plan to help him become leader of the Labour party. Step two involved an itemised list of Labour MPs, each of whom, he was told, he needed to wine and dine if he was to have any hope of making a successful bid at the job. The frontbencher in question contemplated evening after evening spent in conversation with his colleagues versus time spent with his wife and children. Surely, he reasoned, he could achieve the same end by writing thoughtful columns in the newspapers and delivering wide-ranging speeches? His leadership bid never recovered. The government has, similarly, fallen back into its comfort zone in the fight against coronavirus. There are few problems in life that Whitehall doesn\u2019t seek to solve through swallowing up our personal details: if the second coming were to take place in modern Britain, the authorities would doubtless immediately want Jesus to fill in 2,000 years of backdated tax returns. Officialdom\u2019s addiction to hoovering up information has numerous benefits: it has allowed the Office for National Statistics to establish a link between ethnicity and the risk of dying of Covid-19, because it was able to eliminate other explanations \u2013 income level, household type, occupation and so on \u2013 through the use of the vast reams of information that the state collects. But the downside of the government\u2019s appetite for surveillance can be found in the NHSX contact tracing app that is a vital plank of any attempt to keep new infections down and isolate outbreaks once lockdown ends. Although the app asks only for a postcode, storing the information centrally will allow the government, armed with the huge amounts of data it already holds, to identify other facts and secrets about the app\u2019s users. That horrifies privacy campaigners, but the biggest problem in practice will be the efficiency of the app. As designed, it is a battery hog that saps the life from users\u2019 phones \u2013 probably a far bigger barrier to people downloading it than its implications for surveillance. A second app is now in development \u2013 one that will be free of the government\u2019s tendency to collect as much information as it can about citizens. The endless desire to know our secrets is present in essentially every British government, regardless of its political hue. But this government has also reverted to a comfort zone that is distinct to itself: treating the battle against the virus as if it were a battle against a rival political party, one to be defeated by a savvy media strategy and careful leaks to preferred outlets. Genuine transparency should be kept to a minimum, with real news confined to setpiece events featuring the government\u2019s biggest gun, the prime minister. As a method to dispatch Labour in 2019, it worked like a charm. As an approach to defeating Covid-19 it lacks a certain something. Leaks beget leaks \u2013 cabinet ministers see that leaks are emerging from \u201cDowning Street\u201d and grumble to journalists; civil servants surmise that their bosses are spreading stories too, and also complain to the press. The process has also led to a muddled understanding of what exactly is being eased and when. The reality is that the changes to how we live \u2013 people to be able to go out for exercise twice a day, garden centres to be reopened \u2013 are minor and sensible. The disease spreads less effectively in the open air, provided people observe physical distancing. It\u2019s easy to observe social distancing in garden centres, which will, in any case, probably fold if they cannot reopen over the coming months, which are as important to them as Christmas is to the high street. But the drip-drip of headlines suggesting an \u201cend\u201d to lockdown has made some voters think the government is taking unnecessary risks, and encouraged others to take unnecessary risks of their own, safe in the apparent certainty that the lockdown will soon be ended. The comfort zone strategy has real long-term downsides, too. MPs generally agree that Keir Starmer has had a good week: the Labour leader\u2019s call for the government to publish its lockdown exit plan has been validated twice over, once by the unhelpful culture of leaks and hints about what is to come, and once because, when all is said and done, the government will have actually produced and published an exit strategy. The fear among Labour MPs, however, is that the government will try to bind Starmer to any unpopular measures he signs up to. One Conservative gleefully told me that they would make Starmer \u201ca collaborator\u201d in any politically painful decisions. Hardly anyone believes that the global increase in the popularity of incumbent governments will last all the way to the next general election, but many think it will be harder for Starmer to criticise the government\u2019s unpopular decisions \u2013 of which, it\u2019s assumed, there will be many, due to the economic consequences of the lockdown \u2013 if he has been brought into the fold. Boris Johnson has had regular conversations with the opposition parties, but he has thus far failed to establish any crucial moments at which Starmer\u2019s hands are also at the tiller. The leaks have also allowed the devolved governments in Scotland and Wales, neither of which have been without fault during the crisis, to assert their distinctiveness from Westminster simply by clearly communicating a near-identical approach openly and transparently, rather than through the pages of favoured papers. But the comfort zone approach has obscured an issue that ought to be a real source of political pain for Johnson and Starmer. The way out of lockdown isn\u2019t a mystery: governments must first reduce the rate of new transmissions to as close to zero as possible, and then have the necessary infrastructure to test at scale, track the movements of possible carriers, and isolate the infected as and when new outbreaks emerge. There are two barriers in the UK\u2019s path to that destination. The first is logistical: Britain doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to implement a system of testing, tracking and isolating infections. That is a painful area for the Conservatives, as it means discussing whether they have fallen short in procurement, or if the spending decisions taken since 2010 have left the state ill prepared for crisis. But the second barrier is painful for both parties: a functioning system of testing, tracing and isolating new cases would require a major reduction in our liberties and a prolonged period of increased surveillance. It\u2019s far from clear that there is a majority in parliament for that approach, and it\u2019s not a natural political position for Johnson or Starmer. Both are commonly said to be \u201cinstinctive liberals\u201d, though their records at the big organisations they ran, whether as mayor of London or director of public prosecutions, are muddier than that. What matters more is that most British people are not liberals, instinctive or otherwise. It\u2019s easy to forget that while New Labour\u2019s ID cards scheme was unpopular within the party and in parliament, it enjoyed majority support in the country as a whole. The great British public has enthusiastically embraced CCTV, and no successful political party in the democratic era has been without a generous bung to the police. Whether the SNP in 2007, Johnson in 2019 or even Jeremy Corbyn in 2017, the way to win votes and influence people in British politics has long run on an authoritarian axis. So what will happen if British politics is dominated by two men, neither of whom are instinctively minded to point to the clearest and safest way out of lockdown? The lesson of Johnson\u2019s recent electoral success, in which he tapped into a political demand that has long existed \u2013 for a party that is tough on migrants and criminals but spends lavishly on the NHS and schools \u2013 but has been unavailable to voters since 2005, is that eventually the voters get what the voters want. If neither Johnson nor Starmer is willing to leave their comfort zone, they may find that someone else will. \u2022 Stephen Bush is the political editor of the New Statesman",

      "bodyText": "When Pavlos Pandelides realised the coronavirus pandemic was moving west, he bought a plane ticket and flew from Athens to London. He then drove north to Nottingham to collect his daughter, a student at the city\u2019s university, before returning with her the next day to Greece. An ardent admirer of all things British, the businessman had absolutely no doubt that what he was doing was right. \u201cThe British are fighters but I could see they were underestimating this,\u201d he said. While Covid-19 was tearing through northern Italy, Boris Johnson was still faltering, with his government showing worrying signs of complacency. There was, said Pandelides, no time to waste. \u201cIt was more than a protective father thing. It was clear they were about to really mess up.\u201d In the weeks preceding the suspension on 23 March by Athens\u2019 centre-right administration of air links with the UK, demand for plane tickets home from Britain\u2019s large Greek community hit unprecedented heights. Greeks, like many other Europeans, have been left astonished and alarmed by the Johnson government\u2019s handling of the public health emergency. Britain\u2019s chaotic strategy, initial soft-touch approach and high death toll have been met with disbelief in a country that, despite the eviscerating effects of a near decade-long debt crisis, has kept the virus under control. \u201cJohnson\u2019s management of the pandemic has been almost Mediterranean in style, flippant and carefree,\u201d said the economic analyst Antonis Papagiannidis. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but think that people have been left to rot, that the interests of the economy were put before health.\u201d In the absence of responsible leadership, Britons had been on the receiving end of conflicting messages, he said. \u201cFirst, they\u2019re told, \u2018There\u2019s no problem\u2019; then, \u2018Oh, there is a problem\u2019.

They should have been informed of the real risks and allowed to deal with them with their legendary stiff upper lip.\u201d In contrast to the more than 31,000 who have now succumbed to the disease in the UK, Greece has recorded one of the continent\u2019s lowest casualty rates, with 150 deaths and fewer than 2,700 confirmed coronavirus cases after enforcement of tough measures to contain the epidemic early on. It has been a stark change of fortune for a nation more usually associated with civil disobedience and incompetence \u2013 both products of a dysfunctional state. As Britain enters the week uncertain of whether its lockdown will be significantly eased, Greeks are preparing beaches and hotels for a tourist season they hope will begin in July as restrictions gradually unwind. Prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has so far resisted the temptation to gloat.

Covid-19 could quite probably kill me.\u201d</p> <p>The anonymous contributor is part of a project called<a href=\"https://www.youngfoundation.org/promote_home/promote_home_middle/community-covid-you/\"> Covid-19 and Me</a>, run jointly by the <a href=\"https://www.youngfoundation.org/people/helen-goulden/\">Young Foundation</a> and the Open University, two of a number of organisations which are asking thousands of men and women of all ages, ethnicities, incomes, beliefs and backgrounds across Britain to keep diaries, complete questionnaires and be interviewed by their peers. They want to know what it is like, at an everyday level, to live through a global pandemic, to create an ongoing \u201cweather map of public feeling\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we are experiencing is forcing new ways to interact with neighbours, friends and family,\u201d says Helen Goulden, chief executive of the Young Foundation, a charity working to strengthen communities. \u201cOur research pre-pandemic shows we were already concerned about safety because of insecure employment, crime and issues such as Brexit.</p> <p>\u201cNow, as lockdown eases, safety is becoming a deeply personal issue. People are not talking about lifting lockdown to ease inequalities or reduce the economic impact but about the direct risk to themselves and their families. Fifteen million people have underlying health problems \u2013 that impacts on a lot of families concerned for vulnerable relatives.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/04/museum-covid-19-v-and-a-pandemic-coronavirus-objects\">Museum of Covid-19: the story of the crisis told through everyday objects</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday, more insight will be gained when the <a href=\"http://www.massobs.org.uk/write-for-us/12th-may\">public is asked to keep a single-day diary</a>, unmediated by journalists, commentators or government focus groups, for <a href=\"http://www.massobs.org.uk/write-for-us/12th-may\">Mass Observation</a> (MO), now housed at the University of Sussex. MO was established in 1937, when it recruited an army of volunteers and social scientists to create \u201can anthropology of home\u201d.</p> <p>At the coronation of George VI on 12 May 1937, the concept of an annual day-long diary was instigated when the public was asked to record their activities and feelings over 24 hours. The scheme was revived again in 2010, and Tuesday marks its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Anyone can participate, and all contributions are stored in the archive for posterity.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s human nature to want to record our own feelings,\u201d says MO\u2019s curator Fiona Courage. \u201cSome people in Wuhan have said: \u2018I wrote every day. It helped to keep me sane.\u2019 Texts and emails mean that diaries have gone into abeyance but, in these extraordinary times, the longer form allows us all to be historians in our own way.\u201d</p> <p>Normally, the panel of volunteers who write all year round with MO numbers around 400. In the past few weeks, as more volunteers have come forward, the group has swollen to more than 700. The <a href=\"https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIm-X5v6yk6QIVWuztCh3NswJ0EAAYASAAEgL-H_D_BwE\">Fawcett Society</a>, a feminist charity, is also asking women to send it their Covid-19 experiences. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab3133b94df30c69351e057bb6dc620caf472240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab3133b94df30c69351e057bb6dc620caf472240/0_125_10033_6020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Survivors of the London blitz, 1940; Searching in the ruins of bombed houses.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">During the Blitz, MO diarists revealed they felt it was one war for the rich and another for the rest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: World History Archive/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Covid 19 and Me is using <a href=\"https://nquire.org.uk/\">NQuire</a>, a scientific methodology, developed by the OU and overseen by the OU\u2019s Professor Anne Adams, that treats the public as \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d. \u201cCitizen scientists can help to influence policy-making in areas such as health, climate change and social inequality. Their contributions will also prepare us better for future pandemics,\u201d Adams explains.</p> <p>\u201cIt means that communities can connect up with experts who too often operate in their own boxes. Twitter and Instagram can trivialise. This is about the democratisation of all the channels of information, not just those that are instant or official.\u201d</p> <p>So, what are the diaries revealing? How big a gap exists between government action and what the public expects? Whether newfound community solidarity can continue beyond the immediate crisis?</p> <p>On 29 April, Professor Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England, during the government\u2019s daily briefing, called for more of what she termed, \u201clocal intelligence\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI have underlying health conditions, including asthma,\u201d writes a frightened 40-year-old woman , shortly before Sunday\u2019s news of whether the lockdown will be eased. \u201cI\u2019m terrified to leave the house, even for exercise, but I\u2019m not sick enough to be \u2018extremely vulnerable\u2019. Covid-19 could quite probably kill me.\u201d The anonymous contributor is part of a project called Covid-19 and Me, run jointly by the Young Foundation and the Open University, two of a number of organisations which are asking thousands of men and women of all ages, ethnicities, incomes, beliefs and backgrounds across Britain to keep diaries, complete questionnaires and be interviewed by their peers. They want to know what it is like, at an everyday level, to live through a global pandemic, to create an ongoing \u201cweather map of public feeling\u201d. \u201cWhat we are experiencing is forcing new ways to interact with neighbours, friends and family,\u201d says Helen Goulden, chief executive of the Young Foundation, a charity working to strengthen communities. \u201cOur research pre-pandemic shows we were already concerned about safety because of insecure employment, crime and issues such as Brexit. \u201cNow, as lockdown eases, safety is becoming a deeply personal issue. People are not talking about lifting lockdown to ease inequalities or reduce the economic impact but about the direct risk to themselves and their families. Fifteen million people have underlying health problems \u2013 that impacts on a lot of families concerned for vulnerable relatives.\u201d On Tuesday, more insight will be gained when the public is asked to keep a single-day diary, unmediated by journalists, commentators or government focus groups, for Mass Observation (MO), now housed at the University of Sussex. MO was established in 1937, when it recruited an army of volunteers and social scientists to create \u201can anthropology of home\u201d. At the coronation of George VI on 12 May 1937, the concept of an annual day-long diary was instigated when the public was asked to record their activities and feelings over 24 hours. The scheme was revived again in 2010, and Tuesday marks its 10th anniversary. Anyone can participate, and all contributions are stored in the archive for posterity. \u201cIt\u2019s human nature to want to record our own feelings,\u201d says MO\u2019s curator Fiona Courage. \u201cSome people in Wuhan have said: \u2018I wrote every day. It helped to keep me sane.\u2019 Texts and emails mean that diaries have gone into abeyance but, in these extraordinary times, the longer form allows us all to be historians in our own way.\u201d Normally, the panel of volunteers who write all year round with MO numbers around 400. In the past few weeks, as more volunteers have come forward, the group has swollen to more than 700. The Fawcett Society, a feminist charity, is also asking women to send it their Covid-19 experiences. Covid 19 and Me is using NQuire, a scientific methodology, developed by the OU and overseen by the OU\u2019s Professor Anne Adams, that treats the public as \u201ccitizen scientists\u201d. \u201cCitizen scientists can help to influence policy-making in areas such as health, climate change and social inequality. Their contributions will also prepare us better for future pandemics,\u201d Adams explains. \u201cIt means that communities can connect up with experts who too often operate in their own boxes. Twitter and Instagram can trivialise. This is about the democratisation of all the channels of information, not just those that are instant or official.\u201d So, what are the diaries revealing? How big a gap exists between government action and what the public expects? Whether newfound community solidarity can continue beyond the immediate crisis? On 29 April, Professor Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England, during the government\u2019s daily briefing, called for more of what she termed, \u201clocal intelligence\u201d. Adams says \u201clocal intelligence\u201d ought to include these contributions from everyday life, in all its diversity and variations. Experts need to read the pulse of the public. \u201cThe government briefings are drowning in data but what makes the data meaningful is the connection between it and the stories that the public have to tell. People in cities, for instance, are noticing less pollution, clearer air, more birdsong \u2013 data apart, how will that impact on support for climate change post-Covid?\u201d \u201cWho would have thought in a liberal democracy so many people would do what they were told?\u201d the former cabinet secretary Gus O\u2019Donnell noted recently about the compliance to lockdown. Was that surprise because of a lack of feel for the warp and weft of what the public is really experiencing? During the Blitz, diarists for MO revealed that there was one war for the rich and another war for the rest. In heavily bombed Leicester, the rich were \u201ctaking their cars out into the country\u2026 and spending the night there\u201d \u2013 rather like some of those with country estates advocating a rapid easing of the lockdown now. Goulden points out it that it allegedly takes 21 days to make a habit and 90 days to break it. Already during the Covid-19 outbreak, the new habits include avoiding others, drinking more and rediscovering a sense of solidarity. Can the latter, at least, last? Or will that become fractured by easing the lockdown? \u201cPeople are writing to tell us that while they have bent the rules responsibly, others are doing so blatantly,\u201d says Goulden. \u201cA relaxation in rules may become increasingly contested, confused and personally interpreted, possibly leading to sharper exchanges between people and more stark inequalities at a national level.\u201d However, when events are changing so fast during the pandemic, can the diaries and questionnaires have any permanent value? Goulden agrees that they can only provide a snapshot, and contributors are, of course, self selecting. Over time, though, they may provide an invaluable picture of what we have lived through and what may have permanently changed. The MO diaries during the war years reflected patriotism and admiration of Churchill but they also revealed the regard some had for Hitler, and a far less gung-ho spirit than the government portrayed. There was also a strong expression of the growing expectation that whatever came after the war had to be better. So, will our contemporary diaries begin to record the limits on neighbourliness, respect for key workers and the NHS and mutual aid as we venture out of our homes? Or will they underline that health, wellbeing, fairness in society and all that has been lost to communities during austerity \u2013 parks, libraries, children\u2019s centres, youth clubs, community centres \u2013 have a newfound alue that no government can afford to ignore post-Covid?

      "body": "<p>It is 100 days since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK on 31 January. The official death toll so far from the epidemic has topped 33,000 and is still rising fast. The actual total could be far higher, many analysts say \u2013 leaving Britain among the countries hit hardest by Covid-19.</p> \n<p>The government has struggled to get on top of the crisis, facing growing criticism for its lack of early preparation to tackle the virus, its abrupt shifts in strategy, its failure to provide adequate protective equipment for its medical staff and other key workers, and its inability to organise testing on the scale that many say is vital.</p> \n<p>And its communications have been widely described as evasive and shambolic \u2013 with many left confused last week as the Cabinet battled to provide a coherent account of its plans to lift the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Those plans have been complicated by the fact that our infection rate remains stubbornly high and, as a result, any measures announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday are expected to be modest. While some other countries are embarking tentatively on a return to normality, Britain is struggling to meet its criteria for doing so.</p> \n<p>Amid a growing perception that the government\u2019s record in confronting the crisis is amongst the worst in the world, the Labour leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/06/keir-starmer-confronts-boris-johnson-for-first-time-during-pmqs-video-highlights\">Keir Starmer confronted Boris Johnson</a> this week in their first prime minister\u2019s questions meeting with the stark question: \u201cHow on earth did it come to this?\u201d</p> \n<p>Below Robin McKie, Toby Helm and Emma Graham-Harrison try to answer that question by considering the key factors that might lie behind our disaster.</p> \n<h2>Politics</h2> \n<p>Over the past week there have been moments when members of the government have given up pretending that all has gone well. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/19/the-uk-governments-woeful-response-to-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">evidence of the mishandling</a> of the pandemic response has piled up, some ministers have realised they would sound ridiculous if they could not admit that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/the-observer-view-on-the-coronavirus-errors-that-have-cost-precious-lives\">errors had been made</a>.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, James Brokenshire, a home office minister, accepted that more testing early on would have helped. \u201cThere is an acknowledgement mistakes have been made \u2013 no government is going to get everything right,\u201d he said. Then at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions the same day Boris Johnson admitted his \u201cbitter regret\u201d at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-covid-19-and-care-homes-promises-are-not-enough\">crisis in care homes.</a> But they have been rare admissions.</p> \n<p>Over the last few days the UK\u2019s political leaders have been divided over the lockdown and how to keep the public safe. Mid-week, Downing Street was indicating it wanted to end the \u201cstay at home\u201d message while Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister, protested that to do so would risk many more lives. The issue was still being debated at the highest levels on Friday as No 10 appeared to be backing off such a change.</p> \n<p>No one can expect politicians to handle a crisis on this scale without things going wrong along the way. Labour, under its new leader Keir Starmer, has acknowledged that. He held back in his criticism until last week, knowing that the country wanted this government to succeed. But he, too, would not have been doing his job had he not highlighted government failings in his first PMQ with Johnson. Why, he asked, had the government been slow on testing, slow on supplying PPE to NHS and care home workers, slow on going into lockdown? </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bec38c7e-4c90-4d90-9f12-e5d02ade213e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cohpBp316i8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When the inevitable public inquiry is held, Johnson\u2019s government will face hard questions about its response. When many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/uk-government-coronavirus-science-who-advice\">UK scientists were growing increasingly worried</a> about Covid-19 in January and February, Johnson and his team had other things on their minds \u2013 enjoying their general election win and \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson inherited public services ill-equipped to handle a pandemic. The NHS lacked enough intensive care beds, protective equipment for staff and, initially, ventilators. The social care sector, shamefully unreformed, was another victim of Tory austerity that has paid the price. Anglo-Saxon economics has left the UK vulnerable, whereas countries which had spent more on their health systems \u2013 Germany is the prime example \u2013 have fared better.</p> \n<p>Decision-making has also been found wanting. The UK ended track-and-trace testing on 12 March, because there was not the capacity to carry on. A sense that the UK could somehow tough it out prevailed for too long.</p> \n<p>Early on in the crisis Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">missed a series of Cobra meetings</a> about Covid-19 and was still proudly shaking hands with people in hospitals in early March. Now, as he tries to find ways to ease the lockdown, while at the same keeping the risk of a second wave to a minimum, the test for the government is to keep the public believing it has the answers. So far much of the evidence has suggested otherwise.</p> \n<p><em>Toby Helm</em></p> \n<h2>History</h2> \n<p>Britain\u2019s pandemic planning was extensive \u2013 even if the government did not choose to implement lessons learned from its 2016 simulation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/what-was-exercise-cygnus-and-what-did-it-find\">Exercise Cygnus</a> \u2013 but the one thing it did not have was recent first-hand experience of a major respiratory disease outbreak.</p> \n<p>When Covid-19 arrived, it had been over a century since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now\">Spanish flu</a> swept through the country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55601e3446f55d1020ad0781be5ecafa9cb1f8f5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55601e3446f55d1020ad0781be5ecafa9cb1f8f5/208_81_1092_1366/799.jpg\" alt=\"A man wears a mask during the Spanish flu of 1918.\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man wears a mask during the Spanish flu of 1918.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Decades without an airborne epidemic of a new disease may have bred false confidence that viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which spread from China in 2002, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/what-ebola-taught-me-about-coronavirus-panic-will-get-us-nowhere\">Ebola</a>, which first appeared in Africa in the 1970s, could be contained near their place of outbreak.</p> \n<p>Countries that lived through those outbreaks first hand were among those that moved most swiftly and decisively against coronavirus, the tragic lessons of the past a spur to action.</p> \n<p>Before Covid-19 had been identified as a coronavirus, and when it was still being described as a \u201cmystery pneumonia\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-outbreak-taipei-taiwan-china\">Taiwan brought in checks</a> on passengers flying from Wuhan.

Italy and Spain have relatively old populations and have suffered high death rates while nations such as Ireland, with lower median ages, have fared better. So could the UK\u2019s relatively elderly population explain our high death rates?</p> \n<p>No, said Professor Sarah Harper, founding director of the Oxford Institute of Population Ageing.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom a demographic point of view, the UK is no different from most other European countries. In fact, we are on the younger side, so you cannot blame the age structure of the UK for this.\u201d</p> \n<p>In addition, care homes \u2013 claimed by some to be a special UK issue \u2013 have proved to be serious problems in other nations with substantial Covid-19 death rates, including France, Belgium and Norway. \u201cCare home outbreaks are almost inevitable without really radical measures to prevent them,\u201d said Professor Noel McCarthy, of Warwick Medical School.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"070e1ce7-43bd-462f-80b5-0be91d966238\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XPF35H9RLNE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Scientists have also found that individuals from black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19 in Britain. About 13% of the UK population come from BAME backgrounds but they account for a third of virus patients in critical care units. Last week, figures for England and Wales suggested that black people were four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people.</p> \n<p>However, this picture is not unique to the UK. Nations that include Norway and the US have also reported high Covid-19 death rates among BAME people. Just why this is occurring remains unclear \u2013 though scientists point out that BAME groups tend to suffer from higher rates of diabetes, heart disease and obesity, conditions that make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Another key risk factor is obesity. Those with a body mass index greater than 30 are more likely to need intensive care than those with healthy weights. Britain is facing a major obesity problem, doctors have pointed out, and this could explain, in part, our high Covid-19 fatality rate of <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">nearly 500 deaths per million people</a>. Yet this picture is confounded by comparisons with other nations. For example, New Zealand has a worse prevalence of obesity than the UK but has a Covid-19 death rate of only 4 per million.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo be blunt, it was a lack of testing, a failure to shut down society in time, and a lack of care equipment that are to blame for current high Covid-19 death rates,\u201d said Harper.</p> \n<p><em>Robin McKie</em></p> \n<h2>Geography</h2> \n<p>Britain is a densely populated nation containing a very large capital city. More than 9 million people live in London and more than 18 million people arrived in the UK in the first three months of the year: a perfect nursery setting for a new virus to take seed and then increase in numbers in an explosive, exponential manner. Other densely populated places such as New York and northern Italy have also suffered.</p> \n<p>So was the UK simply unfortunate? Has its population felt the impact of Covid-19 more deeply because of its geography?</p> \n<p>The link is weak, say epidemiologists, who point to many other cramped, bustling cities that have relatively low numbers of Covid-19 cases at present. A good example is provided by India. It is the world\u2019s second most populous nation and its cities \u2013 including Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata, some of the biggest and most populous urban centres in the world \u2013 are renowned for their dense populations and tightly packed housing. Yet Covid-19 death rates are remarkably low there. Last week, the death rate from the disease stood at 1 per million people in India, it was reported. The UK\u2019s rate is reported at nearly 500 per million.</p> \n<p>As a result, many UK scientists reject the idea that Britain\u2019s high death toll is simply a matter of unfortunate positioning or a result of the high density of much of its population. \u201cWere we unlucky? No. We just didn\u2019t have a proper plan for dealing with this. Other countries did,\u201d said virologist Professor Nicola Stonehouse, of Leeds University.</p> \n<p>This point was backed by consultant cardiologist Amitava Banerjee. \u201cWe were not humble enough to look at other countries \u2013 China, Italy or Spain \u2013 and learn a lesson from them and lock down quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were arrogant,\u201d added Banerjee, who is also assistant professor of clinical data science at University College London. \u201cWe thought we had nothing to learn from other countries and thought we were an exceptional case. In fact, we had a lot to learn but didn\u2019t take the opportunity.\u201d</p> \n<p>Taking lessons from past mistakes and from the examples of other nations will be crucial if Britain is to hope to extricate itself from the medical crisis it now faces, say epidemiologists.</p> \n<p><em>Robin McKie</em></p> \n<h2>Endgame</h2> \n<p>How Britain extricates itself from its coronavirus lockdown will be a delicate procedure, scientists agree. In general, they envisage an approach that would maintain restrictions until numbers of Covid-19 cases are low enough to allow the tracking and isolating of individual cases.</p> \n<p>However, at the current rate of infections, it is hard to see when that might occur. Last week, the number of new cases of Covid-19 that were being diagnosed every day hovered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/coronavirus-uk-latest-deaths-confirmed-cases-and-which-regions-are-hardest-hit\">around the 5,000 mark</a>. That is far too high to allow tracing of newly infected individuals. The tracking system would be overwhelmed in days. The country therefore faces a choice. It could endure even harsher lockdown rules \u2013 with no exercise permitted \u2013 or maintain the current system for months. Alternatively, it could ease the lockdown in the near future and risk facing a rapidly rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/covid-19-second-wave-may-be-avoided-with-track-and-trace-says-uk-science-chief\">second wave of cases</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e91b1dca6c7593cbcae9e252df80c1d9e2ca7a58\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e91b1dca6c7593cbcae9e252df80c1d9e2ca7a58/291_151_4590_2754/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A researcher in a lab developing a vaccine for Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A researcher in a lab developing a vaccine for Covid-19.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whenever lockdown is relaxed, emphasis is likely to be placed on shielding the vulnerable, in particular those who have high risk factors, such as the elderly.

      "bodyText": "It is 100 days since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK on 31 January. The official death toll so far from the epidemic has topped 33,000 and is still rising fast. The actual total could be far higher, many analysts say \u2013 leaving Britain among the countries hit hardest by Covid-19. The government has struggled to get on top of the crisis, facing growing criticism for its lack of early preparation to tackle the virus, its abrupt shifts in strategy, its failure to provide adequate protective equipment for its medical staff and other key workers, and its inability to organise testing on the scale that many say is vital. And its communications have been widely described as evasive and shambolic \u2013 with many left confused last week as the Cabinet battled to provide a coherent account of its plans to lift the lockdown. Those plans have been complicated by the fact that our infection rate remains stubbornly high and, as a result, any measures announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday are expected to be modest. While some other countries are embarking tentatively on a return to normality, Britain is struggling to meet its criteria for doing so. Amid a growing perception that the government\u2019s record in confronting the crisis is amongst the worst in the world, the Labour leader Keir Starmer confronted Boris Johnson this week in their first prime minister\u2019s questions meeting with the stark question: \u201cHow on earth did it come to this?\u201d Below Robin McKie, Toby Helm and Emma Graham-Harrison try to answer that question by considering the key factors that might lie behind our disaster. Politics Over the past week there have been moments when members of the government have given up pretending that all has gone well. As evidence of the mishandling of the pandemic response has piled up, some ministers have realised they would sound ridiculous if they could not admit that errors had been made. On Wednesday, James Brokenshire, a home office minister, accepted that more testing early on would have helped. \u201cThere is an acknowledgement mistakes have been made \u2013 no government is going to get everything right,\u201d he said. Then at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions the same day Boris Johnson admitted his \u201cbitter regret\u201d at the crisis in care homes. But they have been rare admissions. Over the last few days the UK\u2019s political leaders have been divided over the lockdown and how to keep the public safe. Mid-week, Downing Street was indicating it wanted to end the \u201cstay at home\u201d message while Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister, protested that to do so would risk many more lives. The issue was still being debated at the highest levels on Friday as No 10 appeared to be backing off such a change. No one can expect politicians to handle a crisis on this scale without things going wrong along the way. Labour, under its new leader Keir Starmer, has acknowledged that. He held back in his criticism until last week, knowing that the country wanted this government to succeed. But he, too, would not have been doing his job had he not highlighted government failings in his first PMQ with Johnson. Why, he asked, had the government been slow on testing, slow on supplying PPE to NHS and care home workers, slow on going into lockdown? When the inevitable public inquiry is held, Johnson\u2019s government will face hard questions about its response. When many UK scientists were growing increasingly worried about Covid-19 in January and February, Johnson and his team had other things on their minds \u2013 enjoying their general election win and \u201cgetting Brexit done\u201d. Johnson inherited public services ill-equipped to handle a pandemic. The NHS lacked enough intensive care beds, protective equipment for staff and, initially, ventilators. The social care sector, shamefully unreformed, was another victim of Tory austerity that has paid the price. Anglo-Saxon economics has left the UK vulnerable, whereas countries which had spent more on their health systems \u2013 Germany is the prime example \u2013 have fared better. Decision-making has also been found wanting. The UK ended track-and-trace testing on 12 March, because there was not the capacity to carry on. A sense that the UK could somehow tough it out prevailed for too long. Early on in the crisis Johnson missed a series of Cobra meetings about Covid-19 and was still proudly shaking hands with people in hospitals in early March. Now, as he tries to find ways to ease the lockdown, while at the same keeping the risk of a second wave to a minimum, the test for the government is to keep the public believing it has the answers. So far much of the evidence has suggested otherwise. Toby Helm History Britain\u2019s pandemic planning was extensive \u2013 even if the government did not choose to implement lessons learned from its 2016 simulation, Exercise Cygnus \u2013 but the one thing it did not have was recent first-hand experience of a major respiratory disease outbreak. When Covid-19 arrived, it had been over a century since the Spanish flu swept through the country. Decades without an airborne epidemic of a new disease may have bred false confidence that viruses like severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which spread from China in 2002, and Ebola, which first appeared in Africa in the 1970s, could be contained near their place of outbreak. Countries that lived through those outbreaks first hand were among those that moved most swiftly and decisively against coronavirus, the tragic lessons of the past a spur to action. Before Covid-19 had been identified as a coronavirus, and when it was still being described as a \u201cmystery pneumonia\u201d, Taiwan brought in checks on passengers flying from Wuhan. These soon expanded to over 120 measures including strict quarantine, border controls, testing and contact tracing. \u201cWe learned very harsh lessons from Sars and that experience is something other countries don\u2019t have,\u201d said Chan Chang-chuan, dean of National Taiwan University\u2019s College of Public Health. To date, its Covid-19 death toll is six, despite its very close economic and cultural ties with mainland China, and a high volume of cross-border travel between the two. South Korea endured Sars and has even more recent memories of a fatal coronavirus epidemic, after Mers (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) broke out there in 2015, killing 36 people. It began ramping up testing capacity from January, before the disease had arrived in force. At one point the country had the highest number of cases outside mainland China, but its testing and careful contact tracing meant it was among the first and most successful countries in flattening the curve. Experience of Sars may have made governments more confident the public would accept restrictions, and that proved indeed to be the case: many people took proactive measures, such as covering their faces, even before authorities stepped in. And in Africa, experience of Ebola may have helped Sierra Leone keep cases to just 231 so far; authorities repurposed tracking systems set up in the wake of the 2014 outbreak. But there are also countries that have not lived through recent outbreaks of respiratory epidemics that have responded fast and kept cases low, from New Zealand to Senegal and Denmark. So while past experience may have helped some countries, it was not a necessary condition for a rapid and effective response and should not be seen as an explanation for why the UK has been so badly affected. Emma Graham-Harrison Demography Age clearly plays a key part in influencing the outcome of Covid-19 and is highlighted as a cause of some of the widespread variations seen in death tolls from different countries. Italy and Spain have relatively old populations and have suffered high death rates while nations such as Ireland, with lower median ages, have fared better. So could the UK\u2019s relatively elderly population explain our high death rates?

Another key risk factor is obesity. Those with a body mass index greater than 30 are more likely to need intensive care than those with healthy weights. Britain is facing a major obesity problem, doctors have pointed out, and this could explain, in part, our high Covid-19 fatality rate of nearly 500 deaths per million people. Yet this picture is confounded by comparisons with other nations. For example, New Zealand has a worse prevalence of obesity than the UK but has a Covid-19 death rate of only 4 per million. \u201cTo be blunt, it was a lack of testing, a failure to shut down society in time, and a lack of care equipment that are to blame for current high Covid-19 death rates,\u201d said Harper.

In the few months that this virus has been known to science, these are the rules that have been devised, writes <em>Robin McKie</em>. </p> <p><strong>Keeping two metres apart:</strong> This distance is based on the fact that droplets coughed out by a human being will travel no more than two metres before falling to the ground. It is assumed that virus-laden droplets are a key method of the airborne transmission of the disease. However, smaller aerosols may be responsible for spreading some virus particles, though it is not yet clear if they carry enough to trigger an infection in another person. Tests to find out are now under way in laboratories.</p> <p><strong>Face masks: </strong>The non-specialist face masks on sale in the UK are generally not designed to protect the person wearing them but to protect others. \u201cThey are designed to catch what you breathe out, not what you breathe in,\u201d says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. \u201cThe worry is that people will wear them thinking they cannot be infected, and will not feel they have to take other precautions.\u201d</p> <p><strong>It is safer outside: </strong>\u201cImagine setting fire to a newspaper inside your flat,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThe smoke will hang around for hours. Do it in the open air and the smoke will be wafted high into the air in minutes. And so it will be for virus-carrying droplets hanging in the air. They will dissipate very quickly outdoors and very slowly indoors.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The 15-minute rule: </strong>According to Public Health England, a quarter of an hour is the maximum time you should spend in conversation with someone you\u2019re not sharing lockdown with. This is based on observations of the behaviour of other airborne microbes. These indicate that 15 minutes is the average time you can spend in safe conversation without breathing in virus-laden droplets.</p> <p><strong>Washing your hands:</strong> The evidence is very clear. The virus that causes Covid-19 has a coat covered with chemicals called lipids, and these are rapidly made inactive by soap and water. \u201cBy washing your hands carefully as often as possible, you can halt the spread of the virus which you can pick up when touching infected surfaces. It is as simple as that,\u201d says Finn.</p> <p><br>\u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2020 to clarify and expand on the remarks by the Hackney mayor about takeaway alcohol. The Dove pub contacted us after publication to say that it only sells alcohol in closed containers for home consumption along with a food option.</p> <p><br><br></p>",

A few weeks earlier Hackney\u2019s mayor had tweeted that selling or buying takeaway alcohol is not essential during lockdown and that this led to scenes which he found \u201cunacceptable\u201d [See Footnote]. Jamieson disagreed. \u201cPeople need to congregate, to express themselves. Sometimes they need to live for today.\u201d The science behind the lockdown rules The government\u2019s rules for protection against Covid-19 are based on a series of assumptions about the virus that causes the disease. In the few months that this virus has been known to science, these are the rules that have been devised, writes Robin McKie. Keeping two metres apart: This distance is based on the fact that droplets coughed out by a human being will travel no more than two metres before falling to the ground. It is assumed that virus-laden droplets are a key method of the airborne transmission of the disease. However, smaller aerosols may be responsible for spreading some virus particles, though it is not yet clear if they carry enough to trigger an infection in another person. Tests to find out are now under way in laboratories. Face masks: The non-specialist face masks on sale in the UK are generally not designed to protect the person wearing them but to protect others. \u201cThey are designed to catch what you breathe out, not what you breathe in,\u201d says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. \u201cThe worry is that people will wear them thinking they cannot be infected, and will not feel they have to take other precautions.\u201d It is safer outside: \u201cImagine setting fire to a newspaper inside your flat,\u201d says Finn. \u201cThe smoke will hang around for hours. Do it in the open air and the smoke will be wafted high into the air in minutes. And so it will be for virus-carrying droplets hanging in the air. They will dissipate very quickly outdoors and very slowly indoors.\u201d The 15-minute rule: According to Public Health England, a quarter of an hour is the maximum time you should spend in conversation with someone you\u2019re not sharing lockdown with. This is based on observations of the behaviour of other airborne microbes. These indicate that 15 minutes is the average time you can spend in safe conversation without breathing in virus-laden droplets. Washing your hands: The evidence is very clear. The virus that causes Covid-19 has a coat covered with chemicals called lipids, and these are rapidly made inactive by soap and water. \u201cBy washing your hands carefully as often as possible, you can halt the spread of the virus which you can pick up when touching infected surfaces. It is as simple as that,\u201d says Finn. \u2022 This article was amended on 14 May 2020 to clarify and expand on the remarks by the Hackney mayor about takeaway alcohol. The Dove pub contacted us after publication to say that it only sells alcohol in closed containers for home consumption along with a food option.",

Can\u2019t they be trusted to obey rules of hygiene, of social distancing, or to keep away from the home if they feel unwell? In hospital and residential settings, essential carers are just that \u2013 essential, as vital as the paid carer or the nurse or the doctor.

In hospital and residential settings, essential carers are just that \u2013 essential, as vital as the paid carer or the nurse or the doctor. There are many ways of dying, and many ways of saving a life. The transformation of a home into a jail, which has led some relatives to turn to the law to try to break out their loved one, has been done for good motives, and in the name of protection. But such enforced loneliness is cruel and is wrong. It causes untold pain and harm. Children calling to their trapped parent through a fence, comforting them despairingly through a closed door. The helpless attempt at communication by phone, by Zoom. Last goodbyes by Skype. Death alone. The virus has laid bare gross inequalities in the country. People living and dying with dementia \u2013 at home or in hospital or a care home \u2013 are among the most vulnerable in society, and they are also the easiest to ignore and forget. Let\u2019s not. \u2022 Nicci Gerrard is an Observer journalist and a founder of John\u2019s Campaign",

He also said while people had the right to protest, they should not be breaching social distancing rules and those who do \u201cshould be held to account\u201d. Beyond its links to various conspiracy theories, the protest marks the first pushback against the lockdown laws introduced in Australia following the outbreak of Covid-19. Similar protests have taken place across the US, and the \u201carrest Bill Gates\u201d chant was started by far-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones at a protest in Austin, Texas. It comes a day before the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to announce a loosening of restrictions on smaller gatherings in line with other states. Victoria has to date maintained the strictest lockdowns of the states as it attempts to grapple with a major Covid-19 outbreak at a meat processing facility in Melbourne. It is also one of the only states which has seen significant pushback from its opposition over the laws. On Sunday Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos called the protest \u201cincredibly disappointing\u201d. \u201cThose individuals who are protesting today are at breach of the stay at home directive,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly disappointing that we\u2019ve got people protesting against vaccines, for example. \u201cI know that the whole of Australia, the whole world in fact, is waiting with great anticipation [for] a potential vaccine being developed for coronavirus.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist bringing you the main stories on Sunday 10 May.</p> \n<h2>Ten arrested at protest against Covid-19 lockdown laws</h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">Ten people were arrested at a protest outside Melbourne\u2019s Parliament House</a> on Sunday. About 200 people gathered to protest against Victoria\u2019s continued lockdown laws and against the concept of vaccination, chanted for the arrest of Bill Gates, and pushed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/01/why-the-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-is-false-video-explainer\">conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was linked to the rollout of 5G.</a></p> \n<p>Two of the 10 arrested were the organisers of the protest, police said. The charges for the 10 included breaching Victoria\u2019s state of emergency orders, which expire on Monday and carry a $1,600 on-the-spot fine or potential jail time. Three people were also charged with assaulting a police officer, and one police officer was taken to hospital for a rib injury.</p> \n<h2>NSW to ease restrictions from Friday</h2> \n<p>From Friday, people in New South Wales will be allowed to have five visitors in their home and gather in groups of up to 10 outside. Places of worship will also be open to up to 10 people. Restaurants and cafes will be open to up to 10 dine-in patrons, although premier Gladys Berejiklian conceded that may not be a viable business decision.</p> \n<p>Weddings will be allowed to have 10 guests, funerals 20 attendees if held indoors and 30 if outdoors. However Berejiklian said she was not yet ready to lift the restrictions on regional travel within NSW, and cautioned that the \u201cbiggest threat to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales\">New South Wales</a> community is complacency\u201d. She said if infection rates increased significantly, the state would be locked down again.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></strong>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>WA announces four-step plan to ease restrictions</h2> \n<p>Western Australia has announced a four-stage plan to ease lockdown restrictions. The state is currently in phase one and will move to phase two, which will allow for indoor gatherings of up to 20 people, and allow restaurants, cafes, and pubs to reopen for up to 20 patrons, from Monday 18 May. Phase three will happen about four weeks after that, details to be confirmed, and then phase four will happen at a date to be fixed.</p> \n<p>Phase two will also allow groups of up to 20 to engage in non-contact sport, swimming in outdoor pools, and indoor and outdoor fitness classes. Weddings and funerals can have up to 20 participants if indoors and 30 if outdoors.</p> \n<p>The 13 regional borders in WA will be replaced with four, allowing for travel between neighbouring regions. The hard border with the eastern states will remain in place. Premier Mark McGowan said it \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus\u201d and \u201cwill likely be the final restriction that we lift\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Australia records 14 new cases</h2> \n<p>Australia recorded just 14 new cases of coronavirus overnight. Ten of those cases were in Victoria, including one connected to the Cedar Meats cluster, bringing the total number of cases in that cluster to 79. Queensland and NSW both recorded two new cases each.</p> \n<h2>China threatens barley tariffs</h2> \n<p>The Australian government is trying to convince China not to go ahead with proposed tariffs against Australian-grown barley, which could devastate the $1.5bn trade. Beijing has indicated it may impose the tariffs because it claims an 18-month long anti-dumping investigation, which Australia participated in, has found evidence of dumping and anti-competitive behaviour. Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham says there is no evidence to show Australia engaged in dumping, and that Australian barley farmers \u201coperate on an entirely commercial basis\u201d. It follows weeks of escalating tension between Canberra and Beijing over Australia\u2019s support for an independent investigation into the origin of Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

Companies have already been scrambling for legal and practical advice as they prepare for the realities of managing workplaces during the Covid-19 crisis. However, there are already major concerns that workers are unclear about what to do if they are being put at risk, while industry figures also warn that the mental health impacts of returning to a new \u201calien environment\u201d are not being prioritised. Taped squares in lifts, protective screens between workstations and repurposed meeting rooms are among the basic measures being prepared.

This is developing.\u201d</p> \n  <p>NY state health authorities said last week there have been 73 reported cases in New York of children falling severely ill with a toxic shock-like reaction that displays symptoms similar to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/kawasaki/index.html\">Kawasaki </a><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/kawasaki/index.html\">disease</a>.</p> \n  <p>On the ABC, Doherty said it was possible Covid-19 was triggering some cases of the disease.</p> \n  <p>\u201cKawasaki is an autoimmune disease. We don\u2019t know what causes it. We long suspected it could be triggered by a virus. It is possible it is triggered by a number of different viruses,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s possible \u2013 likely that Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2 is triggering some incidents of this. Children are not totally exempt from this. Some children have died. But they seem to be much less severely affected on the whole.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Doctors still believe most children with Covid-19 develop only mild illness, but Doherty said there was also the prospect of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d as a result of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what the normal incidents of Kawasaki is in New York, you have to look back at that,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about with the whole pandemic in the end will be what\u2019s called excess deaths.

The first is that it is not available for everybody. And for example, if you\u2019re a worker who is not eligible, maybe because of visa status, maybe because of your age, then it\u2019s not just whether or not we want that person to be paid. We actually don\u2019t want that person doing anything other than isolating. And if they\u2019re in a real-world situation of \u2018I\u2019ll lose all my money\u2019, I think we know what they\u2019ll do. </p> \n   <p>And the people who are eligible for jobseeker \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that it passes the pub test where you can go down to Centrelink, register and wait for a long period, and eventually you\u2019ll be reimbursed. If at the end point, people aren\u2019t going to do that and think that they\u2019ve only got a niggle in the throat and maybe they should go to work, it\u2019s not simply a sick leave issue.

      "bodyText": "We will leave our live Australian coverage there for the day. You can follow our rolling global coverage here or read a summary here. Here\u2019s how things stand in Australia: Victoria is set to announce tomorrow whether it plans to ease coronavirus restrictions. The current public health orders will expire, but they could be extended or replaced with something new. New South Wales and WA announced an easing of restrictions, NSW to come into effect on Friday and WA on Monday week. All other states and territories have announced some easing of restrictions. Children are returning to school in NSW this week. Queensland is also seeing the return of kids in kindergarten and students in prep, grade one, year 11 and year 12. Kids in WA are also back at school, but there\u2019s no penalties for learning from home. Australia recorded just 14 new cases of Covid-19 overnight. Ten were in Victoria, including one more in the Cedar Meats cluster, bringing the total size of that cluster to 79. NSW and Queensland recorded two each. Queensland\u2019s deputy premier and treasurer Jackie Trad, who stood aside amid a corruption inquiry last week, has now resigned. Ten people were arrested at a protest against Victoria\u2019s lockdown measures and police have said they will work to identify anyone else who was at the protest (reportedly 250 people) and fine them all for breaching public health orders. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said that for lockdown restrictions to be eased Australians will have to show some personal responsibility for maintaining an appropriate distance between each other and avoiding crowds. He also said the 5G conspiracy theory, which links the telephone network to the coronavirus, is \u201cnonsense\u201d. The dispute between Australia and China appears to have escalated, with Beijing reportedly considering imposing tariffs on Australian barley farmers for alleged anti-competitive behaviour. The Australian government says there\u2019s no evidence Australian farmers engaged in dumping. Stay well, remain 1.5m apart at the shops or when protesting and wish your mother and other mothers/parents in your life a happy mother\u2019s day from us. South Australia has established a rapid response team to deal with any coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes. Twenty-seven of the 97 people to die in Australia after testing positive to Covid-19, died in nursing homes. More detail from AAP: The dedicated SA Pathology team has been assembled to provide greater protection for some of the state\u2019s most vulnerable citizens. If an outbreak occurs, the team will immediately test everyone in the facility, helping to quickly identify cases, limit the spread and protect both residents and staff. \u201cA key to protecting our state from a resurgence of this disease is our success in dealing with cases as they are identified,\u201d health minister Stephen Wade said. \u201cThe way to stop a case from becoming a cluster and a cluster becoming an outbreak is to identify and isolate cases and contacts quickly. \u201cOlder people are much more vulnerable to becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and residents in aged care facilities are at particular risk as we see in both Australia and overseas.\u201d Ten people were arrested at the anti-lockdown, anti-vaxx, and apparently anti-5G protest outside parliament house in Melbourne today. And police have said they are attempting to identify others who attended so they can fine them too. Among those arrested were two organisers of the protest. In a statement, Victoria Police said it \u201crespects the public\u2019s right to protest\u201d but it \u201cmade it very clear that if a planned protest was to proceed today, it would be in direct contravention of the chief health officer\u2019s current directives\u201d. Those directives, which expire tomorrow, allow police to arrest or issue a $1,600 on the spot fine to anyone deemed to be breaching Victoria\u2019s stage three lockdown laws, which state that the only reason a person should be outside their home is for exercise, care or compassionate reasons, to attend work or school, or for essential shopping. Here\u2019s the police statement: At the protest on Spring Street today, police arrested 10 people, including two organisers of the event. OC spray was deployed during an arrest of one individual. The majority of those arrested were for failing to comply with the chief health officer\u2019s directions. Three of the offenders will also be charged with assaulting a police officer, and another offender will be charged with discharging a missile after allegedly throwing a bottle at police. All offenders were released pending summons. As a result of the protest activity, a police officer who was in attendance has been taken to hospital for what is believed to be a rib injury. When attending the protest today, the priority for police was to quickly arrest those individuals who were acting unlawfully and inciting others to breach the chief health officer\u2019s directions. Once police made arrests, the crowd started to disperse. Police are continuing to investigate the events of today in order to identify other people who were in attendance. Once individuals are identified, we will be issuing them with fines and will consider any other enforcement options. I missed this earlier and, frankly, am not sure why I\u2019m sharing it now. But if you want to listen to the same music as the opposition leader, which appears to have been created by googling \u201ccoronavirus songs\u201d (seriously Albo, where\u2019s the creativity?) then here you go. It\u2019s OK, mate. As Nick Hornby wrote, a good compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard to do. Labor\u2019s trade spokeswoman Madeleine King and agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon have released this statement on the proposed barley tariffs. They write: Labor is deeply concerned about reports that China may be preparing to impose tariffs on Australian barley. China is yet to finalise its decision, and the government must use the coming days to resolve this matter to protect Australia\u2019s valuable barley industry. It is in the interests of both nations to have a productive trading relationship. Australia and China have a rich history of trade and investment which has been extremely beneficial to both our nations. The government needs to show leadership on managing this important relationship at this difficult time. South Australia has reported no new cases of coronavirus. Again. They now have just one active case remaining. Murphy said that employers would probably have to stagger shift starts when companies begin asking employees to return to work to avoid peak-hour crowding on public transport. The national cabinet\u2019s roadmap has employees working from home, if they are able, until the last stage of restrictions being lifted. Murphy says: We are very keen, as well as asking those who are working from home to continue working from home for the time being, but we are also keen for employers and employees to look at staggered start and finish times. On the need for an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus in China, Murphy said the world needed to understand how the coronavirus developed, what was the intermediate species that helped transfer the virus to humans, how it mutated, etc. Obviously everybody wants to know what are things that each and every country could have done better to stop this widespread pandemic. He says that Australia and the World Health Organisation have received \u201ca lot of information out of China\u201d and that China has been \u201creadily sharing information and collaborating\u201d. I hope it becomes a scientific and health-based investigation looking at lessons to be learned. Murphy says that businesses should be allowed to turn people away if they have obvious flu-like symptoms. On the stepped path out of lockdown, why did the national cabinet recommend that restaurant patrons be capped at a fixed number rather than a number based on the size of the restaurant? Murphy says that might happen in stage two of the restrictions being lifted, but in stage one \u201cmost of the health experts we have worked with feel strongly that we should keep total group size small\u201d. You could sell potentially infect 20 or 30 people even in a socially distance restaurant, if you have only got 10 people in a group, that is a smaller group to contact trace as well. Murphy is asked about the protests that are happening in Melbourne today, which was pushing a number of conspiracy theories including the one about coronavirus being linked to 5G. (Video explainer on that here.) Murphy said he has been contacted by a number of conspiracy theorists, and that the theory is \u201cnonsense\u201d. There is unfortunately a lot of very silly misinformation out there. There is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space. I have unfortunately received a lot of communication from these conspiracy theorists myself. It is complete nonsense. 5G has got nothing at all to do with coronavirus. Similarly, I understand people have the right to protest, but they should not be breaching those social distancing rules and if they are, they should be held to account. Murphy says continuing to control the coronavirus outbreak in Australia is a matter of personal responsibility. He says that if people forget those principles of social distancing and only going out when it\u2019s essential after the restrictions lift, the virus will spread. \u201cRegulation only goes so far,\u201d he says, adding that he has seen images of people out this week \u201ccrowded in shopping malls, in other circumstances, where they have not been observing the social distancing norms that are part of our new way of behaving\u201d. So regulation can achieve things, but every individual can do more than regulation, by behaving in a way that is respectful of social distancing norms, respectful of the hand hygiene practices that we now have, and if everyone can do that, that will enable us as a nation to progressively and cautiously relax the regulations. But if people don\u2019t do it, we could get widespread community transmission again. That second wave that we\u2019ve talked about, but none of us want to get and none of us intend to get. But it is as much about the rules and regulations as it is about personal responsibility ... So if you are going to a shopping centre to buy something, go and buy something, but don\u2019t hang around the shopping centre for half-an-hour mingling for no purpose. Go home. If you are arriving at a shopping centre and you find a crowd at an escalator not wanting to practise social distancing or crowding together, don\u2019t go in. Leave. Come back later. If you see someone not practising social distancing or behaving irresponsibly, tell them. If a lift opens and you find it is full of people, don\u2019t get in. All of these things are really important. Murphy says the case data in Australia shows the virus is transmitted by \u201cmobile, fit adults\u201d but the deaths are concentrated among the elderly and vulnerable. People have said to me, why don\u2019t you just protect really carefully all those with chronic conditions and the elderly? Make sure they are well cocooned away from everyone else in society? As we have seen already, that\u2019s just not possible if you\u2019ve got widespread community transmission. This virus is incredibly infectious. The chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, says Australia has reported 14 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24-hours. Ten of those are in Victoria. Murphy is speaking in Canberra at the moment. He says Australia\u2019s daily case increase has dropped back to under 20 per day, after a brief increase during the Cedar Meats outbreak. While we are talking about increasing tensions with China, Daniel Hurst just published this report which says that LNP backbencher George Christensen has threatened to call the Chinese ambassador, Cheng Jingye, to give evidence before an Australian parliamentary committee. Christensen is the chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth. He has not got permission from trade minister Simon Birmingham for this latest move, Daniel reports. Trade minister Simon Birmingham has just wrapped up a press conference in Canberra about China preparing to introduce tariffs on Australian-grown barley. Australian barley growers issued a joint statement today saying they understood China intended to introduce tariffs as a result of an investigation into dumping and anti-competitive behaviour. Tariffs could destroy Australia\u2019s $1.5bn barley trade to China. Birmingham said Australia was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by these reports and said there was no evidence that Australia had engaged in dumping of barley. The anti-dumping investigation had been going on for 18 months, with Australia\u2019s cooperation, and Birmingham said Australia sees no basis on which tariffs would be justified. It appears to be an escalation of the diplomatic row between Australia and China, over Australia\u2019s vocal support for an independent investigation into the origin of Covid-19. Asked if Australia risked causing greater offence with Beijing if it fought the anti-dumping findings, Birmingham said: We are mounting a case based on evidence. There should be no offence taken by anybody about the fact that the Australian government stands up for Australian farmers on the basis of evidence that they operate on an entirely commercial basis. ... We don\u2019t dispute the right of any country to receive a complaint in relation to dumping practices or allegations, and to investigate that complaint. But it ought, ultimately, to be resolved on the evidence of the complaint, and the evidence here is compelling that Australian barley producers operate in entirely commercial matters. Some states are preparing to allow restaurants and cafes to have a handful of dine-in patrons again. But what about the hospitality workers who were laid off and are now surviving on the jobseeker payment. Will most of them be able to return to work, if restaurants are limited to 10 covers? And if this were to happen again \u2014 is it reasonable to expect that single adults can live on just $280 per week? Gay Alcorn looked at this issue as part of a series on life after lockdown. You can read it here. The protest outside parliament house has reportedly dispersed. We\u2019ll bring you a round up of arrest numbers shortly. In other, non-protest related Victorian news, more people have now been swabbed in the two-week testing blitz than were tested for Covid-19 in the state between January and the end of April. More than 154,000 people have been swabbed in two weeks. The initial aim of the testing blitz, which was announced on 30 April, was 100,000 swabs. The results take between 24 hours and three days to confirm, and are being analysed at 15 laboratories across Victoria. I\u2019m notoriously bad at crowd estimates but this looks like 100-200 people to me. If you\u2019re wondering why the crowd at the Melbourne protest was chanting \u201carrest Bill Gates,\u201d well, congratulations for managing to avoid this particular conspiracy theory. The short version that because Gates has been warning against the risk of a pandemic for years (and told Donald Trump before the Covid-19 crisis began that the US was not prepared for such an event) then he MUST in some way be responsible for it, for his own nefarious purposes. This is nonsense. It\u2019s also specifically American nonsense: the \u201carrest Bill Gates\u201d chant was started by Alex Jones at a protest in Austin, Texas. Australia, and particularly Victoria, has no jurisdiction to arrest Gates. (And, let me reiterate, absolutely no cause on the grounds alleged by Jones et al.) It does however have jurisdiction for arresting people for breaching social distancing laws. There have been some fairly dramatic scenes at the anti-lockdown protest outside the Victorian parliament. The protesters are anti-vaxxers and people fed up with the stage three restrictions. Police have detained a number of people. And that\u2019s where I will leave you for today. I\u2019m going to hand you over to Calla Wahlquist who will take you through the rest of the afternoon. Thanks as always for reading. The Victorian Liberal Party has also been pushing back against the state\u2019s lockdown restrictions. The state\u2019s opposition spokesman for planning, Tim Smith, has been referring to Andrews as \u201cChairman Dan\u201d and called him a \u201cfear mongering doomsday propagandist\u201d. Smith was on some of the commercial television networks this morning, and while he said people shouldn\u2019t protest, he\u2019s also running the line that \u201cthe only people that can\u2019t visit their mothers today - on Mother\u2019s Day - across Australia, are criminals locked in jail and the good people of Victoria\u201d. Not true, Tim Smith, I am in New South Wales and am unable to visit my mother because of this blog and also because if I go anywhere near her she\u2019ll definitely force me to help her varnish outdoor furniture or re-paint the kitchen or something else horrible. Per the Age newspaper, a crowd has broken into chants of \u201carrest Bill Gates\u201d at an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne today. Victoria is the final state to begin easing restrictions as it continues to deal with the outbreak at the Cedar Meats processing facility. As we told you earlier, the state\u2019s premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announcing an easing of some restrictions tomorrow. But that hasn\u2019t stopped these Victorians heading to the state\u2019s parliament to protest. And once again there have been no new cases recorded in the ACT. The capital has no active cases of the virus. OK, I\u2019m breaching state borders again and heading to Victoria, where there have been 10 new Covid-19 cases recorded in the past 24 hours. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer professor Brett Sutton confirms that one of those is from the Melbourne meat processing works at the centre of a cluster of cases. It brings the total number of cases at the facility to 76. Sutton says that of the 1,487 confirmed cases in Victoria to date, 157 have been confirmed as being a result of community transmission. There are currently seven people in hospital, including five patients in intensive care. Sutton: Today\u2019s increase in cases illustrates once again that while we have been flattening the curve, our battle against Covid-19 is far from over. Victorians have done a remarkable job so far sticking to the coronavirus restrictions and staying at home has saved lives. But now is not the time for complacency. \u201cA record number of Victorians will be tested for coronavirus during these two weeks as part of a major testing blitz across the state. \u201cThe main aim of this increase in testing is to improve access and actively search for cases, allowing us to gain a better picture of this virus and make informed decisions for Victoria.\u201d The big news out of this press conference though is not Covid-19 related. Queensland\u2019s deputy premier, Jackie Trad, who had stood aside over an ongoing corruption inquiry into the hiring of a principal at a high school in her electorate, has now resigned her ministerial responsibilities. She has previously said she believes the inquiry will clear her of any wrongdoing. Palaszczuk thanks Trad and announces a reshuffle of her ministry: the state\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles, will become deputy leader. Cameron Dick, previously the state development minister, becomes treasurer. Kate Jones, the tourism and innovation minister, takes over his job as development minister. Palaszczuk on Trad: She has made the decision in the best interests of her family, the community and the party. She does not want there to be any distraction for the government as we respond to the Covid crisis, and where the government must be focused on recovery and jobs. So I really want to thank her.\u201d She says Trad still intends to re-contest her seat at the next Queensland state election. Moving to Queensland now where premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is speaking. From today Queensland has eased a number of Covid-19 restrictions. She says there have been two new cases in the past 24 hours. However two cases from last week have turned out to be false positives, meaning the overall number of confirmed cases remains 1,045. Here is a (slightly) more concise explanation on the restrictions to be eased in Western Australia from next Monday. It includes the new regional travel borders at the bottom. WA\u2019s health minister Roger Cook is now speaking. He says there have again been no new cases of Covid-19 in the state, leaving the total number of confirmed cases at 552. Cook says that of those cases just seven remain active. We have one person still recovering from coronavirus in the Goldfields, with no cases in any other region of Western Australia. There are now four confirmed Covid-19 cases in Perth Metropolitan hospitals. Of those, one is in ICU. Cook says the state\u2019s Covid-19 clinics were \u201cpretty quiet yesterday\u201d with only 265 people tested. He says that while he welcomes the easing of restrictions, it is \u201cinevitable that there could be some new cases of coronavirus within our community over the coming months\u201d. He urges people in WA to continue to get tested no matter how minor their symptoms. McGowan says phase four of the easing of restrictions will be \u201cassessed and finalised\u201d at a later stage, but that the hard border between WA and the rest of the country \u201cwill likely be the final restriction that we lift\u201d. McGowan says the next phase of the state\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d will be finalised in the coming weeks and will \u201ctake into account the infection rates across WA\u201d. He says he expects phase three to be implemented in about four weeks. He says that, depending on the latest health advice, phase three will likely include a further increase in the number of people allowed at non-work gatherings, further relaxation of measures for cafes and restaurants, an easing of travel restrictions and allow for gyms to reopen and the return of contact community support. Phase three will also likely see public playgrounds, outdoor gym equipment, skate parks and cinemas reopened. He says some regional travel restrictions within WA will also be eased. Currently WA has 13 so-called \u201cregional borders\u201d. That will be reduced to four. It means, for example, that people in the south-west of the state will be able to travel within the Great Southern Wheatbelt, Perth and the Peale regions. The restrictions on the remote communities across the Kimberley, Pilbara and Goldfields will remain in place, as will the hard border with the other states. McGowan says as part of the phase two easing, businesses and premises will \u201cneed to complete an official Covid safety plan\u201d. He says the details of that plan will be released \u201cshortly\u201d. McGowan is outlining a four-stage \u201croadmap\u201d. He says phase one of that road map is already in place. From next Monday, so the 18th, McGowan says the following changes will be put into place: Indoor and outdoor non-work gatherings will be lifted to a maximum of 20 people, up from the current limit of 10 people. Western Australians will now be encouraged to return to work, McGowan says, \u201cunless they are unwell or fall into a vulnerable category as we have previously defined\u201d. Cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen for dine-in service, limited to 20 patrons and with the 4 sq metre rule. That includes dine-in meal services within pubs, bars, community clubs, hotels and WA\u2019s casino. He\u2019s encouraging local governments to ease restrictions on al fresco dining to encourage that. Limits on people attending weddings and funerals will be lifted to 20 attendees. If they are held outdoors, up to 30 attendees will be allowed. Places of worship, community facilities and libraries can reopen, limited to 20 patrons. The number of people who can participate in non-contact community sports will increase to 20 people. McGowan says this means adults and children can train and take part in sports if there\u2019s no physical contact involved and there is no more than 20 people in one group. Outdoor and indoor fitness classes, with minimal shared equipment, can take place, limited to 20 participants. Public swimming pools can open under strict rules, limited to 20 patrons per pool. McGowan says WA\u2019s hard border with the east coast \u201chas been our strongest weapon in the fight against this virus. The hard border, our regional travel restrictions, and our handling of the cruise ship crisis have all played a part in limiting the spread of Covid-19 across Western Australia. We have a broad testing regime in place that gives us confidence in saying we have no evidence of community spread of the illness. Western Australia is now ready to take the next step. Our performance, our success and our hard borders have provided us with the opportunity to move quicker to ease restrictions compared to other states which have community spread of the virus. McGowan begins by wishing his wife a happy mother\u2019s day, and asks his kids to behave. He\u2019s flagging a further easing of restrictions following Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting. As I\u2019ve said virtually every day since the commencement of the pandemic, Western Australians have done an incredible job in stopping the spread of the virus. WesternAustralia\u2019s performance has led the nation. And the world. We set out to flatten the curve. And we have achieved that. Now lets pop over to Western Australia, where premier Mark McGowan is speaking. Berejiklian says it\u2019s \u201cup to the health experts\u201d as to whether NRL players should be forced to have a flu shot before the competition resumes, as has been the case in Queensland. The health experts accepted the plan put to them. We expect all organisations who have had a health plan ticked off to stick to the plan. I don\u2019t care who the organisation is, I don\u2019t care who the individuals are. If you have signed off on a plan, you have to stick to that plan. Because all of us are. All of us have changed our lives. All of us have heeded to the restrictions that we have put in place. And it is important that if you have a plan ticked off, no matter who you are, what organisation you are, you have to stick to it. Berejiklian says any further easing of restrictions will depend on what happens in the next few weeks. I want to say this to the community \u2013 if there is evidence or if there is data that shows either a huge spike, then we have to go backwards. Similarly, if the data shows us that we\u2019re doing better than expected, we can move forward a bit faster. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to go beyond what we have already said today, because it is a bit of watching and acting. There are a number of things we have still held back on. You cannot take a holiday in New South Wales. There are activities other states are doing which you can\u2019t yet do in New South Wales. But we have an obligation to our citizens to move forward or backwards as we see fit, based on health advice. In NSW, children are returning to schools this week. Berejiklian says that is \u201centirely appropriate\u201d. This week, there will be increased activity, no doubt, with schools going back. We also appreciate that when schools go back, it also signals certain things to the community about how we\u2019re feeling about addressing the pandemic at this stage. So we feel it is entirely appropriate to move to this next level of easing of restrictions. And, of course, we know that when parents are dropping off and picking up children from school, or when they are getting their children to school, there could be several of them doing that at the same time. But make sure you maintain that social distancing. Berejiklian acknowledges that for many restaurants and cafes it \u201cwon\u2019t be viable\u201d to reopen with only 10 patrons, but she says \u201cit\u2019s a start\u201d. Only a small proportion [will] find it viable. It is a start. It is up to those restaurants to determine whether or not they think they are viable ... we acknowledge that for many restaurants, this won\u2019t be enough for them to have people, welcome people inside. But having said that, I\u2019ve also been quite inspired by seeing how a lot of businesses have reshaped the way they do things. Berejiklian says the easing of restrictions \u201cwill only be permanent if all of us take on responsibility to respect the new set of rules we\u2019ve put in place\u201d. \u201cI hope they will be permanent. I don\u2019t want us to go backwards. But that depends on us. Be vigilant. If you go to a shopfront and the retailer isn\u2019t doing what they are supposed to, let them know. Let the authorities know. Please make sure all of us stay vigilant. At the end of the day governments can put all the rules in place, but it is up to us to do the right thing as well. The biggest threat to the New South Wales community is complacency. The virus is as deadly, it is as contagious, it is as virulent as it\u2019s always been. The only difference between May and March is the fact that we have far less cases in May. We need to keep it that way. That is the only difference. But unfortunately the virus is very contagious. We\u2019re heading into colder months. That is why it is so important for all of us not to be complacent. She points to the examples of South Korea and Singapore, which have had to re-introduce lockdown measures after \u201csecond wave\u201d outbreaks. Berejiklian says restrictions on regional travel will not be lifted yet. She also, in contradiction to what the prime minister Scott Morrison said on Friday, flags that if large outbreaks occur some of the restrictions may need to be reintroduced. New South Wales is not yet ready to have recreational holidays [in] regional communities. We\u2019re not ready to ease restrictions as much as other states have. But what we will do is assure the community that so long as we keep working together, so long as we keep working hard, that we can continue to move forward. And there is a risk given the size of our population and the number of cases that we may need to go backward sometimes. I hope that\u2019s not the case. We continue to take a cautious approach in New South Wales, but also one which has a focus on jobs and the economy. Because we can\u2019t continue to live like this for the next year or until there is a vaccine. But what we can do is continue to bring the community along with us and I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am as to the level of cooperation, the respecting of the restrictions, and we ask for that to continue. She says she \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to go back\u201d on easing restrictions, but says \u201cthat depends on all of us\u201d. In other words, continue to maintain social distancing. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant says the two new cases include a person who recently returned from the UK. The other is a close contact of a perviously confirmed case. Chant says the two new cases are out of 9,515 people who have been tested in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. There are now 3,053 confirmed cases in New South Wales. About 105 of those cases are being treated by New South Wales Health. Seven people are being treated on ventilators in intensive care units. She ends by thanking the people of New South Wales but urging them to maintain vigilance against the virus. To have a population the size of New South Wales, to see our cases go from a maximum of 200 or so a day down to just a small handful is a wonderful achievement. We don\u2019t want to see any of this lost. We need to fire up our economy. We need to get people back into jobs. We need to see some semblance of normality come back. But we can\u2019t breach any of the restrictions in place. No matter what you are doing, when you leave your home, you need to maintain social distancing. This doesn\u2019t change the fact that so many in our community, who are very vulnerable \u2013 those of a certainly age or those with a medical condition \u2013 should still exercise the extreme caution they have already been exercising for the last month and a half. Please acknowledge that the easing of the restrictions is a sign about how far we come. Please also acknowledge that we should \u2013 all of us \u2013 need to maintain vigilance. Berejiklian says outdoor gym equipment and outdoor pools will be allowed to reopen \u201cwith caution\u201d. She urges people to practice good hygiene including wiping down equipment before using it, and says local councils will have discretion over how and whether those services are re-opened. Please acknowledge and assume that every time you use an outdoor piece of gym equipment or an outdoor playground the person who [it] used before you may have the virus,\u201d she says. \u201cWe ask you to exercise it with caution and make decisions for yourself and your family as to whether you feel that equipment can be used. The federal and state health experts have also given us advice about outdoor pools, swimming areas and the rules around those. We\u2019re allowing that to occur in NSW from Friday, but [with] the restrictions that the health authorities have put in place. As foreshadowed this morning, weddings will increase from five people to 10, and funerals will increase to 20 mourners or 30 for an outside service. Religious gatherings or places of worship will now be able to include up to 10 people. The place of worship may choose to have quiet prayer or formal services, but no more than 10 people at a time. There is an expectation that both the people attending those places, as well as the people organising the services, or the place of worship, maintain hygiene and good social distancing for everybody in those places. The limit on visitors in the home will also rise from two to five, from Friday. That includes adults and children. \u201cA total of five people irrespective of the ages ... of those people,\u201d Berejiklian says. If it\u2019s a very small hole in the wall, you won\u2019t be able to have 10 because you need to keep the four-sq-metre rule, you need to have the social distancing. If you\u2019re a small hole in the wall, you may have two inside and, if allowed, eight outside. The combination is up to you as the manager. Berejiklian confirms what we reported earlier \u2013 announcing a further easing of restrictions on gatherings from Friday. It includes outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people, meaning it\u2019s the first time since the new rules were introduced that people will be able to leave the home for recreational activities. Berejiklian says a gathering of 10 people might be physical training, sitting down in a park, or \u201chaving some type of gathering outdoors\u201d. Berejiklian says NSW has recorded two new cases in the past 24 hours, says it\u2019s an \u201coutstanding result\u201d but calls for people to maintain social distancing measures and continue to get tested no matter how minor their symptoms. \u201cPlease maintain the vigilance,\u201d she says. \u201cEven a scratchy throat, an ache or a pain, any flu-like symptom should be treated as though you have got the virus. So, please, make sure you get tested.\u201d New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian is speaking now. If, like me, you\u2019ve been a little preoccupied by Australian news of late, this global briefing is very helpful. As we hit the 4m global case mark, Russia has become a new hotspot for the outbreak, Belarus has defied worries to hold a parade marking the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazis, South Korea has shut down more than 2,100 clubs and bars in the capital Seoul as it deals with a second-wave outbreak and in Italy, Milan\u2019s mayor has warned he might have to reimpose lockdown rules if people did not respect physical distancing. Doherty, a Nobel laureate, also told the ABC there was \u201cno way\u201d governments could avoid relaxing lockdown restrictions, but said it was \u201cvery likely\u201d infection numbers would increase. \u201cThere is no way that we can avoid relaxing these restrictions,\u201d Doherty said. We can\u2019t keep the country shut down forever. People are already getting restless, from what I understand. We do have to lift them, but carefully because we can handle a certain level of infection in the community, and we would hope to keep it down to just, say, spot fires. While an increase in cases was likely, he said the health system was prepared. Nobody ever in the Australian scenario talked about eradication. We thought we might be getting close to it, but that just seemed too impossible a goal. Maybe it is eradicated in South Australia. Maybe Western Australia. That would be fantastic. That would impose other restrictions, because you\u2019d have to impose travel restrictions between the eastern states and western states, if have still got cases in the eastern states. The shutdown did allow us to get all the testing in place \u2026 and also to get all the hospitals ready with more ventilators, more hospital space and more trained personnel. The question will be \u2013 can we manage to keep a balance so that we don\u2019t get overwhelmed in the hospitals, if it really does flare? Immunologist professor Peter Doherty spoke to the ABC a little earlier this morning, and was asked about the deaths of three children in New York of inflammatory complications possibly linked to Covid-19. The deaths have prompted Andrew Cuomo, the state\u2019s governor, to warn of \u201can entirely different chapter\u201d of a disease that had been believed to cause only mild symptoms in children. The governor reported the first death, of a five-year old boy, on Friday. At his morning press conference on Saturday, Cuomo raised the number of fatalities to three, after the death of a seven-year-old and a teenager. \u201cThe illness has taken the lives of three young New Yorkers,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThis is new. This is developing.\u201d NY state health authorities said last week there have been 73 reported cases in New York of children falling severely ill with a toxic shock-like reaction that displays symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease. On the ABC, Doherty said it was possible Covid-19 was triggering some cases of the disease. \u201cKawasaki is an autoimmune disease. We don\u2019t know what causes it. We long suspected it could be triggered by a virus. It is possible it is triggered by a number of different viruses,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s possible \u2013 likely that Covid-19, Sars-CoV-2 is triggering some incidents of this. Children are not totally exempt from this. Some children have died. But they seem to be much less severely affected on the whole.\u201d Doctors still believe most children with Covid-19 develop only mild illness, but Doherty said there was also the prospect of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d as a result of the virus. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the normal incidents of Kawasaki is in New York, you have to look back at that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about with the whole pandemic in the end will be what\u2019s called excess deaths. I mean, how many more people have died throughout the year than would otherwise have died.\u201d Health minister Greg Hunt has told Sky this morning that he expects the AFL to be back \u201cpretty soon\u201d, after the Herald Sun reported this morning that the league was aiming for a return on 11 June. \u201cI want to see community sport back, the AFL back, the NRL back, netball back,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThe AFL ... they have worked incredibly well in laying out a pathway, consulting with the players, consulting with the health authorities. \u201c[AFL chief executive] Gill McLachlan said to me: \u2018We will not proceed unless we have the clear indication that it is safe and it has the endorsement and support of the medical officers. \u201cI think we will have the footy back pretty soon. I\u2019ll leave the dates to the particular states that are reviewing the plans.\u201d The Victorian government is set to announce an easing of some restrictions on smaller gatherings tomorrow, which could allow AFL teams to train in slightly larger groups than the two they are currently allowed. The Herald Sun reports that the league could resume with a blockbuster Thursday night clash between Collingwood and either Richmond or Melbourne on 11 June. South Australian premier Steven Marshall has also suggested AFL matches could be played in Adelaide when the season resumes. The two SA clubs \u2013 Adelaide and Port Adelaide \u2013 have been preparing to play matches interstate because of SA\u2019s tight border controls and quarantine protocols. Western Australian clubs Fremantle and West Coast are facing the same situation. But Marshall is hopeful the SA government will be able to limit the rate of Covid-19 infections and ease restrictions by next month. \u201cI think they are getting towards the end of their focus on this issue and I think they\u2019ll be giving some clear direction to the AFL really soon,\u201d Marshall told Sky Sunday Agenda. \u201cIt would be great to see the Adelaide Oval up and running again. It really depends on when games resume and what the level of community transmissions and new cases are in those other states. \u201cIf it was up and running today, then I think South Australian teams would be playing those first games interstate. If it happens later, community transmissions come down, it could be a different model.\u201d As parliament returns this week, we will be seeing increasing focus on whether the prime minister\u2019s timeframe for the economic \u201csnapback\u201d is realistic. It was a point made by Labor\u2019s industrial relations spokesman, Tony Burke, on Insiders this morning. Linda Burney, the shadow minister for families and social services, has issued a statement warning a sudden reduction in unemployment benefits in September would be \u201ca recipe for disaster\u201d. Burney is calling on the government to seek and release any modelling on the economic impact of \u201csnapping back\u201d the Coronavirus Supplement - the temporary payment that effectively doubles the jobseeker allowance. Burney said switching the jobseeker payment back to $40 per day in September could be the equivalent of \u201cripping almost $1bn a fortnight from household budgets\u201d and would have a significant impact on the Australian economy. She said the government needed to explain \u201cwhether the nation is now edging closer to another economic cliff in the form of the prime minister\u2019s promised jobseeker snapback\u201d. \u201cIf the prime minister wants to snap back jobseeker, he should be upfront with Australian workers and Australian businesses as to its consequences.\u201d When asked on Friday to give certainty to the millions of Australians receiving jobseeker and jobkeeper payments, Scott Morrison told reporters he wanted them \u201cto be back in their jobs where they don\u2019t need it\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming towards\u201d. Burke confirms Labor will seek to challenge changes to IR laws made by the government in the midst of the Covid-19 crisis. Last month the government changed the time required for employers to consult over changes to pay and conditions from seven days to just 24 hours. The change is only supposed to be in place for six months. With parliament returning this week, Burke says Labor will try to \u201cdisallow\u201d the change in the Senate. I hope, procedurally, we\u2019ll be able to get to that point this week in the Senate. There\u2019s a few Senate procedural issues that that hinges on. But ultimately, this is a really dangerous change the government\u2019s made, and it flies in the face of the cooperation that the union movement has been showing the government during this period. David Speers asks Burke if Labor believes the jobseeker and jobkeeper programs should be extended beyond September, when they are due to expire. Burke says he doesn\u2019t believe \u201cthe hard deadlines that are there right now are going to be able to continue\u201d. Unless you want people to suddenly be able to not pay their bills, unless you want people to suddenly vacate the premises where they live and handing back the keys to homes that they\u2019ve mortgaged, then the government is going to have to look at extending this. Think of the alternative, and I don\u2019t think that that is what we want Australia to look like in a few months. I certainly don\u2019t believe the hard deadlines that are there right now are going to be able to continue. So there are some people who missed out the whole way through where this needs to be extended right now. Whether it be casuals, whether it be arts and entertainment. Burke is also taking aim at the government for calling for people to stay home from work even if they have only very minor symptoms. The government has said people like labour hire and gig economy workers can apply for two weeks of the Jobseeker payment \u2013 called the sickness allowance \u2013 to cover illness, but Burke says it will be too difficult to access. The government, when they say jobseeker is available, there are two problems with that. The first is that it is not available for everybody. And for example, if you\u2019re a worker who is not eligible, maybe because of visa status, maybe because of your age, then it\u2019s not just whether or not we want that person to be paid. We actually don\u2019t want that person doing anything other than isolating. And if they\u2019re in a real-world situation of \u2018I\u2019ll lose all my money\u2019, I think we know what they\u2019ll do. And the people who are eligible for jobseeker \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that it passes the pub test where you can go down to Centrelink, register and wait for a long period, and eventually you\u2019ll be reimbursed. If at the end point, people aren\u2019t going to do that and think that they\u2019ve only got a niggle in the throat and maybe they should go to work, it\u2019s not simply a sick leave issue. It\u2019s actually a public health issue. Tony Burke, Labor\u2019s opposition spokesman on industrial relations and the arts, is being interviewed on the ABC\u2019s Insiders. He wants the Morrison government to release guidelines for workplaces to practice Covid-safe practices if and when more people begin returning to work, and says there should be penalties for employers who breach those guidelines. \u201cIf you\u2019re putting people\u2019s health and safety at risk, there should be penalties attached to that,\u201d Burke said. While most states, including New South Wales, have already loosened some restrictions, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews has been the most cautious in relaxing lockdown restrictions. But the Herald Sun is reporting that the Victorian premier will announce a loosening on the reigns tomorrow, with schools to resume in two weeks and groups of up to 10 to be allowed to gather indoors and outdoors. The Herald Sun is also reporting the AFL is aiming to return to the field by the middle of June. My colleague Naaman Zhou has been (virtually) sitting in the inquiry into the Ruby Princess fiasco this week, and has put together this step-by-step walk-through of how exactly the cruise ship came to dock and disembark in Sydney. Federal health minister Greg Hunt has confirmed the Australian government will back a European Union motion for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19 in China. The government has been calling for an inquiry for some weeks. Foreign affairs minister Marise Payne first flagged the need for an inquiry to be run at arms length from the World Health Organisation. It\u2019s sparked a harsh response from China, Australia\u2019s number one trading partner. \u201cWe support the EU motion which includes an independent investigation, regulatory work on wet markets and also the potential for independent inspection powers,\u201d Hunt told Sky News this morning. Let\u2019s keep going around the grounds to Queensland, where you\u2019ll have no excuse not to visit your mum on Mother\u2019s Day (sorry I haven\u2019t called yet Mum, if you\u2019re reading). From today up to five people from the same home are allowed to visit another household, with schools resuming as normal on Monday. Personal training sessions, retail shopping, weddings with up to 10 people and funerals of up to 20 inside or 30 outside are now also allowed in the sunshine state. Restaurants, libraries, pools and beauty salons can also reopen, with open house inspections and auctions allowed to proceed. Bars and gaming facilities will remain closed for now, but up to 10 people at a time can dine in at restaurants, pubs, licensed clubs, RSL clubs and hotels. Recreational travel for day trips up to 150km from home will be allowed. In the outback, where there have been no Covid-19 cases, people can travel up to 500km from home and up to 20 locals will be allowed to dine in pubs and cafes. We also expect Western Australian premier Mark McGowan to outline the easing of some restrictions later today. McGowan has hinted that he\u2019ll focus on changes that will stimulate the state\u2019s economy, though last week he seemed to indicate there were no plans to lift WA\u2019s border closure. WA Health minister Roger Cook has cautioned any changes would be just the \u201cbeginning of a long journey\u201d. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a shortcut,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWe will look at what we can do to ease restrictions in order to reopen the economy,\u201d he said. No new virus cases were reported in WA on Saturday, leaving the state\u2019s total number of confirmed cases at 552. Only seven cases remain active, with four people in hospital and one of those in intensive care. The state government has also announced a multimillion dollar fund to help boost research into Covid-19 and to ramp up its testing regime. The government will allocate $6m with similar cash coming from the private sector. Good morning, Welcome to Guardian Australia\u2019s live coverage of all things Covid-19. Some big news in New South Wales this morning. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has revealed that the state will begin unrolling some restrictions from Friday. The changes are all in line with the stage one \u201croad map\u201d outlined by the prime minister Scott Morrison on Friday. The changes, which Berejiklian is expected to formally announce at a press conference in Sydney later this morning, include allowing cafes and restaurants to reopen for up to 10 patrons and easing the restrictions on the number of people able to visit another person\u2019s home from two to five. The changes will also mean 10 people can gather together outdoors. Children\u2019s playgrounds will also reopen, as will outdoor gyms and pools with some restrictions. Religious gatherings will be allowed to host up to 10 people, as will weddings. Funerals can have up to 20 mourners indoors and 30 outdoors. The ban on regional travel will remain however, and libraries and community centres will remain closed.",

Five months on, it is Brazil that is heading in the direction of a humanitarian emergency, amid a devastating coronavirus outbreak propelled by Bolsonaro\u2019s dismissive attitude towards the pandemic. The Brazilian president has downplayed the crisis as media \u201chysteria\u201d and repeatedly rejected his own government\u2019s social distancing recommendations, even as the death toll has soared. In contrast, Argentina swiftly imposed a national lockdown, and appears to have successfully flattened the curve of contagion. \u201cYou can recover from a drop in the GDP,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez has said about his decision to implement an early lockdown. \u201cBut you can\u2019t recover from death.\u201d With only 5,611 cases and 293 deaths so far, against Brazil\u2019s nearly 136,000 cases and over 9,100 deaths, even diehard Bolsonaro supporters are now looking towards their southern neighbour with an envious eye.

The worst affected is Villa 31 where some 45,000 people inhabit makeshift homes with deficient water services. Cases there jumped from just a handful to 219 when the \u201cvilla\u201d was left without water for some 10 days by a water plant failure that was only resolved in recent days. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Villa 31 is a tragedy,\u201d said Ofelia Fern\u00e1ndez, (no relation of the president), the city\u2019s youngest legislator at 20 years old. \u201cWhen a whole family is crammed in a single room, no amount of hand-washing will slow the spread.

Fern\u00e1ndez is expected to announce the resumption of activities for some industries such as motor car and clothing factories starting Monday. But bars and restaurants will remain closed, except for deliveries and takeaways, as will schools, universities and entertainment venues. The tight coordination between the central government, governors and mayors in Argentina over lockdown measures stands in sharp contrast to the battles and confrontations in Brazil where Bolsonaro sacked his health minister and clashed with regional governors. But the differences between the two country\u2019s experiences of the pandemic are not just down to the contrasting personalities of their presidents, said the Argentinian academic Andr\u00e9s Malamud, a senior research fellow at the University of Lisbon. Bolsonaro split with the party that brought him to power, whereas Fern\u00e1ndez is a product of one of Latin America\u2019s most enduring and powerful national movements. \u201cFern\u00e1ndez can rely on Argentina\u2019s disciplined Peronist party, which has historically been on the side of the most disenfranchised, so informal workers, who make up 49% of the workforce, trust Fern\u00e1ndez to provide solutions. Bolsonaro instead is an independent with no party to fall back on. Argentina\u2019s governors are also dependent on the fiscal largesse of the federal government, so they fell in line quickly with the nationwide lockdown,\u201d said Malamud. Argentina still faces many challenges, chiefly economic: inflation is still around a yearly 50% and the renegotiation of the country\u2019s sizable foreign debt is a race against the clock, with the possibility of a technical default soon if a current round of negotiations are not successful. With the country\u2019s finances obviously on his mind, Fern\u00e1ndez on Thursday tweeted a picture of himself confirming via teleconference a $1.8bn loan from the Inter-American Development Bank. For now at least, the president has said he plans to keep prioritizing saving lives over reviving the economy. \u201cI\u2019d rather a factory was empty because its workers are in quarantine, and not because they\u2019re ill or dead,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez said.",

The pilgrimages have been organised by the Council of Christians and Jews.</p> <p>Jonathan Wittenberg, the senior rabbi of Masorti Judaism, came up with the idea because he wanted \u201cthe voices of religions to be heard more in support of the amazing and inspiring efforts so many in our society are making, from the NHS to care workers, people stocking shop shelves, running food banks, volunteering to make visors and gowns, getting shopping and prescriptions for elderly or immunity impaired neighbours, and keeping up our morale in countless creative ways.\u201d</p> <p>His route from his home in north London will take in the Royal Free, University College London hospital, Great Ormond Street hospital and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. At each place, he will stop to \u201csalute the courage, devotion and dedication\u201d of NHS staff and offer prayers.</p> <p>Wittenburg, a diabetic who will run at night to minimise the risk to his health, said: \u201cI feel very aware of not being in the front line. So the least I can do is appreciate and support those who are.</p> <p>\u201cBut this is not just about the present. It\u2019s also about looking to the future and working so that the \u2018new normal\u2019 is a way of life in which we notice and care for each other and nature with greater attentiveness and kindness. These are our most basic and most universal religious and human values.\u201d</p> <p>His partner for the first virtual pilgrimage is the Rev Colin Sinclair, the moderator of the Church of Scotland, who will visit two hospitals and some care homes near his home in Edinburgh during his walk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>He said: \u201cOne of the paradoxical aspects of lockdown and physical distancing is that other barriers seem to have broken down. We have a solidarity in our shared humanity, across both our beliefs and our place in society. In the light of coronavirus we are all ordinary people struggling with the same problem and as such we all know anxiety, uncertainty and also tears.</p> <p>\u201cNo one would wish Covid-19 on anyone, yet it has helped us reassess what really matters in our world and how we can live, work and respect one another. I am glad as a Christian leader to honour those serving in the frontline and also to offer prayers for them and those they care for.\u201d</p>",

Among those taking part will be Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Catholic archbishop of Westminster, and Ephraim Mirvis, the chief rabbi. Priests and rabbis will be paired for simultaneous walks or runs to key worker sites, such as schools, hospitals, care homes, bus stops and food banks, over the next few weeks. The pilgrimages have been organised by the Council of Christians and Jews. Jonathan Wittenberg, the senior rabbi of Masorti Judaism, came up with the idea because he wanted \u201cthe voices of religions to be heard more in support of the amazing and inspiring efforts so many in our society are making, from the NHS to care workers, people stocking shop shelves, running food banks, volunteering to make visors and gowns, getting shopping and prescriptions for elderly or immunity impaired neighbours, and keeping up our morale in countless creative ways.\u201d His route from his home in north London will take in the Royal Free, University College London hospital, Great Ormond Street hospital and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. At each place, he will stop to \u201csalute the courage, devotion and dedication\u201d of NHS staff and offer prayers. Wittenburg, a diabetic who will run at night to minimise the risk to his health, said: \u201cI feel very aware of not being in the front line. So the least I can do is appreciate and support those who are. \u201cBut this is not just about the present. It\u2019s also about looking to the future and working so that the \u2018new normal\u2019 is a way of life in which we notice and care for each other and nature with greater attentiveness and kindness. These are our most basic and most universal religious and human values.\u201d His partner for the first virtual pilgrimage is the Rev Colin Sinclair, the moderator of the Church of Scotland, who will visit two hospitals and some care homes near his home in Edinburgh during his walk. He said: \u201cOne of the paradoxical aspects of lockdown and physical distancing is that other barriers seem to have broken down. We have a solidarity in our shared humanity, across both our beliefs and our place in society. In the light of coronavirus we are all ordinary people struggling with the same problem and as such we all know anxiety, uncertainty and also tears. \u201cNo one would wish Covid-19 on anyone, yet it has helped us reassess what really matters in our world and how we can live, work and respect one another. I am glad as a Christian leader to honour those serving in the frontline and also to offer prayers for them and those they care for.\u201d",

In Super League, the average salary is \u00a375,000 and only a handful of marquee players attract an annual income anywhere near those that footballers in the Premier League receive each and every week.</p> <p>Without income from supporters and the realistic possibility of a reduced TV deal from Sky in 2022, even the most sustainable clubs are worried. Castleford are one such example. Around a fifth of the town\u2019s 40,000 population regularly attend games and their director of rugby, Jon Wells, believes there are implications ahead that could last for years. \u201cI fear there will be a significant levelling-down exercise in rugby league finances,\u201d he says. \u201cIs a \u00a3100,000 player now worth \u00a380,000? Is someone on \u00a380,000 now worth \u00a372,000?</p> <p>\u201cWe also have to consider that our supporters, who as working-class people could be hit financially by this more than supporters of other sports \u2013 [they] may not be able to afford to come to games.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole sport takes a hit, not just the lower leagues. I can\u2019t see a rugby league event with fans in this year and that\u2019s going to have huge implications. As a sport, we rely on our communities just as much as they rely on us.\u201d</p> <p>The numbers become even more sobering the further down the pyramid you go. Hunslet were once one of rugby league\u2019s most successful clubs, winning two league championships and two Challenge Cups before the second world war. Nowadays they participate in the sport\u2019s lowest professional tier, League 1: where the average player earns \u00a310,000 on a part-time playing contract.</p> <p>\u201cA loss of around \u00a315,000 would be enough for a good portion of clubs outside Super League to encounter serious insolvency issues,\u201d says Damian Irvine, a director at Hunslet. \u201cClubs at this level were already in danger from any serious revenue fluctuation prior to Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "At first glance, the numbers do not seem that terrifying. While other mainstream sports predict the financial cost of Covid-19 will run into the hundreds of millions, last week\u2019s news that the Rugby Football League has secured a \u00a316m loan from the government suggests it is in reasonable shape \u2013 in need of assistance rather than full-blown emergency intervention. But take even a modest journey through this sport, whose roots remain firmly embedded in northern, working-class towns and you learn this money was absolutely essential to protect it from going under. Indeed, that was outlined to clubs in a recent email from the RFL. \u201cThe sport faces a genuine threat to its future,\u201d it read. Rugby league is not a house built on sand but economically it is heavily reliant on two things: its multimillion-pound broadcast arrangement with Sky Sports and ticketing and merchandise revenue from the local communities that it supports in return. Where it differs from other sports is that even the most prominent, high-profile clubs are facing financial uncertainty due to the spread of coronavirus. In Super League, the average salary is \u00a375,000 and only a handful of marquee players attract an annual income anywhere near those that footballers in the Premier League receive each and every week. Without income from supporters and the realistic possibility of a reduced TV deal from Sky in 2022, even the most sustainable clubs are worried. Castleford are one such example.

      "body": "<p>The number of jobless people in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">rose by more than 20 million in April</a>, something deemed worthy of a mention in the \u201cand in other news\u201d slot on the BBC\u2019s evening TV bulletin.</p> <p>Sure, it was the 75th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ve-day\">VE day</a> and there were socially distanced street parties to cover and archive footage of crowds gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to treasure.</p> <p>But hang on a minute. In the past, literary careers have been built on the sort of employment catastrophe that has just befallen the world\u2019s biggest economy. It is worth recalling that the war commemorated last week had its roots in Germany\u2019s 6-million long dole queues in the early 1930s.</p> <p>It matters a lot that the official US unemployment rate rose by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7% in a single month, that the real level of joblessness is actually around 25% and is likely to reach 30% before it peaks.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The April rise in unemployment was bigger than anything seen during the collapse of the US economy during the Great Depression, an economic tragedy that took several years to unfold. Inevitable once the decision was taken to shut down businesses in order to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-live-news-obama-trumps-covid-19--chaotic-as-global-cases-pass-4-million-mexico-russia-germany-south-korea-deaths-\">Covid-19</a> virus from spreading, layoffs are hitting the poorest workers hardest. An employee in the bottom 20% of earners was four times as likely to lose their job last month as someone in the highest earning 20%.</p> <p>As in the UK, shuttering businesses across the country is proving easier to do than reopening them. The number of airline passengers currently stands at 7% of last year\u2019s level; in the states where restaurants have reopened for business the number of customers is around 10% of its pre-pandemic levels. The number of weekly jobless claims has come down from its peak but is still running at more than 3 million.</p> <p>All of which suggests that unemployment is going to stay high for some time. The chances of the jobless rate being below 10% by the time Donald Trump stands for re-election in November look remote.</p> <p>Unemployment \u2013 and the risk of being made unemployed \u2013 makes people miserable. There has been plenty of speculation in the past couple of months about whether the lockdown has been good for levels of wellbeing, but the survey evidence and the economic literature suggests it has not.</p> <p>Here in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said the levels of people reporting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/04/half-of-british-adults-felt-anxious-about-covid-19-lockdown\">high levels of anxiety</a> more than doubled when the economy went into hibernation at the end of March. More than half the adult population \u2013 25 million people \u2013 said they were worried about their health, the security of their job or having enough money to get by.</p> <p>A separate coronavirus study from the Mental Health Foundation found that 34% of UK adults surveyed and in full-time work were concerned about losing their jobs; 20% of unemployed people surveyed said they had suicidal thoughts and feelings within the last two weeks; and 11% of unemployed people who have experienced stress during the pandemic said nothing had helped them to cope with the worry and anxiety.</p> <p>There may well be people who are sailing through the lockdown untroubled, but they probably don\u2019t include those who have lost their jobs, think they might be laid off once the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end, or feel responsible as the owner of a small business for the livelihoods of others. Not for them the luxury of working from home on full pay or retirement on an indexed-linked final salary pension.</p> <p>What\u2019s more, it is reasonable to expect similar levels of stress and despair to be prevalent on the other side of the Atlantic, where the welfare state is not known for its generosity.

      "bodyText": "The number of jobless people in the US rose by more than 20 million in April, something deemed worthy of a mention in the \u201cand in other news\u201d slot on the BBC\u2019s evening TV bulletin. Sure, it was the 75th anniversary of VE day and there were socially distanced street parties to cover and archive footage of crowds gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to treasure. But hang on a minute. In the past, literary careers have been built on the sort of employment catastrophe that has just befallen the world\u2019s biggest economy. It is worth recalling that the war commemorated last week had its roots in Germany\u2019s 6-million long dole queues in the early 1930s. It matters a lot that the official US unemployment rate rose by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7% in a single month, that the real level of joblessness is actually around 25% and is likely to reach 30% before it peaks. Let\u2019s start with the obvious. The April rise in unemployment was bigger than anything seen during the collapse of the US economy during the Great Depression, an economic tragedy that took several years to unfold. Inevitable once the decision was taken to shut down businesses in order to stop the Covid-19 virus from spreading, layoffs are hitting the poorest workers hardest. An employee in the bottom 20% of earners was four times as likely to lose their job last month as someone in the highest earning 20%. As in the UK, shuttering businesses across the country is proving easier to do than reopening them. The number of airline passengers currently stands at 7% of last year\u2019s level; in the states where restaurants have reopened for business the number of customers is around 10% of its pre-pandemic levels. The number of weekly jobless claims has come down from its peak but is still running at more than 3 million. All of which suggests that unemployment is going to stay high for some time. The chances of the jobless rate being below 10% by the time Donald Trump stands for re-election in November look remote. Unemployment \u2013 and the risk of being made unemployed \u2013 makes people miserable. There has been plenty of speculation in the past couple of months about whether the lockdown has been good for levels of wellbeing, but the survey evidence and the economic literature suggests it has not. Here in the UK, the Office for National Statistics said the levels of people reporting high levels of anxiety more than doubled when the economy went into hibernation at the end of March. More than half the adult population \u2013 25 million people \u2013 said they were worried about their health, the security of their job or having enough money to get by. A separate coronavirus study from the Mental Health Foundation found that 34% of UK adults surveyed and in full-time work were concerned about losing their jobs; 20% of unemployed people surveyed said they had suicidal thoughts and feelings within the last two weeks; and 11% of unemployed people who have experienced stress during the pandemic said nothing had helped them to cope with the worry and anxiety. There may well be people who are sailing through the lockdown untroubled, but they probably don\u2019t include those who have lost their jobs, think they might be laid off once the government\u2019s furlough scheme comes to an end, or feel responsible as the owner of a small business for the livelihoods of others. Not for them the luxury of working from home on full pay or retirement on an indexed-linked final salary pension. What\u2019s more, it is reasonable to expect similar levels of stress and despair to be prevalent on the other side of the Atlantic, where the welfare state is not known for its generosity. Indeed, the work of economists such as Danny Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald has highlighted how higher unemployment is the economic variable most strikingly linked to rising unhappiness, and the longer the spell of unemployment the greater the cost to personal wellbeing. Academic interest in the impact of unemployment on physical and mental health picked up in the 1980s, when deep scars were left by workers enduring long spells of joblessness and in some cases losing touch with the labour market altogether. A priority, therefore, is to prevent temporary layoffs becoming permanent, because that is the path to more poverty, more ill-health, more crime, more relationship breakups and more social alienation. Hence the current heightened interest in job guarantee schemes for the young and universal basic income for all to supplement strong doses of economic stimulus. The textbook free-market solution to unemployment is that workers can always price themselves back into a job by being willing to take a pay cut. Fortunately, no government in the world believes this nonsense, and the story of the past couple of months has been frantic attempts to prevent a health emergency from morphing into an employment emergency. Britain\u2019s furlough scheme has been one response to this incipient crisis, but there has also been a response in the US, where Trump, keen not to become the new Herbert Hoover, has adopted a three-pronged approach.

We need to ensure that no doctor, nurse or healthcare worker is put in harm\u2019s way in this manner ever again, and the families of frontline healthcare workers who have died get much-needed answers.\u201d Several of those who died, including Dr Peter Tun, who worked at Royal Berkshire hospital and Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, who worked at Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, had warned about the risks posed by a lack of PPE. Among the failures the claimants allege are an absence of gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government\u2019s pandemic stockpile when coronavirus reached the UK in February. They also refer to the claims by UK businesses with access to PPE that their offers to help were ignored and to the fiasco surrounding the attempt to source 400,000 protective gowns from Turkey. The order from Turkey was delayed and when it did arrive contained only 67,000 gowns of which only 4,500 were passed as fit for use in the health service. The Sunday Telegraph reported that of a stockpile of nearly 26m Tiger Eye protectors, 15.9m pairs were distributed in the health system while the remainder were being held in quarantine. A DHSC spokeswoman said: \u201cThe Tiger Eye protectors were bought in 2009 and were in CE marked boxes. These were rechecked, and following these assessments, we have issued an alert to clinical settings advising against their use and we are removing them from the supply chain. \u201cBased on current stock assessments, trusts should have sufficient visors and goggles to immediately stop using Tiger Eye protection.\u201d The pre-action letter says the DHSC has a legal obligation under the Human Rights Act 1998 and article 2 of the European convention on human rights to commence an immediate and independent investigation into issues surrounding the procurement and distribution of PPE within both the NHS and wider social care system prior to and during the current crisis. The government and NHS England initially insisted there was no shortage of PPE, only distribution problems, before the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, admitted last month that there was \u201cshort supply\u201d in some areas. Jolyon Maugham, the director of the Good Law Project, said: \u201cWe support the government\u2019s efforts to get protective equipment to those risking their lives to protect the sick and vulnerable. But we must never be forced to ask NHS and care home workers to risk their lives again.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been called the four-person puzzle. If you could only have the same four family members or friends to dinner for a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, who would you choose? That is the dilemma the Belgian government has handed its citizens as it moves to the next phase in easing restrictions on everyday life.</p> <p>From Sunday, every household in Belgium can invite up to four guests to their home. Two sets of four people make a \u201ccorona bubble\u201d, who can visit each other\u2019s homes. No one else is allowed into the domestic social circle. The concept, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">also being discussed by the British government</a>, opens up the biggest social minefield of the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, announced the plan last week, after being accused of prioritising the economy over people\u2019s wishes to be reunited with friends and family.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been called the four-person puzzle. If you could only have the same four family members or friends to dinner for a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, who would you choose? That is the dilemma the Belgian government has handed its citizens as it moves to the next phase in easing restrictions on everyday life. From Sunday, every household in Belgium can invite up to four guests to their home. Two sets of four people make a \u201ccorona bubble\u201d, who can visit each other\u2019s homes. No one else is allowed into the domestic social circle. The concept, also being discussed by the British government, opens up the biggest social minefield of the coronavirus lockdown. Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, announced the plan last week, after being accused of prioritising the economy over people\u2019s wishes to be reunited with friends and family. Allowing social bubbles to start on Sunday, Mother\u2019s Day in Belgium and much of continental Europe, is no accident. \u201cThe physical separation from those whom we love has in some cases become unbearable,\u201d Wilm\u00e8s said, but visitors are told not to hug or exchange the typical three-kiss greeting. The government expects guests to stay 1.5 metres apart and suggests people meet in gardens or on terraces where possible. Authorities say it impossible to police the policy, so they are relying on people\u2019s sense of civic duty. Belgians, especially large families or those where one or both parents have remarried, are already contemplating their choices. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly complicated.

Only one person per household was previously able to meet a person from another household. In theory, two families or two couples may now meet, providing they observe the 1.5-metre physical distancing rule and face coverings are worn if they meet outside. It has not been specified whether a family can meet up with one family on one day and another family the next. The assumption is that that is the case but it is yet to be clarified.

The obviously ill president congratulates the \u201cClass of Covid-19\u201d before rambling about coal, Dr Fauci, sunscreen and Obama, all while drinking bleach.</p> <p>The night\u2019s \u201chost\u201d, Kristin Wiig, gives a very awkward monologue. Sandwiched between two quick and cringey showtunes, the former cast member half-jokingly/half-seriously wishes everyone a happy Mother\u2019s Day.</p> <p>The show proper gets off to a good start with Zoom Catch-Up, in which sociopathic jetsetters Deidre (Heidi Gardner) and Ripley (Martin Short, great as always) infuriate their friends by regaling them with details of their voluntary \u201cquarantina\u201d in Covid-ravaged Italy \u2013 \u201cThe food, the people, the wine \u2026 we saw none of it!\u201d</p> <p>Song for the Kids is a musical public service announcement in which the cast, joined by a children\u2019s choir and Josh Gad, make an impassioned argument to \u201cLet Kids Drink\u201d during quarantine \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019ll be happier and funnier and fall asleep by six!\u201d It\u2019s the rare musical number that starts out catchy and funny and gets better, climaxing in Beck Bennett\u2019s gloriously pathetic plea on behalf of drunken sad sacks everywhere.</p> <p>Another Masterclass: Quarantine Edition sees Chloe Fineman deliver a dead-on very self-satisfied Phoebe Waller-Bridge and a slightly less impressive air-headed Britney Spears. Melissa Villase\u00f1or joins in with her Instagram-popular (but one-note) John Mulaney.</p> <p>Zoom Church sees the pastor of a black congregation attempt to lead his flock in a virtual service, only to hit a wall of frustration when he tries to get them to put themselves on mute. Ego Nwodim and Chris Redd, who have really shone in small parts throughout this season, get in some very funny asides.</p> <p>Pete Davidson performs a rap in honor of rugged Mexican American actor Danny Trejo. It\u2019s basically a rundown of his long list of accomplishments, but hey, who doesn\u2019t love Danny Trejo? He shows up, too.</p> <p>Wiig returns for Hair Vlog, which, like her monologue, feels airless and awkward. For whatever reason, her performance style is not well suited to digital, DIY comedy. The same can be said for Kate McKinnon.</p> <p>R&amp;B foursome Boyz II Men perform their 1997 hit A Song for Mama as we\u2019re treated to a picture slideshow of the cast and their mothers. It\u2019s very sappy, but who\u2019s going to complain about a surprise Boyz II Men performance?</p> <p>On Weekend Update, Colin Jost hits the hot button topics \u2013 coronavirus tearing through Trump\u2019s inner circle, Biden\u2019s response to allegations of sexual assault, Steve Mnuchin and Axl Rose\u2019s stupid Twitter spat \u2013 while Michael Che, drinking whiskey, laments the dangers facing people like him: \u201cSo let me get this straight: I gotta try to survive the coronavirus, the police, basic cardio and now big-ass murder hornets?\u201d</p> <p>They\u2019re joined by former Update host Tina Fey, whose bubbly exterior barely masks her desperation at being stuck at home with her kids.

      "bodyText": "Prior to the pandemic, Saturday Night Live was on course to deliver a slightly above-average season, Eddie Murphy\u2019s triumphant return notwithstanding. Thanks to the final three episodes, all filmed remotely, Season 45 will go down in history. The At Home episodes have had their share of clunky moments but they are testament to the cast and crew\u2019s spirit and ingenuity. The show deserves much credit. The finale kicks off with Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin) delivering a virtual address to a very unhappy group of high school graduates. The obviously ill president congratulates the \u201cClass of Covid-19\u201d before rambling about coal, Dr Fauci, sunscreen and Obama, all while drinking bleach. The night\u2019s \u201chost\u201d, Kristin Wiig, gives a very awkward monologue. Sandwiched between two quick and cringey showtunes, the former cast member half-jokingly/half-seriously wishes everyone a happy Mother\u2019s Day. The show proper gets off to a good start with Zoom Catch-Up, in which sociopathic jetsetters Deidre (Heidi Gardner) and Ripley (Martin Short, great as always) infuriate their friends by regaling them with details of their voluntary \u201cquarantina\u201d in Covid-ravaged Italy \u2013 \u201cThe food, the people, the wine \u2026 we saw none of it!\u201d Song for the Kids is a musical public service announcement in which the cast, joined by a children\u2019s choir and Josh Gad, make an impassioned argument to \u201cLet Kids Drink\u201d during quarantine \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019ll be happier and funnier and fall asleep by six!\u201d It\u2019s the rare musical number that starts out catchy and funny and gets better, climaxing in Beck Bennett\u2019s gloriously pathetic plea on behalf of drunken sad sacks everywhere. Another Masterclass: Quarantine Edition sees Chloe Fineman deliver a dead-on very self-satisfied Phoebe Waller-Bridge and a slightly less impressive air-headed Britney Spears. Melissa Villase\u00f1or joins in with her Instagram-popular (but one-note) John Mulaney. Zoom Church sees the pastor of a black congregation attempt to lead his flock in a virtual service, only to hit a wall of frustration when he tries to get them to put themselves on mute. Ego Nwodim and Chris Redd, who have really shone in small parts throughout this season, get in some very funny asides. Pete Davidson performs a rap in honor of rugged Mexican American actor Danny Trejo. It\u2019s basically a rundown of his long list of accomplishments, but hey, who doesn\u2019t love Danny Trejo? He shows up, too. Wiig returns for Hair Vlog, which, like her monologue, feels airless and awkward. For whatever reason, her performance style is not well suited to digital, DIY comedy. The same can be said for Kate McKinnon. R&amp;B foursome Boyz II Men perform their 1997 hit A Song for Mama as we\u2019re treated to a picture slideshow of the cast and their mothers. It\u2019s very sappy, but who\u2019s going to complain about a surprise Boyz II Men performance? On Weekend Update, Colin Jost hits the hot button topics \u2013 coronavirus tearing through Trump\u2019s inner circle, Biden\u2019s response to allegations of sexual assault, Steve Mnuchin and Axl Rose\u2019s stupid Twitter spat \u2013 while Michael Che, drinking whiskey, laments the dangers facing people like him: \u201cSo let me get this straight: I gotta try to survive the coronavirus, the police, basic cardio and now big-ass murder hornets?\u201d They\u2019re joined by former Update host Tina Fey, whose bubbly exterior barely masks her desperation at being stuck at home with her kids. She advises fellow mothers \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to be emotional in front of your kids \u2026 let them see you open-mouth-chew cold spaghetti while you scream words like \u2018MORON\u2019 and \u2018DUNNING-KRUGER SYNDROME LOOK IT UP HE DEFINITELY HAS IT\u2019 at the news program of your choice\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Of all of the strange side effects of the pandemic, I suppose the craft boom was inevitable. The mindfulness industry (which goes hand in hand with sewing, knitting and the like) was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality\">already thriving</a> before lockdown sent our levels of boredom and anxiety through the roof. Now, we\u2019re seeing something of a craft renaissance: John Lewis\u2019s haberdashery sales have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/a-good-yarn-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-spawns-arts-and-craft-renaissance\">reported an online boost</a>, while Hobbycraft, that stalwart of the craft-industrial complex, has said the number of people visiting its website for crafting ideas has tripled since the lockdown began. For every sourdough starter, there\u2019s also a handmade face mask or a piece of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/tiger-king-reflects-our-world-back-to-us-one-run-by-megalomaniacs-and-amateurs\">Tiger King</a><em>-</em>inspired embroidery.</p> <p>It\u2019s not difficult to see why people turn to crafts in times of crisis. During a particularly potent spell of unemployment in my early 20s, I took to making little people out of tampons. It started when, unable to sleep one night, I gathered up all the \u201ccrafting\u201d materials I could find in my room (some felt tips and a box of Tampax) and turned five tampons into the Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. This was, it should be said, in the wake of the twee-core explosion of the late 2000s, when doing this sort of thing was considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/16/why-the-manic-pixie-dream-girl-must-never-return\">Zooey Deschanel-esque</a>, and therefore good.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My 'painting' looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until now, this was my last memorable episode of adult crafting. As a mild dyspraxic, I\u2019ve never been particularly good at anything involving fine motor skills. My movements are both frantic and indecisive, like a ham descending a staircase. The idea of me sitting down to embroider is about as reasonable as the idea of Donald Trump sitting down to read <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/feb/15/infinite-jest-at-20-still-a-challenge-still-brilliant-emma-lee-moss\">Infinite Jest</a>. But here I am holding something called an embroidery hoop. Having watched the same YouTube instructional video three times, I\u2019ve managed to fit said hoop with a piece of fabric bearing an intricate floral template.</p> <p>On opening up my embroidery kit (which, by the way, had a photo of a child on the packaging) I was nearly overcome by panic. The different coloured threads hung next to one another, on the same piece of card. There was a weird clippy tool I\u2019d never seen before. And one brief look at the instructions told me they\u2019d been run (possibly from Mandarin, going by some Chinese characters on the packaging) through Google translate, which only served to exacerbate my confusion. If it weren\u2019t for the glut of calming \u201chow to\u201d videos on embroidery (many of which have been uploaded over the past few weeks) I would\u2019ve been tempted to dump the entire kit in the bin and put the ordeal behind me before it had even started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90ded4d022c433d7da4503e6d6631bd67e8129f6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90ded4d022c433d7da4503e6d6631bd67e8129f6/15_0_5337_3204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eleanor Margolis not enjoying crafts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018After 10 minutes I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual routine of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonore Schick/Public Domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Admittedly, the first stitch I sew is quite satisfying. I use some of the green thread to make a start on a flower stem, and am frankly awed by my own ability. But before long, it dawns on me just how slow this process is: it has taken me about 15 minutes to do an inch of stem and one tiny leaf. My mind wanders. I\u2019m bored. Had I been born hundreds of years ago, I think to myself, this is probably what I would\u2019ve done (as a lesbian) to avoid contact with my rank, toothless, clap-infested husband. I would\u2019ve sat embroidering poorly by candlelight, thinking impure thoughts about wenches. Maybe this is why lesbians are so into crafting: it\u2019s a throwback to the days when they channelled all the sadness of forbidden desire into quietly subversive needlework.</p> <p>But having decided embroidery is emphatically not for me, I move onto modelling clay. Dyspraxic or not, I loved this stuff as a kid, and have warm memories of making animals, vegetables and minerals<strong> </strong>that inevitably fell apart in the oven. I roll out some balls and make colourful, abstract models. The polymer clay is satisfying to mould and play with, especially for someone given to nervous fidgeting. But after about 10 minutes, my hands feel dried out and achy, and I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual soothing activity of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/a-good-yarn-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-spawns-arts-and-craft-renaissance\">A good yarn: UK coronavirus lockdown spawns arts and craft renaissance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But I will myself to try one last craft. YouTube informs me that, using just cardboard toilet-paper rolls and paint, of which I happen to have both, I can make quite handsome little dandelion prints. Of all crafts I\u2019ve attempted, this seems by far the easiest. You just cut strips into the toilet roll, splay them out and use the end product as a kind of fat paint brush. You\u2019d have to be a mandrill to balls this up.</p> <p>Reader, I balls it up. There\u2019s green and orange paint (the only colours I have) everywhere. My \u201cpainting\u201d looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall. It\u2019s an unmitigated disaster. I stand up and look at my war zone of a table, strewn with paint, loose pieces of thread and multicoloured clay crumbs. I can\u2019t deal with this right now, I think to myself. I\u2019m too stressed. And for the endless \u201cbits and bobs\u201d that come with crafting, my lockdown household has become all the more claustrophobic.</p> <ul> <li><p>Eleanor Margolis is a columnist for the i newspaper and Diva.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Of all of the strange side effects of the pandemic, I suppose the craft boom was inevitable. The mindfulness industry (which goes hand in hand with sewing, knitting and the like) was already thriving before lockdown sent our levels of boredom and anxiety through the roof. Now, we\u2019re seeing something of a craft renaissance: John Lewis\u2019s haberdashery sales have reported an online boost, while Hobbycraft, that stalwart of the craft-industrial complex, has said the number of people visiting its website for crafting ideas has tripled since the lockdown began. For every sourdough starter, there\u2019s also a handmade face mask or a piece of Tiger King-inspired embroidery. It\u2019s not difficult to see why people turn to crafts in times of crisis. During a particularly potent spell of unemployment in my early 20s, I took to making little people out of tampons. It started when, unable to sleep one night, I gathered up all the \u201ccrafting\u201d materials I could find in my room (some felt tips and a box of Tampax) and turned five tampons into the Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. This was, it should be said, in the wake of the twee-core explosion of the late 2000s, when doing this sort of thing was considered Zooey Deschanel-esque, and therefore good. Until now, this was my last memorable episode of adult crafting. As a mild dyspraxic, I\u2019ve never been particularly good at anything involving fine motor skills. My movements are both frantic and indecisive, like a ham descending a staircase. The idea of me sitting down to embroider is about as reasonable as the idea of Donald Trump sitting down to read Infinite Jest. But here I am holding something called an embroidery hoop. Having watched the same YouTube instructional video three times, I\u2019ve managed to fit said hoop with a piece of fabric bearing an intricate floral template. On opening up my embroidery kit (which, by the way, had a photo of a child on the packaging) I was nearly overcome by panic. The different coloured threads hung next to one another, on the same piece of card. There was a weird clippy tool I\u2019d never seen before. And one brief look at the instructions told me they\u2019d been run (possibly from Mandarin, going by some Chinese characters on the packaging) through Google translate, which only served to exacerbate my confusion. If it weren\u2019t for the glut of calming \u201chow to\u201d videos on embroidery (many of which have been uploaded over the past few weeks) I would\u2019ve been tempted to dump the entire kit in the bin and put the ordeal behind me before it had even started. Admittedly, the first stitch I sew is quite satisfying. I use some of the green thread to make a start on a flower stem, and am frankly awed by my own ability. But before long, it dawns on me just how slow this process is: it has taken me about 15 minutes to do an inch of stem and one tiny leaf. My mind wanders. I\u2019m bored. Had I been born hundreds of years ago, I think to myself, this is probably what I would\u2019ve done (as a lesbian) to avoid contact with my rank, toothless, clap-infested husband. I would\u2019ve sat embroidering poorly by candlelight, thinking impure thoughts about wenches. Maybe this is why lesbians are so into crafting: it\u2019s a throwback to the days when they channelled all the sadness of forbidden desire into quietly subversive needlework. But having decided embroidery is emphatically not for me, I move onto modelling clay. Dyspraxic or not, I loved this stuff as a kid, and have warm memories of making animals, vegetables and minerals that inevitably fell apart in the oven. I roll out some balls and make colourful, abstract models. The polymer clay is satisfying to mould and play with, especially for someone given to nervous fidgeting. But after about 10 minutes, my hands feel dried out and achy, and I\u2019m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual soothing activity of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes. But I will myself to try one last craft. YouTube informs me that, using just cardboard toilet-paper rolls and paint, of which I happen to have both, I can make quite handsome little dandelion prints. Of all crafts I\u2019ve attempted, this seems by far the easiest. You just cut strips into the toilet roll, splay them out and use the end product as a kind of fat paint brush. You\u2019d have to be a mandrill to balls this up. Reader, I balls it up. There\u2019s green and orange paint (the only colours I have) everywhere. My \u201cpainting\u201d looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall. It\u2019s an unmitigated disaster. I stand up and look at my war zone of a table, strewn with paint, loose pieces of thread and multicoloured clay crumbs. I can\u2019t deal with this right now, I think to myself. I\u2019m too stressed. And for the endless \u201cbits and bobs\u201d that come with crafting, my lockdown household has become all the more claustrophobic.

About 40,000 people in the Isle of Wight have been trialling the app, designed by an arm of the NHS, which alerts users if they have been near to a suspected case of coronavirus. However, there has been intense speculation the UK could have to change its app to a \u201cdecentralised\u201d model favoured by Apple and Google, which stores data about movements on a user\u2019s phone rather than centrally in an anonymised form with the government. Amid reports of teething problems with the app, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, suggested changes could be on the way. \u201cWe are learning lessons from other apps and if we need to change our app we will do. That\u2019s the point of piloting it before we roll it out nationally,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. He denied the idea that there was already a second app being designed but indicated the government could change tack in future. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware we\u2019re not developing a second app but we are paying attention to the other apps that exist elsewhere in the world,\u201d he told Marr. \u201cAnd if we need to adapt our app or move to a different model, obviously we will do.\u201d MPs and privacy campaigners have repeatedly warned the UK will be an outlier if it insists on using its own centralised app rather than relying on Google and Apple\u2019s technology, claiming the lack of privacy and data protections could mean that the app would be illegal. With growing questions over that approach, it emerged last week that the Swiss-based consultancy Z\u00fchlke Engineering has been hired to undertake a two-week \u201ctechnical spike\u201d to investigate implementing Apple and Google\u2019s system \u201cwithin the existing proximity mobile application and platform\u201d. Z\u00fchlke has already been working on the contact-tracing app since March, documents published this week show, but a new outsourcing contract, first reported by the Financial Times and uncovered by public sector analysts Tussell, shows the government is seriously considering changing how the application works to overcome problems with its initial approach. Last week, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman left open the possibility that a change could be made, telling reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ve set out our plans for a centralised model and that\u2019s what we are taking forwards but we will keep all options under review to make sure the app is as effective as possible.\u201d The centralised model brings advantages in terms of useful insights into the spread of the disease, but also imposes technical limitations that the government has not been able to fully overcome.

The coronavirus pandemic, however, is an existential crisis unlike anything he has faced before. \u201cErdo\u011fan has gradually managed to reform Turkey\u2019s constitution, consolidating power into the presidency\u2019s hands,\u201d said Nate Schenkkan, the director for special research at Freedom House, a US-based democracy watchdog. \u201cWhen the country grapples with the economic fallout from coronavirus, there will be few scapegoats left to blame. He may become a victim of his own success.\u201d There is little doubt a major pandemic-induced financial crisis is about to hit Turkey. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that the country\u2019s economy will shrink by 5% for 2020, driving up inflation to 12% and unemployment to 17.2%. Some predictions paint an even grimmer picture in which unemployment could reach 30%. The Turkish lira dropped to a record low this week of nearly 7.27 to the dollar as central bank interest rate cuts intended to boost growth \u2013 as well as investor fears over Turkey\u2019s depleted foreign currency reserves \u2013 began to bite. In speeches, Erdo\u011fan has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of an IMF bailout, and comments from a US Federal Reserve official this week suggested a credit swap line to cushion the lira\u2019s fall will not be forthcoming. \u201cInformally, inflation in Turkey is already well above the official rate. Interest rate cuts mean the government is paving the way for new currency shocks and high inflation,\u201d said the economist Sel\u00e7uk Ge\u00e7er. \u201cTurkey was already completely broke when coronavirus hit. We are looking at a very deep and prolonged recession.\u201d Turkey is the seventh worst-affected country hit by Covid-19 with 137,115 cases and 3,739 deaths \u2013 although as is the case in many countries, the toll is probably underreported. Yet Erdo\u011fan, usually no stranger to heavy-handed tactics, has resisted calls to order people to stop going to work and stay home, insisting the \u201cwheels of the economy must keep turning\u201d. For the president, renewed economic turmoil could be a mortal blow: over the last two years the economy has become a major vulnerability for his ruling Justice and Development party (AKP). The lira crash of 2018 sent inflation soaring to 25% and triggered a recession \u2013 a sober end to years of an average of 5% economic growth which had buoyed Erdo\u011fan. Last year\u2019s local elections morphed into a referendum on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s handling of the crisis, and the AKP was duly punished. For the first time, the ruling party suffered humiliating defeats in several major cities, and the sense that the president has begun to lose his magic touch after 17 years in office was compounded by an embarrassing strategic miscalculation to rerun Istanbul\u2019s mayoral race. In the aftermath, both the former prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu and the former finance minister Ali Babacan quit to form their own breakaway opposition parties. While Turkey is not supposed to hold a general election until 2023, under the new presidential system opposition party alliances would only need to shave off a few percentage points from the ruling coalition to destroy the government\u2019s already weakened majority. Some observers believe last year\u2019s events show that Erdo\u011fan\u2019s political decline has already begun: the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will certainly give opposition groups the opportunity to strengthen their positions. If an election were held now, latest polling from the Istanbul Economics Research Centre says the AKP would lose 7% of its vote share \u2013 and that one in four AKP voters do not trust the coronavirus statistics released by the health ministry. When cornered, however, the Turkish government tends to lash out, and the Covid-19 crisis has been no exception. More than 400 people have been detained for allegedly sharing \u201cfalse and provocative\u201d social media posts over the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic, as well as several journalists. Rules came into force on Thursday that will also punish negative speculation by individuals or institutions over the health of Turkey\u2019s financial system. The removal of elected officials \u2013 mostly from the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic party (HDP) \u2013 has also continued apace. A year after the last round of local elections, 40 out of 65 municipalities won by the HDP are now under the control of government-appointed trustees. Like many people all over the world, most Turks are immediately worried about holding on to their livelihoods and a rise in the cost of living as the economic effects of the pandemic take hold. Arif, a restaurant owner in Istanbul\u2019s Beyo\u011flu district, has had to keep his business shut for the last seven weeks. On Thursday he was keeping busy by redecorating the premises. \u201cI have 13 workers, three of whom are part-time students.

Whatever the cultural breakthrough \u2013 man buns on scooters, cashless ukulele busking, emotional support bees \u2013 it takes a while to reach the Lancaster and Morecambe Non-Metropolitan Area. If it ever does. We watched as the Covid-19 horror chewed up London, just as London had watched it chew west through Europe. Old wheezers \u2013 eg yours truly \u2013 went into self-isolation early, but the local economy went late, then snapped shut. At the end of our street, the church, the chippy and the pie shop all closed. The pharmacy alone remained accessible, fulfilling some holy destiny: \u201cHa! Where are your carb gods now?\u201d A new local micro-pub with an infantile name (yeah London, we\u2019ve got THEM) opened then folded. One day: jammed full of punters transmitting respiratory bonhomie in the micro-atmosphere. The next: dark. Well, we\u2019ve finally caught up with The News: \u201cMore people are in hospital with coronavirus in the north-west of England than in London.\u201d That\u2019s just because the capital peaked earlier, like it did with house prices and halloumi burgers. Now we hear of an entirely new protocol anxiety, or fretiquette, when lockdown eases. Who will be invited into these key \u201csocial bubbles\u201d, as maximum gatherings of 10 people are being called? Well, there\u2019s a jacuzzi at our local sports centre but you\u2019d be hard pushed to get more than eight in it. Coronashun Street, my lockdown soapcom How I pity all those TV producers and commissioners who are right now ploughing through endless pitches for unique comedy programmes that \u201cacknowledge the lockdown reality AND explore its potential!\u201d Obviously, comedy writers live in a nuanced demimonde of deluded hope and pre-crushed disappointment, so here\u2019s a useful \u201cnote\u201d for my competitors. Give up, move on. I\u2019ve totally cracked it: Coronashun Street, a lockdown soapcom\u00a9 teeming with relatable characters. Mad Gran isolates in a treehouse at the end of the road, communicating via catapult. A socially distanced street choir touches the heart of the pope, gets on Classic FM and raises enough money to save the life of a tot. Zoom-crossed lovers tumble into a synced, tragicomic ketamine binge. A bitter feud simmers between a trapped adulterous scientific adviser and a deeply religious Iceland delivery guy. A sobbing pub landlord FaceTimes his former regulars at closing time, calling for last orders. A Street Stranger Watch leads to a death, possibly two, and the shocking appearance at midnight of all the street\u2019s original Victorian inhabitants. An IT consultant and her laptop swap memories, then the computer runs a diagnostic on the consultant and, uh-oh, she needs new \u201csoftware\u201d.

Despite becoming the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">worst-hit country</a> in Europe, Boris Johnson is enjoying the peak of his popularity curve, according to a latest <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/research/trust-2020-spring-update\">Edelman poll</a>. Moreover, in the last couple of days, this record death toll has often been pushed out of the front pages by other splashes (the likely relaxation of the lockdown or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/headlines-neil-ferguson-coronavirus-death-rate\">Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation</a>). Many Italians are wondering and asking me: \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA plague on both your houses!\u201d yelled Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet. As the UK correspondent for an Italian daily newspaper, my two \u201chouses\u201d are Italy and the UK, the two European nations most badly afflicted by Covid-19. I am aware that we are all exhausted by this experience, habituated to the rising count of fatalities.</p> <p>However, the reality remains stark. The silent majority of Italians, who constitute a sizeable community of about 700,000 people in the UK, are heartbroken that the British people are<strong> </strong>suffering the same fate as their home country. A small but loud minority of Italians on social media castigate the \u201creluctance\u201d and \u201cnaivety\u201d of Johnson and the British government when it came to containing the pandemic, despite having watched the Covid-19 hell unfold in Italy many weeks before. Some haven\u2019t forgotten the remarks of a few eminent British commentators who, at the very beginning of the coronavirus crisis, hinted at some sort of \u201ctypical Italian\u201d mismanagement.</p> <p>Two events in particular in the UK truly shocked Italians. First, Johnson\u2019s chilling warning in early March that many more British families would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\">\u201close </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\">loved ones\u201d</a>. For them, it was inconceivable that a leader would say this, as though the government had already given up in their effort to save lives.</p> <p>Second, and even worse, were the remarks by the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, suggesting that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/herd-immunity-will-the-uks-coronavirus-strategy-work\">herd immunity</a>\u201d might be desirable. Many in Italy reacted with a deep sense of outrage. It was as if the \u201csacrifice\u201d they had made by being first in Europe to fall to the virus had been ignored; it had resulted in no lessons for the UK. </p> <p>When a lockdown was eventually enforced in the UK, many Italians I spoke to couldn\u2019t understand why we in Britain were allowed to jog, go for a walk or simply leave home without showing papers to the police: \u201cYou\u2019re nuts, just stay home!\u201d has been a fairly frequent reaction. Italy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/anger-as-italy-slowly-emerges-from-long-covid-19-lockdown\">slightly relaxed its firm lockdown</a> on 4 May. Police checkpoints were \u2013 actually still are \u2013 everywhere and thousands who breached the rules have been subjected to criminal charges. When Britain recently became the country with the worst coronavirus death toll in Europe, many Italians grieved in shock. To others it was only to be expected given the UK\u2019s \u201csofter\u201d lockdown.</p> <p>Since Johnson\u2019s infamous \u201cloved ones\u201d conference, at least <a href=\"https://rep.repubblica.it/pwa/generale/2020/05/02/news/coronavirus_londra_stranieri-255505314/\">30,000 Italians have left the UK</a> to go back to their home country, according to an official at the Italian embassy in London. Based on my conversations with people, this trend seems to have peaked after the death of a \u201cvery healthy\u201d 19-year-old Italian chef, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52115265\">Luca Di Nicola</a>, from coronavirus in London. The initially soft Covid-19 approach of the UK government generated a great deal of fear among Italians,<strong> </strong>and they decided it made more sense to leave.

      "bodyText": "CNN and the Sydney Morning Herald ask: \u201cWhere did it go wrong for the UK on coronavirus?\u201d Reuters investigates why the UK left \u201cits weakest exposed\u201d in care homes. My own newspaper, La Repubblica, acknowledged the \u201cgrave errors\u201d made in Italy, but observed that the \u201cconfusion and contradictions displayed by the British government in the past few months have few equals\u201d. The way the world is looking at the UK is not the way the UK is looking at itself. Despite becoming the worst-hit country in Europe, Boris Johnson is enjoying the peak of his popularity curve, according to a latest Edelman poll. Moreover, in the last couple of days, this record death toll has often been pushed out of the front pages by other splashes (the likely relaxation of the lockdown or Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation). Many Italians are wondering and asking me: \u201cHow is this possible?\u201d \u201cA plague on both your houses!\u201d yelled Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet. As the UK correspondent for an Italian daily newspaper, my two \u201chouses\u201d are Italy and the UK, the two European nations most badly afflicted by Covid-19. I am aware that we are all exhausted by this experience, habituated to the rising count of fatalities. However, the reality remains stark. The silent majority of Italians, who constitute a sizeable community of about 700,000 people in the UK, are heartbroken that the British people are suffering the same fate as their home country. A small but loud minority of Italians on social media castigate the \u201creluctance\u201d and \u201cnaivety\u201d of Johnson and the British government when it came to containing the pandemic, despite having watched the Covid-19 hell unfold in Italy many weeks before. Some haven\u2019t forgotten the remarks of a few eminent British commentators who, at the very beginning of the coronavirus crisis, hinted at some sort of \u201ctypical Italian\u201d mismanagement. Two events in particular in the UK truly shocked Italians. First, Johnson\u2019s chilling warning in early March that many more British families would \u201close loved ones\u201d. For them, it was inconceivable that a leader would say this, as though the government had already given up in their effort to save lives. Second, and even worse, were the remarks by the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, suggesting that \u201cherd immunity\u201d might be desirable. Many in Italy reacted with a deep sense of outrage. It was as if the \u201csacrifice\u201d they had made by being first in Europe to fall to the virus had been ignored; it had resulted in no lessons for the UK. When a lockdown was eventually enforced in the UK, many Italians I spoke to couldn\u2019t understand why we in Britain were allowed to jog, go for a walk or simply leave home without showing papers to the police: \u201cYou\u2019re nuts, just stay home!\u201d has been a fairly frequent reaction. Italy slightly relaxed its firm lockdown on 4 May. Police checkpoints were \u2013 actually still are \u2013 everywhere and thousands who breached the rules have been subjected to criminal charges. When Britain recently became the country with the worst coronavirus death toll in Europe, many Italians grieved in shock. To others it was only to be expected given the UK\u2019s \u201csofter\u201d lockdown. Since Johnson\u2019s infamous \u201cloved ones\u201d conference, at least 30,000 Italians have left the UK to go back to their home country, according to an official at the Italian embassy in London. Based on my conversations with people, this trend seems to have peaked after the death of a \u201cvery healthy\u201d 19-year-old Italian chef, Luca Di Nicola, from coronavirus in London. The initially soft Covid-19 approach of the UK government generated a great deal of fear among Italians, and they decided it made more sense to leave. Just like the Brits, Italians are enormously proud of their national healthcare system, which, not surprisingly, was explicitly mentioned by Johnson \u2013 when his U-turn was imminent \u2013 as an example of an excellent healthcare system unable to cope with the waves of victims from an unrestricted pandemic. Of course, every country has made their own mistakes against this invisible enemy. Italy made huge ones. Yet many in Italy are still wondering why the UK didn\u2019t act immediately against Covid-19 after the immense suffering in southern Europe. This has now generated a sort of general scepticism and distrust toward the British authorities among Italian citizens \u2013 something hardly helped by the bad feeling already caused by Brexit. On top of that, it\u2019s likely that the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the economy won\u2019t help to keep the country \u2013 and its immigrants \u2013 together. In Italy there is an ongoing and intense debate on the question of whether we are going to be better or worse human beings when this whole mess is behind us. In Britain as in Italy, the answer is still unknown. \u2022 Antonello Guerrera is the UK correspondent for La Repubblica",

We should all be careful, or we\u2019ll be going straight back into lockdown.\u201d Annie Poquelin, 71, said: \u201cOf course everything has to start up again \u2026 but look, the masks, the hand gel, shop assistants behind screens. It\u2019s not like before, is it?\u201d The French government has insisted the return to normal will be \u201cprogressive\u201d and ministers have repeatedly urged the population to maintain social distancing and barrier measures. Last week, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, called on the population to abide by the \u201cspirit\u201d of new regulations, which ban anyone travelling more than 100km outside their d\u00e9partment without a \u201ccompelling reason\u201d. However, in Pont-L\u2019\u00c9veque in Normandy, where many city-dwellers have second homes, locals complained Parisians were already breaking the travel rules. \u201cThe areas around Pont-L\u2019\u00c9veque have suddenly become inundated with Parisian number plates. Second homes that were closed up are now all opened and the village is teeming,\u201d one local said. \u201cPreviously we have seen gendarmes at tolls issue fines, turning people around and sending them back \u2026 now friends are seeing Parisians wandering around all over the place.\u201d He added: \u201cWith the new clusters breaking out and the insufferable arrogance of many Parisians, I fear we will shortly be changing colour [from green to red].\u201d The person, who did not want to be named, said an elderly couple contracted Covid-19 after a family from Paris \u201cnipped down for an illegal weekend\u201d and asked the local woman to do some cleaning. After two new clusters emerged in the Dordogne and the Vienne d\u00e9partments, officials insisted the country must not lower its guard against the virus. One outbreak in the Dordogne was traced back to the funeral of a 51-year-old man in the small village of L\u2019Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt \u2013 population 500 \u2013 south of P\u00e9rigueux. While only 20 people were invited, dozens more turned turned up to the cemetery and wake, some from Switzerland and Portugal from where the dead man originated. After one person present complained of Covid-19 symptoms, the regional health agency identified, traced and tested a total of 127 people; so far nine have tested positive. The results of 63 tests are still not known. Local prefect Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric P\u00e9rissat said the cluster was an \u201cillustration of what we are hoping not to live through in the next few weeks\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a slackening off, people gather in a group of 20 or 30 and one person contaminates others,\u201d P\u00e9rissat said at a press conference. A second cluster was reported at a secondary school in Vienne in south-west France, where four people tested positive after a staff meeting to prepare for the reopening of classes on 18 May. The school is delaying reopening until 27 May. The French lockdown began at midday on 17 March. \u2022 The graphic in this article was amended on 11 May 2020 to correct the information about the Netherlands, where cinemas, cafes and restaurants remain closed for now; and to clarify that all shops selling essential items in Belgium are open.",

Speaking at the government\u2019s daily press briefing on Saturday, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said day-to-day variations in testing were to be expected, and testing was at much higher levels than when the outbreak began.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are now really at a high plateau, in the region of 100,000 tests per day,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>While testing of patients in medical need is primarily conducted in Public Health England and NHS laboratories, as well as some testing of NHS staff, the Lighthouse \u201cmega labs\u201d are involved in wider testing of key workers, including testing of samples from drive-through sites. However this split varies depending on location.</p> \n<p>Nicola Stonehouse, professor in molecular virology at the University of Leeds, who has research staff and students working in the Lighthouse laboratories, praised those working in the facilities,adding the labs were still increasing their capacity and efficiency. </p> \n<p>But, she said, there were challenges. \u201cThings are not running fully up to capacity, and I think there are still issues with the samples coming in, not necessarily being suitable and compatible with the automated equipment that they have got,\u201d Stonehouse said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat means that therefore if things are not compatible, if the samples have not been produced in the right sort of way, then you have got to have a lot more human intervention \u2013 people have got to be involved with repackaging those samples, re-labelling those samples etc, and that obviously takes time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stonehouse said questions remained about how the Lighthouse system worked, and what the tendering process involved.</p> \n<p>\u201cCertainly the [Lighthouse] lab at Alderley Park [in Cheshire] and the lab at Milton Keynes do not seem to be working in the same way, they don\u2019t have the same processes,\u201d she said, although she said that did not mean there was anything wrong with how they were conducting the tests.</p> \n<p>But, she said, the news that the UK was sending samples to the US was puzzling.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is if there were problems at one Lighthouse lab, why they didn\u2019t send samples to another Lighthouse lab, or to some of the NHS labs ,\u201d she said. \u201cThe individual Lighthouse labs to my understanding do not seem to be in contact and working as a unit: they seem to be working as separate, different labs and that doesn\u2019t seem to me to be a very logical thing to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Allan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science \u2013 a professional body with many members working in NHS labs \u2013 expressed frustration at the Lighthouse labs, noting they had little NHS involvement.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much of a feel for what happens in these labs, they have kept themselves very distant from the NHS labs, so we don\u2019t know what happens in them,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Wilson believes the situation would be more transparent if the NHS was closely involved in the Lighthouse labs.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe can\u2019t get information about what testing they are doing and how they are doing the testing because it is very much a closed shop and the staff there haven\u2019t been allowed to speak to the public about what they are doing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said it was important to know the context of the tests sent to the US, for example whether they were urgent samples from patients in hospital, or tests among key workers to see if they can go back to work.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe point is we can\u2019t answer those questions about why the tests are being processed in that way, unless we know what the need is and what sort of samples they are,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout knowing why the tests were taken it just adds to the chaos and confusion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Edwards said sending samples to the US could be a cheap and quick way of clearing a backlog. He also noted that it was difficult to scale up testing, and that it was \u201cunfair\u201d to expect it to be a normal, everyday, working system.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>But he said the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/100000-tests-results-coronavirus-self-isolation\">challenges w</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/100000-tests-results-coronavirus-self-isolation\">ould increase</a> once <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">cont</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">act tracing</a> was added into the equation.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf it is hard setting up just raw testing capacity, it has got to be even harder to set up testing capacity linked to a track-and-trace service,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/uk-contact-tracing-plans-an-nhs-app-and-an-army-of-health-staff\">NHS app, testing and contact-tracing: how will the UK's coronavirus plan work?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Prof Gordon Dougan of Cambridge University found it hard to believe that the UK was having to resort to sending samples overseas, adding that local and rapid testing was vital \u2013 particularly as the country moved out of lockdown.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the disadvantages of remote-testing centres is speed and logistics,\u201d he said. \u201cSending samples over distance can be logistically challenging and the sample has to pass through many hands before the information gets back to the point of origin where it is needed \u2013 the tested individual. The UK Lighthouse centres are a great effort on the part of those setting up tests and they have my complete support but I can see no obvious logic in sending samples overseas.

Speaking at the government\u2019s daily press briefing on Saturday, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said day-to-day variations in testing were to be expected, and testing was at much higher levels than when the outbreak began. \u201cWe are now really at a high plateau, in the region of 100,000 tests per day,\u201d he said. While testing of patients in medical need is primarily conducted in Public Health England and NHS laboratories, as well as some testing of NHS staff, the Lighthouse \u201cmega labs\u201d are involved in wider testing of key workers, including testing of samples from drive-through sites. However this split varies depending on location. Nicola Stonehouse, professor in molecular virology at the University of Leeds, who has research staff and students working in the Lighthouse laboratories, praised those working in the facilities,adding the labs were still increasing their capacity and efficiency. But, she said, there were challenges. \u201cThings are not running fully up to capacity, and I think there are still issues with the samples coming in, not necessarily being suitable and compatible with the automated equipment that they have got,\u201d Stonehouse said. \u201cThat means that therefore if things are not compatible, if the samples have not been produced in the right sort of way, then you have got to have a lot more human intervention \u2013 people have got to be involved with repackaging those samples, re-labelling those samples etc, and that obviously takes time.\u201d Stonehouse said questions remained about how the Lighthouse system worked, and what the tendering process involved. \u201cCertainly the [Lighthouse] lab at Alderley Park [in Cheshire] and the lab at Milton Keynes do not seem to be working in the same way, they don\u2019t have the same processes,\u201d she said, although she said that did not mean there was anything wrong with how they were conducting the tests. But, she said, the news that the UK was sending samples to the US was puzzling. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand is if there were problems at one Lighthouse lab, why they didn\u2019t send samples to another Lighthouse lab, or to some of the NHS labs ,\u201d she said. \u201cThe individual Lighthouse labs to my understanding do not seem to be in contact and working as a unit: they seem to be working as separate, different labs and that doesn\u2019t seem to me to be a very logical thing to do.\u201d Allan Wilson, the president of the Institute of Biomedical Science \u2013 a professional body with many members working in NHS labs \u2013 expressed frustration at the Lighthouse labs, noting they had little NHS involvement. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much of a feel for what happens in these labs, they have kept themselves very distant from the NHS labs, so we don\u2019t know what happens in them,\u201d he said. Wilson believes the situation would be more transparent if the NHS was closely involved in the Lighthouse labs. He said: \u201cWe can\u2019t get information about what testing they are doing and how they are doing the testing because it is very much a closed shop and the staff there haven\u2019t been allowed to speak to the public about what they are doing.\u201d Dr Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said it was important to know the context of the tests sent to the US, for example whether they were urgent samples from patients in hospital, or tests among key workers to see if they can go back to work. \u201cThe point is we can\u2019t answer those questions about why the tests are being processed in that way, unless we know what the need is and what sort of samples they are,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout knowing why the tests were taken it just adds to the chaos and confusion.\u201d Edwards said sending samples to the US could be a cheap and quick way of clearing a backlog. He also noted that it was difficult to scale up testing, and that it was \u201cunfair\u201d to expect it to be a normal, everyday, working system. But he said the challenges would increase once contact tracing was added into the equation. \u201cIf it is hard setting up just raw testing capacity, it has got to be even harder to set up testing capacity linked to a track-and-trace service,\u201d he said. Prof Gordon Dougan of Cambridge University found it hard to believe that the UK was having to resort to sending samples overseas, adding that local and rapid testing was vital \u2013 particularly as the country moved out of lockdown. \u201cOne of the disadvantages of remote-testing centres is speed and logistics,\u201d he said. \u201cSending samples over distance can be logistically challenging and the sample has to pass through many hands before the information gets back to the point of origin where it is needed \u2013 the tested individual. The UK Lighthouse centres are a great effort on the part of those setting up tests and they have my complete support but I can see no obvious logic in sending samples overseas. Indeed, I find it hard to believe we are actually having to do this.\u201d But while Dougan said the local testing centre in Cambridge set up by his team had already tested more than 3,000 healthcare workers in Cambridge University hospitals, establishing similar centres as part of a wider effort would be difficult. \u201cWe need to translate this type of effort into the community but the logistics of retrospectively setting up a system like this when we have neglected the infrastructure over the years is challenging, to say the least,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s something profound about the irony. The world\u2019s highest coronavirus death tolls belong to two countries whose leaders came to power promising the restoration of greatness and control \u2013 the United States and Great Britain. Neither can claim to have been caught by surprise: both nations had the benefit of time, ample scientific warnings, and the cautionary examples of China and Italy.</p> <p>The similarities are striking, the conclusions unavoidable. Here in the UK, we comforted ourselves with the belief that while our own buffoonish rightwing leader had his faults, at least he was no Donald Trump. But in the end, Boris Johnson has managed to stumble over even this lowest of hurdles. The UK government\u2019s response to the crisis has turned out to be nearly as flippant and ill-prepared as the US\u2019s.</p> <p>Two nations that prided themselves on their extraordinary economic, historical and political status have been brought to their knees. Their fall from grace is the outcome of a damaged political culture and distinct form of Anglo-American capitalism.</p> <p>Over the past four years, reckless political decisions were justified by subordinating reality to rhetoric. The cost of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/06/donald-tusk-special-place-hell-brexit-promoters-most-likely-burn\">leaving the EU</a> would be \u201cvirtually nil\u201d, with a free trade agreement that would be one of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/20/liam-fox-uk-eu-trade-deal-after-brexit-easiest-human-history\">easiest in human history</a>\u201d. Imaginary enemies were erected and fake fights confected as both countries pugnaciously went about severing their ties with other nations and international institutions.</p> <p>Political discourse focused on grand abstract notions of rebirth and restoration, in a way that required few concrete deliverables. All the Tory government needed to do was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/nov/06/boris-johnson-pledges-to-get-brexit-done-within-weeks-of-re-election-video\">Get Brexit Done</a>, no matter how slapdash the job. In the US, all Trump needed to do to maintain his supporters\u2019 loyalty was bark about a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/construction-us-mexico-border-wall-coronavirus-pandemic\">wall with Mexico</a> every now and then, pass a racist travel ban, and savage various public figures for sport.</p> <p>This is corrosive stuff \u2013 not only to the quality of public debate, but to the calibre of politicians. When the business of government becomes limited to populist set pieces, its ranks are purged of doers and populated instead with cheerleaders. This is how we ended up with the current cast of dazed-in-headlights Tory cabinet members. In the US, the very notion of an \u201cadministration\u201d has been worn away. As the New York University journalism professor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrosen_nyu/status/1174409846961168387?lang=en\">Jay Rosen puts it</a>, \u201cThere is no White House. Not in the sense that journalists have always used that term. It\u2019s just Trump \u2013 and people who work in the building.\u201d</p> <p>By the time Covid-19 hit their shores, the UK and US were lacking not just the politicians but the bureaucracies required to respond effectively. Prior to the crisis, Trump repeatedly attempted to defund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the UK, the pandemic inconvenienced a Tory cabinet embroiled in a feud with its own civil service. The intellectual and practical infrastructure to deal with facts had been vandalised.</p> <p>But there is a longer, non-partisan history that rendered both nations incapable of an adequate response to the pandemic. The special relationship is not just one of linguistic and cultural proximity, but an ideological partnership forged in the post-second world war era. Anglo-American capitalism, pursued by both right and centre-left parties, rooted in small government and powered by exceptionalism, had dismantled the state. No notice or warning could have refashioned the machinery of government quickly enough to save lives. An economic and political model that hinges on privatisation, liberalisation and the withdrawal of labour rights created a system prone to regular crises, despite such shocks being framed as one-offs.</p> <p>The economic and regulatory kinship<strong> </strong>was strengthened by the transformation of Britain\u2019s quaint and mercantile financial sector into a replica of the US\u2019s aggressive markets. The City caught up with Wall Street.</p> <p>An interventionist foreign policy \u2013 publicly moralistic but privately cynical \u2013 gave the model an expansionist edge, which helped both nations project power abroad and defend their own financial and political interests. But the wars led to quagmires, and the rapidly expanding financial sectors to economic near-death experiences. Neither triggered significant rethinking or reflection. After the 2008 financial crisis, when this system came within \u201c48 hours\u201d of the \u201capocalypse\u201d, two centre-left leaders, Barack Obama and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/feb/21/gordon-brown-saved-banks\">Gordon Brown</a>, chose to shore up the infrastructure that had brought their economies to the brink, recapitalising the banks and revitalising the markets, opting for more regulation rather than fundamental reform.</p> <p>Just as the financial crash was treated as the malfunctioning of a particular unsupervised bug in the system rather than as a feature of it, so is the failure to grapple with the pandemic being cast as an unforeseen, exogenous event, rather than a result of an ideology that enables the state to scramble unprecedented resources to save banks but not lives. A nurse will wear a bin liner as PPE in the US for longer than a failing bank can go unfinanced.</p> <p>Hollow triumphalism about making America great again and Britain taking back control becomes more and more likely in such a system. Trump and the Tories alighted on this formula not entirely out of mendacity or ideology. Without radically challenging Anglo-American capitalism, they have nothing else to offer their voters. And so they must separate economic suffering from politics, and attempt to blame it on immigrants and outsiders. They must blame other countries and international institutions \u2013 the EU, WHO, Nato \u2013 for the feelings of helplessness experienced by their own citizens. The swagger is a facade.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s something profound about the irony. The world\u2019s highest coronavirus death tolls belong to two countries whose leaders came to power promising the restoration of greatness and control \u2013 the United States and Great Britain. Neither can claim to have been caught by surprise: both nations had the benefit of time, ample scientific warnings, and the cautionary examples of China and Italy. The similarities are striking, the conclusions unavoidable. Here in the UK, we comforted ourselves with the belief that while our own buffoonish rightwing leader had his faults, at least he was no Donald Trump. But in the end, Boris Johnson has managed to stumble over even this lowest of hurdles. The UK government\u2019s response to the crisis has turned out to be nearly as flippant and ill-prepared as the US\u2019s. Two nations that prided themselves on their extraordinary economic, historical and political status have been brought to their knees. Their fall from grace is the outcome of a damaged political culture and distinct form of Anglo-American capitalism. Over the past four years, reckless political decisions were justified by subordinating reality to rhetoric. The cost of leaving the EU would be \u201cvirtually nil\u201d, with a free trade agreement that would be one of the \u201ceasiest in human history\u201d. Imaginary enemies were erected and fake fights confected as both countries pugnaciously went about severing their ties with other nations and international institutions. Political discourse focused on grand abstract notions of rebirth and restoration, in a way that required few concrete deliverables. All the Tory government needed to do was Get Brexit Done, no matter how slapdash the job. In the US, all Trump needed to do to maintain his supporters\u2019 loyalty was bark about a wall with Mexico every now and then, pass a racist travel ban, and savage various public figures for sport. This is corrosive stuff \u2013 not only to the quality of public debate, but to the calibre of politicians. When the business of government becomes limited to populist set pieces, its ranks are purged of doers and populated instead with cheerleaders. This is how we ended up with the current cast of dazed-in-headlights Tory cabinet members. In the US, the very notion of an \u201cadministration\u201d has been worn away. As the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen puts it, \u201cThere is no White House. Not in the sense that journalists have always used that term. It\u2019s just Trump \u2013 and people who work in the building.\u201d By the time Covid-19 hit their shores, the UK and US were lacking not just the politicians but the bureaucracies required to respond effectively. Prior to the crisis, Trump repeatedly attempted to defund the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the UK, the pandemic inconvenienced a Tory cabinet embroiled in a feud with its own civil service. The intellectual and practical infrastructure to deal with facts had been vandalised. But there is a longer, non-partisan history that rendered both nations incapable of an adequate response to the pandemic. The special relationship is not just one of linguistic and cultural proximity, but an ideological partnership forged in the post-second world war era. Anglo-American capitalism, pursued by both right and centre-left parties, rooted in small government and powered by exceptionalism, had dismantled the state. No notice or warning could have refashioned the machinery of government quickly enough to save lives. An economic and political model that hinges on privatisation, liberalisation and the withdrawal of labour rights created a system prone to regular crises, despite such shocks being framed as one-offs. The economic and regulatory kinship was strengthened by the transformation of Britain\u2019s quaint and mercantile financial sector into a replica of the US\u2019s aggressive markets. The City caught up with Wall Street. An interventionist foreign policy \u2013 publicly moralistic but privately cynical \u2013 gave the model an expansionist edge, which helped both nations project power abroad and defend their own financial and political interests. But the wars led to quagmires, and the rapidly expanding financial sectors to economic near-death experiences. Neither triggered significant rethinking or reflection. After the 2008 financial crisis, when this system came within \u201c48 hours\u201d of the \u201capocalypse\u201d, two centre-left leaders, Barack Obama and Gordon Brown, chose to shore up the infrastructure that had brought their economies to the brink, recapitalising the banks and revitalising the markets, opting for more regulation rather than fundamental reform. Just as the financial crash was treated as the malfunctioning of a particular unsupervised bug in the system rather than as a feature of it, so is the failure to grapple with the pandemic being cast as an unforeseen, exogenous event, rather than a result of an ideology that enables the state to scramble unprecedented resources to save banks but not lives. A nurse will wear a bin liner as PPE in the US for longer than a failing bank can go unfinanced. Hollow triumphalism about making America great again and Britain taking back control becomes more and more likely in such a system. Trump and the Tories alighted on this formula not entirely out of mendacity or ideology. Without radically challenging Anglo-American capitalism, they have nothing else to offer their voters. And so they must separate economic suffering from politics, and attempt to blame it on immigrants and outsiders. They must blame other countries and international institutions \u2013 the EU, WHO, Nato \u2013 for the feelings of helplessness experienced by their own citizens. The swagger is a facade. Behind it hides a rotting national landscape. As the bodies pile up, the failure of the US and the UK will be somehow spun into victory. The triumphalism will intensify; that is certain. The only question now is how many will continue to believe it. \u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The words of Paula Leibowitz, an Australian education worker and mother of three, will be hauntingly familiar to parents trying to weather the pandemic, keep on top of their jobs and, most challenging of all, ensure their offspring carry on learning while schools are closed. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty tiring,\u201d says Leibowitz, who lives in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the schoolwork, it\u2019s the intensity of the ongoing interaction.\u201d She has long since learned to pick her battles: English and maths classes are non-negotiable, but Leibowitz knows that reality and sanity tend to prevail over ambition when it comes to other classes. \u201cEvery parent you speak to has a totally different perspective and it differs from day to day,\u201d she adds. \u201cSome days are really good and others you have to give it up by 11am.\u201d The story is the same in Italy \u2013 the first European country to close its schools \u2013 as parents and children attempt to navigate the choppy waters of the new educational normality. \u201cBy staying at home, every day, without physical contact with teachers and classmates, my six-year-old daughter, who is a good schoolgirl, has developed a real intolerance towards studying,\u2019\u2019 says Paola Anzalone, a security worker from Agrigento in Sicily. \u201cShe is a shy girl and it is difficult for her to interact with the rest of the class via a monitor while everyone is talking at the same time.\u201d The idea of home schooling until September terrifies Anzalone \u2013 \u201cnot only because I am a mother of two, with a job to combine with home schooling, but also because I believe that at that age children need physical contact with school and their classmates\u201d. A challenge for teachers Annalisa Distasi, from Orvieto in Italy, is trying to ensure that her three children do their remote classes while also fulfilling her duties as a high school teacher. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own lessons with my students and at the moment I\u2019m doing six live lessons a week, but I also do other work, such as recording video lessons, preparing homework, which takes up most of my days,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just feels like the amount of work is twice as much as it used to be and my routine has completely gone as I work until late at night.\u201d As Distasi points out, teachers are also having to adapt \u2013 and fast. Bulgaria announced a state of emergency on Friday 13 March, ordering the immediate closure of educational establishments and many businesses. In a country whose conservative and hierarchical educational system means that teachers rarely deviate from the decrees of the education ministry, the order triggered a weekend of hectic preparations. Despite the fact that half of Bulgaria\u2019s teachers are over 50 \u2013 and that its digital literacy rates lag behind the EU average \u2013 staff have adapted well. Over that weekend, teachers and students self-organised wherever they could online, mostly using Viber and WhatsApp chatrooms, as well as closed Facebook groups. By Monday 16 March, they had launched their distance learning processes on whatever platforms they were already familiar with or had managed to learn overnight. Bozhidara Ilieva, an ICT teacher in Plovdiv, Bulgaria\u2019s second city, has been delighted at the rapid progress her colleagues have made. She says that while older teachers had undergone digital training, many had been reluctant to use their skills \u2013 until now. \u201cThere was a huge leap overnight \u2013 from writing notes on a piece of paper in the staffroom to sending emails!\u201d Old inequalities resurface during the crisis The transition to online schooling, however, has not been seamless, nor fully inclusive. In Bulgaria, as elsewhere, the pandemic has exposed enduring socio-economic divides. The country\u2019s education minister admitted a month after the transition that 11% of students \u2013 mostly from the underprivileged Roma minority \u2013 were not covered by online learning and their teachers and mediators had to work with them over the phone and in person. Financial differences also translate into digital differences. Over the years, Italian governments have carried out substantial cuts in education and the country spends a lot less on the sector than almost every other western country. Although the government and many associations have used their resources to provide the most disadvantaged students with tablets and free connections, home schooling in the country has inevitably exacerbated social inequalities, especially in the poorer south. \u201cThose who have capable parents, equipped with means, such as tablets or computers, have an advantage,\u2019\u2019 says Arianna Filippone, an elementary school teacher in Palermo. \u201cThose who are not lucky enough to have these resources are clearly more disadvantaged. Even today, almost two months after the school closures, authorities are still trying to figure out if there are students without tablets or an internet connection.\u201d In Spain, the Red Cross is not just feeding the hungry and sheltering the homeless; it is also handing out thousands of tablet computers and 3G cards to families so that their children can carry on learning. \u201cWe knew who some of the people who would need help were, but we\u2019ve also had to innovate as we came across new groups,\u201d says Mois\u00e9s Ben\u00edtez, national organisational development manager for the Spanish Red Cross. Meanwhile, the regional government of Madrid has been criticised for contracting fast food companies to feed children eligible for free school meals. In the US, the epidemic has also exposed deep disparities between privately funded schools and public school districts, many of which have struggled to provide a long-term solution for teaching outside the classroom. In Fairfax County, which serves nearly 200,000 students in northern Virginia, the first video instructions were introduced four weeks after schools were ordered shut, and were categorically dismissed as a \u201cdisaster\u201d when they were rolled out. Erika, a mother of two, said the failure was like the \u201cwild west\u201d, with kids waiting 40 minutes to log on to their class sites, which teachers themselves could not always access. While it is rated one of the best school districts in the US, Erika reckons that her kids are getting about one hour of engagement with teachers each week. Towards a different educational future Earlier this week, Spain\u2019s education minister said schools may need to operate at half capacity if a coronavirus vaccine has not been found by the time classes resume in September. The other half of students would have to carry on with computer-based distance learning. The reopening of schools in France is turning into a headache for the authorities and exacerbating the existing uncertainty for parents. The president has decided that schools will reopen \u201cprogressively\u201d to rescue the 5%-10% of pupils in difficult learning and social circumstances who risk dropping out of the education system altogether, and to allow more parents back to work. However, the decision on which schools open and where has been delegated to local authorities.

      "bodyText": "New coronavirus infections rose again in Germany at the end of last week, a few days after leaders loosened social restrictions, while the Chinese city of Wuhan announced it had detected its first case in weeks, helping to push the global total past 4m on Sunday. On the eve of the UK starting to ease its lockdown on Monday, the new cases in Germany and China illustrated the difficulties governments will face over the next months as they attempt to reopen their societies without triggering a second wave of infections. France, which also plans to begin easing its tough seven-week lockdown from Monday, announced the discovery of a cluster of at least nine cases linked to a funeral in Dordogne in the south-west of the country. A local prefect, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Perissat, said the cluster was \u201can illustration of what we are hoping not to live through in the next few weeks \u2026 There\u2019s a slackening off, people gather in a group of 20 or 30 and one person contaminates others.\u201d South Korea also warned of a resurgence of Covid-19 on Sunday as infections rebounded to a one-month high as restrictions were starting to be eased. \u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over,\u201d the president, Moon Jae-in, said as he cautioned about a potential second wave of the virus later in the year. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported 34 new infections, the highest since 9 April, after a small outbreak emerged around a number of nightclubs. The authorities promptly closed all night spots around the capital temporarily. The country is examining whether it will reopen schools in stages starting from Wednesday as it had planned, the health minister, Park Neung-hoo, said. China reported 14 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest number since 28 April, including the first in five weeks in the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected late last year.

New cases have since grown from 802 in early May to double that over the weekend, taking the total number of confirmed infections beyond 107,000. Lebanon has reinstated some restrictions after its caseload grew again over the weekend, after falling to zero at the beginning of last week. \u201cThe situation is getting worse,\u201d the country\u2019s interior ministry said in a statement announcing a curfew that had been pushed to 9pm would be brought forward by two hours. It cited a \u201clack of commitment of many citizens to preventive and public safety measures, and due to the selfishness, disregard and indifference to their health and the health of their communities\u201d. Singapore announced another 876 new infections on Sunday, taking the city-state\u2019s total to 23,336.

Djibouti, the tiny Horn of Africa nation with the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent per capita, reversed plans to begin lifting lockdown measures this week, saying it was premature. \u201cThe government, through the voice of the prime minister, has decided to extend the confinement for another week until 17 May,\u201d the foreign minister, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, said in a Twitter post. \u201cNoting that the prerequisite conditions are not yet in place, the government made this decision just now,\u201d he said. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said Djibouti has the highest number of cases in Africa relative to its population, though its testing has also outpaced many of its neighbours. Lockdown measures in the country have been largely ignored, with large crowds still common in the capital city. Agencies contributed to this report \u2022 The graphic in this article was amended on 11 May 2020 to correct the information about the Netherlands, where cinemas, cafes and restaurants remain closed for now; and to clarify that all shops selling essential items in Belgium are open.",

If you want to go for a walk more often, or to go for a run and also a walk later on in the day then you can now do so,\u201d she said, adding that the relaxation would not apply to \u201csunbathing, picnics or barbecues\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re allowed to exercise more than once is definitely not a licence to start meeting up in groups at the park or at the beach,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing that really does risk spreading this virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>The advice is likely to be the same for the rest of the UK, but Sturgeon was extremely critical of the government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d message. The leaders of Wales and Northern Ireland agreed that they would be sticking with the \u201cstay at home\u201d advice.</p> \n<p>Sturgeon was also scathing about No 10\u2019s communications strategy, after the slogan was unveiled in the Sunday Telegraph before the devolved nations had seen it, saying: \u201cWe should not be reading of each other\u2019s plans in newspapers.\u201d</p> \n<p>After a chorus of disapproval about the new \u201cstay alert\u201d instruction for England, Johnson confirmed the advice would change, but tweeted out a clarification of what \u201cstay alert\u201d would mean.</p> \n<p>The government said the new principles of \u201cstay alert\u201d, which only affects England, were:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Staying at home as much as possible.</p></li> \n <li><p>Working from home if you can.</p></li> \n <li><p>Limiting contact with other people.</p></li> \n <li><p>Keeping distance if you go out (2 metres apart where possible).</p></li> \n <li><p>Washing your hands regularly.</p></li> \n <li><p>Self-isolating if anyone in your household has symptoms.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>More specific details are to be set out by the prime minister, but the first steps in loosening the lockdown are likely to be allowing unlimited outdoor exercise within household groups and the reopening of garden centres this week.</p> \n<p>The government briefed the latest \u201cstay alert\u201d messaging to the media on Saturday night. But in a sign that the UK\u2019s \u201cfour nations\u201d approach may be fracturing, Vaughan Gething, the Welsh health minister, said there had been no agreement from the devolved administrations and stressed that the message for Wales \u201chas not changed: stay at home, and if you do go out, observe the social distancing rules\u201d.</p> \n<p>Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, also said it was right to the stay with the original slogan. She told the BBC: \u201cOn the whole, the message is to stay at home. We will say we are not deviating from the message at this time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour said the \u201cstay alert\u201d messaging risked people thinking the lockdown was over, citting the street parties on Friday and pointin out that parks and beaches had attracted crowds over the warm bank holiday weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Speaking to Sky News, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, defended the slogan, saying the time was right for the UK to start gradually getting back to work as normal as the coronavirus epidemic is past its peak.</p> \n<p>Jenrick acknowledged the virus \u201ccontinues to be prevalent, too many people are still dying of this, and we\u2019re going to have to live with it for a long time\u201d. But he told the Ridge on Sunday programme it was right to \u201cupdate and broaden\u201d the message to the public.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think that\u2019s what the public want and that they will be able to understand this message, which is that we should be staying home as much as possible but when we do go to work and go about our business we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert,\u201d he continued.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd that means things like respecting others, remaining 2 metres apart, washing your hands, following the social distancing guidelines because the virus continues to be prevalent, too many people are still dying of this and we\u2019re going to have to live with it for a long time.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9cf7827d69e0c198670fab4e052c46ad65628cb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9cf7827d69e0c198670fab4e052c46ad65628cb/0_526_5334_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Jenrick said it was right to \u2018update and broaden\u2019 the message to the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Jenrick said it was right to \u2018update and broaden\u2019 the message to the public.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenrick said the message had to be changed to encourage people to resume their roles at work while staying safe. It follows concerns in the Treasury about the huge numbers of people who have been furloughed at a cost of \u00a38bn by 3 May.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going to take risks with the public. I understand people are anxious about the future but we want now to have a message which encourages people to go to work,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cStaying home will still be an important part of the message but you will be able to go to work and you will in time be able to do some other activities that you\u2019re not able to do today.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pressed on whether there was a danger that the message was too woolly, Jenrick said: \u201cWell, I hope not. We need to have a broader message because we want to slowly and cautiously restart the economy and the country.\u201d</p> \n<p>The difficulties of conveying the message were underlined when Jenrick was pressed on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show about what it meant. He said: \u201cStay alert by staying home as much as possible, but stay alert when you do go out by maintaining social distancing, washing your hands, respecting others at work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Opposition politicians and some scientists said the slogan was too unspecific and would leave people thinking they no longer needed to stay at home.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Jonathan Ashworth told Sky that the country needed clarity from the government on how they were meant to act as there was \u201cno room for nuance\u201d when dealing with a life-threatening virus. \u201cThe problem with the slogan is that people will be looking at it slightly puzzled,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, said: \u201cWhat kind of buffoon thinks of this kind of nonsense? It is an invisible threat. Staying alert is not the answer.\u201d </p> \n<p>Prof Simon Wessely, regius professor of psychiatry at King\u2019s College London and director of the health protection research unit in emergency preparedness and response, said it was difficult to know what \u201cstay alert\u201d meant: \u201cResearch in similar situations shows that what the public most want is specific guidance on what to do and what not to do. I am not sure how this answers that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Til Wykes, vice-dean of the institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience at King\u2019s College London, agreed. He said: \u201cIt will just be confusing, be open to misinterpretation and likely to increase risky behaviour \u2013 that means taking risks that will affect everyone and increase infections,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>However, the government\u2019s move to start reopening the economy won praise from some Conservative backbenchers, who have been pressing for an end to the lockdown. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said he believed the government should allow \u201cpeople to rely more on common sense than blanket rules\u201d.</p> \n<p>The decision over when and how to lift the lockdown has been the subject of a huge battle within the cabinet and the wider Tory party.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson has been on the cautious side of the argument, along with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, with cabinet ministers Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss among those pushing for more empahasis to be put on the economic consequences.</p> \n<p>With tensions running high, the Mail on Sunday reported a row between Johnson and Hancock, who is said to have asked the prime minister to \u201cgive me a break\u201d over the pressure he was feeling over the crisis.</p>",

If you want to go for a walk more often, or to go for a run and also a walk later on in the day then you can now do so,\u201d she said, adding that the relaxation would not apply to \u201csunbathing, picnics or barbecues\u201d. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re allowed to exercise more than once is definitely not a licence to start meeting up in groups at the park or at the beach,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing that really does risk spreading this virus.\u201d The advice is likely to be the same for the rest of the UK, but Sturgeon was extremely critical of the government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d message. The leaders of Wales and Northern Ireland agreed that they would be sticking with the \u201cstay at home\u201d advice. Sturgeon was also scathing about No 10\u2019s communications strategy, after the slogan was unveiled in the Sunday Telegraph before the devolved nations had seen it, saying: \u201cWe should not be reading of each other\u2019s plans in newspapers.\u201d After a chorus of disapproval about the new \u201cstay alert\u201d instruction for England, Johnson confirmed the advice would change, but tweeted out a clarification of what \u201cstay alert\u201d would mean. The government said the new principles of \u201cstay alert\u201d, which only affects England, were: Staying at home as much as possible. Working from home if you can. Limiting contact with other people. Keeping distance if you go out (2 metres apart where possible). Washing your hands regularly. Self-isolating if anyone in your household has symptoms. More specific details are to be set out by the prime minister, but the first steps in loosening the lockdown are likely to be allowing unlimited outdoor exercise within household groups and the reopening of garden centres this week. The government briefed the latest \u201cstay alert\u201d messaging to the media on Saturday night. But in a sign that the UK\u2019s \u201cfour nations\u201d approach may be fracturing, Vaughan Gething, the Welsh health minister, said there had been no agreement from the devolved administrations and stressed that the message for Wales \u201chas not changed: stay at home, and if you do go out, observe the social distancing rules\u201d. Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, also said it was right to the stay with the original slogan. She told the BBC: \u201cOn the whole, the message is to stay at home. We will say we are not deviating from the message at this time.\u201d Labour said the \u201cstay alert\u201d messaging risked people thinking the lockdown was over, citting the street parties on Friday and pointin out that parks and beaches had attracted crowds over the warm bank holiday weekend. Speaking to Sky News, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, defended the slogan, saying the time was right for the UK to start gradually getting back to work as normal as the coronavirus epidemic is past its peak. Jenrick acknowledged the virus \u201ccontinues to be prevalent, too many people are still dying of this, and we\u2019re going to have to live with it for a long time\u201d. But he told the Ridge on Sunday programme it was right to \u201cupdate and broaden\u201d the message to the public. \u201cI think that\u2019s what the public want and that they will be able to understand this message, which is that we should be staying home as much as possible but when we do go to work and go about our business we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd that means things like respecting others, remaining 2 metres apart, washing your hands, following the social distancing guidelines because the virus continues to be prevalent, too many people are still dying of this and we\u2019re going to have to live with it for a long time.\u201d Jenrick said the message had to be changed to encourage people to resume their roles at work while staying safe. It follows concerns in the Treasury about the huge numbers of people who have been furloughed at a cost of \u00a38bn by 3 May. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take risks with the public. I understand people are anxious about the future but we want now to have a message which encourages people to go to work,\u201d he said. \u201cStaying home will still be an important part of the message but you will be able to go to work and you will in time be able to do some other activities that you\u2019re not able to do today.\u201d Pressed on whether there was a danger that the message was too woolly, Jenrick said: \u201cWell, I hope not. We need to have a broader message because we want to slowly and cautiously restart the economy and the country.\u201d The difficulties of conveying the message were underlined when Jenrick was pressed on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show about what it meant. He said: \u201cStay alert by staying home as much as possible, but stay alert when you do go out by maintaining social distancing, washing your hands, respecting others at work.\u201d Opposition politicians and some scientists said the slogan was too unspecific and would leave people thinking they no longer needed to stay at home. Labour\u2019s Jonathan Ashworth told Sky that the country needed clarity from the government on how they were meant to act as there was \u201cno room for nuance\u201d when dealing with a life-threatening virus. \u201cThe problem with the slogan is that people will be looking at it slightly puzzled,\u201d he said. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, said: \u201cWhat kind of buffoon thinks of this kind of nonsense? It is an invisible threat. Staying alert is not the answer.\u201d Prof Simon Wessely, regius professor of psychiatry at King\u2019s College London and director of the health protection research unit in emergency preparedness and response, said it was difficult to know what \u201cstay alert\u201d meant: \u201cResearch in similar situations shows that what the public most want is specific guidance on what to do and what not to do. I am not sure how this answers that.\u201d Prof Til Wykes, vice-dean of the institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience at King\u2019s College London, agreed. He said: \u201cIt will just be confusing, be open to misinterpretation and likely to increase risky behaviour \u2013 that means taking risks that will affect everyone and increase infections,\u201d she said. However, the government\u2019s move to start reopening the economy won praise from some Conservative backbenchers, who have been pressing for an end to the lockdown. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said he believed the government should allow \u201cpeople to rely more on common sense than blanket rules\u201d. The decision over when and how to lift the lockdown has been the subject of a huge battle within the cabinet and the wider Tory party. Johnson has been on the cautious side of the argument, along with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, with cabinet ministers Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss among those pushing for more empahasis to be put on the economic consequences. With tensions running high, the Mail on Sunday reported a row between Johnson and Hancock, who is said to have asked the prime minister to \u201cgive me a break\u201d over the pressure he was feeling over the crisis.",

Starmer\u2019s policy is to support an extension of the three-month ban on evictions and give tenants up to two years to pay arrears, which Labour says would help avoid people losing their homes in June. However, activists are calling for a more comprehensive policy to help renters, saying a deferral of rents will push people further into poverty as they face huge rises in what they have to pay each month.

As the kind of dramatic scenes of overstretched health services witnessed in Italy or Spain never fully materialised in Germany, politicians have increasingly struggled to convince the public of the need for strict adherence to social distancing. Now this phenomenon, which the virologist Christian Drosten has called the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d, is fuelling fears of a second wave of the pandemic. On Wednesday, chancellor Angela Merkel announced the latest gradual reopening of large shops, schools, nurseries, and even restaurants and bars \u2013 seemingly bowing to a growing impatience with lockdown restrictions that was manifesting itself in political pressure from the leaders of the 16 federal states, the mass tabloid Bild, and growing conspiracy theory-driven protests across major cities. New hygiene rules announced on Wednesday were supposed to go hand in hand with this relaxation, but are so complicated that many feel they can ignore them altogether. Throughout the week there was a noticeably less cautious mood on the streets of German cities, with clusters of people once again dotting parks to share drinks in the sunshine. In cities including Berlin, Munich and Stuttgart, demonstrators \u2013 including rightwing extremists and anti-vaxxers \u2013 gathered in their thousands on Saturday, protesting against lockdown restrictions that are already being rapidly loosened. The wearing of hygiene masks, while now mandatory in shops and on public transport, is not consistently policed, and often only casually adhered to. Over the weekend, the empirical findings of the Robert Koch Institute, the government\u2019s disease control agency, seemed to match the anecdotal evidence that many people had gathered over the past few days. The RKI announced on Sunday that the reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, had for two consecutive days risen above the critical threshold of one, to 1.1. As recently as Wednesday, when Merkel announced the latest steps of the exit strategy, the R number had been as low as 0.65. There are several reasons to handle these figures with caution. The R number is an estimate that deliberately ignores lag-prone data from the last three days and backdates known cases to their likely day of infection, around a week earlier. Rising R numbers over the weekend therefore do not indicate how the spread of the virus developed following this week\u2019s lockdown relaxation, though it could account for a new mood in the country following the first step of relaxation on 20 April. The RKI itself urged caution on the latest R number \u2013 since new infections in Germany have dropped to relatively low figures, it said, the estimate was more prone to statistical fluctuations.

Under the new emergency mechanism Merkel announced last week, hospitals, care homes or entire municipalities can be put under lockdown if they cumulatively register more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days. By the weekend, only three German municipalities were in breach of this new limit: one in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, one in eastern Thuringia, and one in western North-Rhine Westphalia.

      "bodyText": "Gambling firms are undermining their pledge not to advertise during lockdown by showing \u201cthinly veiled\u201d commercials disguised as social responsibility messages, according to MPs who have urged the government to intervene. The Betting and Gaming Council (BGC), whose members make up the vast majority of the UK industry, vowed last month to suspend TV and radio ads in response to concerns that vulnerable people and children were at greater risk during Covid-19 isolation. Instead, starting from last Friday, they promised to air \u201csafer gambling\u201d messages, detailing tools that customers can use to stop themselves losing control, such as cash deposit limits. In a letter to the culture minister, Nigel Huddleston, a cross-party group of MPs examining gambling-related harm said that the spots have proved to be little more than glorified adverts. One, for the casino firm Mr Green, which is owned by William Hill ends: \u201cEnjoy award-winning online casino with Mr Green.\u201d Another, for Sky Betting &amp; Gaming\u2019s casino brand, ends: \u201cThat\u2019s why I play at SkyVegas.\u201d It also deploys the industry\u2019s much-criticised safer gambling slogan: \u201cWhen the FUN stops, stop,\u201d featuring the word \u201cfun\u201d in outsize type. A third commercial, aired on Comedy Central by Paddy Power\u2019s casino brand, appeared to offer no information about player protection measures at all. Rather than using their generic brand names, all three adverts were shown under the banner of the companies\u2019 casino divisions, which are receiving increased traffic in the absence of sporting fixtures, according to recent financial results from several bookmakers. MPs on the all-party parliamentary group on gambling harm, led by Labour\u2019s Carolyn Harris and the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, said: \u201cThese are clearly just forms of advertising under the thinly veiled guise of a social responsibility message.\u201d The group, which includes more than 50 MPs, said the alleged strategy was \u201ca demonstration of the failure of self-regulation by the industry\u201d and called on the government to intervene. The BGC said it was perverse to criticise any increase in safer gambling messages, adding that 50% of gambling ads are not by its members. Bingo and the National Lottery are thought to account for the remainder. The lobby group said that \u201cif prohibitionists were genuinely concerned they would call on other gambling operators to follow the BGC\u2019s lead\u201d. Charles Ritchie of Gambling with Lives, a charity set up by families bereaved by gambling-related suicide, said: \u201cInstead of shouting \u2018prohibitionist\u2019 at anyone who wants a properly regulated gambling industry, the BGC should get their own members to act honourably and decently. \u201cThe multiple adverts across all commercial TV channels on Saturday shows that the much trumpeted gambling advertising ban is just hypocritical PR and the gambling industry is incapable of self-regulation.\u201d Prof Samantha Thomas, a gambling marketing expert at Deakin University in Australia, said: \u201cAll the evidence from areas like alcohol and tobacco tells us that industry educational ads achieve nothing, and can contribute to promoting and normalising the brands. \u201cAn especially concerning aspect is that they are actually inviting people to visit their websites. That is still promoting the companies.\u201d BGC members offered to halt broadcast commercials until June, but the promise did not extend to online advertising, where spending is more than three times higher than on TV and radio spots. The Guardian has seen analysis suggesting that several of the UK\u2019s largest brands have increased what they spend to appear at the top of Google\u2019s search results for phrases such as \u201conline casino games\u201d and \u201cpoker\u201d since lockdown began. The company that initially showed the data to the Guardian later declined to share it in full because it has gambling industry clients. Paddy Power said it had removed all TV advertising and product-specific sponsorship, as well as enhancing responsible gambling controls. It is understood to have maintained its Comedy Central ad because its Paddy Power Games is a brand rather than a product. It has reversed the decision since being contacted by the Guardian.",

However, Australian families continue to pay<a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/benwage/net-childcare-costs.htm\"> among the highest percentages of household income towards childcare</a> in the developed world. And while all educators within early learning environments need to be qualified, and many have university degrees, they can earn as little as $22/hour.</p> <p>Goodstart\u2019s Julia Davison says Australian governments have historically spent less on early learning and care than other advanced economies. This level of spend results in low wages for staff and out-of-pocket expenses for families. Neither major political party took universal free early learning to the last federal election. \u201cFree access to early learning is common in many countries who recognise the key role early learning plays in improving education, economic and social equality outcomes by making it accessible to all,\u201d she says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve finally got what we\u2019ve always been asking for in terms of universal, free early education for children.</p> <footer> <cite>Prof Marianne Fenech</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhen the early childhood education and care relief package was announced, it was like \u2018Oh my gosh! We\u2019ve finally got what we\u2019ve always been asking for in terms of universal, free early education for children,\u2019\u201d says Fenech.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the importance of the early years, early childhood development and the benefit of early childhood education and care has for the child, the family, the community and the nation \u2013 in terms of workforce participation and production \u2013 we have always argued that early childhood education should be free and seen as a public good \u2013 like education.\u201d</p> <p>The government has been clear that free-to-the-end-user childcare or early childhood education will not remain in place as it would be too costly, even though at present \u2013 due to reduced enrolments \u2013 the relief package is estimated by Labor to be $400m cheaper than the $2bn allocated for childcare spending in this quarter, not anticipating the pandemic.</p> <p>Director of the Tax and Transfer Policy Institute at the Australian National University, Prof Robert Breunig, expects the system will return to its pre-Covid-19 state once the terms of the current relief package expire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4d59da1e03dcb9b38186c12faf9b64e0f0c2b524\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d59da1e03dcb9b38186c12faf9b64e0f0c2b524/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Goodstart Early Learning Centre at Albany Creek in Brisbane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Grattan Institute estimates that moving to a universal model of free early education and care would cost $14bn a year on top of the $8bn the government already spends.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhat we have today is not sustainable,\u201d he says, as centres are currently subsidising the shortfall between their costs, and the combination of the relief package and jobseeker allowance.</p> <p>And while rolling back free care will be politically difficult, Breunig says that making the entire system public would be very expensive. \u201cI think the government will put its foot down and say \u2018We can\u2019t afford to do this for free for everybody.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In late April the Grattan Institute released modelling which suggested that moving to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/permanently-raising-the-child-care-subsidy-is-an-economic-opportunity-too-good-to-miss-136856\">a universal model of free early education and care would cost $14bn a year </a>on top of the $8bn already spent annually. Instead, the institute proposed a more generous subsidy which would render childcare nearly free for the lowest-income earners, with the subsidy rate gradually falling to zero for higher-earning families. It estimated this would cost an additional $5bn but it would be offset by greater equity and workforce participation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/01/parents-urged-to-dob-in-childcare-centres-they-suspect-of-profiteering-from-coronavirus-funding\">Parents urged to dob in childcare centres they suspect of profiteering from coronavirus funding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These estimates presume a continuation of what Breunig calls Australia\u2019s hybrid model of early education and childcare. The government funds a substantial portion of the sector, while the market delivers the services. The sector is diverse, with 13,000 operators, the vast majority of which operate a single service. Two-thirds of the sector is privately-run, with some large for-profit providers, including ASX-listed G8 Education which runs 470 services and in the last financial year posted <a href=\"https://g8education.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Annual-Report-2019.pdf\">post-tax net profits of over $76m</a>. Breunig says the hybrid model works well in providing choice for parents, while the government subsidies attempt to address issues of price and equity of access.</p> <p>However, for advocates of free childcare, the existence of profit-making enterprises is problematic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"934a317f18318b838820a8c71feecda02e713848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/934a317f18318b838820a8c71feecda02e713848/0_0_4000_2662/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cloevlly Child Care Centre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The federal government introduced its childcare relief package in an attempt to stop families withdrawing their children and keep childcare centres open.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Mclaughlin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI think a lot of people are uncomfortable with the amount of profits that are made in some parts of the sector,\u201d says Gibbons. \u201cThere should be a conversation about whether taxpayer money is propping up those profits, but I think that should be part of a wider conversation about what\u2019s in the best interests of children.\u201d</p> <p>Fenech says she would love to see the federal government step in to fund all early childhood learning services and bring the entire system public but she says it will not happen. \u201cIt\u2019s pie in the sky thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re just too far away in terms of how we think about early childhood education.\u201d</p> <p>Gibbons, however, is hopeful of reform. \u201cI think that putting free childcare on the table has opened up a conversation we need to have as a community about what we want the early learning sector to look like, because it isn\u2019t a model that has been really delivering for children. It\u2019s not really a model that\u2019s delivering for families and educators. Arguably it\u2019s not a model that\u2019s delivering for taxpayers in relation to the investment we\u2019re putting in.\u201d</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.pc.gov.au/research/ongoing/report-on-government-services/2020/child-care-education-and-training/early-childhood-education-and-care\">one in five centres are not currently meeting or exceeding national quality standards</a>, according to the Productivity Commission. \u201cThat\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d she says.</p> <h2>Addressing disadvantage and access</h2> <p>As the country emerges from the pandemic, and emergency measures and funding start to fade away, most speaking to the Guardian hope that some reform of the system might rise from the dust.</p> <p>The most critical equity issue within the pre-Covid-19 system was that of vulnerable children falling through the cracks. Under the existing system, parents need to meet a work activity test in order to qualify for subsidised childcare for their children. Disadvantaged children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are those who most benefit from early education. However, they attend at lower rates, and according to research by Fenech, services in lower socioeconomic areas are also less likely to be meeting or exceeding national quality standards.</p> <p>\u201cThe child are benefit system that came in a couple of years ago does cover 80% of the costs for poorer families \u2013 but if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get it,\u201d says Breunig.

      "bodyText": "As the coronavirus pandemic began what at the time looked like a particularly ominous march forward, Fiona Ivits\u2019 four-year-old son, Kit, developed a cough. She kept him home in their Melbourne flat for two weeks but continued to do her full-time job. As the days progressed, Ivits realised that working from home with her son was not possible, and Kit started staring longingly at other children they passed on the street. After their voluntary isolation, as Kit was well, Ivits had to decide her next steps. \u201cIn some ways I was of two minds about sending him back full time [to childcare] after his cough cleared up. There was a nervousness about coronavirus, and I thought maybe I should try keeping him home one day a week,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then they made it free.\u201d On 2 April, the government announced that childcare would become free for families. It was billed as a rescue package, following mass withdrawals from daycare services around the country from families who had been thrown into financial uncertainty and needed to cut costs, or who were concerned about safety. The sector, much of which runs on tight margins, looked like a deck of cards teetering. An essential service As Australia faced the threat of the collapse of the sector, the role of early childhood learning and care was thrust into sharp relief: this is an essential service. The government could not leave it to crumble and expect society to continue functioning through or after the crisis. The relief package aimed to stop families withdrawing their children and keep centres open. Services would be subsidised 50% of their fees, subject to an hourly cap, and they would have to make up the rest by utilising the jobseeker package \u2013 but they could only receive the assistance if they did not charge parents. In announcing the package, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, declared the 200,000-strong workforce to be \u201cvital\u201d. The relief package, he said, would build \u201ca bridge for these valuable services to the other side of this virus so they can continue to play their valuable role in our workforce and education systems and so Australia can bounce back strongly\u201d. Julia Davison, CEO of Goodstart Early Learning, the biggest single provider of childcare in the country, says the recognition by all governments of the importance of childcare as an essential service has been \u201cwonderful\u201d. \u201cI know many of our educators and teachers feel that for the first time they are being acknowledged by governments and the wider community for the extraordinary work they do,\u201d she says. Beyond this critical recognition of the professional sector, says Helen Gibbons, executive director of early childhood education and care for United Workers, the crisis has highlighted that the care of children is a responsibility for the whole of society. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of employers who have had to be a lot more conscious of the fact not only that their staff have young children, and that they are required to pay those children attention, but that as a community we all have a responsibility to support that,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in leaving parents out to dry and saying \u2018That\u2019s your problem to fix\u2019, because actually it\u2019s so many people\u2019s problem to fix.\u201d However, in other ways, the disruption and intervention caused by the coronavirus pandemic has reinforced what many in the sector see as a fundamental problem in the way that early childhood education and care is framed. \u201cI think it\u2019s entrenched the way we think about childcare,\u201d says Prof Marianne Fenech, program director for early education at the University of Sydney and chair of the Australian Early Childhood Teacher Education Network. \u201cIn Australia, childhood education is not recognised as early learning. It\u2019s recognised and talked in policy and in the media as \u2018care\u2019.\u201d It it viewed as vital insofar as it enables workforce participation, says Fenech, particularly the participation of women. And while that is important for gender equity and the economy, \u201cchildren are absent in early childhood education policy\u201d, she argues \u2013 both before, and even more so during the crisis. Gibbons, who spent decades working the sector before moving into its union, agrees: \u201cWhat everybody focused on \u2013 and what the PM focused on \u2013 was keeping early learning alive because the economy needed it to be alive, not because young children need rich learning environments.\u201d This perception acts as a significant stumbling block to further reform and investment in the sector, say those within it. \u201cIt\u2019s a financial model that\u2019s based around trying to support workforce participation, and not spend any more money than you need to,\u201d says Gibbons. \u201cWhat it isn\u2019t is a model that has the child at the centre of it.\u201d Pandora\u2019s box \u2013 free education Fiona Ivits\u2019 family had been receiving some childcare fee subsidies before the crisis but they still paid substantial fees for their son\u2019s five days a week at a charity-run service. \u201cHaving free childcare has been amazing,\u201d she says. \u201cNow that we have seen that free childcare can be provided it\u2019s going to be a bit of a wrench to go back to the system as it was,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving childcare that is free or heavily subsidised would make it just that much easier for people to be productive, engaged in the workforce and not worrying about whether it is profitable or financially viable to go back to work.\u201d Since the introduction in 2018 of the childcare subsidy system, childcare costs in Australia have fallen for the majority of families. However, Australian families continue to pay among the highest percentages of household income towards childcare in the developed world. And while all educators within early learning environments need to be qualified, and many have university degrees, they can earn as little as $22/hour. Goodstart\u2019s Julia Davison says Australian governments have historically spent less on early learning and care than other advanced economies. This level of spend results in low wages for staff and out-of-pocket expenses for families. Neither major political party took universal free early learning to the last federal election. \u201cFree access to early learning is common in many countries who recognise the key role early learning plays in improving education, economic and social equality outcomes by making it accessible to all,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen the early childhood education and care relief package was announced, it was like \u2018Oh my gosh! We\u2019ve finally got what we\u2019ve always been asking for in terms of universal, free early education for children,\u2019\u201d says Fenech. \u201cBecause of the importance of the early years, early childhood development and the benefit of early childhood education and care has for the child, the family, the community and the nation \u2013 in terms of workforce participation and production \u2013 we have always argued that early childhood education should be free and seen as a public good \u2013 like education.\u201d The government has been clear that free-to-the-end-user childcare or early childhood education will not remain in place as it would be too costly, even though at present \u2013 due to reduced enrolments \u2013 the relief package is estimated by Labor to be $400m cheaper than the $2bn allocated for childcare spending in this quarter, not anticipating the pandemic. Director of the Tax and Transfer Policy Institute at the Australian National University, Prof Robert Breunig, expects the system will return to its pre-Covid-19 state once the terms of the current relief package expire. \u201cWhat we have today is not sustainable,\u201d he says, as centres are currently subsidising the shortfall between their costs, and the combination of the relief package and jobseeker allowance. And while rolling back free care will be politically difficult, Breunig says that making the entire system public would be very expensive. \u201cI think the government will put its foot down and say \u2018We can\u2019t afford to do this for free for everybody.\u2019\u201d In late April the Grattan Institute released modelling which suggested that moving to a universal model of free early education and care would cost $14bn a year on top of the $8bn already spent annually. Instead, the institute proposed a more generous subsidy which would render childcare nearly free for the lowest-income earners, with the subsidy rate gradually falling to zero for higher-earning families. It estimated this would cost an additional $5bn but it would be offset by greater equity and workforce participation. These estimates presume a continuation of what Breunig calls Australia\u2019s hybrid model of early education and childcare. The government funds a substantial portion of the sector, while the market delivers the services. The sector is diverse, with 13,000 operators, the vast majority of which operate a single service. Two-thirds of the sector is privately-run, with some large for-profit providers, including ASX-listed G8 Education which runs 470 services and in the last financial year posted post-tax net profits of over $76m. Breunig says the hybrid model works well in providing choice for parents, while the government subsidies attempt to address issues of price and equity of access. However, for advocates of free childcare, the existence of profit-making enterprises is problematic. \u201cI think a lot of people are uncomfortable with the amount of profits that are made in some parts of the sector,\u201d says Gibbons. \u201cThere should be a conversation about whether taxpayer money is propping up those profits, but I think that should be part of a wider conversation about what\u2019s in the best interests of children.\u201d Fenech says she would love to see the federal government step in to fund all early childhood learning services and bring the entire system public but she says it will not happen. \u201cIt\u2019s pie in the sky thinking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re just too far away in terms of how we think about early childhood education.\u201d Gibbons, however, is hopeful of reform. \u201cI think that putting free childcare on the table has opened up a conversation we need to have as a community about what we want the early learning sector to look like, because it isn\u2019t a model that has been really delivering for children. It\u2019s not really a model that\u2019s delivering for families and educators. Arguably it\u2019s not a model that\u2019s delivering for taxpayers in relation to the investment we\u2019re putting in.\u201d More than one in five centres are not currently meeting or exceeding national quality standards, according to the Productivity Commission. \u201cThat\u2019s just not good enough,\u201d she says. Addressing disadvantage and access As the country emerges from the pandemic, and emergency measures and funding start to fade away, most speaking to the Guardian hope that some reform of the system might rise from the dust. The most critical equity issue within the pre-Covid-19 system was that of vulnerable children falling through the cracks. Under the existing system, parents need to meet a work activity test in order to qualify for subsidised childcare for their children. Disadvantaged children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are those who most benefit from early education. However, they attend at lower rates, and according to research by Fenech, services in lower socioeconomic areas are also less likely to be meeting or exceeding national quality standards. \u201cThe child are benefit system that came in a couple of years ago does cover 80% of the costs for poorer families \u2013 but if you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get it,\u201d says Breunig. He says he would like to see the current subsidy system extend to families that are not in work. The Grattan proposal would see 95% of costs covered for the poorest families. \u201cWe know that kids from poorer backgrounds are the ones who benefit most from childcare,\u201d he says. \u201cSo you get get educational outcomes, equity improvement and it\u2019s really not very expensive. We\u2019re not talking about a lot of people.\u201d History offers both cause for hope and pessimism that some better system might be borne of the current crisis. During the second world war, the commonwealth government stepped in to provide childcare so that women were able to participate in the workforce. \u201cWhen the men came back, the women went back to their homes and funding was taken back,\u201d Fenech says. \u201cI think we\u2019ve similarly got a national crisis at hand, and the government is reacting to the crisis \u2026 but it\u2019s only short-term.\u201d Gibbons, however, sees hope in a more recent history. In 2008 when the then largest childcare provider, privately-listed ABC Learning Centres, was on the brink of collapse, it resulted in the birth of Goodstart \u2013 a not-for-profit and the largest single operator in the sector. \u201cI think it would be nice to imagine a world where there is similarly something good that comes out of this crisis,\u201d she says. Fiona Ivits, too, is hopeful that policy reform might flow from the current situation. During lockdown with her son, she discovered that his educators had been teaching him all sorts of concepts that she had never discussed with him. For her, the value of early learning, and the workers in it, has never been clearer. \u201cHe learned it all from them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australians deserve better than a post-crisis \u201csnapback\u201d to an economy in which workers worry about job insecurity while jobseekers are relegated to poverty, Anthony Albanese will declare on Monday. In his latest \u201cheadland\u201d speech, the Labor leader will sharpen his message that the public is looking for a recovery \u201cin which no one is left behind\u201d and will not accept a return to \u201cthe law of the jungle and unfettered market forces\u201d. The vision statement comes as a new report from Deloitte Access Economics warns national income next financial year could fall nearly $200bn short of predictions in the previous budget update, while deficits will also be high in the short term. As the political contest becomes increasingly about the shape of the economic recovery, Albanese will call on the government to bring forward nation-building infrastructure projects and increase investment in social and affordable housing. Speaking in Canberra on the eve of a three-day parliamentary sitting, he will also call for Australia to build up its domestic manufacturing capacity, make better use of scientific research, and help towns and regions though a decentralisation strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we are still saying, \u2018we are all in this together\u2019, after the lockdown has come to an end \u2013 and not just saying it, living up to that standard,\u201d Albanese will say when he addresses an audience in the Labor caucus room in Parliament House. \u201cBecause this experience has reminded us that there is such a thing as society \u2013 that we are all connected and the strength of this bond is what is pulling us through as Australians. Our challenge must be to recover stronger, not just to return to as we were. \u201cLet\u2019s not snap back to insecure work, to jobseekers stuck in poverty, to scientists being ignored.\u201d Reinforcing the warning about the plight of jobseekers, Labor\u2019s spokesperson for families and social services, Linda Burney, said on Sunday the government should release any modelling on the potential economic shock generated from allowing unemployment benefits to revert to just $40 per day from September \u2013 a prospect she described as \u201ca recipe for disaster\u201d. Albanese will deliver the vision statement on the eve of a parliamentary sitting when the opposition is expected to intensify scrutiny of Scott Morrison and his ministry \u2013 including over gaps in the government\u2019s Covid-19 support packages and new evidence surrounding the role of the prime minister\u2019s office in the sports grants saga. Albanese will say the Labor party has an obligation to hold the government to account. \u201cThe enormity of government expenditure approved in recent months makes it an imperative,\u201d he will say. Morrison has nominated July as an \u201caspiration\u201d for all states and territories to work their way through the national cabinet\u2019s three-step plan to ease restrictions on social and economic activity and said he hoped it would build confidence. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is set to update parliament on the vast fiscal and economic impacts of the crisis. But in its latest \u201cbudget monitor\u201d released on Monday, Deloitte Access Economics estimates the underlying cash deficit could be $143bn this financial year and $132bn in the next. The report argues rapid budget repair would be \u201cmisguided\u201d and there is a need to accept a further period of higher deficits, in part to fund more infrastructure spending. It is understood the government sees the next federal budget \u2013 delayed until October \u2013 as a chance to unveil a raft of \u201cpro-investment policies\u201d to grow the economy, amid calls from some business groups for corporate tax cuts and a more flexible workplace relations system. But Albanese will call for a focus on inclusive economic growth where the benefits are shared, together with an industrial relations system that promotes co-operation, productivity improvements and shared benefits. He will also say policy makers need to look at increasing opportunities for people to gain secure employment, \u201cespecially for the next generation of younger workers who nowadays have little idea of the meaning of reliable income or holiday pay\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Back in March, the housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/robert-jenrick-reaffirms-support-for-councils-in-their-coronavirus-response\" title=\"\">pledged</a> that his department would do \u201cwhatever is necessary\u201d to help council leaders cope with the fallout of the coronavirus crisis. Urgent decisions, Mr Jenrick said, should <a href=\"https://www.themj.co.uk/Jenrick-urges-councils-not-to-delay-on-coronavirus-spending/217048\" title=\"\">not be put off</a> because of concerns about money.</p> <p>The minister was taken at his word. Impoverished by 10 years of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/29/council-spending-on-local-services-down\" title=\"\">savage cuts</a> from previous Conservative-led administrations, local authorities nevertheless stepped up to the plate. As the government\u2019s lack of strategic planning was exposed, they battled to provide missing personal protective equipment for care workers. Rough sleepers were housed and extra mental health support offered to vulnerable people. As reports of domestic abuse rose sharply during lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.southwarknews.co.uk/news/number-of-highest-risk-domestic-abuse-cases-doubles-during-lockdown/\" title=\"\">extra resources</a> were deployed to deal with the caseload. Community hubs have been set up to facilitate food distribution and fuel assistance. Across the range of frontline services, a colossal, costly attempt has been made to rescue and preserve the battered infrastructure of everyday life.</p> <p>As a result, councils are now swimming in a sea of unsustainable debt. Outgoings exponentially increased as income streams collapsed during lockdown. From parking fees and business rate taxes to returns on commercial investments, the money that keeps local authorities afloat has dried up. Manchester city council projects an overall loss <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/catastrophic-coronavirus-could-destroy-local-18120651\" title=\"\">of almost \u00a3152m</a> for 2020-21. Liverpool city council is on the verge of <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-brink-collapse-due-perfect-18175466\" title=\"\">filing a section 114 notice</a> \u2013 effectively a declaration of bankruptcy. Relatively prosperous shires are suffering too. The Conservative MP for Shrewsbury, Daniel Kawczynski, has <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/health/coronavirus-covid19/2020/04/27/mp-calls-for-government-to-back-councils-or-risk-calamity/\" title=\"\">highlighted</a> the case of Shropshire council, which has so far incurred coronavirus-related costs of well over \u00a320m. A social \u201ccalamity\u201d awaits, he has said, unless Westminster fulfils its promise to stand by councils during the crisis.</p> <p>But as the calls for financial assistance have become more urgent, Mr Jenrick\u2019s responses have become more evasive. Last week, the airy rhetoric of March was superseded by a warning that councils should not \u201clabour under a false impression that what they are doing will be guaranteed funded by central government\u201d. This amounts to a betrayal of trust. The government has moved to bring forward some payments to councils due later in the year, but a far bigger injection of new money is required. Failing that, it may be that the coronavirus crisis will prove a disastrous tipping point for local authorities, which have been relentlessly harried, hobbled and undermined by Whitehall for 10 years.</p> <p>The austerity drive launched in 2010 by the former chancellor George Osborne turned out to be a declaration of war on municipal England. Almost \u00a316bn of core local government funding <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.40_01_Finance%20publication_WEB_0.pdf\" title=\"\">was cut</a> \u2013 or 60p in every pound provided from Westminster for local services. Council tax rises were legally capped, as care budgets were slashed and amenities closed. Poorer regions, with smaller tax takes, suffered the most. After a decade of devastation, there are, as the leader of Manchester city council, Sir Richard Leese, <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/catastrophic-coronavirus-could-destroy-local-18120651\" title=\"\">wrote to</a> Boris Johnson last month, \u201cno easy cuts left to make\u201d. Without a new settlement adequate to the times, vital needs in our towns, cities and rural areas will go unmet.</p> <p>That prospect could not come at a worse time, as the nation faces the sharpest economic downturn for 300 years. Instead of hanging local government out to dry, Mr Jenrick should be finding ways to put it centre stage in the \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d strategy that will be key to reopening the economy. As the Local Government Association has <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/lga-statement-coronavirus-contact-tracing-strategy\" title=\"\">pointed out</a>, public health teams deployed by councils have unmatched local knowledge and experience. This expertise risks being underutilised as contact tracing contracts are shortsightedly handed to private operators <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/uk-government-using-crisis-to-transfer-nhs-duties-to-private-sector\" title=\"\">such as Serco</a>.</p> <p>In the months to come, councils will also bear responsibility for maintaining levels of social care in the community, ensuring safe provision of public transport, helping local business and providing the essential services celebrated on our doorsteps each Thursday evening. For too long, local government has been treated with ruthless disdain by ministers in London. In this time of crisis, Mr Jenrick has the opportunity to make amends. It\u2019s time to give councils the funding and respect they deserve.</p>",

As reports of domestic abuse rose sharply during lockdown, extra resources were deployed to deal with the caseload. Community hubs have been set up to facilitate food distribution and fuel assistance. Across the range of frontline services, a colossal, costly attempt has been made to rescue and preserve the battered infrastructure of everyday life. As a result, councils are now swimming in a sea of unsustainable debt. Outgoings exponentially increased as income streams collapsed during lockdown. From parking fees and business rate taxes to returns on commercial investments, the money that keeps local authorities afloat has dried up. Manchester city council projects an overall loss of almost \u00a3152m for 2020-21. Liverpool city council is on the verge of filing a section 114 notice \u2013 effectively a declaration of bankruptcy. Relatively prosperous shires are suffering too. The Conservative MP for Shrewsbury, Daniel Kawczynski, has highlighted the case of Shropshire council, which has so far incurred coronavirus-related costs of well over \u00a320m. A social \u201ccalamity\u201d awaits, he has said, unless Westminster fulfils its promise to stand by councils during the crisis. But as the calls for financial assistance have become more urgent, Mr Jenrick\u2019s responses have become more evasive. Last week, the airy rhetoric of March was superseded by a warning that councils should not \u201clabour under a false impression that what they are doing will be guaranteed funded by central government\u201d. This amounts to a betrayal of trust. The government has moved to bring forward some payments to councils due later in the year, but a far bigger injection of new money is required. Failing that, it may be that the coronavirus crisis will prove a disastrous tipping point for local authorities, which have been relentlessly harried, hobbled and undermined by Whitehall for 10 years. The austerity drive launched in 2010 by the former chancellor George Osborne turned out to be a declaration of war on municipal England. Almost \u00a316bn of core local government funding was cut \u2013 or 60p in every pound provided from Westminster for local services. Council tax rises were legally capped, as care budgets were slashed and amenities closed. Poorer regions, with smaller tax takes, suffered the most. After a decade of devastation, there are, as the leader of Manchester city council, Sir Richard Leese, wrote to Boris Johnson last month, \u201cno easy cuts left to make\u201d. Without a new settlement adequate to the times, vital needs in our towns, cities and rural areas will go unmet. That prospect could not come at a worse time, as the nation faces the sharpest economic downturn for 300 years. Instead of hanging local government out to dry, Mr Jenrick should be finding ways to put it centre stage in the \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d strategy that will be key to reopening the economy. As the Local Government Association has pointed out, public health teams deployed by councils have unmatched local knowledge and experience. This expertise risks being underutilised as contact tracing contracts are shortsightedly handed to private operators such as Serco. In the months to come, councils will also bear responsibility for maintaining levels of social care in the community, ensuring safe provision of public transport, helping local business and providing the essential services celebrated on our doorsteps each Thursday evening. For too long, local government has been treated with ruthless disdain by ministers in London. In this time of crisis, Mr Jenrick has the opportunity to make amends. It\u2019s time to give councils the funding and respect they deserve.",

News that three core members of the US pandemic task force were having to go into some degree of self-isolation could not come at a worse time for Donald Trump. The president is trying to project an image of confidence and resolution as he encourages states to reopen their economies, while his administration is proving unable to keep the virus at bay even within the White House. Fauci, 79, a calming face of the Trump administration\u2019s otherwise chaotic pandemic response, has begun what is being described as \u201cmodified quarantine\u201d, involving some work from home, after he had \u201clow risk\u201d contact with a White House staffer who tested positive. He is joined by Dr Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, and Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who have both gone into two weeks of isolation. Fauci will still testify before a Senate committee next week but he will do so remotely. The scramble to protect Trump from potential infection was prompted after two White House staffers tested positive. They included a US Navy officer who served as valet for the president, and the press spokeswoman for vice-president Mike Pence, Katie Miller, who is married to senior policy aide Stephen Miller. A spokesman for Pence issued a statement on Sunday night in response to news reports claiming the vice-president was self-isolating, saying Pence was not in quarantine. Pence \u201chas tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow,\u201d the statement said. The positive tests are reported to have caused alarm within the White House, given the cramped conditions in which officials work. The New York Times cited a senior official as saying Trump himself was \u201cspooked\u201d to learn that the valet, who on occasion serves him food, had not been wearing a mask. Senior officials took to the Sunday talk shows to try to counter the impression of internal shambles around the president. Larry Kudlow, the White House national economic council director, told ABC\u2019s This Week the two positive tests were insignificant. \u201cIn terms of the White House complex, which is an enormous place, at least 500 people, probably much more than that \u2026 those who have tested positive is still a small fraction,\u201d he said. Kevin Hassett, a special adviser to Trump on the pandemic, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union extra precautions were being taken. Nobody was being allowed to have an audience with Trump, he emphasized, unless they had tested negative. But Hassett said there was a degree of risk involved in working in the West Wing, given the age of the building and the working conditions. Speaking to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, he said it was \u201cscary\u201d going to work and that it would have been safer staying at home. \u201cThe West Wing, even with all the testing in the world and the best medical team on Earth, is a relatively cramped place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things that have to happen in that West Wing even though the building is a little old and poorly ventilated.\u201d The crop of infections in the White House poses the administration a problem not only in terms of keeping the president safe. It also provides an inconvenient framing to Trump\u2019s efforts to come across as upbeat in the face of the contagion. He has been encouraging states to reopen their economies, even though in many cases they are ill-prepared for the health challenges of doing so at a time when the virus is still on the rise. Trump has tried to appear in control by pointedly refusing to wear a mask in White House meetings, and even touring a mask-making factory in Arizona last week without carrying any protective gear. The Associated Press reported that Trump chose not to wear a mask because it would \u201csend the wrong message\u201d and impact his re-election chances. The latest data from Johns Hopkins University shows that the US now has more than 1.3m confirmed cases of Covid-19, almost a third of the global tally. There have been 78,855 recorded deaths in the US, although the real figure is likely to be considerably higher. Trump is having to deal with further bad optics about his pandemic response, thanks to his predecessor, Barack Obama. In a leaked call first reported by Yahoo News, Obama told former officials from his administration the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the crisis had been \u201can absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of \u2018what\u2019s in it for me\u2019 and \u2018to heck with everybody else\u2019 \u2026 is operationalized in our government.\u201d Trump lashed back in a tweet on Sunday morning, claiming to be getting \u201cgreat marks\u201d for the handling of coronavirus. He went on: \u201cCompare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks, bad polls \u2013 didn\u2019t have a clue!\u201d Kudlow also hit back. He told ABC that \u201cwith all due respect to the former president \u2026 I really don\u2019t want to get into a political back-and-forth here \u2026 I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about\u201d. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what President Obama is saying. It just sounds so darn political to me.\u201d",

It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has announced a five-tier alert system to rank the threat from coronavirus \u2013 although experts said it was not immediately clear how independent or effective the scheme would be. The current threat level of the pandemic will be categorised on a scale of one to five in different parts of the country, based on assessments by a new \u201cjoint biosecurity centre\u201d. The system is designed to mirror the independent terror alert system, which ranks the threat to the public from \u201clow\u201d to \u201ccritical\u201d and helps decide what protective measures are required. The prime minister said in his broadcast to the nation that the alert system would help the country \u201cavoid going back to square one\u201d. Alert levels, he added, would be determined by the number of cases and the R number, or transmission rate, of the virus. \u201cIn turn, that Covid alert level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures. The lower the level, the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be,\u201d Johnson said. Terror threat levels are agreed by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which is independent of ministers but includes representatives of 16 government departments plus police and intelligence agencies. Further details are expected to be announced when the full lockdown easing plan is presented in detail to parliament on Monday. No detailed information has yet been released on the specific criteria for setting a level of alert. A former senior Whitehall security source said the existing terror threat level system was useful because it helped set \u201ca reference point\u201d to shape behaviour across Britain\u2019s wider national security system. They questioned, however, whether a biosecurity centre would be able to make its assessments independently. \u201cTechnocratic measures are being politicised, and \u2018blamestorming\u2019 and political manoeuvring seem to be the order of the day at the moment,\u201d they said. Johnson said the UK was currently under the second highest level of threat, but the situation was improving. \u201cOver the period of the lockdown, we have been in level four, and thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level three.\u201d The new system will apply only to England at first. Scotland has led criticism from the three devolved administrations of Downing Street\u2019s decision to drop the \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan in favour of \u201cstay alert\u201d. No 10, however, said it would seek to work with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to create an integrated approach across the UK. New Zealand adopted a four-tier coronavirus alert system in late March, in the early stages of the outbreak, so that \u201cpeople can see and plan for the kinds of restrictions we may be required to put in place\u201d, according to its government. Its guidelines cover how people are expected to behave at each level, how the healthcare system should be set up, and what public facilities and businesses are allowed to remain open. New Zealand, which has suffered relatively mildly from coronavirus compared with the UK and others in Europe, is poised to decide on Monday whether to reduce the threat level from three to two. Any decision has to be signed off by the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and her cabinet.",

      "body": "<p>It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2013 your freedom \u2013 of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it\u2019s the only way to defeat the coronavirus \u2013 the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.</p> \n<p>And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense, and though we grieve for all those we have lost, it is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst-case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> and saved many thousands of lives.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And so I know \u2013 you know \u2013 that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike.</p> \n<p>We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants.</p> \n<p>And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children.</p> \n<p>So I want to provide tonight \u2013 for you \u2013 the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening.</p> \n<p>I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates, and though it is right to be flexible in our response, I believe that as prime minister of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress \u201ccould\u201d. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>We must protect our NHS.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must see sustained falls in the death rate.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection.</p></li> \n <li><p>We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people<br>who need it, and yes, it is a global problem, but we must fix it.</p></li> \n <li><p>And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease \u2013 the R \u2013 back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid alert system run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre.</p> \n<p>And that Covid alert level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid alert level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures \u2013 the lower the level, the fewer the measures; the higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.</p> \n<p>There will be five alert levels. Level one means the disease is no longer present in the UK and level five is the most critical \u2013 the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>Over the period of the lockdown, we have been in level four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level three.</p> \n<p>And as we go, everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down, there are two more things we must do.</p> \n<p>We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done.</p> \n<p>And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that \u2013 all told \u2013 we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day.</p> \n<p>We have made fast progress on testing, but there is so much more to do now, and we can.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>When this began, we hadn\u2019t seen this disease before, and we didn\u2019t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes, because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups \u2013 in your area \u2013 as well as giving us a national picture.</p> \n<p>And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given, we have by no means fulfilled all of them.</p> \n<p>And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.</p> \n<p>And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week.</p> \n<p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n<p>And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible \u2013 because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can\u2019t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces Covid-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following Covid-secure standards.</p> \n<p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports, but only with members of your own household.</p> \n<p>You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them.</p> \n<p>And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further.</p> \n<p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, year 1 and year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n<p>And step three \u2013 at the earliest by July \u2013 and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice: if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n<p>Throughout this period of the next two months, we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity.

      "bodyText": "It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2013 your freedom \u2013 of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it\u2019s the only way to defeat the coronavirus \u2013 the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime. And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense, and though we grieve for all those we have lost, it is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst-case scenario was half a million fatalities. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know \u2013 you know \u2013 that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants. And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children. So I want to provide tonight \u2013 for you \u2013 the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a road map for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening. I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates, and though it is right to be flexible in our response, I believe that as prime minister of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress \u201ccould\u201d. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection. We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem, but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease \u2013 the R \u2013 back up over one, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago. And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new Covid alert system run by a new Joint Biosecurity Centre. And that Covid alert level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that Covid alert level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures \u2013 the lower the level, the fewer the measures; the higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be. There will be five alert levels. Level one means the disease is no longer present in the UK and level five is the most critical \u2013 the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed. Over the period of the lockdown, we have been in level four, and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level three. And as we go, everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down, there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. So that \u2013 all told \u2013 we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing, but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn\u2019t seen this disease before, and we didn\u2019t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes, because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups \u2013 in your area \u2013 as well as giving us a national picture. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below one, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below one. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given, we have by no means fulfilled all of them. And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures. And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible \u2013 because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can\u2019t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces Covid-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following Covid-secure standards. And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports, but only with members of your own household. You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them. And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further. In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, year 1 and year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport. And step three \u2013 at the earliest by July \u2013 and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice: if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. Throughout this period of the next two months, we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health. And I must stress again that all of this is conditional \u2013 it all depends on a series of big ifs. It depends on all of us \u2013 the entire country \u2013 to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down. And to prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time \u2013 with transmission significantly lower \u2013 to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally, and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes. We have been through the initial peak, but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already \u2013 the patience and common sense you have shown; the fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can; the incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers; the devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease \u2013 police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more; the scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine; when I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country, and that have helped to get us through this first phase, I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. And if we can\u2019t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won\u2019t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right. We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before. More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing. But for now, we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Thank you very much.",

She would lend its much stricter existing public health advertisement \u2013 the previously UK-wide slogan \u201cstay at home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d \u2013 to the UK government for any advertising sites it had bought in Scotland.</p> \n<p>As she spoke in Edinburgh, the Scottish government <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scotgov/status/1259499764602806272\">tweeted a fresh message</a>: \u201cPlease continue to #StayAtHome. By staying at home, you are saving lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>That became another theme for the day, with the devolved government of Wales and Northern Ireland issuing distinctly different advice, in an effort to counter Downing Street\u2019s sudden shift in messaging.</p> \n<p>The Welsh government\u2019s Twitter feed broadcast a 15-second clip with an unambiguous voiceover stating, \u201cYou must stay home.\u201d</p> \n<p>It too used the colour green but in a darker hue, with an animation of the virus spinning slowly. \u201cWe know it\u2019s hard, but please continue to stay at home,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WelshGovernment/status/1259433046492798976\">the tweet read</a>.</p> \n<p>Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, was clear. \u201cYou should listen to the government of where you live,\u201d he said on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Communications with the UK government, he said, was in \u201cfits and starts\u201d.<br> Arlene Foster, the Northern Irish first minister, was less direct, but confirmed that her power-sharing administration was also taking a different stance. It had reaffirmed the lockdown arrangements in full and would relax it only slowly, beginning this week.</p> \n<p>She told Sky News: \u201cI think it is important that we listen to our chief medical officer and chief scientific officer, we listen to the modelling. [It] is important that we do what is right in our region of the United Kingdom moving forward and that\u2019s why we\u2019re coming with our road plan early next week.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Foster\u2019s tone was less blunt than Sturgeon\u2019s, Stormont\u2019s social media messaging was to the point. Northern Ireland\u2019s health minister, Robin Swan, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinSwannMoH/status/1259479941575577601\">tweeted their own</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobinSwannMoH/status/1259479941575577601\"> motif in yellow, blue and red,</a> which said: \u201cKeep staying at home; keep protecting the NHS; keep saving lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the surface, all three first ministers indicated that their differences with Downing Street were ones of messaging. All three insisted the prime minister was entitled to pursue policies that were right for England, and so too were they.</p> \n<p>All three also said in their jurisdictions, the R number \u2013 the rate at which the virus multiplies in the community \u2013 was still too close to 1 to risk too quickly easing the lockdown. Foster said it was about 0.8 to 0.9 in Northern Ireland, close to that in Scotland.</p> \n<p>All three said Johnson accepted, even embraced, the idea of the governments moving at the correct pace for their countries. They regretted, however, the fact that Johnson and his ministers had not matched that commitment with clear communication and collaborative policymaking.</p> \n<p>But underlying that polite framing was a significant political message, which Sturgeon\u2019s statement hinted at. She is determined to exude competence and discipline. Critics have accused Downing Street of lacking both.</p> \n<p>The devolved governments have advantages Johnson does not have. They are smaller and have fewer duties and pressures than his. They also benefit from the UK government\u2019s marshalling and investment in scientific expertise.</p> \n<p>Messaging from Sturgeon\u2019s government has had its flaws and failures: opposition MSPs have been charting the times her national clinical director, Jason Leitch, has given advice that was reversed within days. Also, on Sunday, her health secretary, Jeane Freeman, admitted that flawed official advice on transferring untested elderly hospital patients to care homes had been published on the Scottish government\u2019s website.</p> \n<p>But at the core of this weekend\u2019s discord are contrasts in leadership. In her daily briefings, Sturgeon has consciously displayed authority and clarity in messaging.</p> \n<p>Drakeford\u2019s administration has been in lockstep about Wales\u2019s lockdown stance. Sturgeon said she needed one thing from Johnson: a clear undertaking that whatever he said about the lockdown, he was only talking about one nation: England. Drakeford and Foster will agree.</p>",

[It] is important that we do what is right in our region of the United Kingdom moving forward and that\u2019s why we\u2019re coming with our road plan early next week.\u201d While Foster\u2019s tone was less blunt than Sturgeon\u2019s, Stormont\u2019s social media messaging was to the point. Northern Ireland\u2019s health minister, Robin Swan, tweeted their own motif in yellow, blue and red, which said: \u201cKeep staying at home; keep protecting the NHS; keep saving lives.\u201d On the surface, all three first ministers indicated that their differences with Downing Street were ones of messaging. All three insisted the prime minister was entitled to pursue policies that were right for England, and so too were they. All three also said in their jurisdictions, the R number \u2013 the rate at which the virus multiplies in the community \u2013 was still too close to 1 to risk too quickly easing the lockdown. Foster said it was about 0.8 to 0.9 in Northern Ireland, close to that in Scotland. All three said Johnson accepted, even embraced, the idea of the governments moving at the correct pace for their countries. They regretted, however, the fact that Johnson and his ministers had not matched that commitment with clear communication and collaborative policymaking. But underlying that polite framing was a significant political message, which Sturgeon\u2019s statement hinted at. She is determined to exude competence and discipline. Critics have accused Downing Street of lacking both. The devolved governments have advantages Johnson does not have. They are smaller and have fewer duties and pressures than his. They also benefit from the UK government\u2019s marshalling and investment in scientific expertise. Messaging from Sturgeon\u2019s government has had its flaws and failures: opposition MSPs have been charting the times her national clinical director, Jason Leitch, has given advice that was reversed within days. Also, on Sunday, her health secretary, Jeane Freeman, admitted that flawed official advice on transferring untested elderly hospital patients to care homes had been published on the Scottish government\u2019s website. But at the core of this weekend\u2019s discord are contrasts in leadership. In her daily briefings, Sturgeon has consciously displayed authority and clarity in messaging. Drakeford\u2019s administration has been in lockstep about Wales\u2019s lockdown stance. Sturgeon said she needed one thing from Johnson: a clear undertaking that whatever he said about the lockdown, he was only talking about one nation: England. Drakeford and Foster will agree.",

      "bodyText": "New York state is alerting all other parts of the US about a new mystery syndrome that appears to be related to Covid-19 and is causing severe illness and even death in very young children. At his coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Governor Andrew Cuomo said officials were \u201cputting on notice\u201d the health departments of all other 49 states. So far three children have died \u2013 a five-year-old in New York City, a seven-year-old in Westchester county and a teenager in Suffolk county in Long Island. All three showed signs of blood vessel inflammation, and also proved positive for the novel coronavirus. Cuomo said 85 cases of Covid-related illness in children were now being investigated by New York, up from 73 on Saturday. Two other deaths are being looked at. The syndrome has puzzled health experts because it appears to be striking young children largely in the toddler to elementary school age, who had been thought to be largely unaffected by coronavirus. The symptoms are also unusual. Instead of respiratory problems normally associated with Covid-19, the children are experiencing inflammation of blood vessels or the heart. Their symptoms are similar to toxic-shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, an illness with no known cause that mainly affects children under five. Cuomo opened up the possibility that several more children may have been hit by the mystery illness without health workers recognising what was happening. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that these cases were coming in and were not diagnosed as related to Covid, as they don\u2019t appear as Covid,\u201d he said. That is why New York is moving quickly to make sure all other states are on the look-out for the syndrome, Cuomo said, adding: \u201cIt may even be probable that this exists in other states and we want to make sure they are aware of it.\u201d In an attempt to better understand the new syndrome, the state is partnering with genetic researchers at the New York Genome Center and Rockefeller University to carry out genome and RNA sequencing.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump continued to fume over the Russia investigation on Sunday, more than a year after special counsel Robert Mueller filed his report without recommending charges against the president but only three days after the justice department said it would drop its case against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. \u201cThe biggest political crime in American history, by far!\u201d the president wrote in a tweet accompanying a conservative talk show host\u2019s claim that Barack Obama \u201cused his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. The tweet echoed previous messages retweeted by Trump, which earned rebukes for relaying conspiracy theories. On Sunday afternoon the president continued to send out a stream of tweets of memes and rightwing talking heads claiming an anti-Trump conspiracy. One tweet by Trump simply read: \u201cOBAMAGATE!\u201d Trump fired Flynn, a retired general, in early 2017, for lying to Vice-President Mike Pence about conversations with the Russian ambassador regarding sanctions levied by the Obama administration in retaliation for interference in the 2016 election. The US intelligence community has long held that such efforts were meant to tip the election towards Trump and away from Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI \u2013 which Trump has acknowledged \u2013 and co-operated with Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation of Russian interference after Trump fired FBI director James Comey. Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy but did lay out extensive links between Trump and Moscow and instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president. Flynn sought to change his plea while awaiting sentencing and the president championed his case, floating a possible pardon. On Thursday, in an act that stunned the US media, attorney general William Barr said the justice department would drop the case entirely. Trump and his supporters have loudly trumpeted the decision and across Saturday and Sunday the president unleashed a storm of retweets of supporters and conservative commentators attacking targets including Obama, Mueller, Comey and House intelligence committee chair Adam Schiff. The talkshow host retweeted by the president, Buck Sexton, is a former CIA analyst who now hosts a show which he says \u201cspeaks truth to power, and cuts through the liberal nonsense coming from the mainstream media\u201d. In another message retweeted by the president, Sexton called former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe \u2013 who Trump fired just short of retirement \u2013 \u201ca dishonorable partisan scumbag who has done incalculable damage to the reputation of the FBI and should be sitting in a cell for lying under oath\u201d. In February, the US justice department said it would not charge McCabe over claims he lied to investigators about a media leak. Like Comey, McCabe released a book in which he was highly critical of Trump, who he said acted like a mob boss. McCabe also wrote that Trump had unleashed a \u201cstrain of insanity\u201d in American public life. In his own tweets, Trump did not directly address comments by Obama himself which were reported by Yahoo News. The former president told associates the Flynn decision was \u201cthe kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic \u2013 not just institutional norms \u2013 but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk\u201d. But Trump\u2019s anger was evident. \u201cWhen are the Fake Journalists,\u201d he wrote on Sunday, \u201cwho received unwarranted Pulitzer Prizes for Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Scam, going to turn in their tarnished awards so they can be given to the real journalists who got it right. I\u2019ll give you the names, there are plenty of them!\u201d The president did not immediately name anyone. But in 2018 the Pulitzer committee did, awarding its prize for national reporting jointly to the Washington Post and the New York Times for \u201cdeeply sourced, relentlessly reported coverage in the public interest that dramatically furthered the nation\u2019s understanding of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and its connections to the Trump campaign, the president-elect\u2019s transition team and his eventual administration.\u201d Trump has further reason to resent the Pulitzer committee and question its choices. In 2019, for example, a New York Times team won a Pulitzer for an \u201cexhaustive 18-month investigation of President Donald Trump\u2019s finances that debunked his claims of self-made wealth and revealed a business empire riddled with tax dodges\u201d. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, was rewarded for \u201cuncovering President Trump\u2019s secret payoffs to two women during his campaign who claimed to have had affairs with him, and the web of supporters who facilitated the transactions, triggering criminal inquiries and calls for impeachment\u201d. Trump\u2019s actual impeachment, which he survived at trial in the Senate in February, concerned his attempts to have Ukraine investigate his political rivals. No reporter or news outlet won a 2020 Pulitzer, announced this week, for its coverage of that affair. Trump\u2019s focus on Sunday remained largely on the Russia investigation despite continuing developments in the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 1.3m Americans and killed nearly 80,000. With cases confirmed among White House aides close to the president, top public health experts including Dr Anthony Fauci in quarantine and Trump reported by the New York Times to be \u201cspooked\u201d, the president claimed in a rare non-Russia-related tweet: \u201cWe are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic.\u201d He also attacked Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president this year, over their response to the \u201cdisaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu\u201d in 2009. Trump also marked a special day in the calendar, tweeting in trademark capitals: \u201cHAPPY MOTHER\u2019S DAY!\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Holiday resorts across England are preparing to open at the end of May with trepidation. They have no idea what the summer holds for them. The battered tourism industry might enjoy a boom in staycation business, or the worst season in memory. It all depends on the advice of the British government.</p> <p>From Wednesday, people will be allowed to spend unlimited time outdoors and can drive to beauty spots in England. But there are still fears that mixed messages from the authorities could lead to tourists flocking to UK destinations, bringing a second wave of coronavirus. </p> <p>Holiday resorts such as Center Parcs and Haven have said all their sites will remain closed until about the end of May, but they, like many optimistic hotel operators, are accepting future bookings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/uk-tourism-indury-hoping-for-easing-of-coronavirus-lockdown\">UK tourism industry hoping for easing of coronavirus lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Haven has offered a free \u201ccoronavirus book with confidence guarantee on all 2020 and 2021 bookings\u201d, while the prices at Center Parcs were reported to have reached remarkably high levels in advance of its slated reopening on 29 May.</p> <p>\u201cFor any guests affected by our closure, we continue to offer a \u00a3100 discount on moving to a date in the future or a full cash refund,\u201d a spokesperson said.</p> <p>\u201cLike many businesses in our sector, we are awaiting further clarity from government so that we can plan reopening scenarios and adapt our offering based on current advice and guidelines in order to keep our staff and guests safe. We haven\u2019t seen a surge in demand, which reflects the uncertainty that we all face.\u201d</p> <p>But the virus continues to cast a shadow. Families of four can pay almost \u00a31,400 to stay at the Longleat Forest site in Wiltshire later this month, raising fears that holidaymakers flocking to the south-west, which has been less affected by the deadly impact of coronavirus than other regions, will bring infections with them.</p> <p>Although the economic pitfalls of the lockdown could hit hardest in areas dependent on tourism, officials in Cornwall are glad the county has not experienced an influx of people and hope that remains the case.</p> <p>Malcolm Bell of Visit Cornwall said: \u201cI hope there is clear and non-ambiguous messaging, because if there is wiggle room, we could see too many people making their own interpretation of rules to justify coming to Cornwall.\u201d</p> <p>However, the British Holiday and Home Parks Association \u2013 which has 2,000 members ranging from small camping grounds to caravan sites and large holiday parks \u2013 has said that despite the closure of all parks, there is \u201ca lot of interest for bookings\u201d and a \u201cbig latent demand to get out and about\u201d.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Little Touches, a Blackpool hotel and ticket agency, said: \u201cThere has been considerable interest from many people in visiting Blackpool, once the prime minister has reviewed the current lockdown procedures and said it is all systems go. You can rest assured that we will be pulling out all the stops to assist the resort\u2019s hoteliers in every way possible.\u201d</p> <p>But while online interest in UK holidays and getaways spiked on Friday as temperatures reached the mid-20s, it tapered off at the weekend, according to Google Trends.</p> <p>Research by VisitBritain, the official UK tourism authority, reportedly shows that the majority of Britons who had planned a domestic holiday this year in the UK \u2013 where there are about 13,000 hotels and more than 25,000 B&amp;Bs and guest houses \u2013 believe it is unlikely to go ahead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The mixed messages on holidays are UK-wide. The Scottish national tourist board has been sending confused signals to prospective tourists, tweeting pictures of popular sites including Jedburgh Abbey and the 16th-century Midhope Castle accompanied by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/stayhome\">#StayHome</a> hashtag. Various respondents declared that they were planning to visit Scotland as soon as possible.</p> <p>Visit Scotland has also launched a campaign urging Scots \u201cto spread the love of their towns, villages and cities to their neighbours, friends and visitors\u201d by sharing the view from their windows with the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/awindowonscotland\">#AWindowOnScotland</a>.</p> <p>A statement on its website read: \u201cIt is hoped the campaign will remind visitors, particularly Scots who holiday here and represent one of the country\u2019s most important tourism markets, of the diverse landscape, vibrant cities and stunning scenery that is waiting for them when this isolation period ends.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Visit Aberdeenshire posted an aerial video of the region\u2019s highlights on 5 May, inviting people to \u201cenjoy our beautiful corner of Scotland from the comfort of your own home\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 and 14 May 2020. Changes were made to clarify that it is only beauty spots in England to which people would be permitted to drive from Wednesday 13 May, and to remove a reference to resorts \u201cacross the UK\u201d preparing to open at the end of May.</p>",

The battered tourism industry might enjoy a boom in staycation business, or the worst season in memory. It all depends on the advice of the British government. From Wednesday, people will be allowed to spend unlimited time outdoors and can drive to beauty spots in England. But there are still fears that mixed messages from the authorities could lead to tourists flocking to UK destinations, bringing a second wave of coronavirus. Holiday resorts such as Center Parcs and Haven have said all their sites will remain closed until about the end of May, but they, like many optimistic hotel operators, are accepting future bookings. Haven has offered a free \u201ccoronavirus book with confidence guarantee on all 2020 and 2021 bookings\u201d, while the prices at Center Parcs were reported to have reached remarkably high levels in advance of its slated reopening on 29 May. \u201cFor any guests affected by our closure, we continue to offer a \u00a3100 discount on moving to a date in the future or a full cash refund,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cLike many businesses in our sector, we are awaiting further clarity from government so that we can plan reopening scenarios and adapt our offering based on current advice and guidelines in order to keep our staff and guests safe. We haven\u2019t seen a surge in demand, which reflects the uncertainty that we all face.\u201d But the virus continues to cast a shadow. Families of four can pay almost \u00a31,400 to stay at the Longleat Forest site in Wiltshire later this month, raising fears that holidaymakers flocking to the south-west, which has been less affected by the deadly impact of coronavirus than other regions, will bring infections with them. Although the economic pitfalls of the lockdown could hit hardest in areas dependent on tourism, officials in Cornwall are glad the county has not experienced an influx of people and hope that remains the case. Malcolm Bell of Visit Cornwall said: \u201cI hope there is clear and non-ambiguous messaging, because if there is wiggle room, we could see too many people making their own interpretation of rules to justify coming to Cornwall.\u201d However, the British Holiday and Home Parks Association \u2013 which has 2,000 members ranging from small camping grounds to caravan sites and large holiday parks \u2013 has said that despite the closure of all parks, there is \u201ca lot of interest for bookings\u201d and a \u201cbig latent demand to get out and about\u201d. A spokesperson for Little Touches, a Blackpool hotel and ticket agency, said: \u201cThere has been considerable interest from many people in visiting Blackpool, once the prime minister has reviewed the current lockdown procedures and said it is all systems go. You can rest assured that we will be pulling out all the stops to assist the resort\u2019s hoteliers in every way possible.\u201d But while online interest in UK holidays and getaways spiked on Friday as temperatures reached the mid-20s, it tapered off at the weekend, according to Google Trends. Research by VisitBritain, the official UK tourism authority, reportedly shows that the majority of Britons who had planned a domestic holiday this year in the UK \u2013 where there are about 13,000 hotels and more than 25,000 B&amp;Bs and guest houses \u2013 believe it is unlikely to go ahead. The mixed messages on holidays are UK-wide. The Scottish national tourist board has been sending confused signals to prospective tourists, tweeting pictures of popular sites including Jedburgh Abbey and the 16th-century Midhope Castle accompanied by the #StayHome hashtag. Various respondents declared that they were planning to visit Scotland as soon as possible. Visit Scotland has also launched a campaign urging Scots \u201cto spread the love of their towns, villages and cities to their neighbours, friends and visitors\u201d by sharing the view from their windows with the hashtag #AWindowOnScotland. A statement on its website read: \u201cIt is hoped the campaign will remind visitors, particularly Scots who holiday here and represent one of the country\u2019s most important tourism markets, of the diverse landscape, vibrant cities and stunning scenery that is waiting for them when this isolation period ends.\u201d Meanwhile, Visit Aberdeenshire posted an aerial video of the region\u2019s highlights on 5 May, inviting people to \u201cenjoy our beautiful corner of Scotland from the comfort of your own home\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 and 14 May 2020. Changes were made to clarify that it is only beauty spots in England to which people would be permitted to drive from Wednesday 13 May, and to remove a reference to resorts \u201cacross the UK\u201d preparing to open at the end of May.",

The result is this weekend\u2019s barrage of confused messaging over whether the lockdown is ending, as he tries to please both sides in the battle raging within the Tory party about how to respond to the coronavirus crisis. On the one hand, the rightwing hawks in his cabinet have been pushing him towards a swift return to business as usual to save the economy, setting out a roadmap to lifting the lockdown sooner rather than later. On the other, the more centrist doves, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have been pulling him in another direction, urging caution for fear of a second peak and more lost lives. The received wisdom is that Johnson is now on the side of the doves following his brush with death during a four-day spell in intensive care suffering from Covid-19. The start of his address on Sunday was cautious: he insisted that there was \u201cno immediate end to the lockdown\u201d and would allow only a gradual shift to unlimited exercise within household groups from Wednesday. However, his overall shift in tone, ditching the \u201cstay at home\u201d message in favour of a \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan, told a different story. That new message appears designed to appease some of his critics within the Conservatives \u2013 mostly on the Brexit-backing libertarian right of the party, who want to see more emphasis on people being trusted to take their own decisions about risk. The decision to set out an ambition to reopen schools and some shops in June and some hospitality venues in July \u2013 without the epidemic in care homes and hospitals yet under control \u2013 also shows he has also been swayed by the hawks in his cabinet. And a renewed emphasis on asking people to get back to work, even if they cannot observe social distancing, is another move that will please Tory MPs worried about the furlough scheme \u2013 while alarming trade unions concerned about the safety of their workforces. It is clear from the scathing reaction of Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, that there are serious worries in the devolved administrations about the risk of lifting the lockdown too soon and the chaotic messaging that is accompanying it. Supporters of Johnson argue that he is trying to strike a careful balance between setting out a roadmap for reopening the economy and making no promises about exactly when schools, shops, cafes and restaurants would reopen. He insisted that the government would ultimately be \u201cdriven not by mere hope or economic necessity, [but] \u2026 [by] the science, the data and public health\u201d. However, sooner or later Johnson is going to have to pick a side in the argument over whether the threat of a crashing economy requires taking some risks with public health \u2013 unless the epidemic starts to clear more quickly than scientists anticipate. And in the meantime, the public has been left with some of the biggest questions unanswered \u2013 especially about when they will be able to freely see their family and friends again.",

The UK\u2019s latest GDP figures will be published this week, covering the period from January to the end of March, and they are expected to show a dramatic fall, as the first quarterly estimate to reflect the initial impact of the coronavirus and lockdown measures.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Ten people were arrested on Sunday and a police officer was injured after protests against Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in Victoria. </strong>More than 100 demonstrators gathered in Melbourne\u2019s CBD to protest against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">\u201cself-isolating, social distancing, tracking apps and 5G being installed\u201d</a>. The protest, which was promoted on various Facebook groups linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and anti-vaxxers, featured signs about China and the Murray-Darling basin. People also chanted: \u201cArrest Bill Gates.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said there is a lot of \u201cvery silly misinformation\u201d out there, such as that the 5G network spreads the virus. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p><strong>Anthony Albanese will use a speech on Monday to demand a post-Covid-19 recovery \u201cin which no one is left behind\u201d</strong> and there is no return to \u201cthe law of the jungle and unfettered market forces\u201d.<strong> </strong>As the political contest shifts from the public health response to economic recovery, the Labor leader will call on the government to bring forward infrastructure projects and increase investment in affordable housing. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we are still saying, \u2018We are all in this together,\u2019 after the lockdown has come to an end \u2013 and not just saying it; living up to that standard,\u201d Albanese will say. \u201cLet\u2019s not snap back to insecure work, to jobseekers stuck in poverty, to scientists being ignored.\u201d Albanese makes his speech as a new report from Deloitte Access Economics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/11/society-must-not-snap-back-to-insecure-work-and-poverty-after-coronavirus-crisis-albanese-says\">warns that national income next financial year could fall nearly $200bn short of predictions</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Donald Trump continued to fume over the Russia investigation on Sunday</strong>, more than a year after the special counsel Robert Mueller filed his report without recommending charges against the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">but only three days after the US justice department said it would drop its case</a> against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Trump used Twitter to accuse Barack Obama of the \u201cthe biggest political crime in US history\u201d. The tweet accompanied a conservative talkshow host\u2019s claim that Obama \u201cused his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. Since Flynn\u2019s acquittal, Trump has attacked journalists who reported on the events leading to what he describes as \u201cthe impeachment scam\u201d. Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia in his inquiry but did lay out extensive links with Moscow and instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<p><strong>A new Australian green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in regional areas reliant on coalmining, according to a report by the

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 11 May. Top stories Ten people were arrested on Sunday and a police officer was injured after protests against Covid-19 lockdown restrictions in Victoria. More than 100 demonstrators gathered in Melbourne\u2019s CBD to protest against \u201cself-isolating, social distancing, tracking apps and 5G being installed\u201d. The protest, which was promoted on various Facebook groups linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and anti-vaxxers, featured signs about China and the Murray-Darling basin. People also chanted: \u201cArrest Bill Gates.\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said there is a lot of \u201cvery silly misinformation\u201d out there, such as that the 5G network spreads the virus. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space,\u201d he said. Anthony Albanese will use a speech on Monday to demand a post-Covid-19 recovery \u201cin which no one is left behind\u201d and there is no return to \u201cthe law of the jungle and unfettered market forces\u201d. As the political contest shifts from the public health response to economic recovery, the Labor leader will call on the government to bring forward infrastructure projects and increase investment in affordable housing. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we are still saying, \u2018We are all in this together,\u2019 after the lockdown has come to an end \u2013 and not just saying it; living up to that standard,\u201d Albanese will say. \u201cLet\u2019s not snap back to insecure work, to jobseekers stuck in poverty, to scientists being ignored.\u201d Albanese makes his speech as a new report from Deloitte Access Economics warns that national income next financial year could fall nearly $200bn short of predictions. Donald Trump continued to fume over the Russia investigation on Sunday, more than a year after the special counsel Robert Mueller filed his report without recommending charges against the president but only three days after the US justice department said it would drop its case against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Trump used Twitter to accuse Barack Obama of the \u201cthe biggest political crime in US history\u201d. The tweet accompanied a conservative talkshow host\u2019s claim that Obama \u201cused his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. Since Flynn\u2019s acquittal, Trump has attacked journalists who reported on the events leading to what he describes as \u201cthe impeachment scam\u201d. Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia in his inquiry but did lay out extensive links with Moscow and instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president. Australia A new Australian green steel industry could create tens of thousands of jobs in regional areas reliant on coalmining, according to a report by the Grattan Institute. The institute found green steel made with renewable hydrogen could become a multibillion-dollar export industry employing 25,000 people. A group of 10 former judges, leading lawyers, integrity experts and public servants have written to Scott Morrison asking for parliament to be recalled. The letter says the current lack of accountability and scrutiny is \u201cundemocratic and unprecedented\u201d. With all states bar Victoria moving to ease Covid-19 restrictions, the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has warned a spike in cases would mean a return to lockdown. From Friday private gatherings of up to five people will be permitted indoors in NSW, and up to 10 people outdoors. Coalition backbencher George Christensen has revived a diplomatic spat with China by threatening to summon the Chinese ambassador. The MP demanded to know why the ambassador threatened a trade boycott after Australia called for an international inquiry into coronavirus. The world Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, has described the death of Ahmaud Arbery as a \u201clynching\u201d and accused Donald Trump of inciting \u201covert acts of racism\u201d. Two white men were charged with murder and aggravated assault on Thursday after video of a confrontation involving an unarmed Arbery was made public. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has detailed the \u201cfirst careful steps\u201d to ease lockdown. English primary schools, shops and nurseries could partially reopen from June, with some cafes and restaurants open by July. Tara Reade\u2019s allegations of sexual misconduct against Joe Biden have divided the Democratic party along new lines. Republicans have seized on the division and started email campaigns asking why Democrats who supported the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford against Brett Kavanaugh have not yet stated whether they believe Reade. In Canada a DNA discovery has shed new light on the ancestral story of the First Nations Beothuk people.

Instead of a road map, Johnson gave the nation a \u201csketch of a roadmap\u201d. Instead of a way ahead, he provided only a \u201csense of a way ahead\u201d. Instead of strong government leadership, the onus was on individuals to do the right thing and experts to provide the necessary data and technology.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be changed by this experience, the prime minister told us, but he provided no vision of the future, merely a list of comparative adjectives \u2013 stronger, better, more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, more generous, more sharing.</p> \n  <p>Many of these ambitions could imply action on the longer-term problems facing the country and the world, such as the climate crisis. Or they could mean nothing at all. There were no details of anything new and positive that could emerge from the colossal suffering of the pandemic as the NHS and United Nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war. There was no mention either of a green new deal, which other nations plan to use as a vehicle for economic recovery. Nor were there details of how air quality improvements could be maintained, though many city mayors in the UK are already working on this.</p> \n  <p>Johnson encouraged more cycling, walking and a continuation of working from home, but when that was not possible, he urged people to drive rather than to use public transport. This is sensible given the need for physical distancing on trains and buses, but it added to the overall impression of a prime minister reacting to necessity rather than getting ahead of problems, pre-empting risks and forging a path illuminated by the \u201clight of science\u201d.</p> \n  <p>There should be more details about the future direction of the economy in the coming days, when Johnson addresses parliament, or when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveils stimulus plans. If the prime minister is serious about the nation returning to \u201crobust health\u201d, the science is clear that climate, nature and air quality must be part of the recovery.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:28:01.620Z\">at 9.28pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb860498f08c0a2409bb384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T20:17:02.565Z\">9.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM's message telling workers to return to factories is 'recipe for chaos', says TUC</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Frances O\u2019Grady,</strong> the TUC general secretary, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s speech as \u201ca recipe for chaos\u201d because safety measures for a return to work are not in place.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/FrancesOGrady/status/1259551752443002880\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lots of working people will feel confused and anxious after listening to Boris Johnson.<br> <br>Govt still hasn\u2019t published guidance on how workers will be kept safe.

This was the second time he\u2019s done it during this crisis. But tonight\u2019s event had an unhappy prequel, with No 10 having to damp down expectations created by newspaper headlines suggesting he would be promising lockdown \u201cfreedom\u201d, and he was further constrained tonight by the fact that much of the detail of what he is planning won\u2019t come until he presents his document to parliament tomorrow.</p> \n  <p>Still, it was a major speech. Here is a five-point analysis.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson offered a highly-conditional timetable for moving out of the most stringent aspects of lockdown while also stressing that most current restrictions need to remain in place</strong>. In terms of announcements that were genuinely new (in the sense that they had not been widely pre-briefed), what was most significant was what he said about what might happen in June and July. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6.</p> \n   <p>Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport.</p> \n   <p>And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But Johnson also stressed that these dates were \u201cdependent on a series of big ifs\u201d and, compared to other lockdown plans, this timetable was remarkably cursory. The Irish government, for example, has published a<a href=\"https://www.gov.ie/en/news/58bc8b-taoiseach-announces-roadmap-for-reopening-society-and-business-and-u/\"> \u201croadmap for reopening society and business\u201d</a> that proposes a five-phase easing of restrictions, with specific measures planned of five specific dates going up to 10 August. According to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-lockdown-to-last-three-more-weeks-62z2brv36\">a report in the Times last week (paywall)</a>, Johnson was under pressure from \u201cdatists\u201d in cabinet to give dates for when certain measures would be relaxed. On the basis of this speech, the \u201cdatists\u201d secured only to the bare minimum.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson has actually toughened the lockdown much more than he has eased it.</strong> The most significant change to the status quo came when he confirmed reports that people arriving in the UK by air will be subject to quarantine. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5#block-5eb844428f0858b1a81077d5\"> 7.14pm.)</a> That is a remarkable shift, particularly for someone who gave a speech earlier this year saying he wanted to resist pressure for barriers to go up. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed#block-5eb825b88f08c0a2409bb1ed\">6.30pm.) </a>Johnson also said that he would increase the fines for the small number of people who break social distancing rules. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4#block-5eb843788f08c0a2409bb2c4\">7.11pm.)</a> This will be an England-only measure, and it appears to go against the advice of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. As was revealed this afternoon (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3#block-5eb81fc28f0858b1a81076e3\">4.56pm)</a>, in response to a proposal in April for greater penalties on lockdown offenders, Sage said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The \u201ccareful\u201d steps to ease the lockdown this week announced as new measures in practice amounted to little more than saying that sunbathing is allowed, in England. </strong>Johnson said two things would be happening this week. First, people would be encouraged to go to work if they cannot work from home. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But for most of the last seven weeks the government\u2019s line has been that people should go to work if they can\u2019t work from home. When the government first announced the lockdown it put out guidance saying \u201call non-essential premises must now close\u201d, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-pmqs-boris-johnson-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-recess?page=with:block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24#block-5e7b2d368f0878a2a48a9c24\">this line was swiftly removed from the document</a> because it was not the message the government wanted to give out. And ministers infuriated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, by refusing to back his call for all construction work to halt.</p> \n  <p>Second, Johnson said that from Wednesday people would be able to take more exercise. Referring to England, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise.</p> \n   <p>You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, unlike in Scotland and Wales, in England the lockdown restrictions never said that people could only go out once a day for exercise (even though ministers sometimes said people should exercise just once a day). And<a href=\"https://www.college.police.uk/What-we-do/COVID-19/Documents/What-constitutes-a-reasonable-excuse.pdf\"> official police guidance (pdf)</a> said people could drive to another destination to exercise. All that really seems to be new is that people can sunbath (not something that previously seemed to count as a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be out under the regulations).</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson announce a new five-step covid alert system that will be used to help decide when lockdown measures can be lifted.</strong> (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf#block-5eb8428b8f08c0a2409bb2bf\">7.07pm.)</a> This seems very similar to an approach announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, <a href=\"https://sacoronavirus.co.za/2020/04/23/statement-by-president-cyril-ramaphosa-on-south-africas-response-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-union-buildings-tshwane/\">in a speech last month.</a> Here is the South African system.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/34859ebafb21d0757953e05469b99aa5b649e1db/0_0_1498_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight\" width=\"1000\" height=\"821\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa\u2019s coronavirus alert system - similar to the one announced by Boris Johnson tonight</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: South African government</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But Johnson did not explain which lockdown measures will apply for which alert level. (Perhaps there will be more detail in the document being published tomorrow.) He also said changes to the alert level will be triggered primarily by changes to R, the reproduction number (which shows the coronavirus infectivity rate). But all he could say about R was that it was between 0.5 and 0.9.

Over the last three months (like most politicians, and even many scientists), he has had to drastically revise his assessment of the threat it poses and what needs to be done. </p> \n  <p>Here are nine quotes that show how much his stance has changed.</p> \n  <p><strong>1 Johnson says he won\u2019t let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</strong> One of his first public references to coronavirus came in a speech devoted to Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">at Greenwich on 3 February</a>, when he said he would not let coronavirus push him towards protectionism.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And in that context, we are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion, of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is somewhat hard to square with the news that Johnson is now planning to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK, although this is a public health policy, not a trade policy.</p> \n  <p><strong>2 Johnson avoids being alarmist as he publishes the government\u2019s first coronavirus action plan.</strong> The document was published on 3 March, when Johnson attended a press conference with Sir Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/03/labour-facing-one-of-worst-local-election-performances-in-recent-history-leaked-party-report-suggests-live-news?page=with:block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b#block-5e5e51bc8f086a28115b6b7b\">Johnson stressed that most people had no need to fear the illness.</a> He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>3 Johnson calls for a balanced approach.</strong> Two days later, on 5 March, Johnson told ITV\u2019s This Morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/05/chief-medical-officer-chris-whitty-questioned-by-mps-live-news?page=with:block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17#block-5e60df108f08c2df6d273b17\">at that point it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d.</a> He also said the government was going for a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance.</p> \n   <p>I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In fact no one in the UK was saying the government should just \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, but at that point government advisers were telling ministers that if they tried to suppress coronavirus completely, they would just risk a worse second peak later in the herd. A more balanced approach would allow \u201cherd immunity\u201d to develop, they argued.</p> \n  <p><strong>4 Johnson changes tone, and warns that \u201cmany more\u201d people will die.</strong><em> </em>At another Downing Street press conference, on 12 March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630#block-5e6a75f18f085f0b8d947630\">he said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This was also the moment when Johnson said<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796#block-5e6a75358f087df56e4c7796\"> the government was no longer trying to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus</a> and had instead moved to the stage where it was focusing on \u201cdelay\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>5 Johnson tells people to stay at home if possible.</strong> With the crisis intensifying, at the first of what No 10 said would be daily press conferences, Johnson announced on 16 March what amounted to a soft lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/16/boris-johnson-press-conference-coronavirus-live-firms-could-soon-be-allowed-to-run-reduced-services-because-of-coronavirus-shapps-suggests-politics-live?page=with:block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1#block-5e6fb2518f085e564ad852d1\">He said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We need people to start working from home where they possibly can.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine \u2013 and you should do this as little as you can.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>7 Johnson himself then went down with coronavirus, and he ended up in hospital, where he spent three nights in intensive care.</strong> On leaving hospital he recorded <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-04-12/coronavirus-prime-minister-boris-johnson-s-easter-sunday-message-in-full/\">an Easter Sunday message</a> (the resurrection video) in which he movingly described how he had come close to death, thanked the nurses who had looked after him, and paid tribute to the contribution of the public. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset - our National Health Service.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>8 On 27 April, on his first day back at work in Downing Street after his recuperation, Johnson says that preparations to ease the lockdown have been under way for weeks, but that the government will proceed cautiously.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2#block-5ea696548f08fa2bdcb1bff2\">He said: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity.

It is a meeting note, dated 1 April, prepared for a Sage meeting on 2 April.</p> \n  <p>The newly released material is everything from point 3, starting with the headline: \u201cSpecific comments about new suggestions for improving adherence within the Framework (27 March)\u201d. It shows Sage rejected three proposals to toughen the lockdown.</p> \n  <p>Here is the key extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The framework proposes four new suggestions for increasing adherence, numbered as options 17 to 20 that SPI-B have not commented on before. These focus on: 17) increasing the financial penalties imposed; 18) introducing self-validation for movements; 19) reducing exercise and/or shopping; 20) reducing non-home working. We have reservations about options 17 to 19. </p> \n   <p>First, we are unclear what the evidence base is that the targeted behaviours are a substantial contribution to disease transmission, particularly given the high adherence rates currently observed in the community. Is there evidence, for example, that exercise conducted more than 1km away from the house leads to higher rates of transmission than exercise conducted within 1km of the house? Indeed, for this option, there is a risk that reducing the ability of people to apply some flexibility in choosing where to exercise will increase risk by preventing people from spreading out in nearby open space. Tightening restrictions without clear epidemiological need may lose support among people who have been attempting to adhere.</p> \n   <p>Second, the implicit assumption underlying options 17 to 19 is that people lack motivation to adhere to current guidance. This may apply to some specific subgroups (the example of young men has been given), but broadly the current levels of adherence we are witnessing suggest this is not the issue. </p> \n   <p>Third, there are equity issues within options 17 to 19. Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households, while the assumption that printing and completing paperwork is straightforward for all households can also be challenged. The assumption underlying restrictions on shopping frequency is that people can afford to buy in larger quantities.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson urged the country to take its first tentative steps out of lockdown this week in an address to the nation that was immediately condemned as being divisive, confusing and vague. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that Johnson\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d message was so poor she did not even know what it meant. (See 3.16pm.) In a significant fracturing of the four-nation approach to coronavirus which until now has mostly prevailed, the Scottish and Welsh governments and the Northern Ireland executive all rejected No 10\u2019s new messaging and said they would stick with the current \u201cstay at home\u201d advice for citizens. Johnson has been warned by trade unions that ordering many people back to work from as early as Monday is a \u201crecipe for chaos\u201d without urgent action to safeguard workers\u2019 health. Doctors and police reacted to the government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan and Boris Johnson\u2019s lockdown-easing measures with warnings of growing non-compliance and the \u201cimpossibility\u201d of policing . There is an analysis of Johnson\u2019s speech here. And the BBC\u2019s Helena Wilkinson has been tweeting what some of tomorrow\u2019s papers are saying about Johnson\u2019s speech. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. There is more coronavirus coverage on our global coronavirus live blog here. These are from my colleague Martin Kettle. Boris Johnson has posted this on Twitter, implying he will be taking the afternoon press conference himself. Before the 5pm press conference he is also due to give a statement to MPs about his roadmap for easing the lockdown. Manufacturers have made clear they are still not clear on the conditions which will allow staff to safely return to work. They are asking the government to make its guidance explicit, including standards of PPE where that is required. Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation said: It is critical that there is clear advice on how to do that, and an understanding that firms will be helped to comply as we navigate uncharted waters, and not punished for inadvertent errors. In many parts of manufacturing people will need to work much more closely than 2 metres apart. It is vital that the guidance is explicit about how this may be achieved safely. Where this requires PPE, employers across the country are seeking clear advice on what products are needed, what standard they should be produced to, and confidence that they can be sourced in ways which does not reduce supply to the NHS, care homes and front line workers. Downing Street has released this graphic that seeks to explain the PM\u2019s strategy. It\u2019s not very detailed. Unlike the more informative version (pdf) published by the Scottish government (see below), it also fails to acknowledge the likelihood of an easing of the lockdown measures leading to some resurgence of the virus. Richard Burge, chief executive of London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is urging businesses not to return to work tomorrow saying it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d until explicit guidance from the prime minister. Echoing the stance of Sadiq Khan, the London mayor (see 9.12pm), Burge said: Having heard the prime minister this evening, my strong and unequivocal advice to London businesses is not to change your plans for tomorrow. You have not been given sufficient information on how to get your employees safely to work, nor how to keep them safe while they are there. We hope that the statement in parliament and the promised guidance documents will enable business to prepare. At the moment, it would be foolish for any business leader to encourage staff not already undertaking essential work to do anything but to continue to work from home tomorrow if they can do so. Boris Johnson has promised to \u201cshine the light of science\u201d to help the UK emerge from the coronavirus gloom, but there were disappointingly few indications in Sunday\u2019s speech that he plans to direct that same beam of knowledge towards a clean, green recovery of the nation\u2019s economic health. The address to the nation was cautious and tentative. Instead of a road map, Johnson gave the nation a \u201csketch of a roadmap\u201d. Instead of a way ahead, he provided only a \u201csense of a way ahead\u201d. Instead of strong government leadership, the onus was on individuals to do the right thing and experts to provide the necessary data and technology. The UK will be changed by this experience, the prime minister told us, but he provided no vision of the future, merely a list of comparative adjectives \u2013 stronger, better, more resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, more generous, more sharing. Many of these ambitions could imply action on the longer-term problems facing the country and the world, such as the climate crisis. Or they could mean nothing at all. There were no details of anything new and positive that could emerge from the colossal suffering of the pandemic as the NHS and United Nations emerged from the ruins of the second world war. There was no mention either of a green new deal, which other nations plan to use as a vehicle for economic recovery. Nor were there details of how air quality improvements could be maintained, though many city mayors in the UK are already working on this. Johnson encouraged more cycling, walking and a continuation of working from home, but when that was not possible, he urged people to drive rather than to use public transport. This is sensible given the need for physical distancing on trains and buses, but it added to the overall impression of a prime minister reacting to necessity rather than getting ahead of problems, pre-empting risks and forging a path illuminated by the \u201clight of science\u201d. There should be more details about the future direction of the economy in the coming days, when Johnson addresses parliament, or when the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveils stimulus plans. If the prime minister is serious about the nation returning to \u201crobust health\u201d, the science is clear that climate, nature and air quality must be part of the recovery. Frances O\u2019Grady, the TUC general secretary, has described Boris Johnson\u2019s speech as \u201ca recipe for chaos\u201d because safety measures for a return to work are not in place. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has issued his response to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. He is still using the \u201cstay at home\u201d message, and he is not encouraging Londoners to go to work in the way that Johnson tentatively was. In a statement, Khan said: I want to be as clear as possible with Londoners - social distancing measures are still in place. Lockdown hasn\u2019t been lifted and we all still need to play our part in stopping the spread of Covid-19. You must still stay at home as much as possible and keep a safe two-metre distance from other people at all times when you are out. Everyone must continue to work from home if they possibly can. You must not use public transport for any unnecessary journeys. If you really have to travel, please avoid rush hour. Please walk or cycle whenever possible. We still have a long way to go to defeat this virus and we have not returned to life as it was before ... I urge the government to continue to work with employers, employees and trades unions to design a proper plan for how we can keep everyone safe as they return to work. All Londoners must continue to abide by the rules, and stay home as much as possible, so that we can continue to save lives and protect the NHS. Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, has said that Boris Johnson\u2019s new coronavirus messaging (see 1.37pm) is confusing and dangerous. In a statement on the PM\u2019s speech, Price said: Boris Johnson claims to be the prime minister of the whole United Kingdom but he has acted tonight as England\u2019s prime minister \u2013 not a responsible one either. His message is confusing and dangerous. You cannot stay alert to something you can\u2019t see. The UK government has cut itself adrift of the three-nation approach which now exists between Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There is no clearer and simpler message than \u2018stay at home\u2019. The Police Federation of England and Wales has said that police officers have been put under extreme pressure because of the mixed messages coming out about the lockdown. In a statement on the PM\u2019s speech, John Apter, the federation\u2019s national chair, said: The government has, as expected, made a decision to relax its lockdown guidance in England. This comes following a week of mixed messages and the release of some information which, fuelled by media speculation, meant many people acted as though the lockdown had already ended. This is putting extreme pressure on my colleagues who are on the frontline trying to enforce legislation in these most challenging of times. What we need from the prime minister and the government now is clear and unambiguous messaging and guidance, explaining what exactly is expected of the public, so that my colleagues can do their level best to police it. Police officers will continue to do their best, but their work must be based on crystal clear guidance, not loose rules that are left open to interpretation - because that will be grossly unfair on officers whose job is already challenging. If the message of what is expected of the public is not clear then it will make the job of policing this legislation almost impossible. Boris Johnson seems to like the idea of making a Gaullist address to the nation on evening TV. This was the second time he\u2019s done it during this crisis. But tonight\u2019s event had an unhappy prequel, with No 10 having to damp down expectations created by newspaper headlines suggesting he would be promising lockdown \u201cfreedom\u201d, and he was further constrained tonight by the fact that much of the detail of what he is planning won\u2019t come until he presents his document to parliament tomorrow. Still, it was a major speech. Here is a five-point analysis. Johnson offered a highly-conditional timetable for moving out of the most stringent aspects of lockdown while also stressing that most current restrictions need to remain in place. In terms of announcements that were genuinely new (in the sense that they had not been widely pre-briefed), what was most significant was what he said about what might happen in June and July. He said: In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport. And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. But Johnson also stressed that these dates were \u201cdependent on a series of big ifs\u201d and, compared to other lockdown plans, this timetable was remarkably cursory. The Irish government, for example, has published a \u201croadmap for reopening society and business\u201d that proposes a five-phase easing of restrictions, with specific measures planned of five specific dates going up to 10 August. According to a report in the Times last week (paywall), Johnson was under pressure from \u201cdatists\u201d in cabinet to give dates for when certain measures would be relaxed. On the basis of this speech, the \u201cdatists\u201d secured only to the bare minimum. Johnson has actually toughened the lockdown much more than he has eased it. The most significant change to the status quo came when he confirmed reports that people arriving in the UK by air will be subject to quarantine. (See 7.14pm.) That is a remarkable shift, particularly for someone who gave a speech earlier this year saying he wanted to resist pressure for barriers to go up. (See 6.30pm.) Johnson also said that he would increase the fines for the small number of people who break social distancing rules. (See 7.11pm.) This will be an England-only measure, and it appears to go against the advice of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. As was revealed this afternoon (see 4.56pm), in response to a proposal in April for greater penalties on lockdown offenders, Sage said: Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households. The \u201ccareful\u201d steps to ease the lockdown this week announced as new measures in practice amounted to little more than saying that sunbathing is allowed, in England. Johnson said two things would be happening this week. First, people would be encouraged to go to work if they cannot work from home. He said: We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. But for most of the last seven weeks the government\u2019s line has been that people should go to work if they can\u2019t work from home. When the government first announced the lockdown it put out guidance saying \u201call non-essential premises must now close\u201d, but this line was swiftly removed from the document because it was not the message the government wanted to give out. And ministers infuriated Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, by refusing to back his call for all construction work to halt. Second, Johnson said that from Wednesday people would be able to take more exercise. Referring to England, he said: And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household. But, unlike in Scotland and Wales, in England the lockdown restrictions never said that people could only go out once a day for exercise (even though ministers sometimes said people should exercise just once a day). And official police guidance (pdf) said people could drive to another destination to exercise. All that really seems to be new is that people can sunbath (not something that previously seemed to count as a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d to be out under the regulations). Johnson announce a new five-step covid alert system that will be used to help decide when lockdown measures can be lifted. (See 7.07pm.) This seems very similar to an approach announced by Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president, in a speech last month. Here is the South African system. But Johnson did not explain which lockdown measures will apply for which alert level. (Perhaps there will be more detail in the document being published tomorrow.) He also said changes to the alert level will be triggered primarily by changes to R, the reproduction number (which shows the coronavirus infectivity rate). But all he could say about R was that it was between 0.5 and 0.9. In Germany the Robert Koch Institute publishes a daily bulletin (like this one - pdf) which gives R to the nearest two decimal points. Johnson claimed that he was speaking as prime minister of the United Kingdom (see 7.04pm) - although the row about the new No 10 \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan showed that in important respects he is acting as just prime minister of England. There is no formal position of English PM in the UK constitution, but devolution has made it an implicit component of the prime minister\u2019s job and, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland refusing to follow Johnson in his coronavirus messaging today, he was left sounding more England-only than normal. Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, has issued his response to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. In it he stresses that he has already published a roadmap for Wales, and that Wales will not be reopening schools on 1 June. He says: The prime minister also set out his roadmap for the future. This is at an early stage because it depends on how the virus behaves over the coming weeks and months. Two weeks ago, I published a framework to lead Wales out of the pandemic. This has helped us decide that schools will not return to normal on 1 June. We will continue to make decisions which are right for Wales, using information and expert advice about how coronavirus is circulating here to keep us safe. The view of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech from senior police sources was that key parts of their role in enforcing the lockdown were in effect over. \u201cImpossible,\u201d said one senior source, referring to the prospect of enforcing the lockdown other than policing larger groups of people out of their homes. The dropping of the \u201cstay at home\u201d message, it is feared, will cause confusion, making the restrictions \u201cunpoliceable\u201d. New guidance was hurriedly being drawn up for officers around the country about the new rules, and what they should and should not police. One source with close knowledge of the police\u2019s efforts enforcing coronavirus rules, when asked how easy the new rules would be to enforce, said: \u201cNot a chance in hell.\u201d In an interview with Sky News Ian Blackford, the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, went even further than Nicola Sturgeon in criticising the PM\u2019s speech. He said that Johnson\u2019s proposal for some hospitality outlets to open in July (see 7.13pm) filled him \u201cwith horror\u201d. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, told BBC Scotland that Boris Johnson needed to be much clearer that his proposed easing of the lockdown only related to England. \u201cPretty much everything he said in that statement applied to England,\u201d she said. There were no current plans in Scotland to reopen primary schools or building sites, or to suggest people start playing sports, she said. She went on: He is the prime minister of the UK. I\u2019m not trying to gainsay that, but these restrictions are in place legally separately in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and therefore we have a duty to take decision in our own jurisdictions about the speed with which we lift those. [It] is incumbent on him, maybe a bit more strongly than he did tonight, to stress that when he\u2019s talking about lifting these restrictions, he\u2019s talking for England. We really have such a duty just now to be as clear as possible. Downing Street has just released a joint statement from the British and French governments, after a call between Boris Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. It says the French will be exempt from the UK\u2019s proposed quarantine restrictions. (See 7.14pm.) The joint statement says Johnson and Macron spoke today. It goes on: They stressed the need for close bilateral, European and international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19. The leaders spoke about the need to manage the risk of new transmissions arising from abroad, as the rate of coronavirus decreases domestically. In this regard, the prime minister and the president agreed to work together in taking forward appropriate border measures. This cooperation is particularly necessary for the management of our common border. No quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage; any measures on either side would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner. A working group between the two governments will be set up to ensure this consultation throughout the coming weeks. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has issued this response to the prime minister\u2019s speech. This statement raises more questions than it answers, and we see the prospect of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland pulling in different directions. The prime minister appears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work without a clear plan for safety or clear guidance as to how to get there without using public transport. What the country wanted tonight was clarity and consensus, but we haven\u2019t got either of those. The full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech is here, on the No 10 website. Here is my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s news story about the speech. Johnson winds up by explaining why he is being so cautious. The next phase could be more dangerous, he says. We have been through the initial peak \u2013 but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous. We have a route, and we have a plan, and everyone in government has the all-consuming pressure and challenge to save lives, restore livelihoods and gradually restore the freedoms that we need. But in the end this is a plan that everyone must make work. And when I look at what you have done already. The patience and common sense you have shown. The fortitude of the elderly whose isolation we all want to end as fast as we can. The incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS staff, our care workers. The devotion and self-sacrifice of all those in every walk of life who are helping us to beat this disease. Police, bus drivers, train drivers, pharmacists, supermarket workers, road hauliers, bin collectors, cleaners, security guards, postal workers, our teachers and a thousand more. The scientists who are working round the clock to find a vaccine. When I think of the millions of everyday acts of kindness and thoughtfulness that are being performed across this country. And that have helped to get us through this first phase. I know that we can use this plan to get us through the next. And if we can\u2019t do it by those dates, and if the alert level won\u2019t allow it, we will simply wait and go on until we have got it right. We will come back from this devilish illness. We will come back to health, and robust health. And though the UK will be changed by this experience, I believe we can be stronger and better than ever before. More resilient, more innovative, more economically dynamic, but also more generous and more sharing. But for now we must stay alert, control the virus and save lives. Thank you very much. Johnson confirms quarantine will be introduced for new arrivals. And to prevent reinfection from abroad, I am serving notice that it will soon be the time \u2013 with transmission significantly lower \u2013 to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air. And it is because of your efforts to get the R down and the number of infections down here, that this measure will now be effective. And of course we will be monitoring our progress locally, regionally, and nationally and if there are outbreaks, if there are problems, we will not hesitate to put on the brakes. Johnson goes on to explain what might happen in June and July. In step two \u2013 at the earliest by June 1 \u2013 after half term \u2013 we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools, in stages, beginning with reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Our ambition is that secondary pupils facing exams next year will get at least some time with their teachers before the holidays. And we will shortly be setting out detailed guidance on how to make it work in schools and shops and on transport. And step three - at the earliest by July - and subject to all these conditions and further scientific advice; if and only if the numbers support it, we will hope to re-open at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they are safe and enforce social distancing. Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health. And I must stress again that all of this is conditional, it all depends on a series of big Ifs. It depends on all of us \u2013 the entire country \u2013 to follow the advice, to observe social distancing, and to keep that R down. Johnson announces the \u201cfirst, careful steps\u201d to ease the lockdown. Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures. And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible \u2013 because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can\u2019t work from home. And to ensure you are safe at work we have been working to establish new guidance for employers to make workplaces COVID-secure. And when you do go to work, if possible do so by car or even better by walking or bicycle. But just as with workplaces, public transport operators will also be following COVID-secure standards. And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household. You must obey the rules on social distancing and to enforce those rules we will increase the fines for the small minority who break them. And so every day, with ever increasing data, we will be monitoring the R and the number of new infections, and the progress we are making, and if we as a nation begin to fulfil the conditions I have set out, then in the next few weeks and months we may be able to go further. Johnson says the lockdown can\u2019t end this week. And yet when I look at where we are tonight, we have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below 1. And though we have made progress in satisfying at least some of the conditions I have given, we have by no means fulfilled all of them. And so no, this is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Johnson explains how local flare-ups will be tackled. So that \u2013 all told \u2013 we are testing literally hundreds of thousands of people every day. We have made fast progress on testing \u2013 but there is so much more to do now, and we can. When this began, we hadn\u2019t seen this disease before, and we didn\u2019t fully understand its effects. With every day we are getting more and more data. We are shining the light of science on this invisible killer, and we will pick it up where it strikes. Because our new system will be able in time to detect local flare-ups \u2013 in your area \u2013 as well as giving us a national picture. Johnson announces plans for a coronavirus alert level system. And to chart our progress and to avoid going back to square one, we are establishing a new covid alert system run by a new joint biosecurity centre. And that covid alert level will be determined primarily by R and the number of coronavirus cases. And in turn that covid alert level will tell us how tough we have to be in our social distancing measures \u2013 the lower the level the fewer the measures. The higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.There will be five alert levels. Level 1 means the disease is no longer present in the UK and level 5 is the most critical \u2013 the kind of situation we could have had if the NHS had been overwhelmed. Over the period of the lockdown we have been in level 4 and it is thanks to your sacrifice we are now in a position to begin to move in steps to level 3. And as we go everyone will have a role to play in keeping the R down. By staying alert and following the rules. And to keep pushing the number of infections down there are two more things we must do. We must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS, and though the numbers are coming down sharply now, there is plainly much more to be done. And if we are to control this virus, then we must have a world-beating system for testing potential victims, and for tracing their contacts. Johnson stresses he will stick to his five tests for ending the lockdown. And since our priority is to protect the public and save lives, we cannot move forward unless we satisfy the five tests. We must protect our NHS. We must see sustained falls in the death rate. We must see sustained and considerable falls in the rate of infection. We must sort out our challenges in getting enough PPE to the people who need it, and yes, it is a global problem but we must fix it. And last, we must make sure that any measures we take do not force the reproduction rate of the disease \u2013 the R \u2013 back up over 1, so that we have the kind of exponential growth we were facing a few weeks ago. Johnson says he is setting out \u201cthe first sketch of a roadmap\u201d of lifting the lockdown. So I want to provide tonight \u2013 for you \u2013 the shape of a plan to address both fears. Both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a roadmap for reopening society. A sense of the way ahead, and when and how and on what basis we will take the decisions to proceed. I will be setting out more details in parliament tomorrow and taking questions from the public in the evening. I have consulted across the political spectrum, across all four nations of the UK. And though different parts of the country are experiencing the pandemic at different rates, and though it is right to be flexible in our response, I believe that as prime minister of the United Kingdom \u2013 Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 there is a strong resolve to defeat this together. And today a general consensus on what we could do. And I stress \u2018could\u2019. Because although we have a plan, it is a conditional plan. He says the death rate is coming down. And it is thanks to your effort and sacrifice in stopping the spread of this disease that the death rate is coming down and hospital admissions are coming down. And thanks to you we have protected our NHS and saved many thousands of lives. And so I know \u2013 you know \u2013 that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike.We must stay alert. We must continue to control the virus and save lives. And yet we must also recognise that this campaign against the virus has come at colossal cost to our way of life. We can see it all around us in the shuttered shops and abandoned businesses and darkened pubs and restaurants. And there are millions of people who are both fearful of this terrible disease, and at the same time also fearful of what this long period of enforced inactivity will do to their livelihoods and their mental and physical wellbeing. To their futures and the futures of their children. He continues to praise the public. And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly. You have put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing. Because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it\u2019s the only way to defeat the coronavirus \u2013 the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime. And though the death toll has been tragic, and the suffering immense, and though we grieve for all those we have lost, it is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could have been a catastrophe in which the reasonable worst case scenario was half a million fatalities. Boris Johnson is starting his speech. It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2013 your freedom \u2013 of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war. Boris Johnson will be delivering his speech about easing the lockdown shortly. No 10 has released an embargoed copy to journalists, and so I should be able to post his words in full as soon as he has delivered them. From the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Tonight\u2019s speech from Boris Johnson will be one of the most important he has given on coronavirus. Over the last three months (like most politicians, and even many scientists), he has had to drastically revise his assessment of the threat it poses and what needs to be done. Here are nine quotes that show how much his stance has changed. 1 Johnson says he won\u2019t let coronavirus push him towards protectionism. One of his first public references to coronavirus came in a speech devoted to Britain\u2019s post-Brexit future at Greenwich on 3 February, when he said he would not let coronavirus push him towards protectionism. And in that context, we are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric, when barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage, then at that moment humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion, of the right of the populations of the earth to buy and sell freely among each other. This is somewhat hard to square with the news that Johnson is now planning to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK, although this is a public health policy, not a trade policy. 2 Johnson avoids being alarmist as he publishes the government\u2019s first coronavirus action plan. The document was published on 3 March, when Johnson attended a press conference with Sir Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Johnson stressed that most people had no need to fear the illness. He said: Let me be absolutely clear that for the overwhelming majority of people who contract the virus this will be a mild disease from which they will speedily and fully recover as we have already seen. 3 Johnson calls for a balanced approach. Two days later, on 5 March, Johnson told ITV\u2019s This Morning that at that point it should be \u201cbusiness as usual for the overwhelming majority of people in this country\u201d. He also said the government was going for a \u201cbalanced\u201d approach. He said: One of the theories is perhaps you could take it in on the chin, take it all in one go and allow the disease to move through the population without really taking as many draconian measures. I think we need to strike a balance. I think it would be better if we take all the measures that we can now just to stop the peak of the disease being as difficult for the NHS as it might. I think there are things we may be able to do. In fact no one in the UK was saying the government should just \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, but at that point government advisers were telling ministers that if they tried to suppress coronavirus completely, they would just risk a worse second peak later in the herd. A more balanced approach would allow \u201cherd immunity\u201d to develop, they argued. 4 Johnson changes tone, and warns that \u201cmany more\u201d people will die. At another Downing Street press conference, on 12 March, he said: I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. This was also the moment when Johnson said the government was no longer trying to \u201ccontain\u201d coronavirus and had instead moved to the stage where it was focusing on \u201cdelay\u201d. 5 Johnson tells people to stay at home if possible. With the crisis intensifying, at the first of what No 10 said would be daily press conferences, Johnson announced on 16 March what amounted to a soft lockdown. He said: We need people to start working from home where they possibly can. And you should avoid pubs, clubs, theatres and other such social venues. 6 A week later Johnson announces the full lockdown. In an evening TV address on 23 March he said: You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine \u2013 and you should do this as little as you can. 7 Johnson himself then went down with coronavirus, and he ended up in hospital, where he spent three nights in intensive care. On leaving hospital he recorded an Easter Sunday message (the resurrection video) in which he movingly described how he had come close to death, thanked the nurses who had looked after him, and paid tribute to the contribution of the public. He said: We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset - our National Health Service. 8 On 27 April, on his first day back at work in Downing Street after his recuperation, Johnson says that preparations to ease the lockdown have been under way for weeks, but that the government will proceed cautiously. He said: This is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle [coronavirus] to the floor, and so it follows that this is the moment of opportunity. This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk. 9 Johnson stresses that there could be an even bigger coronavirus outbreak if the government mishandled the lockdown. At his most recent press conference, on 30 April, he said: It is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain. This is from Nicki Credland, chair of the British Association of Critical Care Nurses, on the new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan. This is from Phillip Lee, a former Tory minister who defected to the Lib Dems over Brexit last year. Louise Haigh, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, has said that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to \u201cgo it alone on messaging\u201d \u2013 ie to introduce a new slogan for the public in England not being matched in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland \u2013 is dangerous. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has posted this on Twitter to make the point that she is not, in any meaningful sense, lifting the lockdown in Scotland. On Friday my colleagues Paul Lewis and David Conn reported on how some members of Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, were angered by the way the government readacted large chunks of a Sage document before publishing it last week. The scientists felt the redactions were unnecessary because it seemed the content was just being hidden to prevent people learning that some government proposals had been dismissed by the experts, and at last one adviser was said to be considering resigning. Now the government has relented. This line has been added to the website page where all the Sage documents are published. Material was redacted from this document in accordance with the standard principles governing Freedom of Information when it was first published. However Sir Patrick Vallance [the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser) and No 10 agree that such Sage documents relating to Covid should be published in full, in the interests of maximum transparency, with exceptions only for matters relating to national security. Here is the document (pdf). It is a meeting note, dated 1 April, prepared for a Sage meeting on 2 April. The newly released material is everything from point 3, starting with the headline: \u201cSpecific comments about new suggestions for improving adherence within the Framework (27 March)\u201d. It shows Sage rejected three proposals to toughen the lockdown. Here is the key extract. The framework proposes four new suggestions for increasing adherence, numbered as options 17 to 20 that SPI-B have not commented on before. These focus on: 17) increasing the financial penalties imposed; 18) introducing self-validation for movements; 19) reducing exercise and/or shopping; 20) reducing non-home working. We have reservations about options 17 to 19. First, we are unclear what the evidence base is that the targeted behaviours are a substantial contribution to disease transmission, particularly given the high adherence rates currently observed in the community. Is there evidence, for example, that exercise conducted more than 1km away from the house leads to higher rates of transmission than exercise conducted within 1km of the house? Indeed, for this option, there is a risk that reducing the ability of people to apply some flexibility in choosing where to exercise will increase risk by preventing people from spreading out in nearby open space. Tightening restrictions without clear epidemiological need may lose support among people who have been attempting to adhere. Second, the implicit assumption underlying options 17 to 19 is that people lack motivation to adhere to current guidance. This may apply to some specific subgroups (the example of young men has been given), but broadly the current levels of adherence we are witnessing suggest this is not the issue. Third, there are equity issues within options 17 to 19. Any flat rate financial penalty will have a higher impact on poorer households, while the assumption that printing and completing paperwork is straightforward for all households can also be challenged. The assumption underlying restrictions on shopping frequency is that people can afford to buy in larger quantities. The risk of tension arising as the police are required to start penalising those who are not adhering should also be factored into considerations. Earlier Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, said that, along with the Scottish and Welsh governments, the Northern Ireland executives would be keeping the \u201cstay at home\u201d message. (See 12.03pm.) Now Robin Swann, Northern Ireland\u2019s health minister, has reinforced the message by tweeting out this slogan saying \u201ckeep staying at home\u201d. A news day that was meant to be dominated by the prime minister\u2019s speech has (so far, at least) instead been hijacked by four nations slogan bickering. The official UK death toll has risen to 31,855 \u2013 an increase of 269 on yesterday. The Department for Health and Social Care has tweeted that 92,837 tests were carried out on Saturday. The government dashboard with more details is here. And this press release has more detail of the testing figures. Good afternoon. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Molly Blackall. I\u2019ll be here for the rest of the day, covering Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at 7pm, and then bringing you reaction and analysis as the night goes on. According to the BBC\u2019s Chris Mason, part of the speech was pre-recorded yesterday, and part today. According to the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Harry Cole, the decision to start recording the speech before its contents had been supposedly agreed by the cabinet, which met earlier today, did not go down well. The press conference is now finished \u2013 and so is my stint on the live blog. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Andrew Sparrow who\u2019ll take the blog over for the next few hours. Thank you all for following along, and a special thanks to those who sent in tips and pointers, it\u2019s much appreciated. I hope you\u2019re staying safe and well, wherever you\u2019re reading from. The Scottish government is working with advisers to balance need for infection control with mitigating distress measures are causing to people with dementia, or those who care for them, the health minister says. Sturgeon says she doesn\u2019t expect the new regulations, which will allow people to exercise multiple times a day, to significantly change the transmission rate. She thinks the risk in terms of increased transmission is low but the benefits to health could be high. Sturgeon also said that people being outdoors has a much lower impact on transmission than when they are indoors. Sturgeon says she doesn\u2019t rule out making localised guidance within Scotland, such as giving some lockdown measures for Glasgow and others for Inverness. But she suggests we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves, and not to exaggerate the differences in place. The Scottish health secretary emphasises that the NHS is still open for emergencies and maternity, and for cancer treatment, despite the cancellation or postponement of many procedures. Sturgeon says she will \u201cleave it to the prime minister to explain how dropping the \u2018stay at home\u2019 message\u201d still involves advice to stay at home. It comes after Johnson tweeted guidance which said that \u201cstay alert\u201d included instructions to \u201cstay at home as much as possible\u201d. This has caused understandable confusion about how the \u201cstay alert\u201d message differs from the previous \u201cstay at home\u201d message. Roughly half of care homes in Scotland have not had any coronavirus infections at all, Sturgeon said. Patients discharged from hospital after coronavirus who are returning to care homes need to give two negative tests before discharge, says the health secretary, Jeane Freeman. If they are in hospital for another reason but need to go back to a care home, they should provide a negative test and then quarantine in the care home. It\u2019s \u201cof interest\u201d for Scotland to be involved with the alert system expected to be unveiled by Boris Johnson tonight, but they would need more evidence, Dr Smith says. There is \u201cinsufficent confidence to say we\u2019re sufficiently below the magical 1 number,\u201d says the interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith. The number he\u2019s referring to is the transmission rate, the R number, which governments are trying to keep below 1. He says the real danger is that relaxing measures too early would cause that number to grow. Sturgeon refers to the recent increase in infection rate in Germany as evidence that the \u201cmargins of error are very narrow\u201d. Germany has recently moved towards relaxing restrictions, but has already had to reimpose measures in one state after a spike in cases. \u201cMy overall watchword in this is \u2018caution\u2019,\u201d Sturgeon said. Sturgeon says communication teams in Scotland and the UK government are liaising over the message at the moment, and she is committed to a four-nation approach. \u201cI am absolutely committed to a four-nation approach\u201d, she says, and the fact that evidence necessitates the nations following different timetables should not be seen as a break in this. However, what will make the approach harder is if the UK government takes decisions for the four nations without consultation. In Scotland, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has asked people to wear face coverings while in shops. It comes as she announces that people can exercise more than once a day in Scotland. Sturgeon has confirmed the \u201cstay alert\u201d message won\u2019t be operating in Scotland, and has hit out at the UK government for leaving Scotland out of the loop. She says consultation and alignment is really important, and that decisions taken in Westminster shouldn\u2019t be presented as UK-wide. \u201cWe should not be reading for the first time of others\u2019 plans in newspapers,\u201d she says, adding that clarity of message is \u201cparamount\u201d. Sturgeon says that different decisions may be more appropriate across the nations if the evidence suggests they are on different timelines. She says she respects the right of other nations to make their decisions, but it\u2019s important to not confuse the guidance. Sturgeon says the progress Scotland has made is \u201cfragile\u201d and it could be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d to drop the measures at such a \u201ccritical time\u201d. \u201cExcept for the essential reasons outlined, the guidance remains to stay at home in Scotland,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is a risk of people dying unnecessarily in Scotland if we drop the stay at home message.\u201d Sturgeon also says she is not willing to drop the message in favour of something which is \u201cvague and imprecise\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2018stay alert\u2019 means,\u201d she adds. From Monday the once-a-day exercise limit will be removed. However, this won\u2019t apply to those who are shielding or have symptoms. People must stay \u201crelatively close to their own home\u201d. This does not extend to barbecues or sunbathing. Nicola Sturgeon stresses this is not licence to meet up in groups. This will be the only change the Scottish government will announce, but over the next week it will consider further measures about going outside. Some of the things it will update the public on next weekend after consideration will include the opening of garden centres and recycling centres. Sturgeon says she has not seen the plan unveiled by the PM tonight, so can\u2019t comment on that. She expects confirmation of a period of quarantine for those travelling to the UK from Boris Johnson tonight, and welcomes it. Sturgeon says the rate of transmission is still too high to lift lockdown, so Scotland must stay at home. The country must be \u201ccautious and careful\u201d; the objective must be to \u201csolidify\u201d that progress and not \u201csquander it\u201d or give mixed messages. If Scotland does that, \u201cpeople will die\u201d. She says this will be under review. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is giving a press conference. I\u2019ll update you with the key points as it goes along. In Scotland there are now 13,486 positive cases confirmed, and an increase of 181 since yesterday. There are 1,484 patients in hospital with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, a decrease of 101 since yesterday. There are 82 people in ICU with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, a decrease of seven. There have been 10 deaths in the past 24 hours from coronavirus. The total now is 1,857. Sturgeon says the rate of transmission is still too high to lift lockdown, so Scotland must stay at home. Must be \u201ccautious and careful\u201d, objective must be to \u201csolidify\u201d that progress and not \u201csquander it\u201d or give mixed messages. If Scotland did that, \u201cpeople will die\u201d. She says this will be under review. Police were spat and coughed on as they tried to disperse a birthday party of around 40 people in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Police were called to an address in Wemsley Grove, Tonge Moor, shortly before 8pm yesterday, where they found a birthday party with around 40 people in attendance, including both adults and children. \u201cOfficers encouraged the group to disperse and were met with hostility as guests refused to co-operate,\u201d a Greater Manchester Police statement said. \u201cOfficers continued to encourage the group to disperse, and as people started to leave, a group of people continued to refuse to co-operate with the officers and began to deliberately cough and spit.\u201d Seven people \u2013 aged between 23 and 48 \u2013 were arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly and for breach of Covid-19 regulations and received fixed penalties. A further individual was not arrested but was given a fixed penalty at the scene. The assistant chief constable Robert Potts said: \u201cWhen the vast majority of us are all making such sacrifices in order to reduce the transmission of the virus and save lives as a result it is really disappointing to see the rules being flagrantly ignored by those who are putting their own safety and the safety of so many others at risk. \u201cThis remains an incredibly challenging time for everybody but we all need to follow the legislation and government guidance in order to save lives and protect the most vulnerable members of our communities. \u201cFollowing this incident yesterday, the Bolton neighbourhood team will be out providing reassurance to residents in the area, so please feel free to speak to them if you have any questions or concerns.\u201d Hi everyone, I\u2019m back from my lunch break. If you spot something we should be reporting on in this blog, you can drop me a message on Twitter. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything but will try to read it all, so thanks in advance! Charities have called for safe legal routes to claim asylum in the UK, after a single-day record number of migrants were confirmed to have crossed the Channel in small boats on Friday. The number of migrants who managed to reach the UK this weekend is now at least 244 after another boat made the dangerous journey on Sunday. Eight inflatable boats - including one packed with 51 people - were intercepted in the English Channel by Border Force on Friday, with 145 migrants in total rescued. On Saturday, a further 82 migrants were responded to by UK authorities. Seventy of these were discovered on board inflatable boats, while 12 men were found at Dungeness on the Kent coast. On Sunday, Border Force was alerted to another boat at 3.20am, and it was found to be carrying 17 people. The migrants were taken to Dover, where they will be assessed for symptoms of coronavirus. Since the Covid-19 lockdown was announced in Britain on March 23, at least 853 migrants have been intercepted by UK authorities and brought ashore, according to data gathered by the PA news agency. A large number of those who arrived in the UK over the bank holiday weekend presented themselves as Iranian, Afghan, Yemini, Iraqi, Kuwaiti and Syrian nationals. Here my colleague Mattha Busby\u2019s story: A total of 1,857 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 10 on Saturday, the Scottish government has announced. Recent statistics show 13,486 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 181 from 13,305 the day before. There are 82 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of 11 on Saturday. 1,484 people in Scotland are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, including those who are in intensive care, a drop of 101 from the Saturday total of 1,585. Since March 5, 3,100 people who have tested positive for coronavirus have been able to leave hospital, which includes 84 people since Saturday. Another five Covid-19 deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said, bringing total deaths in the region to 435. A further 178 people, who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 23,149. The full details are here (pdf). Patients were aged between 32 and 98 years old. 12 of the 178 patients, aged between 58 and 95 years old, had no known underlying health condition, NHS England said. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: East of England 23 London 25 Midlands 28 North East &amp; Yorkshire 32 North West 44 South East 18 South West 8 Briefings to newspapers have led to more people flouting the Government\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown rules, the shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said. The Leicester South Labour MP blamed headlines suggesting an easing of restrictions from Monday on several national titles\u2019 front pages on Thursday, which were all based on briefings, for the apparent confusion in the population about the next phase of the lockdown. Police forces voiced frustration as people flocked to parks and were socialising outdoors on Friday and Saturday. Speaking to Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Ashworth said: \u201cThe frustration is that we had different briefings to different newspapers throughout the week. \u201cI think some of those briefings to newspapers has led to the situation yesterday and on Friday of lots of people going to parks, enjoying the sunshine. \u201cWe have seen an increase in road traffic and I think we have seen more Coastguard call-outs than at any other point during the lockdown. \u201cThis lockdown, which we have been in now for seven weeks, has contributed to hospital admissions falling and the death rate falling, and you\u2019d hope and expect that, and that is a tribute to the British public who have followed the stay home advice.\u201d At the daily Downing Street press conference on Saturday, transport secretary Grant Shapps warned that the government would proceed with \u201cextreme caution\u201d when lifting lockdown measures. Hello, taking over briefly while Molly Blackall is on a break. You can flag updates you want to share with me either on Twitter or you can email me. The prime minister risks jeopardising the successes of the coronavirus lockdown in dropping his \u201cstay home\u201d slogan, a scientist advising the government has said. Behavioural expert Prof Susan Michie, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said Johnson\u2019s new messaging was \u201ca long way\u201d from being clear and consistent and could give people the green light to socialise. It comes after all devolved nations rejected the new slogan, with Wales and Scotland saying they weren\u2019t consulted on the change. Leaders of all the devolved nations have now rejected Boris Johnson\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan, and have vowed to continue with the existing \u201cstay at home\u201d message. Instead of the original advice, the prime minister is now telling the public to \u201cstay at home as much as possible\u201d, to keep two metres apart when going out and \u201climit contact\u201d with other people. Despite the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, saying the government\u2019s \u201cstrong preference\u201d was for a UK-wide response, all devolved nations have rejected the new slogan. Health ministers in Wales and Scotland, as well as the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have said they were not consulted about the change of message and found out about it through media reports. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has become the latest to criticise the government\u2019s new coronavirus slogan, describing it as \u201ctoo ambiguous\u201d and \u201cunenforceable\u201d. A passenger plane bringing 120,000 surgical gowns from China has landed in the UK. The Airbus A340, which was decorated in livery thanking NHS staff, landed at Bournemouth airport from China this morning. Paul Stoddart, chairman of the European Aviation Group, said: \u201cToday we delivered yet another 120,000 surgical gowns, much needed to the NHS. \u201cThe flight was from China back to Bournemouth and all went very well. Looking forward to the next few flights.\u201d Health professionals have issued a new legal challenge demanding an urgent inquiry into the government\u2019s failure to provide PPE for frontline workers. A pre-action letter sent by the Doctor\u2019s Association UK (DA) and the Good Law Project (GLP), which are responsible for bringing the challenge, provides a list of \u201crecurrent and systemic\u201d failures in PPE supplies. The groups are demanding legal action be taken immediately so that \u201clessons can be learnt\u201d in case of a resurgence in the virus. \u201cIt is a tragedy that nearly 200 healthcare workers in the UK have died due to Covid-19,\u201d said a spokesperson for the DA. \u201cThere has been recurrent and systemic failure of the PPE supply chain, leaving staff in some instances with makeshift or no PPE. \u201cEvery healthcare worker death from Covid-19 must be investigated, the issue of PPE has to be considered as part of that. Until we establish all the factors involved we feel that inquests must be opened,\u201d they added. \u201cWith the Good Law Project, we are seeking a legal remedy by compelling the secretary of state for health and social care to discharge his statutory duty to promptly and properly order an investigation of healthcare worker deaths.\u201d Downing Street is also weighing in to try to explain the meaning of the new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan. A No 10 spokesman said the public can stay alert by \u201cstaying at home as much as possible\u201d, \u201climiting contact with other people\u201d and keeping two metres apart where possible. \u201cWe can control the virus by keeping the rate of infection (R) and the number of infections down,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThis is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we start to recover from coronavirus.\u201d \u201cEveryone has a role to play in keeping the rate of infection (R) down by staying alert and following the rules,\u201d they added. If you\u2019re just joining us, here\u2019s a quick overview of what\u2019s happened with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\u2019s response to the government\u2019s new coronavirus slogan. This morning, the UK government introduced a new slogan, \u201cstay alert, save lives\u201d, to replace the \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d slogan used so far. It appears to be part of today\u2019s change in lockdown conditions, with some relaxation of measures expected to be announced at the government\u2019s briefing tonight. The slogan gained attention in the media this morning, with Sunday newspapers reporting on the new slogan and the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, discussing it on Sky News and the Andrew Marr show. However, since the reveal, Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon, and Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister Arlene Foster, have both said that they will not be adopting the new slogan. Sturgeon said it was too early for Scotland to drop the \u201cstay home\u201d message. The health ministers in Scotland and Wales, along with Sturgeon, have said that they were not consulted on the change of message. That brings you up to speed with this morning\u2019s events - I\u2019ll let you know as and when this develops further. Prime minister Boris Johnson has just released some insight into what the new government coronavirus slogan means. \u201cEveryone has a role to play in helping to control the virus by staying alert and following the rules. This is how we can continue to save lives as we start to recover from coronavirus,\u201d he said in a tweet. The message was accompanied by a image which shows how to \u201cstay alert\u201d: Stay at home as much as possible Work from home if you can Limit contact with other people Keep your distance if you go out (2m apart where possible) Wash your hands regularly. It is still somewhat unclear how this differs from the previous guidance - as these measures were largely already in place - but that is likely to be clarified at tonight\u2019s briefing, when a slight relaxation of coronavirus lockdown measures are expected to be announced. I wanted to share this brilliant picture with you all, which shows Boris Johnson in a socially distanced discussion with a member of public. The photograph was taken as the prime minister took his morning walk through St James\u2019 Park in London yesterday. Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister Arlene Foster has said the region will not adopt the new government slogan, instead sticking with the \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d message. Speaking to BBC Northern Ireland radio on Sunday, she said: On the whole, the message is to stay at home. We will say we are not deviating from the message at this time. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland will not be adopting the new slogan either, with Welsh and Scottish health ministers saying they were not consulted on the change of message. Thanks to all those getting in touch with tips, pointers and questions - I\u2019ll try to address them here in the blog. If you see something you think we should be reporting in this blog, you can drop me a message on Twitter, @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I\u2019ll try to read it all. A leading statistician has criticised the government\u2019s use of daily figures, describing it as \u201cnumber theatre\u201d. Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter, chairman of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, criticised the government\u2019s daily briefings, saying that the public are being fed \u201cnumber theatre\u201d. Speaking on the Andrew Marr show this morning, Spiegelhalter said he wished data was being shared by people who understood its \u201cstrengths and limitations\u201d and could \u201ctreat the audience with respect\u201d. Asked about the Government\u2019s communication to the public through the briefings, Spiegelhalter said he had watched Saturday\u2019s briefing and \u201cfrankly, I found it completely embarrassing\u201d. He said it was \u201cextraordinary\u201d that it is not known how many people have had Covid-19. \u201cWe get told lots of big numbers, precise numbers of tests being done - 96,878. Well, that\u2019s not how many were done yesterday; it includes tests that were posted out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re told 31,587 people have died; no, they haven\u2019t, it\u2019s far more than that. I think this is actually not the trustworthy communication of statistics,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s such a missed opportunity. The public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they\u2019re hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information, and yet they get fed this what I call \u2018number theatre\u2019, which seems to be co-ordinated really much more by a Number 10 communications team rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what\u2019s going on.\u201d Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has just tweeted the original \u201cstay at home\u201d message and pinned it - meaning it will come up as the first tweet on her profile. This is likely to be read as her doubling down on her earlier statement that the Scottish government would not be adopting the UK government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan. She argues it is too soon to lift the \u201cstay home\u201d message in Scotland. Sturgeon, alongside the Scottish and Welsh health ministers, have alleged that they were not consulted on the change of slogan. Intensive care doctors are warning that non-compliance with the lockdown could lead to a second wave of Covid-19 infections. Their concern follows pictures on television of people gathering in large groups on Friday, and in one case doing a mass conga, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of VE Day and also of large numbers of people sunbathing and picnicking on Saturday in London Fields in east London. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant in Wales, tweeted today to say: \u201cShowing our supremacy in the world stats as we irresponsibly flount lockdown to celebrate VE Day in the worst fashion. Glad I\u2019ve had a couple of weeks away from ITU to recuperate as the next wave is going to make this horrific statistic even worse. Things are about to get busy.\u201d And Dr Mark Forrest, an intensive care doctor in the north-west of England, says he is \u201cseriously worried\u201d that ignoring the lockdown will increase the pressure on units like his. He tweeted: \u201cOur ICU already has more Covid cases than 2 weeks ago as more people go out. Ignoring lockdown has us seriously worried for the next few weeks.\u201d Vaughan Gething, health minister for Wales, has said that the UK government has not discussed the new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan with the other nations. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the media briefings and changed message for England. There has not been a 4 nations agreement or discussion on this,\u201d Gething tweeted. The WelshGovernment message has not changed. Stay at home and if you do go out observe the social distancing rules. #StayHomeSaveLives It comes after the Scottish health minister and first minister both said Scotland had not been consulted. Liberal Democrats acting leader Sir Ed Davey has called for the Government to publish the evidence it used to move to its new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan. He warned that the change could cause alarm amongst the public, and make police enforcement \u201cnear impossible\u201d. \u201cChanging the slogan now, while in practice keeping the lockdown in place, makes the police\u2019s job near impossible and may cause considerable alarm. Ministers risk sowing confusion and losing public trust with this muddled communications strategy and lack of transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear why the Prime Minister has made this decision,\u201d he added. \u201cFor it to make any sense, we need total transparency on the science and advice that has led to this change. Ministers must publish the evidence they are relying on to make these decisions to allow for real scrutiny.\u201d If you\u2019re just joining us, there is much confusion this morning over the government\u2019s new slogan, \u201cstay alert, save lives\u201d, which will replace \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d. It is set to be unveiled at tonight\u2019s 7pm briefing, but Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick has already been on Sky News and the Andrew Marr Show this morning discussing the slogan. What does \u201cstay alert\u201d mean? When asked by Marr what \u201cstay alert\u201d meant, Jenrick said: \u201cStay alert by staying home as much as possible, but stay alert when you do go out by maintaining social distancing, washing your hands, respecting others in the workplace and other settings you\u2019ll go to.\u201d This has understandably caused confusion about how this slogan differs from the last. Scotland won\u2019t adopt slogan Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted this morning that the Scottish government won\u2019t be adopting the new slogan as the risk of infection is still too high to abandon the \u201cstay home\u201d message. She also said the Scottish government had not been consulted on the change of message. Since then, the Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman has said she has \u201cno idea\u201d what \u201cstay alert\u201d means. Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has said she has \u201cno idea\u201d what the UK government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan means. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Politics Scotland on Sunday, Ms Freeman said the Scottish Government was not consulted on the change. She said: \u201cThat is not a change that we would agree with. I think the First Minister was really clear last week that the \u2018stay at home\u2019 message was the right message and if I\u2019m perfectly frank, I have no idea what \u2018stay alert\u2019 actually means.\u201d Ms Freeman also said the public would be \u201cat a disadvantage\u201d in following guidance if the message was not clear. She added: \u201cWe\u2019re asking the public to do a very great deal here and the least we can do is be consistent and clear in the message that we\u2019re sending and stay at home is the right message.\u201d A senior police officer who survived a spell in intensive care with Covid-19 has criticised the public\u2019s \u201cincreasingly blas\u00e9\u201d attitude towards observing the lockdown. Chief supt Phil Dolby of West Midlands police tweeted: \u201cA month ago today, on a ventilator &amp; in a coma, I started to breath for myself! I am v disturbed by the increasingly blas\u00e9 way ppl are treating the lockdown. With lack of answers around immunity, my family &amp; I are going to remain shielding. I can\u2019t go thru that again. #Covid19\u201d. Meanwhile, an expert in mental health has added to the growing concern that the government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d message will confuse people. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth voiced unease this morning on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show. \u201cThe one thing that helps the population is clear, concise and accurate messaging. This one is concise only. The previous message to stay home was at least clear. What does stay alert mean? It will just be confusing, be open to misinterpretation and likely to increase risky behaviour \u2013 that means taking risks that will affect everyone and increase infections\u201d, said Prof Til Wykes, vice-dean of the institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThis is not just about preventing deaths but many people who have survived this virus are left with physical problems that will affect them for a very long time. If you are going to re-message then listen to behavioural scientists about how to do it best\u201d, added Wykes, in a comment issued through the Science Media Centre. The UK\u2019s coronavirus contact tracing app, being developed as part of the government\u2019s pandemic response, may not work with either Apple or Google phones. Dr Michael Veale, lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London, said the UK is \u201creally going against the grain\u201d in its development of the app. Comparing the government\u2019s app with the app his team is working on, Veale said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working in a way where all of the matching between people happens on a user\u2019s device, not in a central server, and that\u2019s generally considered to be more privacy preserving. Whereas the UK has taken a different approach, which builds a social network of people in the cloud.\u201d \u201cThe problem is that Apple and Google, Apple in particular, have stated that they won\u2019t allow this kind of central system to be created, it doesn\u2019t work with their operating system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so the UK is really going against the grain and therefore it\u2019s finding problems on both Google and Apple phones.\u201d He said he does not think the app will be up and running in the UK before June. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick denied the government was already working on a second coronavirus app, but said ministers would move to a different app if necessary. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware we\u2019re not developing a second app but we are paying attention to the other apps that exist elsewhere in the world,\u201d he told Marr. \u201cAnd if we need to adapt our app or move to a different model, obviously we will do.\u201d A body representing police officers in London has criticised the government\u2019s pandemic response as \u201cwishy-washy\u201d amid concerns that the public has begun ignoring lockdown restrictions. The Metropolitan Police Federation (MPF) said that, despite its assertions to the contrary, the government is sending out mixed messages. MPF\u2019s Ken Marsh told BBC Radio 4 that authorities \u201cneeded to be firmer right from the beginning\u201d. You can read more here: The government must be \u201cincredibly cautious\u201d about easing lockdown measures, the chairman of the government\u2019s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) has said. Speaking to Andrew Marr this morning, Professor Peter Horby said: \u201cWe have to be clear that this is not like a storm where we batten down the hatches and then it passes by and we walk out into the sunshine and it\u2019s gone. \u201cIt\u2019s still out there. Most of us have not had this virus. So if we get this wrong it will very quickly increase across the population and we will be back in a situation of crisis. \u201cSo we have to be incredibly cautious about relaxing the measures.\u201d Around 50,000 coronavirus test samples have been sent to the US after \u201coperational issues\u201d in the lab network caused delays. The Department of Health said sending swabs abroad is one of the contingencies to deal with problems in rapidly-expanded testing system. The test results will be validated back in the UK and communicated to patients \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d. The department said that work was ongoing to resolve the issues, and that testing capacity is quickly being restored. According to the Sunday Telegraph, the samples were airlifted to the US in chartered flights from London\u2019s Stansted airport. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cThe expansion of the UK\u2019s coronavirus testing network has involved setting up an entirely new \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 lab network to process test swabs. \u201cWhen problems arise, we have contingencies in place which include creating extra temporary capacity for our labs or sending swabs abroad to partner labs for completion. Of course, our partner labs must match our high standards.\u201d At yesterday\u2019s Downing Street briefing, it was revealed that the number of daily coronavirus tests fell below Health Secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s 100,000 target for a seventh day in a row. It was announced that 96,878 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 9am on Saturday, down from 97,029 the day before. Ahead of tonights 7pm briefing, which is set to include the beginning of the lifting of lockdown restrictions, here are some of the measures expected to be unveiled: A new message \u201cStay alert, save lives\u201d, retiring the \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d seen so far. However Nicola Sturgeon has said this is the first she has heard of the message, and won\u2019t be adopting the slogan. A terror threat style alert system, which the UK will move through in stages to exit lockdown. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said the UK was currently at stage four out of five, and they hope to move out of three. Lockdown could be different in each region, with measures tailored to the local state of the virus. COBRA, the government\u2019s emergency committee, is expected to meet this afternoon. People who are unable to work from home could be allowed to return to work, Sky news are reporting. However, people will be advised to wear face masks in shops and public transport. Garden centre are expected to be allowed to reopen from Wednesday, say Sky News. There will be tougher fines for those who break the rules. Tonight\u2019s statement will be prerecorded with no questions from the media. The WHO has warned that lockdown restrictions must be eased carefully, saying it would be \u201ctraumatising\u201d for people to re-enter lockdown in the case of a second wave. \u201cThis is the advice we give really to every country is to be very, very cautious when taking these decisions to ease down the restrictions, because really what we don\u2019t want to see is that there is a second wave and that we have to go back to the lockdown. That would be traumatising I think for everyone,\u201d Tarik Jasarevic from the WHO told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that this is done in a staged, in a gradual way, so we can really see what is the effect of people getting back close to one another? So it is really important that this is being done very, very carefully, so we avoid the possibility that we have to go back into a situation we\u2019ve been in.\u201d The lockdown could be eased differently in different regions as Northern Ireland\u2019s rate of transmission is higher than other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland\u2019s First Minister Arlene Foster said. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge On Sunday, she said: \u201cSage and indeed our own medical officer do acknowledge that there are different rates of transmission across the United Kingdom. \u201cThere are differences and regional differences across the United Kingdom and I think the PM has to recognises there are regional differences so you may see slight differences across the UK.\u201d When she was asked if it was a good idea that the lockdown could be re-applied to different regions if required, she said: \u201cIt is important that we do what is right in our region of the United Kingdom moving forward. That is why we are coming forward with our roadmap next week. It will set out how we can take graduated steps back to what will be a different normality.\u201d She also warned that any return to normality will still feature social distancing. \u201cIt is important that we give hope to people but it is also important that we protect people,\u201d she said. Interesting analysis of the visual side of the government\u2019s change of message from the BBC\u2019s economics editor, here. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that will not be adopting the government\u2019s change of slogan - from \u201cStay home, saves lives\u201d, to \u201cstay alert, save lives\u201d. Sturgeon said the Sunday newspapers were the first she had heard of the change. Despite this, Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said it was the government\u2019s \u201cstrong preference\u201d that the UK would have a coordinated response. Wales also appears to have been left out of the loop about tonight\u2019s government announcement, but Mark Drakeford, first minister of Wales, emphasised he\u2019d like cooperation. Shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has warned that the government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan risks ambiguity. \u201cWe need absolute clarity from Boris Johnson. There\u2019s no room for nuance in this,\u201d he said on Sky News this morning. This virus exploits ambivalence, it thrives on ambiguity and I think the problem with the slogan that has been briefed to the newspapers is people will be looking slightly puzzled, questioning \u2018What does it mean to stay alert? What are the Government saying with that?\u2019 \u201cSo I hope that Boris Johnson will offer us that crystal-clear clarity tonight that is desperately needed,\u201d he added. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said newspaper briefings have led to more people flouting the lockdown. \u201cThe frustration is that we had different briefings to different newspapers throughout the week. \u201cI think some of those briefings to newspapers has led to the situation yesterday and on Friday of lots of people going to parks, enjoying the sunshine. We have seen an increase in road traffic and I think we have seen more coastguard call outs than at any other point during the lockdown,\u201d he said to Sophy Ridge on Sky News this morning. Ashworth also said the falling hospital admissions rate and death toll was a \u201ctribute\u201d to the Brits who have stayed at home. \u201cThis lockdown which we have been in now for seven weeks has contributed to hospital admissions falling and the death rate falling and you\u2019d hope and expect that and that is a tribute to the British public who have followed the stay home advice,\u201d he said. Around 40% of people on people on the Isle of Wight are using the NHS app in a pilot, Robert Jenrick, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, has said. Speaking to Sophie Ridge on Sky News this morning, he said that about 50,000 people have downloaded the app in one week. However, he did not say how many people had been hired to do contact tracing. The government is attempting to meet a 18,000 target. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick seems to be hinting that tonight\u2019s announcement will focus on getting people back to work. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to take risks with the public. I understand people are anxious about the future but we want now to have a message which encourages people to go to work,\u201d speaking now to Sophy Ridge on Sky News. \u201cStaying home will still be an important part of the message but you will be able to go to work and you will in time be able to do some other activities that you\u2019re not able to do today,\u201d he said. New alert system Jenrick said more aspects of the economy and social lives will be opened up as the UK moves through the threat level on the new alert system. This is thought to be a colour coded system, which will allow the UK to phase out of lockdown in stages. \u201cMany people will be familiar with the threat level we\u2019ve had in this country for some time which measures the ongoing threat of terrorist and other risks to our safety and this is a similar threat level,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment we believe the country is at four on a scale of five with five being the most concerning and our aspiration is to bring that down as swiftly as we can to three. And at each stage, at each of those milestones, we will be in a position to open up and restart more aspects of the economy and of our lives.\u201d Local measures Jenrick also suggested that measures could be tailored to local conditions, with the government having the option to strengthen or relax restrictions locally to control the virus. \u201cThe evidence behind it will also be able to inform what we do at a local level and if we see there are outbreaks in particular localities, neighbourhoods, schools, towns, then we may be able to take particular measures in those places as we build up a more sophisticated and longer-term response to controlling the virus,\u201d he said. UK-wide approach Jenrick said the government\u2019s \u201cstrong preference\u201d is that leaders of devolved nations work together to create to UK wide approach to the virus. \u201cOur strong preference is the whole United Kingdom moves as one,\u201d he told Ridge. \u201cWe hope that they will agree to a consistent approach across the country, that\u2019s our strong preference.\u201d The Government is withdrawing a model of protective goggles from hospitals and care providers because they do not meet coronavirus standards. The \u2018Tiger Eye\u2019 model, purchased in 2009, have recently been reexamined and deemed unfit for use. According to the Sunday Telegraph, an urgent warning was sent to hospitals about the goggles, of which their is a 25.6 million stockpile. The newspaper said that 15.9 million pairs were distributed in the health system while the remainder was being held in quarantine. \u201cThe \u2018Tiger Eye protectors\u2019 were bought in 2009 and were in CE marked boxes. These were rechecked, and following these assessments, we have issued an alert to clinical settings advising against their use and we are removing them from the supply chain,\u201d a Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said. \u201cBased on current stock assessments, Trusts should have sufficient Visors and Goggles to immediately stop using \u2018Tiger Eye\u2019 protection. If settings require replacement eye protection they should contact the National Supply Disruption Line, and we are arranging replacement stock for Trusts who need immediate supply,\u201d she added. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the live blog for the next couple of hours. I\u2019ll bringing you all the breaking coronavirus updates from across the UK. We\u2019re all looking ahead to Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement tonight, as rumours circulate of a potential start to the end of lockdown, so I\u2019ll update you if I get any news of what that might look like. If you spot something you think we should be reporting in this blog, you can drop me a message on Twitter @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything but I will endeavour to read it all! Thanks in advance. Britain\u2019s biggest trades unions have warned Boris Johnson that they will not recommend a return to work for their three million members until the government and employers agree a nationwide health and safety revolution as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a letter to the Observer, leaders of the \u201cbig four\u201d \u2013 Unison, Unite, the GMB and Usdaw \u2013 together with the Trades Union Congress, say many of their members have already lost their lives \u201ctransporting people and goods, protecting the public and caring for the vulnerable\u201d. You can read more here: Good morning, Welcome to our live blog with all the latest coronavirus developments in the UK. Later today, in a speech which has been highly anticipated since the Sunday Telegraph last week suggested schools could reopen from 1 June, Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a coronavirus warning system for England when he outlines his plans to gradually ease the lockdown. The prime minister will drop the \u201cstay home\u201d slogan and instead tell the country to \u201cstay alert, control the virus and save lives\u201d when he outlines his \u201croadmap\u201d to a new normality during an address to the nation on Sunday. Johnson is planning to tell workers who cannot do their jobs from home to begin returning to their workplaces while following social distancing rules. The new slogan drew some scorn, including from the author JK Rowling, who said: \u201cIs coronavirus sneaking around in a fake moustache and glasses? If we drop our guard, will it slip us a Micky Finn? What the hell is \u2018stay alert\u2019 supposed to mean?\u201d Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, tweeted that it \u201cfeels to me like a mistake to me to drop the clear\u201d stay at home message.",

If Social Security and Medicare taxes aren\u2019t taken out of paychecks, workers and businesses would take home a little more money with each paycheck. The idea is that workers benefiting from the cut would spend more money, which could help curb a recession.

She did not immediately comment further.</p> <p>The fight is all about state regulations versus county regulations, and Reuters reported it thus:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Musk has been pushing to reopen Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, factory after Alameda county\u2019s health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla\">Tesla</a> filed a lawsuit against the county on Saturday, calling the continued restrictions a \u2018power grab\u2019 by the county since California\u2019s governor had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen.</p> <p>The company said Alameda was going against the federal and California constitutions, as well as defying the governor\u2019s order, in the lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court.</p> <p>Alameda county, where the Fremont factory is located, is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May, with only essential businesses allowed to reopen. County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Musk, of course, was free with his tweeted comments, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259159878427267072\">blasting</a> \u201cthe unelected and ignorant \u2018Interim Health Officer\u2019 of Alameda\u201d for he said \u201cacting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/tesla-not-given-the-green-light-to-reopen-says-alameda-county-rep.html\">According to CNBC</a> the official in question, Erica Pan, told an online town hall on Friday \u201ceven though California had relaxed Covid-19 restrictions at the state level, legally, \u2018If there are local orders, whichever is stricter prevails.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cShe added that currently, Alameda county \u2013 where the Fremont car factory is based \u2013 is \u2018still a little bit stricter\u2019 than the state in its approach to protecting public health amid an outbreak of the novel coronavirus. </p> <p>CNBC quoted Pan as saying of Tesla: \u201cWe have not given the green light.

      "bodyText": "Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Monday\u2019s blog: Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s major news developments ... Trump coronavirus vaccine goal \u2018amazingly ambitious\u2019, Senate Republican says. White House predictions about how the US economy might rebound from the coronavirus crisis and how quickly a vaccine might be rolled out came under question on Sunday. Fauci in quarantine as Trump projects confidence and urges states to reopen. The White House is stepping up precautions to try to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the West Wing after Dr Anthony Fauci and two other senior leaders in the coronavirus fight began self-quarantining on Sunday. Cuomo alerts states about mystery coronavirus illness after three children die. New York state is alerting all other parts of the US about a new mystery syndrome that appears to be related to Covid-19 and is causing severe illness and even death in very young children. Trump charges Obama with \u2018biggest political crime in American history\u2019. The US president continued to fume over the Russia investigation on Sunday, three days after the justice department said it would drop its case against Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Up to 43m Americans could lose health insurance amid pandemic, report says. As many as 43 million Americans could lose their health insurance in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. Oklahoma City University president Martha Burger has condemned the \u201chate-filled attack\u201d that interrupted the Methodist school\u2019s remote graduation ceremony on Saturday. \u201cWe are heartbroken and outraged at the hate-filled attack that occurred at the end of our virtual graduation celebration,\u201d Burger said in a statement. \u201cDuring a time that should have been focused on recognizing our graduating students, an unknown source was able to bypass the system and display racist and offensive language. I want to be clear, OCU stands against racism, bigotry, and anti-Semitism.\u201d While Burger did not give any details about the content of the interruption, the Associated Press reported that a racial slur and a swastika appeared as the names of the graduates scrolled across the screen near the end of the ceremony, which was held using the popular video-conferencing platform Zoom. Since the coronavirus lockdown, Zoom\u2019s daily active users shot up from around 10 million to 300 million as people have increasingly relied on video-conferencing. The uptick in usage has given rise to cyberattacks known as \u2018zoom-bombings\u2019, where bad actors enter video meetings and broadcast explicit imagery or abuse other users. In April, Zoom released an update including encryption and new privacy controls, improvements that were part of a 90-day plan to address an onslaught of security concerns surrounding the service. New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has reported at least 1,503 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the statewide total to roughly 138,532. \u201cWe\u2019ve tragically lost 140 more lives, pushing our total to 9,255 lives lost,\u201d Murphy said on Sunday. It marked the fourth straght day with fewer than 2,000 cases in the Garden State, although deaths from the virus remained up. New Jersey, with a population of approximately nine million people, remains a coronavirus hotbed with more cases and deaths than any US state besides New York. That has led Murphy to proceed with extreme caution in the easing of coronavirus restrictions. While the governor has explored allowing a limited number of more essential businesses to reopen, he stressed during Saturday\u2019s daily briefing that he won\u2019t do so until satisfied by the data and public health officials. \u201cNothing\u2019s changed,\u201d Murphy said on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re under consideration. We\u2019re all looking at what other steps we can take. We will let you know if nonessential retail is allowed to be open. It is not at the moment.\u201d \u201cI hope it can change,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope it\u2019ll change sooner than later. No one would be happier.\u201d A study of 5,754 employees of Major League Baseball found only 60 tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, a rate lower than what similar studies on the infection rate among the general population have found. \u201cI was expecting a larger number,\u201d said Dr Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at the University of Stanford and one of the study\u2019s authors, told ESPN. \u201cIt shows the value of doing the science as opposed to guessing.\u201d Twenty-six of MLB\u2019s 30 teams took park in the study, which required participants to use a pin prick to draw blood, test it themselves using a pre-shipped kit, then return a survey. Of the 5,603 employees who took the test and submitted their results, only 39 (0.7%) returned positive results. MLB Network\u2019s Jon Heyman reported that none of the people who tested positive have died from the virus. MLB, like every other major US sports league, has remained on hiatus since spring training was shut down and opening day postponed indefinitely. But details of a restart plan expected to be submitted on Tuesday began to trickle out on Sunday. They include a truncated season of around 80 games beginning in early July exclusively against opponents in the same geographic regions and an expanded postseason format that would send seven teams from each league to the playoffs instead of the current five. Donald Trump was back at it on Twitter on Sunday, seething over the Russia investigation more than a year after special counsel Robert Mueller filed his report without recommending charges. \u201cThe biggest political crime in American history, by far!\u201d the president wrote amid a stream of tweets of memes and rightwing talking heads claiming an anti-Trump conspiracy. One tweet by Trump simply read: \u201cOBAMAGATE!\u201d \u201cWhen are the Fake Journalists,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwho received unwarranted Pulitzer Prizes for Russia, Russia, Russia, and the Impeachment Scam, going to turn in their tarnished awards so they can be given to the real journalists who got it right. I\u2019ll give you the names, there are plenty of them!\u201d The president did not immediately name anyone. More than 1.3m people in the United States have been infected with the coronavirus and nearly 80,000 have died, according to publicly available data from multiple sources compiled by the Guardian. New York senator Chuck Schumer has called on the Department of Veterans Affairs to explain why it allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine on veterans for the coronavirus despite scant scientific evidence it helped. The Senate\u2019s top Democrat said the VA needs to provide more information about a $208,000 order of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug widely promoted by President Trump as a \u2018miracle cure\u2019. The request comes on the heels of a whistleblower complaint filed on Tuesday by former Health and Human Services official Rick Bright alleging he was ousted from his position after raising concerns that the Trump administration wanted to \u201cflood\u201d coronavirus hotspots like New York and New Jersey despite the uncertain efficacy and potential for harm. \u201cThere are concerns that they are using this drug when the medical evidence says it doesn\u2019t help and could hurt,\u201d Schumer said in an interview with the Associated Press. The senator added that VA secretary Robert Wilkie must address whether anyone at the department was pressured by anyone at the White House to use hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 in light of Trump\u2019s persistent endorsements. A VA spokesperson decried Schumer\u2019s \u201cpreposterous\u201d suggestion that any department official would make treatment decisions based on anything other than \u201cthe best medical interests of patients\u201d in a statement on Sunday. Saturday night saw a return to major, live sports in America as the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, staged an event broadcast live on pay-per-view on ESPN+. UFC\u2019s president, Dana White, is a close ally of Donald Trump and the president recorded a message of support that was shown on the telecast before the event. \u201cLet\u2019s play,\u201d Trump said in the video. \u201cYou do the social distancing and whatever else you have to do. But we need sports. We want our sports back.\u201d One of the fighters had to drop out before the event after testing positive for Covid-19, but White said it had been a useful experiment as sports look to reopen during the pandemic. \u201cI knew we could do this,\u201d he said following the event on Saturday night. \u201cI knew we could figure it out. Even with all the hurdles that we had early on, this has been fun. It\u2019s been challenging and it\u2019s been fun.\u201d There was no live audience for the fights, which took place at Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida. Sports leagues across America, and the world, have been shut down during the pandemic. Although professional baseball is being played in Taiwan and South Korea, and Germany\u2019s Bundesliga plans to return later this month. The Covid-19 pandemic poses obvious immediate health risks but it could also place our longer-term well-being in jeopardy. If, as some forecasts predict, the unemployment rate rises to 20%, up to 43 million Americans could lose their health insurance. That could result in deaths with people unable to afford treatment. \u201cThe status quo is incredibly inefficient, it\u2019s incredibly unfair, it\u2019s tied to employment for no real reason,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy adviser for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \u201cThis problem exposes a lot of the inadequacies in our system.\u201d You can read our full report on the subject here: Dr Anthony Fauci will testify remotely before a Senate committee next week. The US government\u2019s top infectious diseases adviser had been due to appear in person while observing social distancing and wearing a mask but the Washington Post reports he will now do so via videoconference. Two other witnesses at the Senate Covid-19 hearing on Tuesday had already said they would testify remotely. CDC director Dr Robert Redfield, and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn are in self-quarantine after coming into contact with Vice-President Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, Katie Miller, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week. \u201cAfter consulting with Dr Fauci, and in an abundance of caution for our witnesses, senators, and the staff, all four administration witnesses will appear by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances,\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health Committee said, in a statement on Sunday. The Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr Brett Giroir, had also been due to appear in person, but joined Fauci in saying he would appear via video link. Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, says he will continue with plans to reopen the state despite the fact that cases and deaths of Covid-19 are not going down. \u201cWe wish we were going down. We are not. We have been hit in Ohio, just like other states have been hit economically, so we\u2019ve got to try to do two things at once, you know no one is underestimating how difficult this but, it\u2019s something we have to do,\u201d DeWine said in an appearance on Fox News Sunday. DeWine said that taking steps to reopen the Ohio economy is necessary as the state has taken a severe economic hit during the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hit very hard. We\u2019ve had over a million people apply for unemployment,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re no different than most other states. I mean we\u2019ve been hit exceedingly hard. And again, as we look to come back carefully, it\u2019s not so much about at this point orders that I issue or my health director issues, it\u2019s really about what people do and I emphasize that time and time again.\u201d DeWine said it was important for the state\u2019s residents to observe safety rules. \u201cThe virus is still out there, it\u2019s still very, very dangerous. We have to keep the distancing. People should wear masks, wash their hands. I mean, these are basic things that we have to do. We can\u2019t let up,\u201d he said. More than 23,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Ohio and there had been 1,331 recorded deaths as of Sunday morning. The Associated Press has spoken to Americans who have decided to sue China over the Covid-19 outbreak. So far at least nine lawsuits have been filed against China in the US, claiming the country did not do enough to control the pandemic and sought to hide the full extent of the outbreak. Many of the lawsuits are class action, filed on behalf of thousands of people and business. One was filed by the district attorney of Missouri, on behalf of the entire state. \u201cI do feel that they hid it from the world and from Americans,\u201d Saundra Andringa-Meuer, one of the people pursuing legal action against China told the AP. \u201cI don\u2019t feel we had to have the loss of life. I don\u2019t think we had to have the economy shut down. It disrupted all of American lives. I do believe we need to right some of these wrongs.\u201d Andringa-Meuer, 61, came down with the virus in March and was on a ventilator for 14 days. Foreign governments cannot be sued in the US, apart from in exceptional circumstances. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be an uphill battle for them to ultimately take advantage of those exceptions,\u201d Robert Boone, a specialist in class-action lawsuits told the AP. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang described the Missouri lawsuit as \u201cvery absurd and [with] no factual and legal basis.\u201d Fears of a hot zone in the West Wing are mounting after a valet who handles food and beverages and the vice-president\u2019s press secretary tested positive for Covid-19, a New York Times report citing multiple White House officials has revealed. According to the report, Trump \u201cwas spooked that his valet, who is among those who serve him food, had not been wearing a mask\u201d and \u201cannoyed\u201d to learn that Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller tested positive. \u201cIt is scary to go to work,\u201d Kevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to the president, said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d program on Sunday. Mr. Hassett said he wore a mask at times at the White House, but conceded that \u201cI think that I\u2019d be a lot safer if I was sitting at home than I would be going to the West Wing.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a small, crowded place. It\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s a little bit risky. But you have to do it because you have to serve your country.\u201d The discovery of the two infected employees has prompted the White House to ramp up its procedures to combat the coronavirus, including daily tests for some senior staff, increased usage of masks and more rigorous screening of people entering the complex. The concern about an outbreak of the virus at the White House \u2013 and the swift testing and contact tracing being done to contain it \u2013 underscores the broader challenge for Americans as Mr. Trump urges them to begin returning to their own workplaces despite warnings from public health officials that the virus continues to ravage communities across the country. Most restaurants, offices and retail stores do not have the ability to regularly test all their employees and quickly track down and quarantine the contacts of anyone who gets infected. At the White House, all employees are being tested at least weekly, officials said, and a handful of top aides who regularly interact with the president are being tested daily, they said. \u201cTo get in with the president, you have to test negative,\u201d Mr. Hassett said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program. New York health commissioner Howard Zucker says the deaths of three young New Yorkers from inflammatory complications possibly linked to Covid-19 were in otherwise healthy children: two in elementary school and one adolescent. He says 30 to 40 people are reviewing charts of the 85 young people with the illness to \u201cassess exactly what has happened to them\u201d. When asked if those who died had any underlying conditions, Zucker tells parents to call their doctor if their child is suffering from nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pallor or chest pains, which are common symptoms of the toxic-shock syndrome-like condition, and to \u201cerr on the side of caution\u201d. \u201cYou want to talk about Mother\u2019s Day?\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cThis is every mother\u2019s nightmare.\u201d The New York governor is blasting the \u201ccorporate bailouts\u201d embedded in the federal government\u2019s coronavirus relief legislation. \u201cYou took care of corporate America,\u201d Cuomo says, \u201cbut now you\u2019re going to starve police and fire and hospitals and schools?\u201d \u201cGoing forward, let them fund working Americans because that\u2019s the need,\u201d the governor says. \u201cYou look at the past legislation: they funded hotels, restaurants, airlines, big corporations, public companies. Now it turns out they funded a tax break for millionaires in the Covid response legislation. And they didn\u2019t fund state and local governments. Who do state and local governments fund? I fund police, fire fighters, nurses, school teachers and food banks.\u201d He ends with a warning, calling back to the much-criticized bailouts during the last financial crisis. \u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistake twice,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cDon\u2019t do what this nation did after the 2007-08 mortgage crisis bailout where the government bailed out all these bankers and corporations that made a fortune running a mortgage scam.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the number of total of hospitalizations and intubations statewide are down from the previous 24-hour period in his daily briefing from Albany, calling it \u201cgood news\u201d. He says that the new Covid-19 hospitalizations are also down with 521 in the last 24-hour period, the same number as 20 March before they sharply escalated. There were 207 deaths from the virus statewide in the last day \u2013 including 43 in nursing homes \u2013 which is down from 226 on Saturday. The governor, who has come under criticism for the disproportionate death toll at assisted-living facilities (particularly upstate, where in some counties they account for nearly all coronavirus-related deaths), stresses that it is a national problem and notes that New York\u2019s percentage of deaths in nursing homes ranks 34th out of 50 states. To address the issue, he says all nursing home staff in New York must now be tested for the virus twice a week. Cuomo then says the state\u2019s department of health is investigating up to 85 cases of what may be a Covid-related illness in children \u2013 mostly toddler to elementary school age \u2013 with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease. The illness has taken the lives of three young New Yorkers and an additional two deaths are currently under investigation. Cuomo adds the department is issuing a notice to all other 49 state health departments to notify them of the situation. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, gave his sobering assessment of the pandemic on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, saying \u201cwe\u2019re going to see 60 to 70% of Americans\u201d infected with Covid-19. \u201cWe have to understand that we\u2019re riding this tiger, we\u2019re not directing it,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cThis virus is going to do what it\u2019s going to do. What we can do is only nibble at the edges, and I think it\u2019s not a good message to send to the public that we can control this virus in a meaningful way. ... What we have to tell people honestly, what they want to hear, they don\u2019t want it sugarcoated and they don\u2019t want it coated in fear. But somewhere between now and tomorrow, next year, we\u2019re going to see 60 to 70% of Americans ultimately infected with this virus. What we have to do is to figure out how not just to die with the virus but also how to live with it. And we\u2019re not having that discussion. As Lewis Carrol once said: \u2018If you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going, any road will get you there.\u2019\u201d When asked whether the United States is ready to reopen the economy, Osterholm said it was \u201cunclear\u201d what that exactly means. \u201cWhen we say what we mean by opening the economy, that\u2019s really unclear,\u201d Osterholm said. \u201cWe have to, we can\u2019t stay locked down for 18 months, but at the same time when you have cases increasing, deaths increasing, healthcare workers without adequate protective equipment, and we\u2019re suddenly going back to what was once our normal lives, that\u2019s not a safe place to be. We can\u2019t do that and not expect to see a major increase in cases.\u201d Keisha Lance Bottoms also, of course, discussed with CNN the coronavirus outbreak in her state and attempts to reopen the Georgia economy. As she did so she hit Donald Trump again, accusing him of \u201cerratic leadership\u201d during the crisis. Bottoms said it was \u201cdifficult to tell\u201d if people in Atlanta were following her recommendation to stay at home despite Georgia governor Brian Kemp\u2019s attempts to open the state up, per Trump\u2019s desire. \u201cMany young people are out and about as if everything is normal,\u201d she said. \u201cOur malls have opened. Restaurants are reopening. But, anecdotally, I have spoken with just as many people who have said that they will remain at home. \u201cMany of our Fortune 500 companies are not reopening for business just yet. And I think \u2026 therein lies the issue that we have really across this nation. You have Fortune 500 companies and people who have the ability to telework are able to remain at home, but our frontline workers, many who are most vulnerable in terms of having access to health insurance and to quality health care, are the people who are having to go back out to work. \u201cAnd so we will see over the next couple of weeks what this massive health experiment, what the results are in our state.\u201d Asked what she would like to see from the federal and state government to help remedy the kind of racial disparities in Covid-19 patients referred to by Robert F Smith on NBC, Bottoms said: \u201cOne, I think that we need to make sure that people have access to funding, people who own small businesses, that they have access to these loans, and that they are able to make decisions not based on economics, but what is best for their health and for their families and for their communities. \u201cBut, also, I think that we have to be responsible. We know that there will be a time that we have to reopen this country, because we\u2019re not at the point that there is a cure or even a vaccine for Covid-19. But I think we have to be very thoughtful. I don\u2019t think the way to reopen up Georgia and stimulate the economy is to send the people out who can least afford to get sick.\u201d Bottoms added: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to have those decisions put forth when we are getting really what I call erratic leadership from the White House and no clear blueprint on how we move forward thoughtfully as a country.\u201d Moving away from the coronavirus for a moment, the Democratic mayor of Atlanta has called the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed by two white men in February, a \u201clynching\u201d. Keisha Lance Bottoms also accused Donald Trump of inciting overt acts of racism. Speaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, the rising star within the Democratic party said the killing of Arbery, 25, was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. Father and son Gregory and Travis McMichael were charged with murder and aggravated assault on Thursday after video of a confrontation with an unarmed Arbery, who was African American, was made public. Asked if the former county police officer and his son would have been charged had the video not been posted online, Bottoms said: \u201cHad we not seen that video I don\u2019t think they would have been charged.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s 2020 and this was a lynching of an African American man.\u201d The Guardian has disclosed that police in Glynn county, Georgia, where Arbery was killed while jogging in a quiet suburban street, failed to conduct a thorough investigation. The idea that the incident was a lynching has also been expressed by the dead man\u2019s father, Marcus Arbery Sr, in an interview with the Guardian. Bottoms is an increasingly prominent voice in Georgia. As the black mayor of the state\u2019s largest city, she has been talked about as a possible vice-presidential candidate for Joe Biden. On Sunday she was sharply critical of Trump and the US justice department. \u201cWith the rhetoric we hearing coming out of the White House in so many ways, I think that many who are prone to being racist are given permission to do it in an overt way we otherwise would not see in 2020,\u201d she said. Where local police forced fail to take action against alleged racial killings, she said, there used to be the justice department as a \u201cbackstop\u201d, ensuring appropriate prosecutions. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that leadership at the top right now. It\u2019s disheartening.\u201d Trump has commented on Arbery\u2019s death, telling Fox News: \u201cMy heart goes out to the parents and the family and friends.\u201d \u201cJustice getting done is the thing that solves that problem,\u201d the president added. On Sunday, Bottoms talked about her four children, three of whom are boys. \u201cThey are angry and afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cIt speaks to the need to have leadership at the top that cares about all our communities, not just in words but in deeds as well.\u201d NBC\u2019s Meet the Press has an interesting interview today with Robert F Smith, a billionaire who a year ago famously took care of the debt of a whole graduating class at Morehouse, the alma mater of Martin Luther King in Atlanta. Discussing the coronavirus outbreak and its various disproportionate effects on communities of colour, Smith said: \u201cYou know, as a good friend of mine has said, this is a pandemic on top of a series of epidemics.\u201d Smith was not asked to elaborate but one would presume he was referring to the effects of gun violence, drug abuse, poverty, harsh sentencing laws and more. He added: \u201cAnd I think the important thing that we have to do is continue to rally as Americans to come with real lasting, scalable solutions to enable the communities that are getting hit first, hardest, and probably will take the longest to recover with solutions that will enable their communities to thrive again.\u201d On ABC\u2019s This Week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow repeated, as did treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin elsewhere, that the Trump administration does not want another stimulus bill yet. He was also asked about Barack Obama\u2019s comments about the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIt has been an absolute chaotic disaster,\u201d Obama said in a call reported by Yahoo News on Friday, \u201cwhen that mind-set of, what\u2019s in it for me and to heck with everybody else, when that mind-set is operationalized in our government.\u201d Kudlow listed Trump\u2019s responses to the crisis, and said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand what President Obama is saying. It just sounds so darn political to me. \u201cLook, what we\u2019ve done may not be 100% perfect. You know, these things happen once every 100 years. But the overall pictures, we\u2019ve created a massive health and safety infrastructure to deal with the pandemic here in the United States. \u201cAnd judging from the results, where there has been a flattening in the rate of growth in infection rates and mortality rates, it\u2019s working, so we\u2019re preparing to reopen the economy.\u201d Kudlow then repeated a talking point from a White House not surprisingly focused on economic recovery, given its centrality to Trump\u2019s re-election hopes in November. \u201cNext year, 2021 could be a tremendous snapback in the US economy,\u201d Kudlow said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m going to leave President Obama alone.\u201d Here\u2019s our report on what Obama said, which was mostly about Michael Flynn: Precautions against Covid-19 infection have been stepped up at the White House but are hampered by the cramped and poorly ventilated conditions in the West Wing, Kevin Hassett, a special adviser to Donald Trump on the pandemic response, said on Sunday. Speaking on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Hassett said extra measures were being taken after two White House staffers, including Katie Miller, the press secretary to vice-president Mike Pence and wife of senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, tested positive for the virus. \u201cThe West Wing, even with all the testing in the world and the best medical team on Earth, is a relatively cramped place,\u201d Hassett said. He added: \u201cThere are things that have to happen in that West Wing even though the building is a little old and poorly ventilated.\u201d Hassett emphasised that anyone coming into contact with Trump has to have tested negative in advance. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of evidence that you can pass the virus if you test negative,\u201d he said. But Trump has come under criticism in recent days for ostentatiously failing to wear a mask in White House meetings. He even toured a mask-making factory in Arizona without wearing a mask. Hassett said he himself did wear a mask when necessary. On the wider pandemic picture, Hassett said it was \u201ca scary time for everybody. We\u2019ve got moving on 80,000 dead and more than 30m getting unemployment benefits - it\u2019s a stressful time for all Americans\u201d. He warned that unemployed could exceed 20% of the US workforce by late summer, after which he predicted it would start to decline amid a strong economic rebound. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has been talking to Fox News Sunday about the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to reopen and restart the stalled US economy, and whether there will be another huge stimulus bill. Democrats who control the House want one of those but the White House doesn\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s the short version. The White House is \u201cabsolutely pushing for a payroll tax cut\u201d, Mnuchin says. Most observers think that is a non-starter, because Democrats won\u2019t let it. Payroll taxes, meaning deductions from regular paychecks, include funds for Social Security and Medicare, vital social benefits. Here\u2019s a taste of how BusinessInsider.com explains things: A payroll tax cut could free up more cash for employees and employers. If Social Security and Medicare taxes aren\u2019t taken out of paychecks, workers and businesses would take home a little more money with each paycheck. The idea is that workers benefiting from the cut would spend more money, which could help curb a recession. It could give employers more money, which could reduce the need to lay off employees. But here\u2019s what it says would happen: The tax cut would disproportionately give more money to people with higher incomes, who typically have more savings to fall back on during a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. A payroll tax cut would also do nothing to help those who lost their jobs because of the crisis, especially lower-income people in industries like tourism, hospitality, and dining that have been especially hit hard by the pandemic and decline in demand from consumers. Here\u2019s our business editor, Dominic Rushe, on the economic crisis: After Elon Musk sued local authorities in California and threatened to move Tesla\u2019s HQ to Texas or Nevada, over attempts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, one Democratic state politician had a blunt message for the electronic car magnate: \u201cF*ck Elon Musk.\u201d Lorena S Gonzalez from San Diego, who describes herself on Twitter as a \u201cMama, Labor Leader turned CA Assemblywoman [and] Progressive Latina Democrat\u201d, tweeted the pithy rebuke on Saturday night, earning predictable press attention. She did not immediately comment further. The fight is all about state regulations versus county regulations, and Reuters reported it thus: Musk has been pushing to reopen Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, factory after Alameda county\u2019s health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect. Tesla filed a lawsuit against the county on Saturday, calling the continued restrictions a \u2018power grab\u2019 by the county since California\u2019s governor had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen. The company said Alameda was going against the federal and California constitutions, as well as defying the governor\u2019s order, in the lawsuit filed in San Francisco federal court. Alameda county, where the Fremont factory is located, is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May, with only essential businesses allowed to reopen. County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. Musk, of course, was free with his tweeted comments, blasting \u201cthe unelected and ignorant \u2018Interim Health Officer\u2019 of Alameda\u201d for he said \u201cacting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!\u201d According to CNBC the official in question, Erica Pan, told an online town hall on Friday \u201ceven though California had relaxed Covid-19 restrictions at the state level, legally, \u2018If there are local orders, whichever is stricter prevails.\u2019 \u201cShe added that currently, Alameda county \u2013 where the Fremont car factory is based \u2013 is \u2018still a little bit stricter\u2019 than the state in its approach to protecting public health amid an outbreak of the novel coronavirus. CNBC quoted Pan as saying of Tesla: \u201cWe have not given the green light. We have been working with them looking at some of their safety plans. But no, we have not said that it is appropriate to move forward.\u201d \u201cFrankly, this is the final straw,\u201d Musk responded. \u201cTesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen[t] on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in [California].\u201d Musk also claimed \u201cTesla knows far more about what needs to be done to be safe through our Tesla China factory experience than an (unelected) interim junior official in Alameda County\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not messing around,\u201d the billionaire insisted. \u201cAbsurd [and] medically irrational behavior in violation of constitutional civil liberties, moreover by unelected county officials with no accountability, needs to stop.\u201d This is from Paula Reid of CBS, a reporter who has challenged Donald Trump publicly recently and gained a certain amount of fame as a result: Dr Anthony Fauci, 79, is the top US public health expert whose profile has risen steeply during the coronavirus crisis and who we learned last night will now enter a form of quarantine and work remotely due to exposure to a White House staffer who tested positive for Covid-19. Drs Stephen Hahn and Robert Redfield, other senior health advisers, are also in isolation. Tony Blair has waded into the row over China\u2019s role in exacerbating the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, saying the country had \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d but urging Europe and the US to keep lines of cooperation open. The former UK prime minister tells CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday that in what he calls the \u201cnew world order\u201d forced by coronavirus, co-operation between nation states and regions of the world will be all the more important. \u201cThe reflation of our own economies is obviously going to work better if there\u2019s global concerted action around the economy,\u201d Blair says. Taking a starkly different line to Donald Trump, who has become increasingly belligerent towards China and has repeated unproven theories that the disease originated in a Chinese laboratory, Blair cautions against any attempt to break ties with Beijing. \u201cIf you think of the big issues that we face today, whether it\u2019s on the economy or on issues like climate or indeed dealing with this global pandemic, how do you deal with it unless you have some space for cooperation with China?\u201d Here\u2019s the president\u2019s Sunday morning coronavirus tweet, or one of them: Suffice to say, whether or not the president is \u201cgetting great marks\u201d for how the coronavirus outbreak has been handled rather depends on who is doing the judging, and Trump\u2019s heralding of his restrictions (not outright ban) on travel from China relatively early in the outbreak is subject to all sorts of caveats. The president\u2019s Sunday morning tweet, or one of them: Pulitzers were handed out for work on the Russia investigation. Washington Post editor Marty Baron, for one, is not the kind of chap you\u2019d think would be inclined to give his back. Impeachment (which was all about Ukraine, as it happens) didn\u2019t feature in this year\u2019s list, though. Anyway, here\u2019s some context, if context is needed, for the president\u2019s fixation with the Russia investigation \u2013 which ended last spring, remember, with the publication of the Mueller report. On Thursday the justice department announced it was dropping its case against Michael Flynn, the retired general who was Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, was fired for lying to the vice-president and then pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador and co-operated with special counsel Robert Mueller, before changing his mind, seeking to withdraw his plea and, it seems, avoiding sentencing thanks to attorney general William Barr. Breath. Here\u2019s what Yahoo News said Barack Obama had to say about it all in a leaked tape recording: The news over the last 24 hours I think has been somewhat downplayed \u2013 about the justice department dropping charges against Michael Flynn. \u201cAnd the fact that there is no precedent that anybody can find for someone who has been charged with perjury [in fact Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI] just getting off scot-free. That\u2019s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic \u2013 not just institutional norms \u2013 but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk. \u201cAnd when you start moving in those directions, it can accelerate pretty quickly as we\u2019ve seen in other places.\u201d \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, and of course the politics of and around it. It\u2019s a fine \u2013 if surprisingly cold \u2013 day in New York, still the epicenter of the outbreak in the US although as Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday, things are improving if still, of course, vastly concerning. Here are the Johns Hopkins figures: US cases: 1,309,373 US deaths: 78,789 New York cases: 333,122 New York deaths: 26,612 Other states, of course, are hard-hit and some are being hit harder by the day. Some, many more than half the 50, are attempting various forms of economic reopening. Here\u2019s southern bureau chief Oliver Laughland\u2019s latest report from Biloxi, Mississippi: At the White House, of course, Donald Trump continues to push such reopening moves, while not lashing out at political enemies. Once again, there is no White House briefing, coronavirus task force or otherwise, on the schedule today. That might in part be because the task force is now committed to working remotely, because the virus has been spreading through the White House, very close to the president and his No2, Vice-President Mike Pence. Trump last communicated with the public via an absolute box barrage of retweets about Russia, James Comey, Michael Flynn, Adam Schiff and Robert Mueller. So far, so much like the rest of the last three years. The president wants the country to move on \u2013 but does he? Here\u2019s something that might\u2019ve contributed to the president\u2019s mood, which has developed this morning. More to come, of course. Here\u2019s some more reading in the meantime, from our columnist Robert Reich and under one of the more stark headlines I\u2019ve ever written:",
