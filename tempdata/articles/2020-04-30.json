Or his candidacy could attract small-government Republicans away from Trump to the benefit of Biden.</p> \n  <p>His chances of winning the presidency are slim.

They usually perform poorly.</p> \n  <p><strong>What is his relationship with Trump?</strong></p> \n  <p>Contentious. Amash has been a vocal critic of the president and the feeling is mutual. When Amash announced he was leaving the Republican party, Trump tweeted: \u201cGreat news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest &amp; most disloyal men in Congress is \u2018quitting\u2019 the Party. No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn\u2019t get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat.

The group wants to force the state to immediately remove voters it suspects have moved from the voter rolls. The state has refused to remove the voters, saying it is not confident enough the voters have moved and wants to give voters until after the 2020 election to confirm their voter registration.</p> \n  <p>Last year a <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fjan%2F13%2Fwisconsin-judge-orders-voters-purged-democrats-fined\">circuit court judge</a> ordered the state to remove the voters, but an appeals court reversed the ruling. The suit is being closely watched because it is believed to be an obvious effort to benefit Donald Trump, who won the state by just under 23,000 votes in 2016.

His recusal made a difference \u2013 the court wound up deadlocking 3-3. Kelly lost his election to Jill Karofsky, a liberal challenger, by more than 163,000 votes. But now that the election had passed, Kelly said he saw no ethical obstacle preventing him from hearing the case. \u201cIn light of the fact that this case cannot now affect any election in which I would be a candidate while the case is being decided, there is no ethical bar to my participation in the consideration of the petition for review or the merits of the case if the petition for review is granted,\u201d Kelly wrote in a Wednesday order. Karofsky\u2019s 10-year term begins on 1 August, and she will narrow the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3.</p> \n  <p>Stephen Gillers, a law professor at NYU and an expert on judicial ethics, said he did not see anything improper in Kelly\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is rare but not unheard of for a judge who recuses to unrecuse,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cJudge Kelly is still a judge and the matter is before his court.

The court noted that \u201cat most\u201d 39 non-citizens had registered to vote in Kansas over the last 19 years. Many of those cases, the court be explained by administrative error, and did not justify the burden placed on 30,000 voters. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1255520426798862339\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whoa!

Trump said federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus would be \u201cfading out\u201d. The guidelines are set to expire tomorrow, and Trump signaled he was looking ahead to reopening the country, applauding governors who have started to allow some businesses to reopen with restrictions. \u201cI am very much in favor of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting it going.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci expressed cautious optimism about the results of a trial of the drug remdesivir to treat coronavirus. The results indicated the drug reduced patients\u2019 recovery time and had an impact on patients\u2019 survival rate. \u201cThis will be the standard of care,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWhat it has proven is a drug can block this virus.\u201d The US economy shrank by 4.8% last quarter, according to new data from the commerce department. The figure is the latest indication of the devastating impact the pandemic is having on the economy. A new poll indicates most Americans are not ready to reopen the country. The PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll showed large majorities of Americans are uncomfortable with reopening schools or restaurants unless coronavirus testing is significantly expanded. The Guardian\u2019s technology reporter Kari Paul writes from California: Tesla founder Elon Musk went off script in the company\u2019s Q1 earnings call on Wednesday, calling San Francisco\u2019s shelter-in-place orders \u201cfascist\u201d as his frustration over the closure of his Bay Area factory continues. \u201cWe are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area,\u201d he began. \u201cThe extension of shelter in place -- or as I would call it, forcibly imprisoning people in their homes, against all constitutional right - and in my opinion infringing on people\u2019s freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong, and not why people came to America or pulled this country - what the fuck?\u201d he trailed off. He said shelter in place will cause \u201cgreat harm\u201d to companies. This comes after Musk sent a series of erratic tweets calling on the government to relax social distancing restrictions, sharing articles and praising examples of places relaxing their orders. \u201cFREE AMERICA NOW,\u201d one tweet read. Tesla reported stronger than expected earnings for quarter one, despite disruptions from coronavirus. Shares of the company were up nearly 2% at $813.77 in extended trade. Online demand for the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine surged by more than 1,000% after Donald Trump endorsed it as a potential treatment for Covid-19 without providing evidence it worked, a new study has found. There are no proven prescription therapies to treat Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Despite the lack of evidence, the presidential endorsement drove up online searches for buying hydroxychloroquine, and its chemical cousin chloroquine, by 1,389% and 442% respectively. Internet searches remained high, researchers said, even after NBC News reported an American couple had accidentally poisoned themselves by taking a liquid containing chloroquine meant to treat parasites in fish tanks, following a Trump press briefing in which he promoted the drug. \u201cWe know that high-profile endorsements matter in advertising, so it stands to reason that these endorsements could spur people to seek out these medications,\u201d said Michael Liu, a graduate student at Oxford University and the study\u2019s first author, in a statement. Want to catch up on coronavirus updates from around the world? Read The Guardian\u2019s global coronavirus blog: As Georgia governor Brian Kemp moves to reopen businesses in the state, against the advice of public health officials and the president, Black Georgians are disproportionately getting sick. In a survey of eight Georgia hospitals, researchers found that out of 305 Covid-19 patients, 247 were Black. The results were released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today. African Americans, who make up 30% of Georgia\u2019s population, overall account for 36% of confirmed cases, according to state data. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports from California: As coronavirus tore through jails and prisons across the United States, California reduced bail for most low-level offenses to $0, allowing thousands of defendants to wait out their court dates at home instead of in custody. The response across the criminal justice system in the state has been disparate, echoing longstanding tensions about reform. Prosecutors in Tulare county have \u201cworked around the clock\u201d to oppose the early release of more than 1,000 defendants, according to the district attorney there. In Los Angeles, leaked emails showed the district attorney\u2019s office instructing prosecutors to seek a loophole in the new bail schedule for some cases. And police unions in cities across California have argued the emergency schedule will lead to an uptick in crime. Hanging over the bail schedule debate is a referendum in November, when Californians will get to decide whether the state should eliminate its bail system moving forward. The success or failure of the emergency guideline, beyond the infection rate of the state\u2019s inmate population, has the very real possibility of becoming a talking point in all future debates for bail reform for years to come, criminal justice reform advocates say.

Amash, 40, is a lawyer by trade who first served in the Michigan statehouse before ascending to the US Congress in 2010 during the Tea Party wave. Amash, in his first campaign, benefited from support from major Tea Party groups. In 2019 Amash left the Republican party in protest of its seemingly immovable support for Donald Trump. He decided to join the Libertarian party and has served as one of the few members of Congress not part of the Republican or Democratic party. Could Amash\u2019s candidacy have an impact in the 2020 presidential election? It\u2019s possible. Amash, a fiscal conservative, could siphon away right-leaning voters disinclined to vote for Trump from former vice-president Joe Biden. Or his candidacy could attract small-government Republicans away from Trump to the benefit of Biden. His chances of winning the presidency are slim. Amash is getting into the race late and no presidential candidate running on the Libertarian party has ever actually been elected president. They usually perform poorly. What is his relationship with Trump? Contentious. Amash has been a vocal critic of the president and the feeling is mutual. When Amash announced he was leaving the Republican party, Trump tweeted: \u201cGreat news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest &amp; most disloyal men in Congress is \u2018quitting\u2019 the Party. No Collusion, No Obstruction! Knew he couldn\u2019t get the nomination to run again in the Great State of Michigan. Already being challenged for his seat. A total loser!\u201d (Amash, at times, has been mentioned as a potential candidate for statewide office but has never actually run for Senate or governor.) Read more: The White House meeting with business executives \u2013 which in many ways resembled a coronavirus briefing \u2013 just ended. As he\u2019s done at briefings, Trump took questions from reporters, alongside Mike Pence and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary. The president made many of the same claims he\u2019s made at press briefings, blithely repeating that the pandemic will soon \u201cbe gone\u201d, without explaining why. But there were a few key differences between the press briefings and today\u2019s live-streamed meeting. Trump\u2019s public health advisers were absent. And notably, the camera was continuously focused on Trump \u2013 there was no footage of the reporters in the room asking questions. Trump said he\u2019s planning a trip to Arizona next week, and Ohio soon. \u201cHopefully in the not too distant future we\u2019ll have some massive rallies and people will be sitting next to each other,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a rally where you have every fourth seat full, every six seats are empty for everyone you have full. That wouldn\u2019t look too good.\u201d The president suggested that a vaccine may not be needed as part of a recovery from the pandemic. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a vaccine, if the virus is gone, you\u2019re like where we were before,\u201d he said. At least 89 coronavirus vaccines are in development, according to the World Health Organization, but even the most promising options still need to undergo rigorous safety testing, which could take a year to 18 months. But without a vaccine, why does Trump think the pandemic will just go away? He dodged the question. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna go, it\u2019s gonna leave,\u201d Trump said, without explaining his thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be eradicated.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Daniel Kelly, the conservative Wisconsin supreme court justice who lost his re-election bid earlier this month, will participate in a controversial case before he leaves the court over whether more than 200,000 voters should be removed from the state\u2019s voter rolls. The Wisconsin supreme court is currently considering whether to hear the case, which was brought by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative legal group. The group wants to force the state to immediately remove voters it suspects have moved from the voter rolls. The state has refused to remove the voters, saying it is not confident enough the voters have moved and wants to give voters until after the 2020 election to confirm their voter registration. Last year a circuit court judge ordered the state to remove the voters, but an appeals court reversed the ruling. The suit is being closely watched because it is believed to be an obvious effort to benefit Donald Trump, who won the state by just under 23,000 votes in 2016. Voters who lived in zip codes that were predominantly students or African Americans were more than twice as likely to be flagged for removal, a Guardian analysis found. Kelly recused himself in November when the court considered a request to hear the case on an expedited basis. His recusal made a difference \u2013 the court wound up deadlocking 3-3. Kelly lost his election to Jill Karofsky, a liberal challenger, by more than 163,000 votes. But now that the election had passed, Kelly said he saw no ethical obstacle preventing him from hearing the case. \u201cIn light of the fact that this case cannot now affect any election in which I would be a candidate while the case is being decided, there is no ethical bar to my participation in the consideration of the petition for review or the merits of the case if the petition for review is granted,\u201d Kelly wrote in a Wednesday order. Karofsky\u2019s 10-year term begins on 1 August, and she will narrow the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3. Stephen Gillers, a law professor at NYU and an expert on judicial ethics, said he did not see anything improper in Kelly\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is rare but not unheard of for a judge who recuses to unrecuse,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cJudge Kelly is still a judge and the matter is before his court. The reason for the prior recusal, which was correct at the time, is no longer present. So it is fine to reverse his position.\u201d \u201cI see the new normal being what it was three months ago,\u201d Trump said. I think we want to go back to where it was.\u201d So far, his public health advisers have disagreed. The new normal, per Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, as well as the president\u2019s own plan to reopen the economy, suggest that distancing will have to be scaled back slowly. Nevertheless, Trump insisted, \u201cthe target date\u201d to reopen \u201cis as soon as possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf I watch Alabama play LSU, I don\u2019t want to see 20,000 people instead of 120,000 people.\u201d Hi, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh \u2013 blogging from the west coast. The president is speaking at a White House with industry executives. \u201cI don\u2019t see protecting cities and states if they\u2019re going to be sanctuaries,\u201d Trump said. Municipalities that prevent their law enforcement from cooperating with immigration authorities shouldn\u2019t get federal coronavirus aid, he said. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The US coronavirus death toll has surpassed 60,000. The US has also confirmed more than 1 million cases of coronavirus, representing about a third of all cases from around the world. Trump said federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus would be \u201cfading out.\u201d The guidelines are set to expire tomorrow, and Trump signaled he was looking ahead to reopening the country, applauding governors who have started to allow some businesses to reopen with restrictions. \u201cI am very much in favor of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting it going.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci expressed cautious optimism about the results of a trial of the drug remdesivir to treat coronavirus. The results indicated the drug reduced patients\u2019 recovery time and had an impact on patients\u2019 survival rate. \u201cThis will be the standard of care,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWhat it has proven is a drug can block this virus.\u201d The US economy shrank by 4.8% last quarter, according to new data from the commerce department. The figure is the latest indication of the devastating impact the pandemic is having on the economy. A new poll indicates most Americans are not ready to reopen the country. The PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll showed large majorities of Americans are uncomfortable with reopening schools or restaurants unless coronavirus testing is significantly expanded. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Vice President Mike Pence said he expects the US to be conducting 2 million tests a week next month. \u201cWe\u2019re doing more than a million tests a week now, 5.8 million tests total,\u201d Pence said moments ago during a White House event with industry executives. \u201cWe expect by next month very quickly to be at a capacity to do more than 2 million tests a week.\u201d That would work out to about 285,000 tests being conducted every day, but some health experts have said the country will need to conduct millions of tests a day to effectively limit the spread of the virus. The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn reports: New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, personally oversaw the dispersal of a large, tightly packed Hasidic Jewish funeral on Wednesday, lashing out at the conduct of mourners, sparking angry counter-criticism from community leaders. In a tweet, the mayor called the large processional \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d, and vowed to bring social gatherings such as that event to an end while movements are still restricted by coronavirus guidelines. A follow-up tweet from the mayor drew criticism for singling out the Jewish community and generalizing about its members: Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, tweeted that generalizing New York\u2019s Jewish population \u201cis outrageous especially when so many are scapegoating Jews\u201d. On Wednesday morning De Blasio apologized at a press event for a heavy-handed response, saying: \u201cIf you saw anger and frustration, you\u2019re right. I spoke out of real distress. People\u2019s lives were in danger right before my eyes.\u201d On the same day as the funeral, crowds gathered to watch a city flyover by the US navy\u2019s Blue Angels and the air force\u2019s Thunderbirds planes in honor of healthcare workers. \u201cOnly bigots have a problem when a few 100 Hasidim do what thousands of people in the same city have done the same day: not social distance,\u201d the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council tweeted. The Dow closed up more than 500 points following today\u2019s promising news about a potential coronavirus treatment. The Dow closed up 532 points, or about 2.2%, to 24,634, although markets are still significantly down from February. The markets seemed to be responding to the cautious optimism about the results of a trial of the drug remdesivir to treat coronavirus. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said of the drug earlier today, \u201cThis will be the standard of care. ... What it has proven is a drug can block this virus.\u201d But bad news still far outweighs the good when it comes to the state of the economy. New data from the commerce department shows the US economy shrank by 4.8% last quarter. The number of Americans who have died of coronavirus has now surpassed 60,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The country has recorded 60,207 deaths from coronavirus, and 1,030,487 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the US, representing about a third of all the cases confirmed around the world. The US has now lost more people to coronavirus than the Vietnam War. Over the country\u2019s nearly two decades of involvement in Vietnam, 58,220 Americans were killed. The death toll will continue to climb in the coming weeks, and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates the current death toll may represent an undercount. Trump said earlier today that the federal guidelines on limiting the spread of coronavirus, which are set to expire tomorrow, will be \u201cfading out.\u201d Appearing alongside Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards in the Oval Office, Trump indicated the guidelines would be relaxed as states start to look toward reopening their economies. \u201cI am very much in favor of what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump said of the governors who are starting to allow businesses to open with restrictions in place. \u201cThey\u2019re getting it going.\u201d Vice President Mike Pence added, \u201cFrankly, every state in America has embraced those guidelines at a minimum, or even done more, and now our focus is working with states as governors, like Gov. John Bel Edwards, unveil plans to open up their states again.\u201d Public health experts have warned the country could risk another surge in coronavirus cases if restrictions are relaxed too quickly, and many governors have looked to the federal government for guidance on how to safely reopen. Trump will participate in a virtual Fox News town hall on reopening the economy this weekend, the White House has just announced. In a press release on the town hall, Fox News said the event would take place Sunday from 7 pm to 9 pm ET, and it will be co-moderated by anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. The virtual town hall, which is entitled \u201cAmerica Together: Returning to Work,\u201d will air live from the Lincoln Memorial. Fox News noted the president would answer viewer-submitted questions for an hour and a half of the town hall, which is interesting considering Trump reportedly wanted to start a talk radio show as coronavirus cases started to rise in the US. According to the New York Times, the president envisioned hosting the show for two hours a day and taking listeners\u2019 questioners, but he ultimately decided against it because he didn\u2019t want to compete with controversial radio host Rush Limbaugh. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy criticized speaker Nancy Pelosi after the Democratic leader announced the members who would serve on the coronavirus select committee. McCarthy accused Pelosi of trying to launch \u201cimpeachment 2.0 with a partisan and unnecessary oversight committee.\u201d \u201cThe roster the speaker has chosen makes clear that this is not an honest effort at transparency and accountability, but rather another attempt to politically damage the Trump administration,\u201d a spokesman for the California Republican said. McCarthy previously said he would not name the Republican members of the select committee until the Democratic members were announced. Pelosi said she gave McCarthy her list of names last week. House speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced the Democratic members who will serve on the coronavirus select committee, which will oversee the distribution of government funds from the coronavirus relief bills that Congress has passed. The Democratic members are majority whip Jim Clyburn, finance committee chairwoman Maxine Waters, oversight committee chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, small business committee chairwoman Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, congressman Bill Foster, congressman Jamie Raskin and congressman Andy Kim. Clyburn will also serve as the chair of the select committee. \u201cAs House Speaker, I am proud to appoint these distinguished and accomplished leaders of the Congress and Country to the Select Committee on the Coronavirus,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cWe must make sure that the historic investment of taxpayer dollars made in the CARES Act is being used wisely and efficiently to help those in need, not be exploited by profiteers and price-gougers.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said the results of a trial of the drug remdesivir showed \u201cquite good news\u201d for the treatment of coronavirus. As Trump met with Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards in the Oval Office, Fauci told reporters that the results showed a \u201cclear-cut positive effect in diminishing time to recover.\u201d The trial found that the group of patients who received remdesivir took an average of 11 days to recover, versus 15 days for the placebo group. The remdesivir patients also saw a mortality rate of 8%, compared to 11.6% for the placebo group. \u201cThis will be the standard of care,\u201d Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. \u201cWhen you know a drug works, you have to let people in the placebo group know so they can take it.\u201d He added, \u201cWhat it has proven is a drug can block this virus.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: A Kansas law requiring residents to prove their citizenship when they registered to vote is both illegal and unconstitutional, a federal appeals court ruled on Wednesday. The law, which went into effect in 2013, required Kansans to show a document such as birth certificate or a passport when they went to register to vote. Before it was blocked by a lower court in 2016, it prevented around 30,000 people from registering to vote. Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state nationally known for his anti-immigrant views and support of voting restrictions, championed the measure, saying it was necessary to prevent non-citizens from registering to vote in his state. In an unusual move, Kobach personally defended the measure in court in a 2018 trial. Practically speaking, the ruling on Wednesday from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th circuit, upholds a lower court ruling from 2018. It does not change much in Kansas because the law was first blocked by a lower court in 2016. But it offered more affirmation that there was not the kind of voter fraud in Kansas to justify the law, as Kobach claimed. The court noted that \u201cat most\u201d 39 non-citizens had registered to vote in Kansas over the last 19 years. Many of those cases, the court be explained by administrative error, and did not justify the burden placed on 30,000 voters. The case was \u201cthe most important voting rights trial of the 21st century,\u201d tweeted Richard Hasen, an election law expert and law professor at the University of California, Irvine. It was closely-watched among voting rights advocates, who have long seen Kobach, who chaired Donald Trump\u2019s short-lived voter fraud commission, as a leader in a conservative push to restrict voting rights. The American Civil Liberties Union, which helped represent the plaintiffs in the case, saw it as a chance to put Kobach\u2019s claims about voter fraud on trial and show how flimsy they were. Kobach said the ruling was an example of \u201cjudicial activism\u201d and a \u201cperversion of the 14th Amendment Equal Protection Clause.\u201d A spokesperson for Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab said his office was reviewing the ruling. \u201cThis law disenfranchised tens of thousands of Kansans, denying them the most fundamental right in our democracy,\u201d said Dale Ho, the director of the ACLU\u2019s voting rights project. \u201cWe are gratified the court struck it down, and now call upon Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab to turn the page on Kris Kobach\u2019s sorry legacy of voter suppression, drop any further appeals, and work with us collaboratively in the interests of all Kansas voters.\u201d There are no plans to postpone or otherwise alter a special congressional election in Wisconsin that is less than two weeks away, even though more than 50 people who voted in person or worked the polls during the state\u2019s presidential primary earlier this month have tested positive for Covid-19, The Associated Press writes. Democratic governor Tony Evers tried to change the April 7 election so that it would be conducted entirely by mail, but he was blocked by the Republican-led state legislature and conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court. Several of the 52 people who have tested positive and were at the polls on April 7 also reported other ways they may have been exposed to the virus, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said. Because of that, it\u2019s unclear if those people contracted the virus at the polls, but there were dire warnings at the time that demanding in-person voting could lead to a surge in coronavirus cases. The 52 positive cases were in people who tested positive in the two weeks after the election, so by April 21. Most people show symptoms within 14 days of exposure, though some people who have the virus don\u2019t show symptoms. After next week, the state will no longer ask people who test positive for the virus whether they were at the polls on April 7 because of how much time has passed, said Julie Willems Van Dijk, who heads the state health agency. \u201cWe\u2019re getting to the point where the door will be closing on those,\u201d she said. Statewide, there have been more than 6,200 confirmed cases and 300 deaths since the outbreak began. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The US economy shrank by 4.8% last quarter, according to new data from the commerce department. The figure is one more indication of how the economy is suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Most Americans are not ready for the country to reopen, according to a new poll. The PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll showed large majorities of Americans are not comfortable with reopening restaurants or schools without an increase in coronavirus testing. Jared Kushner described the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus as a \u201cgreat success story,\u201d despite widespread criticism of the early response. The comment came one day after the US reached the grim milestone of having confirmed more than 1 million cases of coronavirus. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, described the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus as \u201ca great success story\u201d just a day after the US reached the grim milestone of confirming more than 1 million cases of the virus. \u201cWe\u2019re on the other side of the medical aspect of this,\u201d Kushner told Fox News. \u201cThe federal government rose to the challenge, and this is a great success story, and I think that\u2019s really what needs to be told.\u201d Kushner\u2019s comments are objectionable for several reasons. For one, it is hard to argue that any crisis resulting in the death of at least 59,000 Americans can be categorized as a \u201cgreat success story.\u201d For another, the federal government\u2019s early response to the virus has been widely criticized, in part due to a critical delay in testing that hobbled states\u2019 ability to identify early cases. Finally, it\u2019s unclear whether the country is \u201c on the other side of the medical aspect of this,\u201d considering public health experts have warned the country could see a second wave of infections in the fall. Some states may also see a surge in cases in the coming weeks if social distancing restrictions are relaxed too quickly. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has just ended his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Here\u2019s some of what he covered: The governor once again criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for opposing additional fundings for state governments. Cuomo again noted McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky is much more reliant on federal funding than New York is, and the governor accused the Republican leader of playing politics with American lives. Cuomo has ordered the MTA to come up with a plan to sanitize every subway car every night. The announcement comes as the governor has expressed alarm about homeless New Yorkers potentially spreading the virus as they sleep in subway cars. The state is expanding coronavirus testing for first responders. New York has conducted more than 2,000 antibody tests on first responders, and the results indicated 17.1% of New York fire department and EMT workers and 10.5% of New York police officers have coronavirus antibodies. Another 330 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday. The daily death toll has come down significantly from earlier this month, but it remains alarmingly high. Cuomo unveiled a mural of hundreds of homemade masks sent to New York from across the country. The governor said the mural represented a \u201cself-portrait of America\u201d and suggested it should serve as an example for politicians, although some viewers questioned why the masks had not been distributed. New York governor Andrew Cuomo warned it was \u201cextraordinarily dangerous\u201d to bring politics into the country\u2019s response to coronavirus. The Democratic governor said this was the \u201cmost dramatic\u201d situation the country has faced in recent decades, and it will require cooperation across the different branches of government. \u201cThis is all uncharted water,\u201d Cuomo said of the crisis, adding that handling the pandemic will require politicians to be \u201cat our best.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s large collage of handmade masks sent to the state immediately prompted this question on Twitter: why hadn\u2019t the masks been distributed? A senior adviser to the governor responded by noting the state has been distributing millions of masks to vulnerbale populations in recent weeks. But that response didn\u2019t directly answer the question of why the governor decided to use the masks as a prop to criticize Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell. Moments ago, New York governor Andrew Cuomo once again went after Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for opposing additional government funding for states. Echoing comments from last week, Cuomo noted McConnell\u2019s home state of Kentucky is much more reliant on federal funding than New York is. Cuomo accused McConnell of playing politics in the middle of a national crisis, dividing the country into \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d as the US coronavirus death toll approaches 60,000. The governor also suggested Republicans were trying to direct government funds to big businesses instead of average Americans as the country suffers deep economic hardship. New York governor Andrew Cuomo unveiled a large collage of the masks that Americans from across the country have sent the state as it suffers the effects of the pandemic. Cuomo said the hundreds of masks represented \u201ca self-portrait of America\u201d and said the collage spelled \u201clove.\u201d The governor unveiled the collage after sharply criticizing Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s comments last week suggesting states should declare bankruptcy rather than receive additional federal funding. \u201cPoliticians, try to be half as good as the American people,\u201d Cuomo said as he stood beside the collage. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state would administer coronavirus tests to 1,000 transportation workers. Cuomo said he has also directed the MTA to develop a plan to disinfect every subway car every night to limit the spread of the virus. The governor once again railed against allowing those who are homeless to sleep in subway cars, warning that could cause transmission of the virus. \u201cTo let homeless people stay on the trains with no mask, no equipment -- you\u2019re not helping the homeless,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state would move to expand coronavirus testing for frontline workers, who face an increased risk of contracting the virus. The governor announced the state has conducted more than 2,000 antibody tests on first responders so far, which showed 17.1% of New York fire department and EMT workers and 10.5% of New York police officers tested positive. New York governor Andrew Cuomo just referenced a Guardian article on the spread of coronavirus in Germany during his daily briefing. Cuomo was citing our report on how Germany has asked citizens to stay home as much as possible amid evidence that coronavirus infections are on the rise. The Guardian\u2019s Philip Oltermann reports from Berlin: The basic reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, has come to be seen as the key indicator over whether restrictions on public life can be loosened after Angela Merkel stressed the importance of keeping the number below one. On Tuesday, the German government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), announced the reproduction number for Monday 27 April had risen to 1, after having put it as low as 0.7 in mid-April. Lothar Wieler, the RKI\u2019s president, later specified that the reproduction rate for Monday was 0.96, and therefore technically still below one. ... Wieler appealed to the German public to \u2018preserve our success\u2019 of having prevented health services from being overwhelmed by continuing to apply physical distancing even though federal authorities have already begun to relax restrictions on social movement. Another 330 New Yorkers died of coronavirus yesterday, governor Andrew Cuomo announced during his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to the pandemic. Tuesday\u2019s daily death toll was almost identical to Monday\u2019s, meaning the rate of fatalities in the state is remaining high, even though it has come down significantly from a few weeks ago. Cuomo noted overall coronavirus hospitalizations once again dropped slightly, but the number of new hospitalizations was up slightly from Monday, a disconcerting sign as the state looks ahead to reopening. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests the US coronavirus death toll may be significantly higher than currently reported. The New York Times reports: Total deaths in seven states that have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic are nearly 50 percent higher than normal for the five weeks from March 8 through April 11, according to new death statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 9,000 more deaths than were reported as of April 11 in official counts of deaths from the coronavirus. The new data is partial and most likely undercounts the recent death toll significantly. But it still illustrates how the coronavirus is causing a surge in deaths in the places it has struck, probably killing more people than the reported statistics capture. These increases belie arguments that the virus is only killing people who would have died anyway from other causes. Instead, the virus has brought a pattern of deaths unlike anything seen in recent years. If you look at the provisional deaths from all causes, death counts in New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, Maryland and Colorado have spiked far above their normal levels for the period. In New York City, the home of the biggest outbreak, the number of deaths over this period is more than three times the normal number. New York officials have already said the state\u2019s reported death toll, which is the highest in the country, is likely an undercount because many coronavirus victims died at home without being officially tested for the virus. Trump mocked Justin Amash after the independent congressman announced the formation of an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian party\u2019s presidential nomination. The president sarcastically said Amash \u201cwould make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his Congressional seat.\u201d Amash, who left the Republican party last year due to his criticism of Trump, had already said he would not campaign for his congressional seat again. Trump went on to say of Amash, \u201cI like him even more than Jill Stein!\u201d Stein was the Green party\u2019s 2016 presidential nominee, and many Democrats criticized her for helping to draw votes away from Hillary Clinton in the general election. The president\u2019s mocking tweet could indicate he thinks Amash\u2019s third-party bid will help his chances of reelection. The acting navy secretary has ordered a wider investigation of how coronavirus spread on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, delaying a decision on whether to reinstate the ship\u2019s former commander. \u201cI am directing Adm. Gilday to conduct a follow-on command investigation,\u201d acting navy secretary James McPherson said in a statement, referring to the chief of naval operations. \u201cThis investigation will build on the good work of the initial inquiry to provide a more fulsome understanding of the sequence of events, actions, and decisions of the chain of command surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt.\u201d The former commander of the ship, Captain Brett Crozier, was removed from his post after his letter raising concerns about the spread of coronavirus among sailors was made public. The first lady urged a slow reopening of the economy in a new tweet, as a number of states start to look at loosening some social distancing restrictions. Melania Trump encouraged Americans to continue practicing social distancing and covering their faces to limit the spread of coronavirus. \u201cWe need to make sure we slowly get back to normal while still fighting to keep the virus suppressed,\u201d the first lady said. The tweet was noteworthy because of how ardently the first lady\u2019s husband has been pushing for states to reopen in the hope it will help the US economy quickly recuperate its recent losses. Reports emerged yesterday that Trump told governors they should \u201cseriously consider\u201d reopening schools, even though many states have already announced schools will stay closed for the remainder of the academic year. Trump has told intelligence agencies to investigate whether China or the World Health Organization concealed early information about coronavirus, according to a new report. NBC News reports: A specific \u2018tasking\u2019 seeking information about the outbreak\u2019s early days was sent last week to the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, which includes the National Center for Medical Intelligence, an official directly familiar with the matter said. The CIA has received similar instructions, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. President Donald Trump appeared to refer to the request at his news conference Monday. \u2018We\u2019re doing very serious investigations,\u2019 Trump said. \u2018We are not happy with that whole situation, because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly, and it wouldn\u2019t have spread all over the world.\u2019 As part of the tasking, intelligence agencies were asked to determine what the WHO knew about two research labs studying coronaviruses in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus was first observed. NBC News has previously reported that the spy agencies have been investigating the possibility that the virus escaped accidentally from one of the labs, although many experts believe that is unlikely. As the president has attracted widespread criticism for his administration\u2019s early response to coronavirus, Trump has tried to shift the blame to everyone from congressional Democrats to China and the WHO. Independent congressman Justin Amash announced yesterday he has formed an exploratory committee to seek the Libertarian party\u2019s presidential nomination. The Michigan lawmaker, who left the Republican party last year due to criticism of Trump, previously indicated he was considering a long-shot, third-party bid for the White House. \u201cAmericans are ready for practical approaches based in humility and trust of the people,\u201d Amash said in his announcement about the exploratory committee. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for a presidency that will restore respect for our Constitution and bring people together.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether Amash\u2019s bid would do more to help Trump or Joe Biden in the general election, but a number of the president\u2019s critics on both sides of the aisle warned that Amash could bolster Trump\u2019s chances of winning reelection. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Amanda Holpuch report: Donald Trump rolled out a new blueprint for reopening the country on Tuesday, dubbed Opening up America Again, that included ramping up testing and a partnership with drugstore chains to expand access to tests nationwide. \u201cWe are doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually reopen our nation and to safely get our people back to work,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere is a hunger for getting our country back, and it is happening.\u201d But the real truth is that the reopening of America will happen slowly, bit by bit, state by state, city by city, business by business, building by building. Corporate America will have as large a say as Trump as to when things will really reopen. So will the state governors. And as the US contemplates getting back to normal, it is also becoming clear our definition of \u201cnormal\u201d may have changed forever. The very nature of work-life is being rethought: some 49% of CFOs see remote working as a permanent solution for some workers. A widespread reopening will have to take all these factors into account. Country by city, building by building, job by job. A federal or local order to reopen will be just one part of this incredibly complex puzzle and all these changes will take time. Here\u2019s an unsurprising headline: Joe Biden won Ohio\u2019s Democratic presidential primary yesterday. The former vice president won the support of 72% of Ohio\u2019s Democratic voters, while Bernie Sanders secured 17% of the vote, even though he has suspended his campaign. (The Vermont senator has said he will remain on states\u2019 ballots in an effort to win more delegates and thus influence the Democratic party\u2019s platform.) But the more interesting headline from Ohio may be how it was able to transition to an almost entirely vote-by-mail primary in a little over a month. Ohio\u2019s primary was originally scheduled for last month, but governor Mike DeWine moved to cancel in-person voting at the last minute due to concerns about voters spreading coronavirus at polling places. Many states have since followed in Ohio\u2019s footsteps, delaying their presidential primaries and expanding absenteee voting options to limit in-person voting, and Ohio\u2019s transition to vote-by-mail could serve as one example for the general election in November, barring the last-minute confusion about in-person voting last month. In a statement earlier this week, Ohio secretary of state Frank LaRose said, \u201cIn a matter of weeks, we\u2019ve done something that\u2019s taken other states years to do \u2013 transform our state into one capable of voting entirely by mail.\u201d The longest economic expansion in US history officially came to an end on Wednesday when the commerce department announced the economy shrank 4.8% in the first three months of the year. The economic slump, the steepest since the last recession in 2008, is just an early indicator of how severely the coronavirus pandemic has mauled the US economy. Much of the US economy shut down in March in an effort to contain the virus, which triggered 26 million people to file for unemployment benefits and wiped out a decade of jobs gains, at the end of the first quarter. The next set of figures from the commerce department will more accurately reflect the true scale of its impact. Kevin Hassett, senior economic adviser to the White House, has predicted gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 the widest measure of the economy \u2013 could fall at an annualized rate of 30% in the next quarter. Goldman Sachs expects a 15% unemployment rate in the US by mid-year, up from 4.4% at present. The fall is the sharpest quarterly decline in GDP since the end of 2008 when the economy contracted by an annualized rate of 8.4%. But on current forecasts the drop-off could soon rival the economic collapse of the Great Depression. In 1932 the US economy shrank 13% over the year. Good morning, live blog readers. There are a pair of new polls out this morning that are sure to make Donald Trump a bit nervous about how Americans are weathering the coronavirus crisis. According to a PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll, most Americans do not feel ready to relax social distancing restrictions, even as the president pushes states to start the process of reopening. When asked if it was a good idea for students to return to schools without further coronavirus testing, only 14% said yes. Only 19% said the same of restaurants reopening, and allowing large groups of people to attend sporting events got the approval of only 8% of respondents. This is all despite the fact that 50% of those who were surveyed said their household had suffered a job loss or a reduction in hours since the start of the crisis. Another poll adds some context to Americans\u2019 hesitation on reopening. A new Politico/Morning Consult poll shows 79% of voters consider a second wave of coronavirus cases to be very or somewhat likely. All of this paints a very alarming picture about the state of the country. Americans are suffering because of the current crisis, but they realize that there is no simple way to return to normal, no matter how much the president may wish for there to be.",

I forgot about Covid-19, the friends and family I missed, and even the crusty bits on my share house stove. That unctuous soup filled my entire universe, and for a minute, I felt at peace. I also felt like I was in an episode of Netflix\u2019s spellbindingly mundane Samurai Gourmet.</p> <p>In Masayuki Kusumi\u2019s 12-part 2017 miniseries, recently retired salaryman Takeshi Kasumi (Naoto Takenaka), the gentle 60-year-old protagonist, is troubled by his new free time.

(When he is too embarrassed to drink a beer with lunch, the samurai swaggers into the restaurant and demolishes a bottle of sake. Emboldened, Kasumi orders two beers.) On his journeys of self-discovery he finds unfamiliar inner strength in the face of uncertainty and lets go of the pressures and worries of his former life, eating and doing whatever he wants.</p> <p>Each 20-minute episode is a soothing lesson in optimism. In one he swoons over a takeaway bento box as his neighbour asks, \u201cIs it really that good?\u201d He thinks: \u201cIt\u2019s just a plain lunch, but eating it under a clear sky makes it special.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de84957aef7d0ecb05f3f654c35433b98f1f5191\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de84957aef7d0ecb05f3f654c35433b98f1f5191/131_0_1873_1124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naoto Takenaka as Takeshi Kasumi in Samurai Gourmet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Each 20-minute episode is a soothing lesson in optimism.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lovingly shot, slow-panning culinary scenes make ordinary Tokyo kitchens feel like Neverland as each pickled plum, slab of stewed tofu, and paddle of rice glitters through the dewy camera filter, captivating Kasumi\u2019s every sense, and yours, for a moment. Each time Kasumi uncontrollably blurts out \u201cumai!\u201d (\u201cdelicious\u201d), jauntily pops apart a set of bamboo chopsticks, or watches beer bubbles slowly bead up his glass, it feels like a scented candle is illuminating the end of this dark tunnel.</p> <p>Dreamy food visuals aside, Samurai Gourmet is, at its core, about the joy of discovery, and of nostalgia. Kasumi fondly recounts memories of energy in his teens, confidence in his 20s, and young love with his wife Shizuko. While eating grilled dried mackerel at a seaside inn, he\u2019s reminded of a weekend trip he took with friends in high school \u2013 the first time he enjoyed mackerel, and the first time he felt adult. \u201cThat memory makes this mackerel even more delicious,\u201d he considers, before asking the elderly innkeeper for a second helping.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/29/zoeys-extraordinary-playlist-yes-the-musical-series-is-cheesy-but-its-also-a-glorious-lockdown-escape\">Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist: yes, the musical series is cheesy.

As my housemates blast Ariana Grande and we dance around our living room at 4am, I long for the dancefloors of Melbourne music festivals and nightclubs. My partner shaking margaritas in a pickle jar makes me miss sitting at a bar. And I still crave my favourite pho restaurant, even after brewing broth for 12 hours.

      "bodyText": "A month into isolation I found myself hypnotised by the slowly slithering oil slicks on top of some freshly made chicken broth. I forgot about Covid-19, the friends and family I missed, and even the crusty bits on my share house stove. That unctuous soup filled my entire universe, and for a minute, I felt at peace. I also felt like I was in an episode of Netflix\u2019s spellbindingly mundane Samurai Gourmet. In Masayuki Kusumi\u2019s 12-part 2017 miniseries, recently retired salaryman Takeshi Kasumi (Naoto Takenaka), the gentle 60-year-old protagonist, is troubled by his new free time. He decides to explore Tokyo on foot alone, eating something new every day. Whenever Kasumi is challenged by a new experience, an imaginary wandering samurai appears \u2013 Kasumi\u2019s idealised self \u2013 to show him the way. (When he is too embarrassed to drink a beer with lunch, the samurai swaggers into the restaurant and demolishes a bottle of sake. Emboldened, Kasumi orders two beers.) On his journeys of self-discovery he finds unfamiliar inner strength in the face of uncertainty and lets go of the pressures and worries of his former life, eating and doing whatever he wants. Each 20-minute episode is a soothing lesson in optimism. In one he swoons over a takeaway bento box as his neighbour asks, \u201cIs it really that good?\u201d He thinks: \u201cIt\u2019s just a plain lunch, but eating it under a clear sky makes it special.\u201d The lovingly shot, slow-panning culinary scenes make ordinary Tokyo kitchens feel like Neverland as each pickled plum, slab of stewed tofu, and paddle of rice glitters through the dewy camera filter, captivating Kasumi\u2019s every sense, and yours, for a moment. Each time Kasumi uncontrollably blurts out \u201cumai!\u201d (\u201cdelicious\u201d), jauntily pops apart a set of bamboo chopsticks, or watches beer bubbles slowly bead up his glass, it feels like a scented candle is illuminating the end of this dark tunnel. Dreamy food visuals aside, Samurai Gourmet is, at its core, about the joy of discovery, and of nostalgia. Kasumi fondly recounts memories of energy in his teens, confidence in his 20s, and young love with his wife Shizuko. While eating grilled dried mackerel at a seaside inn, he\u2019s reminded of a weekend trip he took with friends in high school \u2013 the first time he enjoyed mackerel, and the first time he felt adult. \u201cThat memory makes this mackerel even more delicious,\u201d he considers, before asking the elderly innkeeper for a second helping. While Kasumi shows gratitude for past experiences, I, on the other hand, have been recounting my pre-coronavirus life with envy. As my housemates blast Ariana Grande and we dance around our living room at 4am, I long for the dancefloors of Melbourne music festivals and nightclubs. My partner shaking margaritas in a pickle jar makes me miss sitting at a bar. And I still crave my favourite pho restaurant, even after brewing broth for 12 hours. But that attitude won\u2019t get me through isolation. In one episode Kasumi\u2019s wanderings take him to a traditional izakaya, when heavy rain seeps through the roof, drenching plates of karaage chicken. The tension is mounting as Kasumi, inspired by his inner samurai, has just asked one drunk and cantankerous customer to pipe down. The bar owner releases the pressure valve by fetching a handful of umbrellas for everyone in the joint, uniting them in laughter. \u201cAnother problem solved,\u201d says one punter. Samurai Gourmet has taught me that the quotidian can be remarkable in vexing times. Like my unemployed partner who\u2019s merrily taken up sweeping leaves; the feeling of connection I get from sharing a stir-fry with my housemates; or my friend Jax who baked me a cake while recovering from a mid-lockdown mastectomy. I\u2019m noticing how the people around me, like Kasumi, are coping with uncertainty by living in the moment, and if I can enjoy any food as much as he does, I think I\u2019ll be alright. \u2022 Samurai Gourmet is streaming on Netflix",

Lady Hale, the president of the British supreme court, favours brooches. She famously wore a giant jewelled spider the day she ruled that UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/28/lady-hale-spider-brooch-launches-global-trend\">\u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court Ruth Bader-Ginsberg has her dissent collar. <br><br>Her Majesty the queen, may once have used a brooch to express one\u2019s distaste for Donald Trump, her love of Obama and her approval of Canada. She may even have worn a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jun/21/queens-hat-alludes-to-brexit\">pro-European Union hat</a>.<br><br>Strangely, Dr Birx has not had much time to comment on the meaning behind her scarves. We know that one, an Afework Tekle art silk scarf from Ethiopia, was a gift from a colleague. Another, also Herm\u00e8s, costs around US$700. Some, like one called Eagle and another called Daughters of the American Revolution, are patriotic.</p> \n<p>Then there\u2019s the scarf featuring a cherry blossom motif, which may or may not be a reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/aug/26/braindead-the-absurd-new-thriller-that-will-make-your-head-explode\">BrainDead</a>, a TV show in which aliens living in Washington\u2019s cherry trees take over the minds of politicians. It seems likelier that Dr Birx had the Northern Hemisphere spring on her mind \u2013 but who knows?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-0XWcOpZa_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings. Most recently, a video of her face as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral. As Trump spoke, Birx appeared to purse her lips and looked down, her hands clasped in her lap. Around her neck and shoulders was a silk scarf, loosely tied \u2013 almost in the style of a girl scout. The scarf was Herm\u00e8s. Or, to be precise, Herm\u00e8s\u2019 \u201cRetour \u00e0 la Terre\u201d, in peach. We know this because there is now an Instagram account devoted to Dr Birx\u2019s scarves. She wears a different one almost every day, tied in a variety of styles, a move that has spawned her scarves their own online fanbase. The @deborahbirxscarves Instagram page, created by Texas resident Victoria Strout, now has more than 31,000 followers. Strout, who works at a footage and music licensing company, said she hopes the account provides a \u201cbrain break\u201d for people dealing with nonstop Covid-19 coverage, as well as a bipartisan celebration of Dr Birx, who has had a distinguished three-decade-long career focused on HIV/AIDS, vaccine research, and global health. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of people that admire Dr Birx and also like scarves,\u201d Strout said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of created its own little community, which has been really fun and something I absolutely didn\u2019t expect.\u201d One follower of the account suggested Birx was using the scarves as a face mask as soon as she left the White House podium, another implored her to teach the world her scarf-tying technique. There may also have been a \u201cBirx scarf bump,\u201d the Wall Street Journal reported, with one site, Vestiaire Collective, which sells second-hand clothes, reporting a 1,148% increase in the sale of Herm\u00e8s scarves from the same period last year. Dr Birx joins a tradition of powerful women signalling their feelings through the medium of trademark accessories. Lady Hale, the president of the British supreme court, favours brooches. She famously wore a giant jewelled spider the day she ruled that UK prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation \u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d. Associate Justice of the US Supreme Court Ruth Bader-Ginsberg has her dissent collar. Her Majesty the queen, may once have used a brooch to express one\u2019s distaste for Donald Trump, her love of Obama and her approval of Canada. She may even have worn a pro-European Union hat. Strangely, Dr Birx has not had much time to comment on the meaning behind her scarves. We know that one, an Afework Tekle art silk scarf from Ethiopia, was a gift from a colleague. Another, also Herm\u00e8s, costs around US$700. Some, like one called Eagle and another called Daughters of the American Revolution, are patriotic. Then there\u2019s the scarf featuring a cherry blossom motif, which may or may not be a reference to BrainDead, a TV show in which aliens living in Washington\u2019s cherry trees take over the minds of politicians. It seems likelier that Dr Birx had the Northern Hemisphere spring on her mind \u2013 but who knows? Reuters also contributed to this report.",

Trump\u2019s handling of the virus has come under strong scrutiny with just 43% of Americans approving of his handing of the pandemic, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll on 27-28 April, days after the president\u2019s discredited comments on injecting disinfectant. Trump told Reuters he did not believe opinion polls that showed his likely Democratic presidential opponent, Joe Biden, leading the race for the White House. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the polls,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI believe the people of this country are smart. And I don\u2019t think that they will put a man in who\u2019s incompetent.\u201d US economic figures won\u2019t have helped Trump\u2019s position, with news that the economy shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in first quarter of the year \u2013 a precursor to far grimmer reports expected in later months from the severe recession triggered by the pandemic. The US is not the only country to take issue with China\u2019s handling of the virus. Australia has called for an independent investigation into its origins, along the lines of weapons inspectors who were tasked with inspecting Iraq\u2019s arsenal before the second Gulf war. Beijing has rejected the suggestion, saying that if that line was pursued, Chinese companies and students may not choose to do business or study in Australia. Britain\u2019s ambassador to the US Karen Pierce said her country backed calls for an investigation but said any inquiry should come later. In comments published on Thursday, Le Yucheng, a vice-foreign minister said China \u201cresolutely opposes\u201d any international investigation into the pandemic, which he described as an effort to stigmatise the country. Beijing has blamed the US for leading international criticism against China. An English-language editorial in the nationalist state-run Global Times said the lack of US leadership was putting the entire world \u201cunder risk.\u201d \u201cCooperation is the most effective solution \u2026 But if the world cannot keep a sober head on this, there will probably be a more profound crisis waiting for humanity after the pandemic is gone,\u201d it said. Chinese health authorities reported four new coronavirus cases on Thursday, a day after officials downgraded Beijing\u2019s emergency response level and loosened travel restrictions, including quarantine requirements for those travelling into the capital. In a further sign Chinese officials believe the epidemic is under control within its borders, Beijing said on Wednesday that its previously delayed parliament meeting would open on May 21 and 22. In other coronavirus developments: Global infections for coronavirus are approaching 3.2 million, with more than 227,000 deaths. The US leads the world on infections (1,038,451) and more than 60,000 deaths. Italy is the next worst affected with 27,682 deaths and then the UK, with 26,166. South Korea reported no new domestic coronavirus cases on Thursday for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The country had just four new infections, all imported cases, taking the national tally to 10,765. The death toll rose by one to 247. Japan is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency for another month, local media have reported, after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201csevere\u201d. The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa surged past the 5,000 mark on Thursday after it saw the largest single-day jump to date, health ministry figures showed. A World Health Organization official declined comment on reports that Gilead Science\u2019s remdesivir could help treat Covid-19, but said that further data was needed.

Coal demand is forecast to fall by 8% compared with 2019, its largest decline since the end of the second world war.

It found that global energy demand was likely to plummet by 6% this year, the equivalent of losing the entire energy demand of India \u2013 the world\u2019s third largest energy consumer \u2013 or the combined energy demand of France, Germany, Italy and the UK. The impact of the pandemic on energy use will be more keenly felt in advanced economies where demand is expected to fall by 11% across the EU and 9% across the US. The collapse of fossil fuel demand could lead global emissions to fall by 8% compared with 2019, a drop six times larger than the record fall after the financial crisis in 2009 to lows not seen in the past decade. The 3bn tonne drop in carbon dioxide emissions surpasses data commissioned by the Guardian this month that predicted a fall or 2.5 bn tonnes this year, greater than the drop triggered by every financial crash since the second world war combined.",

For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/01/shape-of-the-future-how-barrys-bootcamp-changed-the-way-we-work-out\" title=\"\">Barry\u2019s Bootcamp</a> on Instagram, Mishler\u2019s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction.

Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benagain/status/1250357935601004550\" title=\"\">a digital replica</a> of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.</p> <p>Working out at home in the time of coronavirus is fraught. Most of us don\u2019t have much space to spare, let alone weights or props to replicate the gym (or a steam room or a woman arguing on her phone while jogging on a treadmill next to you). But even for those of us committed to being deeply unambitious during this period, exercise does eventually seem like a good idea, if not just to make up for all the pasta dinners and handfuls of milk chocolate \u2013 also to alleviate boredom, or sore backs from sitting cross-legged on the couch all day, or to introduce some movement beyond padding in slippers a few feet from the bedroom to a makeshift standing desk (a laptop propped up on a cupboard), or to give the illusion of some form of routine.</p> <p>Even though every form of exercise, from pilates to ecstatic dance, is being offered in online workouts, and in many cases for free, yoga seems to have risen to the top. It doesn\u2019t require any fancy accessories \u2013 you don\u2019t even need a mat \u2013 and there\u2019s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety.</p> <p>Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child\u2019s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one\u2019s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (\u201cfocus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best\u201d). Some of the classes can be done in bed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5604b49f436bc792b2d0cb346dee06de2a366282/0_0_2483_1928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"776\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two women practising yoga while on lockdown at home in Santiago, Chile.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she\u2019s not: she isn\u2019t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She\u2019s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there\u2019s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun \u2013 with her Texan \u201chowdy\u201d \u2013 or get a little spiritual and write on her website that \u201cYoga is really the art of waking up\u201d.</p> <p>Right now, while we are stuck \u2013 in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces \u2013 yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn\u2019t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she\u2019s become the woman of the hour.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail \u2013 which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypx4dy/the-inventor-of-the-chilis-baby-back-ribs-song-has-never-eaten-their-ribs\" title=\"\">\u201cbaby back ribs\u201d jingle</a> \u2013 Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call.</p> <p>On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. \u201cIt\u2019s best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cMy boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He\u2019s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden \u2026 Oh come on, buddy!\u201d \u2013 she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. \u201cYou have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you\u2019re in the Groundhog Day movie.\u201d</p> <p>Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor \u2013 among her early roles was a cameo as \u201ccute female student\u201d in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights \u2013 she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/13/fitness-retro-workouts\" title=\"\">Jane Fonda\u2019s</a> classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee\u2019s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun.</p> <p>The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos.</p> <p>\u201cI had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything \u2013 it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you\u2019re a spiritual person,\u201d Mishler told me. \u201cA daily practice that can be medicinal \u2013 you could roll out the mat if you\u2019re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There\u2019s the fear of looking as if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they\u2019re expensive and they require commitment.</p> <p>Mishler\u2019s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren\u2019t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space \u2013 Mishler did her workout in a living room \u2013 the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens.</p> <p>While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn\u2019t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn\u2019t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision \u2013 a strategy, even though she hates that word \u2013 to make her the yoga girl next door.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ba20dfbbb188994dff84e8fcbd3ac716d1c557c/0_157_816_367/500.jpg\" alt=\"yoga with adriene - posing with benji the dog - from official website\" width=\"500\" height=\"225\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yoga teacher Adriene Mishler with her dog, Benji.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoga With Adriene/Find What Feels Good</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. \u201cHe is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it\u2019s a super-produced video,\u201d she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. \u201cBenji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that\u2019s too heavy of a word. We\u2019re here together and he helps set the tone.\u201d</p> <p>As Mishler was crafting the channel\u2019s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe\u2019s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler\u2019s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love.</p> <p>The YouTube channel wasn\u2019t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler\u2019s videos aren\u2019t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone.</p> <p>For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga \u2013 Mishler\u2019s mother is Mexican \u2013 scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations.</p> <p>On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: \u201cI am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.\u201d And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting:</p> <p><em>Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise,</em><br><em>To continue, and awaken.</em><br><em>To slowly nod with forgiveness,</em><br><em>Squint the eyes \u2013</em><br><em>Just a bit,</em><br><em>And whisper,</em><br><em>I got this.</em></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it \u2013 along with all the other misfits who weren\u2019t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey \u2013 and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn\u2019t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio.</p> <p>In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn\u2019t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended.</p> <p>On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It\u2019s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler\u2019s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/12/doctors-note-dog-on-plane-emotional-support-animals\" title=\"\">my bulldog, Joan</a>, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.)</p> <p>Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I\u2019ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. \u201cGetting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it\u2019s been incredible and unexpected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt honestly feels like I\u2019ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!\u201d Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world\u2019s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust \u2013 the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/05/its-genuine-you-know-why-the-online-influencer-industry-is-going-authentic\" title=\"\">an influencer</a> in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves \u2013 Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber.</p> <p>Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, \u201ca tight race between anything that has \u2018anxiety\u2019 in the title and also the yoga for weight loss\u201d. She feels weird about that, she says. \u201cI do not teach yoga for weight loss, that\u2019s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,\u201d she said, sounding a little defensive. \u201cI know there is integrity in the content,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what\u2019s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene\u2019s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/what-coronavirus-can-teach-us-about-hope-rebecca-solnit\">'The impossible has already happened': what coronavirus can teach us about hope</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They\u2019ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who\u2019ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen.</p> <p>What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we\u2019re let out, and for Mishler, it\u2019s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: \u201cThe process is the candy.

It doesn\u2019t require any fancy accessories \u2013 you don\u2019t even need a mat \u2013 and there\u2019s a meditative aspect that helps with all of our extremely warranted anxiety. Mishler has pitched herself as the perfect first step for yoga novices. Whatever ails you, Mishler seems to have a class for it. She has videos for back pain, vulnerability (an entirely seated practice with a lot of lying in the foetal position), anger (a lot of breathing exercises and child\u2019s pose to calm down) and self-care (literally hugging yourself). There is yoga for runners (a seven-minute full body stretch for before or after a jog) and for those in the service industry (relief from being on one\u2019s feet all day), and even yoga for writers (\u201cfocus the brain and body inward so you can perform, create and be your best\u201d). Some of the classes can be done in bed. Maybe what attracts so many people to Mishler is what she\u2019s not: she isn\u2019t threatening, has none of the holier-than-thou quality of someone who just came back from rigorous spiritual training, and nor is she stone-faced or humourless. On screen, Mishler, who is 35, comes across as sweet and wholesome, like the one popular girl in school who was actually kind. Her classes tend to be slow-placed, with clear instructions for absolute beginners and insight for more experienced students. She\u2019s good at telling you how to avoid injury, which is important when there\u2019s no teacher in the room to correct or guide you deeper into a pose. She can occasionally seem a little homespun \u2013 with her Texan \u201chowdy\u201d \u2013 or get a little spiritual and write on her website that \u201cYoga is really the art of waking up\u201d. Right now, while we are stuck \u2013 in our cramped apartments, our crowded living rooms, our sunless basement flats, our solitary terraces \u2013 yoga offers us a solution, an escape, a way to unwind. It doesn\u2019t come larded with the kind of ambition that drives people to train for marathons or visit the gym several times a week to lose weight. Yoga is only interested in the present, an apt philosophy at a moment when the future is so uncertain. As a teacher, Mishler is not doing anything revolutionary, but she has struck a chord in these anxious times. By not doing too much, and not asking us to do too much, she\u2019s become the woman of the hour. * * * These days Mishler receives so many requests that her press office sends automated emails apologising in advance if it takes a while to respond. But after I got through to her voicemail \u2013 which features her singing a song about leaving a message to the tune of the Chili\u2019s \u201cbaby back ribs\u201d jingle \u2013 Mishler called me back about a minute later, apologising for missing the call. On the phone from her home in Austin, Texas, Mishler sounded exactly like she does in her videos: extremely friendly, sincere and polite. She thanked me for asking how her quarantine is going. \u201cIt\u2019s best-case scenario,\u201d she said. \u201cMy boyfriend lives eight minutes away. He\u2019s the only person that I see, and he can work at his home and I can work here. A lot of people assume I must be golden \u2026 Oh come on, buddy!\u201d \u2013 she broke off to yell at Benji the dog, who was barking in the background. Others are having a much harder time of it, she said, such as her friends who have kids, but she admitted to having occasional wobbles. \u201cYou have your own discombobulated moment each day where you feel like you\u2019re in the Groundhog Day movie.\u201d Mishler grew up in an arty family in Austin. As a teenager, she took acting classes, in which she learned about mind-body practices such as yoga. Later, while trying to make it as a professional actor \u2013 among her early roles was a cameo as \u201ccute female student\u201d in an episode of the TV show Friday Night Lights \u2013 she qualified as a yoga teacher and taught some classes. Her main frame of reference for exercising at home was Jane Fonda\u2019s classic 1980s do-it-for-the-burn aerobics videos, along with Rodney Yee\u2019s yoga DVDs, which featured a lot of instruction but not much fun. The origins of Yoga With Adriene go back to the set of a horror movie, where she met an independent film-maker called Christopher Sharpe, who had helped create a popular YouTube channel starring his wife, the chef Hilah Johnson. Afterwards, Sharpe and Mishler stayed in touch, and in 2012, when Sharpe was looking for new YouTube projects, he asked Mishler if she wanted to start a yoga channel. In September that year, they began uploading videos. \u201cI had this inkling, if we all had an at-home yoga practice, it would change everything \u2013 it could become like a normal hygiene practice, or saying a prayer if you\u2019re a spiritual person,\u201d Mishler told me. \u201cA daily practice that can be medicinal \u2013 you could roll out the mat if you\u2019re stressed. That was a huge stretch in 2012, but I was so broke that I thought it was worth a try.\u201d Yoga studios and, really, gyms in general, can be intimidating places. There\u2019s the fear of looking as if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. It\u2019s easy to stand out by being the largest person in the room, or the only man in the yoga class, or the only woman lifting free weights, or the only person of colour, full stop. Plus, they\u2019re expensive and they require commitment. Mishler\u2019s channel aimed to remove these stresses. One thing that made her videos appealing was that they weren\u2019t filmed in a professional studio or in a fancy home, settings that were popular in older workout videos. By filming in a private space \u2013 Mishler did her workout in a living room \u2013 the videos felt more intimate and personal, tapping into the same qualities that were becoming popular in other YouTube genres, from singing covers of a song in a bedroom to cooking in regular home kitchens. While the setting was clean and bright, it wasn\u2019t aspirational, unlike the Rodney Yee videos, filmed on beaches with spectacular views or at the foot of snow-capped mountains. Mishler was just a nice-looking woman in a nice-enough room wearing a tank top and leggings that didn\u2019t even match. It suited her, but it was also a deliberate decision \u2013 a strategy, even though she hates that word \u2013 to make her the yoga girl next door. In this, Benji is a useful ally. He serves not just as a beloved pet, but as a muse and a beacon of calm as he sleeps on the sidelines. \u201cHe is a great tool for the storytelling. His presence just lends itself so well to not feeling like it\u2019s a super-produced video,\u201d she said, and as if he knew he was being referenced, Benji barked several times in the background. \u201cBenji is a way to tear down the fourth wall without being pretentious. Maybe that\u2019s too heavy of a word. We\u2019re here together and he helps set the tone.\u201d As Mishler was crafting the channel\u2019s tone, Sharpe was carefully studying how YouTube users search for yoga and other workouts, compiling lists of key terms and optimising the titles of the videos. Instead of just creating classes that might suit potential needs, they looked at Sharpe\u2019s studies and tailored classes according to what people were searching for. This is why Mishler\u2019s classes include Yoga for Back Pain, Yoga for Lower Back Pain, Yoga for Upper Back Pain, as well as Upper Back Love, and, of course, Lower Back Love. The YouTube channel wasn\u2019t an overnight hit. It took about two years of posting a new video each week to reach 200,000 subscribers, and that was the point at which it started to become commercially successful. Mishler\u2019s videos aren\u2019t heavily branded, but the website Social Blade, which tracks growth on YouTube, estimates that the channel could make as much as $188,500 per month on advertising revenue alone. For hardcore fans looking to venture further into the Mishler universe, there is also a subscription service ($9.99 per month) called Find What Feels Good, in which the best-friend vibe is amped up even more, via exclusive classes, vlogs, meditations and blog posts. She also leads retreats, and holds large events for International Yoga Day each June. But this year, a retreat in Mexico City combining Spanish lessons and yoga \u2013 Mishler\u2019s mother is Mexican \u2013 scheduled for May had to be cancelled, as did an upcoming event at the United Nations. On 12 April, Mishler began her email newsletter with the following: \u201cI am sending you some loving energy from my humble abode. It is Sunday. Just in case you need a reminder.\u201d And then she included a poem, which, depending on your perspective, will be either painfully twee or gently comforting: Today is another day in which we are blessed with the opportunity to rise, To continue, and awaken. To slowly nod with forgiveness, Squint the eyes \u2013 Just a bit, And whisper, I got this. * * * I attended a Californian high school that offered yoga as part of its physical education programme. At 16 I signed up for it \u2013 along with all the other misfits who weren\u2019t enrolled in typical private-school sports such as lacrosse or field hockey \u2013 and learned crow pose and breathing techniques from a long-haired ageing hippie with a gentle demeanour. I liked it enough, but didn\u2019t take yoga classes again until after university, when I found myself living down the street from a yoga studio. In 2015, after I joined a studio in Manhattan, I would go to a yoga class every couple of days. This year I took the plunge, going from being a yoga student who attended class a few times a week to teaching a restorative yoga class once a week at a downtown studio called Sky Ting. I have never thought of myself as a natural teacher, but I loved it. Teaching was, frankly, kind of a power trip. I like being in charge, putting together a playlist, watching students tumble out of class in a relaxed afterglow. My classes were in the late afternoon on Thursdays. Friends came by, but so did people I didn\u2019t know, and they started to come every week, which was thrilling: I knew what I was doing enough that people wanted more. I started in the second week of January, but was only able to teach for two months before business was suspended. On a recent Sunday evening, I taught one class via Instagram from my sitting room. My yoga studio provided its teachers with notes on setting up, from how to best position our phones to tips on creating as inviting a space as possible in a tiny New York apartment (plants and natural light are good, dirty floors and clutter are best avoided). I tend not to speak a lot during my classes. It\u2019s a conscious choice based on years of wishing that I could zone out and not have to hear a teacher chattering along. But a lot of silence while demonstrating poses alone in front of a screen just translates to dead air, which feels awkward, so I found myself making commentary to fill up the silence. My class, like Mishler\u2019s, was treated to a spontaneous appearance by my bulldog, Joan, when she wandered over to investigate what I was doing. I missed touching my students, running a hand down their spine to encourage deeper relaxation or massaging their foreheads to relieve tension. But I also loved that anyone could join, and students could say hello or send a comment through the app. (That said, I could have done without the person who kept messaging me to say I should change my music.) Because so many studios have taken their classes online, I\u2019ve also got to tune into some of my favourite far-flung teachers and friends, from Portugal to Los Angeles. When I spoke to one of these teachers, Kyle Miller, about her experience of teaching on Zoom, she was near-rapturous. \u201cGetting to see everyone, talk and hang out in the moments before and after class, getting to watch the students as they practise and teach right to them, it\u2019s been incredible and unexpected,\u201d she said. \u201cIt honestly feels like I\u2019ve socialised. I ride a high after my streams!\u201d Yoga teachers, it seems, are perhaps the world\u2019s most gifted people when it comes to putting a positive spin on things. * * * Mishler is not really a superstar teacher like the types who headline Wanderlust \u2013 the global travelling yoga festival that is sort of like Coachella for the spiritually inclined, at which fans shell out around $200 to take massive yoga classes led by teachers talking rapturously about the need to be humble. Nor is Mishler an influencer in the current sense, posing for highly branded and sponsored photos with perfect hair. Her own Instagram is simple and relatively unflashy, featuring photos of the sky, grocery store flowers and, of course, Benji. She is careful not to sound too out-there or new age, and will often poke fun at something she says by using an exaggeratedly calm, smug-yoga-lady voice. Her online persona recalls a time when normal people could become famous on the internet for being good at being themselves \u2013 Justin Bieber before he became Justin Bieber. Mishler acknowledges that she has made compromises to broaden her reach. She understands that she grew her audience based on a canny understanding of how to target her videos, but there is an awkward disconnect between the kind of yoga she wants to teach and what is most sought after on YouTube. Her most popular videos are, she said, \u201ca tight race between anything that has \u2018anxiety\u2019 in the title and also the yoga for weight loss\u201d. She feels weird about that, she says. \u201cI do not teach yoga for weight loss, that\u2019s not my end goal, but, you know, when that is in the title in the SEO, it attracts a lot more people than it would have otherwise,\u201d she said, sounding a little defensive. \u201cI know there is integrity in the content,\u201d she said. While the coronavirus pandemic has brought legions of new fans, it might also mean that, for the first time, Yoga With Adriene could have some real competition. Every yoga brand is trying to ride out this wave of isolation and come out with more followers at the other end. Local studios from all over the world are live-streaming from home so students can take classes with their favourite teachers, not just what\u2019s free on YouTube. Big brands are also pushing their online classes, including Nike, Alo, Gaia, Sweaty Betty, CorePower, Lululemon and Yoga Journal. Meanwhile, on YouTube, there are now numerous videos that seem to borrow heavily from Yoga With Adriene\u2019s formula: accessible classes performed in homey environments. New competitors include Yoga By Candace and Yoga With Tim. They both include their dogs. Whenever we are let out of our homes, my guess would be that yoga studios will have waiting lists. They\u2019ll likely be different from before, operating at no more than a quarter of their usual capacity allowing students (who\u2019ll bring their own mats) to keep two metres apart. But even with those compromises, it will probably feel better than practising one more day in front of a screen. What seemed reassuring in quarantine might feel claustrophobic when we\u2019re let out, and for Mishler, it\u2019s possible that there might be a downside to being so closely associated with a strange and miserable time. While we all troop gratefully back to class, Mishler will still be taping herself at home, doing yoga to a camera in her sitting room, Benji by her side. But worrying too much about the future is not quite in the spirit of Yoga With Adriene, which is all about the here and now. As she writes on her website: \u201cThe process is the candy.

      "bodyText": "A school board in Alaska has got more than it bargained for after pulling classics including The Great Gatsby and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings from the school curriculum, with members of the local community offering incentives to students to read the books anyway \u2013 including $100 (\u00a380) prizes and free mac\u2019n\u2019cheese. The Matanuska-Susitna borough school board in Palmer, Alaska, which oversees 46 schools, voted last week to remove five books from its curriculum for high-school English: F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s The Great Gatsby, Maya Angelou\u2019s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch-22, Ralph Ellison\u2019s Invisible Man, and short-story collection The Things They Carried by Tim O\u2019Brien. According to local paper the Frontiersman News, five members voted in favour of the removal, and two voted against. The books remain in school libraries, but will no longer be taught. According to a flier from the district\u2019s Office of Instruction, Angelou\u2019s memoir had been challenged over its \u201csexually explicit material, such as the sexual abuse the author suffered as a child, and its \u2018anti-white\u2019 messaging\u201d, while Fitzgerald\u2019s classic novel was pulled for \u201clanguage and sexual references\u201d.

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Thursday.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has accused the Chinese government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/trump-claims-china-will-do-anything-to-stop-his-re-election-as-coronavirus-row-escalates\">doing \u201canything they can\u201d to see him lose the presidential election </a>this year, in what marks a serious escalation of the war of words between the two superpowers over the coronavirus pandemic. In an Oval Office interview with Reuters, the US president said he was looking into different options for the consequences China might face for its handling of the pandemic. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said, before adding that Beijing\u2019s actions had \u201cupset very badly\u201d the much-vaunted trade deal between the countries. Trump also said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/trump-government-wont-extend-coronavirus-distancing-guidelines\">he would not extend federal social distancing guidelines</a> when they expire today, despite US deaths from Covid-19 passing 60,000. And <a href=\"\u2018It\u2019s%20going%20to%20leave.%20It\u2019s%20going%20to%20be%20gone.%20It\u2019s%20going%20to%20be%20eradicated,\u2019\">he told business leaders earlier in the day</a> that the virus would soon be \u201cgone\u201d.</p> \n<p>At home, the cabinet will meet today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">when to start easing the lockdown</a> as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached. Despite a record 52,000 tests being carried out on Wednesday, 19,000 were re-tests and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/hospital-chiefs-increasingly-frustrated-with-uk-testing-failures\">hospital leaders criticised ministers</a> for \u201ca series of frequent tactical announcements\u201d about testing targets. They said it was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had distracted from wider policy failures. Just days after Matt Hancock pledged to meet the 100,000 target by the end of April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/uk-turned-down-offer-of-10000-coronavirus-tests-a-day-four-weeks-ago\">the government turned down an offer of 10,000 testing kits a day</a> from a US company. The chief coroner has issued guidelines that inquests into the death of NHS staff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/29/inquests-nhs-staff-deaths-ppe-shortages\">should not examine the impact of lack of personal protective equipment</a> (PPE) on wards.</p> \n<p>A study led by researchers at Liverpool university <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/29/study-finds-a-third-of-uk-covid-19-patients-taken-to-hospital-are-dying\">says one third of patients admitted to hospital in the UK with Covid-19 are dying</a>. It comes as deaths in care homes and the wider community were added to the UK total, bringing the number of fatalities to 26,097 and leaving the country\u2019s toll behind only those of the US and Italy. South Korea today recorded <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/south-korea-records-no-new-domestic-cases-of-covid-19-for-first-time-since-february\">no new cases for the first time since February</a>.

A taskforce was set up to sort out the mess that saw thousands of people facing deportation to the West Indies. More than 12,000 have had their cases resolved but two years after Amber Rudd was forced to quit as home secretary over the fiasco, lawyers and campaigners have expressed concern about the large backlog.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Power play \u2013 </strong>Experts believe renewable electricity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/covid-19-crisis-demand-fossil-fuels-iea-renewable-electricity\">will be the only energy that can survive the economic shock</a> triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.

      "bodyText": "Top story: UK hospital chiefs accuse ministers of tests \u2018red herring\u2019 Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Thursday. Donald Trump has accused the Chinese government of doing \u201canything they can\u201d to see him lose the presidential election this year, in what marks a serious escalation of the war of words between the two superpowers over the coronavirus pandemic. In an Oval Office interview with Reuters, the US president said he was looking into different options for the consequences China might face for its handling of the pandemic. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said, before adding that Beijing\u2019s actions had \u201cupset very badly\u201d the much-vaunted trade deal between the countries. Trump also said he would not extend federal social distancing guidelines when they expire today, despite US deaths from Covid-19 passing 60,000. And he told business leaders earlier in the day that the virus would soon be \u201cgone\u201d. At home, the cabinet will meet today to discuss when to start easing the lockdown as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached. Despite a record 52,000 tests being carried out on Wednesday, 19,000 were re-tests and hospital leaders criticised ministers for \u201ca series of frequent tactical announcements\u201d about testing targets. They said it was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had distracted from wider policy failures. Just days after Matt Hancock pledged to meet the 100,000 target by the end of April, the government turned down an offer of 10,000 testing kits a day from a US company. The chief coroner has issued guidelines that inquests into the death of NHS staff should not examine the impact of lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) on wards. A study led by researchers at Liverpool university says one third of patients admitted to hospital in the UK with Covid-19 are dying. It comes as deaths in care homes and the wider community were added to the UK total, bringing the number of fatalities to 26,097 and leaving the country\u2019s toll behind only those of the US and Italy. South Korea today recorded no new cases for the first time since February. Worldwide, almost 220,000 have died and there are 3.2m cases. You can catch up on all the key developments overnight at a glance and read more details on our live blog. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Windrush return \u2013 The Windrush scandal has come back to dog the government after Home Office figures revealed that 3,720 people who believe they were wrongly categorised as immigration offenders have yet to have their cases resolved. A taskforce was set up to sort out the mess that saw thousands of people facing deportation to the West Indies. More than 12,000 have had their cases resolved but two years after Amber Rudd was forced to quit as home secretary over the fiasco, lawyers and campaigners have expressed concern about the large backlog. * * * Power play \u2013 Experts believe renewable electricity will be the only energy that can survive the economic shock triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The International Energy Agency said the outbreak would cause demand for oil, gas and coal to slump to multi-decade lows but renewable power would grow its share of the market. * * * Biden pressure \u2013 Joe Biden is under increasing pressure to publicly address allegations of sexual assault made by a former employee in his Senate office. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has remained silent about the alleged assault that Tara Reade said took place in 1993. But women\u2019s organisations are said to be privately urging Biden to address the matter and the Washington Post has called on him to make a statement. * * * Noir pioneer dies \u2013 Maj Sj\u00f6wall, the Swedish author credited with co-inventing the Nordic noir genre, has died aged 84. Along with her late husband, Per Wahloo, Sj\u00f6wall penned a 10-book series based on the dour, middle-aged Martin Beck and his team of detectives. They inspired a generation of other writers such as Henning Mankell who said the couple \u201cbroke with the previous trends in crime fiction\u201d. Coronavirus Extra There was some evidence for Trump\u2019s optimistic forecast after positive early results in the US yesterday from a trial of remdesivir. The results showed that patients recovered 31% faster than those treated with a placebo, sending stock markets soaring. White House adviser Dr Anthony Fauci called the trials \u201cquite good news\u201d, while his colleague Dr Deborah Birx is also in the news because her collection of scarves has turned her into a social media celebrity. Despite a fall in the death rates in Italy, life is still extremely tough in many parts of the country. Our reporter Lorenzo Tondo has spoken to residents in the poor Zen district of the Sicilian capital, Palermo, where they fear the mafia will reassert control and where the grim lockdown days \u201cnever end\u201d.

A century later it began to be used in other contexts for any kind of time off (often, joshingly, from family duties). In employment terms, it has usually meant a specific period of absence with continued salary, though in the US, civilian furloughs have typically meant enforced leave without pay, as in the 2013 public-sector shutdown after Congressional budget cuts.</p> <p>More poetically, in one of his 1817 <em>Lay Sermons</em>, Coleridge describes a dream of meeting a melancholy pilgrim, who in turn recounts a vision he experienced during \u201cone of those short furlows from the service of the body, which the soul may sometimes obtain\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Thanks to the coronavirus job retention scheme, many employees have been \u201cfurloughed\u201d on 80% of their salary during lockdown. Presumably this obscure term is preferred to \u201ckept on with most of their pay\u201d simply for brevity, but where does it come from? Originally an importation from Dutch, and spelled \u201cvorloffe\u201d or \u201cfore-loofe\u201d in the 17th century, \u201cfurlough\u201d derives from the German military term for a soldier\u2019s permit to be absent from duty: literally, \u201cfor leave\u201d. A century later it began to be used in other contexts for any kind of time off (often, joshingly, from family duties). In employment terms, it has usually meant a specific period of absence with continued salary, though in the US, civilian furloughs have typically meant enforced leave without pay, as in the 2013 public-sector shutdown after Congressional budget cuts. More poetically, in one of his 1817 Lay Sermons, Coleridge describes a dream of meeting a melancholy pilgrim, who in turn recounts a vision he experienced during \u201cone of those short furlows from the service of the body, which the soul may sometimes obtain\u201d. In these times, especially, such a spiritual furlough might seem a consummation devoutly to be wished. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.",

      "bodyText": "Photographing a funeral is never easy, no matter how professional the photographer, and even more so amid a pandemic. But for Nicol\u00f3 Lanfranchi, capturing the burial of Covid-19 victim Elizabeth Baez, 82, which took place this month at the S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Batista cemetery in Rio de Janeiro, was especially difficult. As he photographed the gravediggers in protective clothing with Elizabeth\u2019s son Henrique, 49, the only mourner allowed, watching on from behind a mask, Lanfranchi thought of his own father, Piero. At 72, Piero was in intensive care with Covid-19 in a hospital in Voghera, in Lombardy, northern Italy \u2013 one of the worst-affected places on Earth. \u201cI imagined myself in the same situation, and I started facing this possibility and I was really touched,\u201d he says. After the funeral, Lanfranchi told Baez about his father. Baez thanked him for capturing his mother\u2019s lonely burial \u2013 and for sharing his own story. That Brazilians \u2013 a sociable, gregarious people - are so open to brief yet profound human interactions like this is just one of the many reasons Italian photographer and film-maker Lanfranchi has returned here every year for the past two decades. The other is to take pictures. \u201cIt is a huge life school for me. I have to be focused, it is dangerous, no one can help me and I feel responsibility to bring back images and the stories,\u201d he says. \u201cIt cleans my mind.\u201d Born in Milan and based in Berlin, Lanfranchi has worked as a freelance photographer in portrait, travel, news, and photojournalism. He prefers to spend time on assignments; he once spent three weeks on board the Aquarius ship as it rescued refugees around the Mediterranean for a series of Guardian dispatches. Coronavirus has been one of the toughest subjects to cover. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about the virus,\u201d he says. \u201cMy father was on my mind.\u201d Lanfranchi first came to Brazil in 2000 because he practises the Afro-Brazilian art of capoeira and came to be \u201cbaptised\u201d in an initiation. Originally developed by enslaved African people as a martial art disguised as a dance, capoeira is an example of how this vast, varied country absorbs cultures. \u201cOther people call this a melting pot. It is more the syncretism, the capacity of an organic form to absorb different things,\u201d says Lanfranchi. In 2012 he photographed wildcat miners in the jungle, in 2014 a soccer tournament in a prison in Jo\u00e3o Pessoa. In 2015 Brazil suffered the worst environmental catastrophe in its history when a tailings dam near Mariana collapsed, killing 19 people and sending millions of litres of mining waste sluicing down the River Doce to the sea. Lanfranchi worked with Greenpeace, Amnesty, Vanity Fair and eventually supplied dramatic images images for a Guardian story that Davilson Brasileiro and I wrote about an investigation into the disaster\u2019s causes by federal prosecutors. In January 2019, Lanfranchi and I had just left the Raposa Serra do Sol indigenous reserve in Brazil\u2019s far north when another tailings dam collapsed, in Brumadinho in the same state of Minas Gerais, killing hundreds. At the disaster zone, Lanfranchi\u2019s persistence, his ability to charm and cajole, and his skill at composing photographs in chaos rendered memorable images of the deadly, avoidable tragedy. He arrived in Rio on 3 March to make a short film about traditional medicine in Brazil\u2019s semi-arid interior, but the pandemic shelved the project. Isolating in Rio\u2019s beachside Ipanema neighbourhood, Lanfranchi discovered that the great composer Tom Jobim had written many of his bossa nova classics in an apartment in his building, including Chega de Saudade (Enough of Longing), most famously recorded by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto. That nostalgia infected Lanfranchi and he sought to take photos that captured time standing still and the fearful melancholy of a city where life was on hold. He bought N95 masks, found a driver who knew the city and began working out how to photograph the pandemic when so many situations \u2013 health centres and hospital wards \u2013 were inaccessible. He cleaned his equipment with alcohol gel, and changed and washed his clothes each time he got home. Using a drone worked for photographing empty beaches and an upscale members\u2019 club for a story on how coronavirus spread among its privileged members. He also used it to capture families on their balconies. He put the drone down to capture food distribution in the City of God favela, street sanitation in nearby Niter\u00f3i, and people ignoring social distancing advice across Rio. Some did this from sheer economic need, others didn\u2019t take the pandemic seriously. The country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, dismissed coronavirus as \u201ca little flu\u201d and argued that protecting the economy was more important than social distancing even as confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths rose. Lanfranchi was dismayed to see Brazilian solidarity corroded by fake news and far-right populism. \u201cI felt how sick the country is, people are supporting a president who openly does not care about the health of the population,\u201d he says. This disconnect resonated as his father\u2019s health worsened. Piero Lanfranchi had gone to hospital to get a plaster removed but caught Covid-19. Father and son communicated via text, until the time came for a plastic box to be put over Piero\u2019s head to help him breathe and he sent a last message. Lanfranchi could not have seen his father even if had been able to get a flight back to Italy. Hospital visitors are not allowed, there are road blocks in Lombardy. On Saturday he got the news: despite the plastic box, his father had died. \u201cHe was alone, this is the worst thing, and something I wouldn\u2019t wish on anybody,\u201d says Lanfranchi, tears cracking his voice. Now the only thing he can think to do is plan a new assignment. \u201cThis is a historical moment, it is leaving a mark on me, and in a certain way I think about the other families affected with this, and I am with them,\u201d he says. \u201cI do not want to be beaten by the virus.\u201d",

Others have lived in Australia for years, and have established families and communities, built homes and forged careers.</p> \n<p>For asylum seekers and refugees, having fled persecution in their homeland, any return is an impossibility.</p> \n<p>More than 40 Catholic leaders wrote to the prime minister earlier this month, pleading for an expansion of federal assistance.</p> \n<p>Father Peter Smith of the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney argued those left out of the government\u2019s relief payments were members of the Australian community.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey pray in our pews, work in our restaurants, farms, factories, aged care homes, supermarkets, and NGOs, study in our schools and universities, and live in our neighbourhoods.

      "bodyText": "Victoria is the latest Australian state to roll out support packages for temporary migrants in Australia who face destitution as a result of Covid-19, but who are excluded from federal assistance. In the absence of federal intervention, Tasmania, South Australia, the ACT, Queensland and Victoria have all announced support schemes to assist temporary visa holders, including international students, asylum seekers and working visa holders. Victoria this week announced a relief payment of up to $1,100 as part of a broader emergency support package, available to tens of thousands of international students living in the state. \u201cInternational students are a vital part of our education system, our economy and our community,\u201d the minister for jobs, innovation and trade, Martin Pakula, said. In Tasmania, any holder of a temporary visa can apply for relief under a $3m support package announced by the premier, Peter Gutwein. Visa holders under financial hardship are eligible for $250, while families can apply for $1,000 in assistance. The ACT government has rolled out cash relief packages for international students, asylum seekers and refugees. \u201cOver the past month we have been advocating to the federal government for people on temporary visas to be covered by jobkeeper and remain connected with work. The Australian government has refused, and as a result many Canberrans on temporary visas have now lost work and now have literally no income, and no support,\u201d the minister for multicultural affairs, Chris Steel, said. South Australia\u2019s $13.8m relief package offers emergency cash grants to students, and other assistance paid through the state\u2019s universities. Individual universities across the country have also committed tens of millions in direct financial support to students left stranded. Dozens of community organisations, faith groups and diaspora bodies have also offered support of food, housing and basic services. The Australian Homestay Network has reported more than 300 families have signed up in the past two weeks to become hosts of international students following a call-out. Its founder, David Bycroft, says Australians have a responsibility to step up and look after those left without assistance during the pandemic. \u201cThe prime minister has told international students to return home if they can\u2019t afford to support themselves but the reality of the situation is it isn\u2019t that simple,\u201d Bycroft said. \u201cFor many students, going home is not an option.\u201d In Australia\u2019s largest state, Domestic Violence NSW has said the state government needs to provide a safety net for women and children living on temporary visas. \u201cFar too many women on temporary visas risk being injured and killed by a violent partner because their only other option is poverty and homelessness,\u201d the group\u2019s spokeswoman, Renata Field, said. \u201cDVNSW is calling on the NSW government to immediately provide income, housing and healthcare support for women and children on temporary visas experiencing domestic and family violence.\u201d Jane Brock, the executive officer of Immigrant Women\u2019s Speakout Association, said her organisation was deeply concerned about women on temporary visas experiencing violence and their children struggling to access food and essentials. There are continued calls for the federal government to help the more than one million people currently in Australia \u2013 including international students, working holiday makers, skilled temporary migrants, asylum seekers and refugees \u2013 who are excluded from the federal government\u2019s jobkeeper and jobseeker Covid-19 support payments. Overrepresented in industries disproportionately affected by coronavirus shutdowns, such as hospitality and retail, and without family links to turn to or networks of community support, thousands have faced destitution: many reported skipping meals and fears they could be left homeless. The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, argued the government \u201chad to draw the line somewhere\u201d, saying that including temporary migrants would add an additional $18bn to the more than $200bn in direct assistance payments already committed. In parliament, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said: \u201cAustralia must focus on its citizens and its residents to ensure that we can maximise the economic supports that we have.\u201d He said temporary visa holders should leave the country. \u201cAs much as it\u2019s lovely to have visitors to Australia in good times, at times like this, if you are a visitor in this country, it is time \u2026 to make your way home.\u201d For many this is infeasible - some countries have closed their borders, even to citizens returning, for others there are no flights, or no affordable flights, or transit countries won\u2019t allow them through. Others have lived in Australia for years, and have established families and communities, built homes and forged careers. For asylum seekers and refugees, having fled persecution in their homeland, any return is an impossibility. More than 40 Catholic leaders wrote to the prime minister earlier this month, pleading for an expansion of federal assistance. Father Peter Smith of the Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney argued those left out of the government\u2019s relief payments were members of the Australian community. \u201cThey pray in our pews, work in our restaurants, farms, factories, aged care homes, supermarkets, and NGOs, study in our schools and universities, and live in our neighbourhoods. And we have abandoned them to their fate. \u201cWe need to look to Singapore to see what can happen when a wealthy, sophisticated nation cares only for their own citizens and tries to ignore all those in their country. This virus doesn\u2019t recognise passport status; it devastates everyone equally.\u201d The director of the Migrant Workers Centre, Matt Kunkel, said state governments should not have to offer crisis payments when the federal government had the power to extend ongoing support to all workers. \u201cAs we head into another month of this crisis, there are still hundreds of thousands of temporary visa workers who have no support, and each day brings them closer to going hungry and losing the roof over their heads. Many are already falling through the cracks and facing extreme financial hardship,\u201d Kunkel said. \u201cWe need a cohesive response from the Morrison government that includes everyone.\u201d",

He said crew members did not have access to the rights afforded by their nations of citizenship, yet they were often outside the jurisdiction of the countries where their ships were sailing.</p> \n<p>Most of the cruise companies are registered in low-tax, low-regulation nations such as Panama or Liberia, with their ships flying the flags of territories such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which are not prepared to care for thousands of sick crew.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"aae21371-2edd-4aee-8af6-9a80a79d6943\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own.

But at least 17 cruise ship workers are confirmed to have died from suspected Covid-19, and dozens more have had to be evacuated from ships and taken to hospital, the Guardian found. \u201cWe all have family, we all want to go home,\u201d said one crew member who has been isolating in his cabin onboard the MSC Seaview off South America for nearly a month, but is no longer being paid. The worker, who spoke via the internet and asked not to be named for fear of losing his job, said crew were initially allowed to move about the ship freely, but have been told to remain in their cabins since a worker who had already left the ship tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cWe have not received any information about when we\u2019re going home or what they are doing to get crew members home,\u201d said the worker. \u201cWe are just in the cabin like prisoners.\u201d A spokesperson for MSC cruises said: \u201cMSC Cruises has taken the difficult decision to temporarily suspend its cruise ship operations. As this health crisis has caused all our ships globally to stop operating, we have temporarily agreed to relieve the majority of our crew from their duties and are working to identify and pay for flight tickets for each and every one to safely return home for the duration of the temporary suspension of ships\u2019 operations. \u201cWe are offering all those who remain on board full board and lodging free of charge, assigning each of them a guest cabin for individual use. We\u2019ve upgraded our menus, and are providing complimentary internet.\u201d Most industry workers hail from developing countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and India and generally earn between $1,000\u2013$2,000 (\u00a3800- \u00a31,600) a month for working seven days a week, according to Ross Klein, a professor at St John\u2019s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry. Documents seen by the Guardian show that at least one cruise line has stopped paying some workers who are trapped onboard. Those who died in April include two housekeeping staff, a bartender and a security guard who were evacuated from ships in Florida. An Italian ship\u2019s doctor died in Brazil after being taken by ambulance from the Costa Fascinosa cruise ship, and an engine worker on the Antarctic cruise ship Greg Mortimer died in Uruguay after 128 of the 217 people onboard tested positive for coronavirus. Yet many nations, including the US, have baulked at providing even basic emergency services for these stranded crew members. \u201cSome of these crews are in a no man\u2019s land,\u201d said John Hickey, a maritime lawyer. He said crew members did not have access to the rights afforded by their nations of citizenship, yet they were often outside the jurisdiction of the countries where their ships were sailing. Most of the cruise companies are registered in low-tax, low-regulation nations such as Panama or Liberia, with their ships flying the flags of territories such as the Bahamas or Bermuda, which are not prepared to care for thousands of sick crew. \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are getting calls left and right. Crews are onboard, they\u2019re not happy and they\u2019re frightened.\u201d As of 4 April, the US Coast Guard estimated that 93,000 crew members remained onboard ships in and around US waters alone. Tens of thousands more are on ships in other parts of the world, according to the Guardian\u2019s analysis, which used the ship tracking site CruiseMapper and media reports to identify more than 50 ships that have had Covid-19 infections or confirmed exposures onboard. Cruises around the world were suspended on 14 March, yet many ports refused to let the ships dock long before that, meaning some crews have been stuck at sea for months. Cruise industry officials say they have been scrambling to repatriate crews that are not needed onboard during the shutdown, but port closures, travel bans and flight restrictions have made it extremely difficult. Some countries, including India, have almost completely sealed their borders, even to citizens. \u201cThe industry is committed to bringing passengers and crew home at its expense \u2013 without burdening governments,\u201d the Cruise Line Industry Association said in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cFlight restrictions and port closures have created some logistical challenges; however we are working through those as we speak. We are asking ports and governments around the world to allow these ships to come into port so that those onboard can make their way home safely and as quickly as possible.\u201d Thousands of crew are sick or have been exposed to coronavirus. Outbreaks are raging in US waters, from the Miami coastline, where at least nine workers have been evacuated from the Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas, to the docks of San Diego, where workers onboard the Disney Wonder have contracted coronavirus. In France, workers preparing to launch the new Celebrity Apex contracted Covid-19 even before the ship carried its first passengers. Some ships have medical supplies but few are equipped to handle full-blown outbreaks. All crew on the MSC Seaview are obliged to wear a mask and gloves onboard the cruise ship, which has basic medical equipment, a small emergency room and a laboratory. At least two doctors are caring for people on the vessel. \u201cAll crew members currently onboard are healthy and none have displayed any symptoms,\u201d a spokesperson for MSC cruises said. \u201cMSC Seaview has a full onboard medical centre equipped and staffed in line with the highest and most stringent international guidelines. We continue to conduct regular health and temperature checks to ensure their health.\u201d The hundreds of crew members onboard the Ruby Princess ship, which departed from Australia on Thursday, marked their 30th day in quarantine on the ship on last week with a video thanking the medical workers who have cared for them. But the ships generally lack ventilators and other complicated medical equipment needed to treat Covid-19. In serious medical emergencies, passengers and crew on cruise ships are normally evacuated to a hospital on land for further care. Since the pandemic began, however, many countries are refusing to take them.",

The impact in the second quarter will \u201cmore severe\u201d, Van Beurden said. Shell plans to scrap all executive bonuses for this financial year, and rein in spending and costs to save up to $9bn. The company will \u201cprobably\u201d consider voluntary redundancies. \u201cThat is not going to happen anytime soon, if at all this year. But if this goes on, it is inevitable that there will be consequences,\u201d Van Beurden said. Shell\u2019s decision to cut its dividend for the first time in almost 80 years breaks with a decades-long taboo among major oil companies against cutting shareholder returns. Shell will also stall plans to buy back the shares which it paid to shareholders in lieu of dividends during the previous oil market downturn in 2015. Earlier this week, BP\u2019s new chief executive, Bernard Looney, said the company\u2019s board had decided not to cut its dividend for the first quarter despite plunging to a loss. BP has cut its dividend only twice in the last 30 years, most recently in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010, which led to 11 fatalities and a bill topping $65bn. He did not rule out future cuts to manage a slow oil market recovery. The market narrative regarding Shell\u2019s dividend record will need to change, Van Beurden added. It will no longer be \u201c\u2018no cuts since World War Two\u2019, it is \u2018no cuts since the last pandemic\u2019,\u201d he said. Van Beurden said he does not expect a recovery in global oil markets or the world\u2019s demand for oil over the medium term, meaning the company would need to prepare for the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty. The chief executive added that the collapse of global oil markets raises the likelihood that the world will reach \u2018peak oil demand\u2019 within the next decade. This may mean that the company shows preference to clean energy projects \u201cwhich serve us better in the future\u201d, he said. Chad Holliday, the chairman of Shell\u2019s board, said: \u201cShareholder returns are a fundamental part of Shell\u2019s financial framework. However, given the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, weaker commodity prices, higher volatility and uncertain demand outlook, the board believes that maintaining the current level of shareholder distributions is not prudent.\u201d",

It\u2019s so easy now to engage and just as easy to disengage.\u201d</p> <p>Shah and Riley believe the legacy of RAR can be seen in the popularity of the Extinction Rebellion mass protests to popularise the fight against climate change, and think thousands of Britons would be protesting about the treatment of NHS workers during the Covid-19 outbreak, if it were possible.</p> <p>\u201cIf we were able to protest at the moment there would probably be a big protest for the NHS,\u201d says Shah. \u201cSome of the things that are going on in that regard are just shocking.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>White Riot will be live streamed from 8.30pm on Thursday 30 April on <a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/\">Curzon Home Cinema</a> (with a Q&amp;A that follows).

The most infamous was Eric Clapton, who while on stage at the Birmingham Odeon in August 1976, declared that Britain was becoming a \u201cblack colony\u201d and that he wanted \u201cthe foreigners out\u201d. Mykaell Riley of Steel Pulse \u2013 the Birmingham roots reggae group who shared the RAR stage with X-Ray Spex, Tom Robinson Band and The Clash in 1978 \u2013 said there was disbelief at first that either Bowie or Clapton, who took inspiration from African-American blues guitarists and had just covered Bob Marley\u2019s I Shot The Sheriff, were flirting with racism. \u201cThere was absolute disbelief,\u201d said Riley. \u201cHe\u2019d just covered Bob Marley, we just thought it was the press having a go at \u2018dear old Eric\u2019. The Clapton rant just underlined a particular mindset in \u2013 not just the musical landscape \u2013 but Britain itself.\u201d He added that when the band first heard of RAR, who released fanzines and organised nationwide gigs that featured black and white artists, they didn\u2019t think the idea was that original. \u201cMost of our audience were punks, we were already doing that work,\u201d said Riley. \u201cWe would go to gigs armed on occasions because it was normal for us to end up in a ruck with our own audience.\u201d Riley believes it would be hard to emulate the event in modern Britain because online activism has taken over as the dominant form of dissent. \u201cRAR called for people to come out and support and people did in their thousands,\u201d said Riley. \u201cIt\u2019s very different when you click, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s so easy now to engage and just as easy to disengage.\u201d Shah and Riley believe the legacy of RAR can be seen in the popularity of the Extinction Rebellion mass protests to popularise the fight against climate change, and think thousands of Britons would be protesting about the treatment of NHS workers during the Covid-19 outbreak, if it were possible. \u201cIf we were able to protest at the moment there would probably be a big protest for the NHS,\u201d says Shah. \u201cSome of the things that are going on in that regard are just shocking.\u201d White Riot will be live streamed from 8.30pm on Thursday 30 April on Curzon Home Cinema (with a Q&amp;A that follows). It will then be available until Monday 4 May and is due to be released in cinemas this September.",

      "body": "<p>Of the antiviral, antibiotic, antiretroviral and anti-malarial medicines being studied in trials to treat and prevent Covid-19, a drug called remdesivir is among a handful which scientists and the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments\">consider most promising</a>.</p> \n<p>Hope in the drug was revived on Wednesday when<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/29/fauci-clear-cut-evidence-potential-covid-19-drug-remdesivir-works-video\"> the US government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, said data from one clinical trial \u201cshows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery\u201d. But within hours of Fauci\u2019s announcement, the prestigious medical journal The Lancet published results from a study in China which found remdesivir did not speed recovery or reduce deaths from Covid-19 compared with a placebo in hospital patients.</p> \n<p>So what should the public make of the seemingly conflicting remdisivir results?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/remdesivir-coronavirus-drug-experimental\">Remdesivir: early findings on experimental coronavirus drug offer 'quite good news'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>What is remdesivir?</h2> \n<p>Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral produced by the US pharmaceutical company Gilead, initially as a potential treatment for the Ebola virus. It was rapidly pushed through clinical trials after showing promising results in the lab, and was then rolled out more widely in affected areas of Africa.</p> \n<p>However, in 2019 Congolese health officials said the drug was less effective than monoclonal antibody drugs, which are often used for cancer treatment and had a much more significant impact on lowering death rates than remdesivir.</p> \n<p>Remdesivir has been revived with the outbreak of Covid-19. This is because it showed promising results in preventing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which are also caused by coronaviruses. But those studies have only been done in animals.</p> \n<h2><strong>What do we know about how it works?</strong></h2> \n<p>The drug is administered via daily infusion for about 10 days. Currently remdesivir has not been approved by health authorities around the world, and given it was mainly being used for Ebola, supply is low. But it is being used in clinical trials, and many countries are attempting to get access to the drug for use in their own Covid-19 studies. There has been spike in applications to Gilead for the drug from countries where Covid-19 has been particularly devastating.</p> \n<p>In previous animal studies of Mers-CoV, <a href=\"https://www.jbc.org/content/early/2020/02/24/jbc.AC120.013056\">US researchers found remdesivir blocks a particular enzyme that is required for viral replication</a>. Scientists hope it will have a similar effect on Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>What did the US study show?</h2> \n<p>The study praised by Fauci relates to a clinical trial by Gilead, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US. The trial of more than 1,000 patients showed those given remdesivir improved after an average of 11 days, compared with an average of 15 days for those not given the treatment. There was no statistically significant improvement in survival rate between the two groups.</p> \n<p>Dr Elena K Schneider-Futschik, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s department of pharmacology and therapeutics, said given the absence of other treatments for Covid-19 and the promising data from the study, \u201cwe can assume that the drug may be fast-tracked\u201d. Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist with the University of Wollongong, said it was important to note the full study had not yet been published, and that although it found patients given the drug recovered faster, researchers had broadened their definition of \u201crecovery\u201d throughout the trial.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad in and of itself, but without further explanation it\u2019s hard to understand why the study made the choices that it did,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, they included people who were still in hospital in their \u201crecovered\u201d figure, according to the study registration \u2013 until we see the full published research we won\u2019t know if that\u2019s justifiable or not.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"770decd4-9257-4050-a836-d3708e070870\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MG9w7zLplFw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What did The Lancet China study show?</h2> \n<p>This study from Wuhan, China showed no statistically clinical benefit in Covid-19 patients in health improvement or mortality. However, the researchers tested a smaller number of patients \u2013 just over 200. They concluded their findings would require confirmation from larger studies. The study was stopped early by the data safety monitoring board because of difficulty recruiting patients. However, it is the first randomised controlled trial of the drug for Covid-19, which is considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.</p> \n<p>The results <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/p/dmnya\">were accidentally published by the World Health Organization on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/p/dmnya\">its website earlier in April</a>, before quickly being removed. Dr Phillip A Reece, a consultant to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, said the findings from the US study were \u201cclearly preliminary\u201d and may have been precipitated by the accidental disclosure of the Chinese trial results. \u201cThis was <a href=\"https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/company-statements/gilead-sciences-statement-on-data-from-remdesivir-study-in-patients-with-severe-covid-19-in-china\">disputed by Gilead</a>,\u201d Reece said.</p> \n<h2>What should we take from all of this?</h2> \n<p>Schneider-Futschik said<strong> </strong>comparing the results from the two studies is difficult. \u201cThere can be a lot of variables in the set-up of the study, and different stages of initiation of treatment,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlso, the Chinese study is incomplete as doctors could not access new patients during the lockdown. It might highly depend on when and at what stage of the infection patients receive the drug. We can say it is currently not clear who is benefitting from remdesivir.

      "bodyText": "Of the antiviral, antibiotic, antiretroviral and anti-malarial medicines being studied in trials to treat and prevent Covid-19, a drug called remdesivir is among a handful which scientists and the World Health Organization consider most promising. Hope in the drug was revived on Wednesday when the US government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said data from one clinical trial \u201cshows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery\u201d. But within hours of Fauci\u2019s announcement, the prestigious medical journal The Lancet published results from a study in China which found remdesivir did not speed recovery or reduce deaths from Covid-19 compared with a placebo in hospital patients. So what should the public make of the seemingly conflicting remdisivir results? What is remdesivir? Remdesivir is an experimental antiviral produced by the US pharmaceutical company Gilead, initially as a potential treatment for the Ebola virus. It was rapidly pushed through clinical trials after showing promising results in the lab, and was then rolled out more widely in affected areas of Africa. However, in 2019 Congolese health officials said the drug was less effective than monoclonal antibody drugs, which are often used for cancer treatment and had a much more significant impact on lowering death rates than remdesivir. Remdesivir has been revived with the outbreak of Covid-19. This is because it showed promising results in preventing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which are also caused by coronaviruses. But those studies have only been done in animals. What do we know about how it works? The drug is administered via daily infusion for about 10 days. Currently remdesivir has not been approved by health authorities around the world, and given it was mainly being used for Ebola, supply is low. But it is being used in clinical trials, and many countries are attempting to get access to the drug for use in their own Covid-19 studies. There has been spike in applications to Gilead for the drug from countries where Covid-19 has been particularly devastating. In previous animal studies of Mers-CoV, US researchers found remdesivir blocks a particular enzyme that is required for viral replication. Scientists hope it will have a similar effect on Covid-19. What did the US study show? The study praised by Fauci relates to a clinical trial by Gilead, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US. The trial of more than 1,000 patients showed those given remdesivir improved after an average of 11 days, compared with an average of 15 days for those not given the treatment. There was no statistically significant improvement in survival rate between the two groups. Dr Elena K Schneider-Futschik, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s department of pharmacology and therapeutics, said given the absence of other treatments for Covid-19 and the promising data from the study, \u201cwe can assume that the drug may be fast-tracked\u201d. Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, an epidemiologist with the University of Wollongong, said it was important to note the full study had not yet been published, and that although it found patients given the drug recovered faster, researchers had broadened their definition of \u201crecovery\u201d throughout the trial. \u201cThis isn\u2019t necessarily bad in and of itself, but without further explanation it\u2019s hard to understand why the study made the choices that it did,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, they included people who were still in hospital in their \u201crecovered\u201d figure, according to the study registration \u2013 until we see the full published research we won\u2019t know if that\u2019s justifiable or not.\u201d What did The Lancet China study show? This study from Wuhan, China showed no statistically clinical benefit in Covid-19 patients in health improvement or mortality. However, the researchers tested a smaller number of patients \u2013 just over 200. They concluded their findings would require confirmation from larger studies. The study was stopped early by the data safety monitoring board because of difficulty recruiting patients. However, it is the first randomised controlled trial of the drug for Covid-19, which is considered the gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. The results were accidentally published by the World Health Organization on its website earlier in April, before quickly being removed. Dr Phillip A Reece, a consultant to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, said the findings from the US study were \u201cclearly preliminary\u201d and may have been precipitated by the accidental disclosure of the Chinese trial results. \u201cThis was disputed by Gilead,\u201d Reece said. What should we take from all of this? Schneider-Futschik said comparing the results from the two studies is difficult. \u201cThere can be a lot of variables in the set-up of the study, and different stages of initiation of treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cAlso, the Chinese study is incomplete as doctors could not access new patients during the lockdown. It might highly depend on when and at what stage of the infection patients receive the drug. We can say it is currently not clear who is benefitting from remdesivir. Is it helping patients who would have recovered anyway, recover quicker? Is remdesivir more beneficial for younger compared [with] older patients? At what stage of the infection does treatment yield the best outcomes? Hopefully, the global clinical study will answer these questions.\u201d Professor of infectious diseases with the Australian National University Peter Collignon said what the drug had not been shown to do was stop people dying. \u201cThe death rate for this virus is terrible and we want it to come down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis drug may have some benefits, but it\u2019s clear from the data we have at this point, it\u2019s not going to be the main answer.\u201d Co-director of the Centre for Virus Research Professor Sarah Palmer said,\u201cWe cannot base our medical response on this one promising study.\u201d \u201cThat said, this National Institute study has more than four times as many patients involved in the clinical trial, giving it greater power to determine the effectiveness of remdesivir. In the trial conducted in China it appears remdesivir was employed in combination with other therapies which may have complicated an assessment of remdesivir\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When Joana Opoku-Darko\u2019s daughter Anna was 18 months old, she came down with malaria, a disease common in Ghana and especially deadly for children.</p> <p>She bought medication from a pharmacy in Ghana\u2019s capital, Accra; when Anna\u2019s fever didn\u2019t subside she took her to a hospital, where they ran some tests.</p> <p>\u201cI was anxious, as a first-time mother. I didn\u2019t have the experience to tell whether it\u2019s going to get any better, or am I going to lose my child?\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThey told me the medicine was no good, and we needed to start treatment all over.\u201d</p> <p>Opoku-Darko had bought fake malaria treatment drugs. Had she not gone to the hospital, Anna could have become another sorry statistic in a country flooded with substandard medicines.</p> <p>The experience has Opoku-Darko worried about the pandemic, especially as experts warn issues of falsified drugs, already very deadly in Africa, will become even greater under Covid-19.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The current focus on curbing Covid-19 spread means there is less focus on routine market surveillance</p> <footer> <cite>Delese Mimi Darko, chief executive of Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified\">World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-11-2017-1-in-10-medical-products-in-developing-countries-is-substandard-or-falsified\">zation</a> (WHO) estimates that one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries are either substandard or fake, which is both dangerous and a waste of precious family money. Various academic studies have put the prevalence at between 11% and 48%.</p> <p>Of 1,500 reports of such products, most came from Africa (42%), with south-east Asia also a major hotspot for fake medications.</p> <p>It is impossible to know precisely how many such medicines are in the system. Delese Mimi Darko, chief executive of Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority (FDA), says this is an ongoing problem, especially as people smuggle drugs across the country\u2019s borders. She too worries that Ghana, with more than 1,500 reported Covid-19 cases, will see an increase in falsified and substandard medicines due to the pandemic. Already the FDA has seized substandard hand-sanitisers.</p> <p>\u201cThe current focus on curbing Covid-19 spread means there is less focus on routine market surveillance,\u201d says Darko. \u201cThis means there could be an influx across porous borders of substandard medical products \u2013 including those for Covid-19.\u201d</p> <p>Measures like social distancing and lockdowns limit the work the regulators could do, she added.</p> <p>The FDA is also keeping an eye on social media posts offering unsubstantiated cures. Ghana\u2019s police service has cautioned people to beware online offers of vaccines for Covid-19. Earlier this month, the WHO warned of falsified chloroquine products found in Cameroon, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and called for \u201cwidespread vigilance\u201d from all countries.</p> <p>Chloroquine has been used in Africa for decades as an antimalarial, but it became internationally famous after Donald Trump said it could be a \u201c<a href=\"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-says-unproven-coronavirus-drugs-could-gift-god-232555075.html\">gift from God</a>\u201d in the fight against Covid-19. Such claims have led to people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/25/can-chloroquine-really-help-treat-coronavirus-patients\">hoarding the medicine</a>, leading to reports of price hikes and shortages. In Nigeria, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/23/africa/chloroquine-trump-nigeria-intl/index.html\">three people overdosed</a> on the drug.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"965e074ae797b929b18a6841012d26f6283d9c5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/965e074ae797b929b18a6841012d26f6283d9c5f/0_63_810_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"Activists for the campaign group Fight the Fakes at a Wellcome Trust-sponsored launch in Accra, Ghana\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Activists for the campaign group Fight the Fakes at a Wellcome Trust-sponsored launch in Accra, Ghana.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fight The Fakes</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kwasi Boateng, director of United States Pharmacopeia-Ghana, a public health non-profit that focuses party on combating falsified medicines, is concerned the pandemic might eventually cause a shortage of essential medicines in Ghana, allowing substandard or falsified treatments to fill the void. While he has not seen shortages of essentials yet, he says Ghana is still early in its battle with the virus and \u201ctime will tell\u201d.</p> <p>Boateng fears that if and when any official Covid-19 treatment is found, fake versions might find their way into the county.</p> <p>\u201cThe kind of medicines that people normally want faked are the ones that are in demand. So, if a new medication comes up which manages the condition, that makes it very attractive for people to want to latch on to it, so we all have to be vigilant.\u201d</p> <p>Chloroquine is no longer used in Ghana to treat malaria, but rumours suggest substandard chloroquine has been in circulation. \u201cIf we find any chloroquine on the market now, there is likely to be issues with it,\u201d says Boateng.</p> <p>In March, an Interpol operation <a href=\"https://www.interpol.int/en/News-and-Events/News/2020/Global-operation-sees-a-rise-in-fake-medical-products-related-to-COVID-19\">reported an increase</a> of more than 100% in seizures of unauthorised chloroquine, compared with the previous year. The organisation said this could be connected to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s public health expert, Dr Mary Stephen, has said: \u201cFrom the beginning of the outbreak there has been a lot of rumours and speculation in terms of which drugs will be effective for Covid-19, for Africa.\u201d</p> <p>She says steps have been taken to stem the tide of fake drugs. In January, a handful of African leaders signed the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/launch-of-the-lom%C3%A9-initiative\">Lom\u00e9 </a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/launch-of-the-lom%C3%A9-initiative\">initiative</a>, pledging new measures, including better border controls and legal processes against the smuggling of falsified products.</p> <p>The founding director of the Lao-Oxford-Mahosot Hospital-Wellcome Trust Research Unit, Dr Paul Newton, warns of a \u201cparallel crisis\u201d of quality, availability, and access to medical products and medicines, for all essential medicines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/jun/05/fake-medicine-makers-blockchain-artificial-intelligence\">Fight the fakes: how to beat the $200bn medicine counterfeiters | Helen Lock</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With global supply chains interrupted and physical distancing rules in place, regulatory work inspecting pharmaceutical factories is decreasing, Newton says. \u201cThat raises the risk of substandard medicines, and of companies cutting corners and making mistakes in the rush to manufacture,\u201d he warns.</p> <p>Newton is concerned about what will happen if and when health authorities do find medicine to prevent or treat Covid-19, and how the world\u2019s 7.8 billion people will access it. There needs to be coordinated production and strict quality surveillance, he warned.</p> <p>Before a medicine is found, Newton says he suspects criminals will have the equipment ready to make vast amounts of it.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they know it\u2019s \u2018medicine X\u2019, they will make fake copies, insert them in the supply chain and make enormous amounts of money \u2013 and kill people, to be brutally frank.\u201d</p> <p>To counter this parallel crisis, Newton calls for a global, prepared approach to assure the quality of diagnostic tests, drugs, and vaccines, where drugs are affordable and not hoarded or diverted from treating existing conditions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Joana Opoku-Darko\u2019s daughter Anna was 18 months old, she came down with malaria, a disease common in Ghana and especially deadly for children. She bought medication from a pharmacy in Ghana\u2019s capital, Accra; when Anna\u2019s fever didn\u2019t subside she took her to a hospital, where they ran some tests. \u201cI was anxious, as a first-time mother. I didn\u2019t have the experience to tell whether it\u2019s going to get any better, or am I going to lose my child?\u201d she says. \u201cThey told me the medicine was no good, and we needed to start treatment all over.\u201d Opoku-Darko had bought fake malaria treatment drugs. Had she not gone to the hospital, Anna could have become another sorry statistic in a country flooded with substandard medicines. The experience has Opoku-Darko worried about the pandemic, especially as experts warn issues of falsified drugs, already very deadly in Africa, will become even greater under Covid-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one in 10 medical products circulating in low- and middle-income countries are either substandard or fake, which is both dangerous and a waste of precious family money. Various academic studies have put the prevalence at between 11% and 48%. Of 1,500 reports of such products, most came from Africa (42%), with south-east Asia also a major hotspot for fake medications. It is impossible to know precisely how many such medicines are in the system. Delese Mimi Darko, chief executive of Ghana\u2019s Food and Drug Authority (FDA), says this is an ongoing problem, especially as people smuggle drugs across the country\u2019s borders. She too worries that Ghana, with more than 1,500 reported Covid-19 cases, will see an increase in falsified and substandard medicines due to the pandemic. Already the FDA has seized substandard hand-sanitisers. \u201cThe current focus on curbing Covid-19 spread means there is less focus on routine market surveillance,\u201d says Darko. \u201cThis means there could be an influx across porous borders of substandard medical products \u2013 including those for Covid-19.\u201d Measures like social distancing and lockdowns limit the work the regulators could do, she added. The FDA is also keeping an eye on social media posts offering unsubstantiated cures. Ghana\u2019s police service has cautioned people to beware online offers of vaccines for Covid-19. Earlier this month, the WHO warned of falsified chloroquine products found in Cameroon, Niger, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and called for \u201cwidespread vigilance\u201d from all countries. Chloroquine has been used in Africa for decades as an antimalarial, but it became internationally famous after Donald Trump said it could be a \u201cgift from God\u201d in the fight against Covid-19. Such claims have led to people hoarding the medicine, leading to reports of price hikes and shortages. In Nigeria, three people overdosed on the drug. Kwasi Boateng, director of United States Pharmacopeia-Ghana, a public health non-profit that focuses party on combating falsified medicines, is concerned the pandemic might eventually cause a shortage of essential medicines in Ghana, allowing substandard or falsified treatments to fill the void. While he has not seen shortages of essentials yet, he says Ghana is still early in its battle with the virus and \u201ctime will tell\u201d. Boateng fears that if and when any official Covid-19 treatment is found, fake versions might find their way into the county. \u201cThe kind of medicines that people normally want faked are the ones that are in demand. So, if a new medication comes up which manages the condition, that makes it very attractive for people to want to latch on to it, so we all have to be vigilant.\u201d Chloroquine is no longer used in Ghana to treat malaria, but rumours suggest substandard chloroquine has been in circulation. \u201cIf we find any chloroquine on the market now, there is likely to be issues with it,\u201d says Boateng. In March, an Interpol operation reported an increase of more than 100% in seizures of unauthorised chloroquine, compared with the previous year. The organisation said this could be connected to the Covid-19 outbreak. The WHO\u2019s public health expert, Dr Mary Stephen, has said: \u201cFrom the beginning of the outbreak there has been a lot of rumours and speculation in terms of which drugs will be effective for Covid-19, for Africa.\u201d She says steps have been taken to stem the tide of fake drugs. In January, a handful of African leaders signed the Lom\u00e9 initiative, pledging new measures, including better border controls and legal processes against the smuggling of falsified products. The founding director of the Lao-Oxford-Mahosot Hospital-Wellcome Trust Research Unit, Dr Paul Newton, warns of a \u201cparallel crisis\u201d of quality, availability, and access to medical products and medicines, for all essential medicines. With global supply chains interrupted and physical distancing rules in place, regulatory work inspecting pharmaceutical factories is decreasing, Newton says. \u201cThat raises the risk of substandard medicines, and of companies cutting corners and making mistakes in the rush to manufacture,\u201d he warns. Newton is concerned about what will happen if and when health authorities do find medicine to prevent or treat Covid-19, and how the world\u2019s 7.8 billion people will access it. There needs to be coordinated production and strict quality surveillance, he warned. Before a medicine is found, Newton says he suspects criminals will have the equipment ready to make vast amounts of it. \u201cWhen they know it\u2019s \u2018medicine X\u2019, they will make fake copies, insert them in the supply chain and make enormous amounts of money \u2013 and kill people, to be brutally frank.\u201d To counter this parallel crisis, Newton calls for a global, prepared approach to assure the quality of diagnostic tests, drugs, and vaccines, where drugs are affordable and not hoarded or diverted from treating existing conditions.",

You can\u2019t aid your elderly, immunocompromised or poorer neighbors if you haven\u2019t taken the bare minimum of preparations. There\u2019s a reason that airplane safety demonstrations warn passengers to put on their own air-masks before assisting others.</p> <p>We\u2019re right to be angry at the people stripping supermarkets bare and hoarding desperately needed supplies.

Rightwing survivalists, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/la-xpm-2012-feb-08-la-na-american-redoubt-20120209-story.html?mod=article_inline\">in particular</a>, are often motivated by paranoid, apocalyptic, and racist or conspiratorial beliefs. A massive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/10/preppers-survivalists-survivalcon-expo-nuclear-bomb-republicans-mormons\">doomsday industry</a> caters to their fantasies with expensive survival supplies of questionable utility.</p> <p>The preppers we encounter in popular culture are invariably the worst examples - religious or political zealots, eccentrics, middle-aged men suffering crises of masculinity, and, in the case of shows such as Doomsday Preppers, caricatures selected for entertainment value.</p> <p>But not all are gun and gear fetishists with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/02/preppers-survivalist-summit-constitution-americas-midlife-crisis\">delusions of grandeur</a>; many are apolitical or even <a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">left</a><a href=\"https://theend.substack.com/\">wing</a>. Global warming, environmental degradation and anxiety about the Trump administration have <a href=\"https://qz.com/973095/the-new-doomsayers-taking-up-arms-and-preparing-for-catastrophe-american-liberals/\">spurred</a> liberals and leftists into the fold. Websites such as <a href=\"https://theprepared.com/\">ThePrepared</a> offer useful, non-alarmist advice on disaster preparedness.</p> <p>The more sophisticated practitioners have always understood that prepping is a matter of both individual and collective wellbeing. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, operates a massive network of grain silos and food depots. People undergoing hardship receive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/02/salt-lake-city-socialism-mormon-style-utah\">food and household goods</a>, for free or in exchange for volunteer service, at the church\u2019s Costco-style warehouses. The system is vertically integrated, with food supplied by <a href=\"https://www.mormonwiki.com/Bishop%27s_Storehouses\">church-owned farms</a>. All Mormons are also <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/emergency-preparedness?lang=eng\">encouraged</a> to maintain emergency stockpiles in their home \u2013 not only for their own sake, but to assist neighbors when a hurricane or flood strikes.</p> <p><em>When</em> disaster strikes, not if. The problem is that disasters always look like remote possibilities before they occur, and historical abstractions afterward. Even the coronavirus, as insurmountable as it seems, will eventually pass; we will return to normalcy, and then complacency, and maybe even go back to ridiculing preppers.</p> <p>Yet global warming probably means more and more of these kinds of crises \u2013 natural disasters, but also economic instability and possibly more pandemics, as thawing ice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/climate-change-thawing-deadly-diseases-anthrax\">releases long-dormant pathogens</a>.</p> <p>I suspect the real reason many people instinctively recoil from prepping is psychological. Prepping comes across as pessimistic or even cynical. But perhaps it is better to think of it as pragmatism. We should prepare for disasters for the same reason we buy life insurance or back up computer files: hope for the best, plan for the worst.</p> <p>Recently, while doing some quarantine cleaning, I found several books I acquired during younger \u2013 less lazy, and more idealistic \u2013 days: The Boy Scout Fieldbook; The US Army Survival Manual; Living Off the Country. It seems unlikely they\u2019ll prove too relevant here in Brooklyn, New York, but I\u2019ve decided to brush up anyway. I also found a book called Home Brewing Without Failures, by the unimprovably named HE Bravery. The utility of that one should speak for itself.</p>",

A massive doomsday industry caters to their fantasies with expensive survival supplies of questionable utility. The preppers we encounter in popular culture are invariably the worst examples - religious or political zealots, eccentrics, middle-aged men suffering crises of masculinity, and, in the case of shows such as Doomsday Preppers, caricatures selected for entertainment value. But not all are gun and gear fetishists with delusions of grandeur; many are apolitical or even leftwing. Global warming, environmental degradation and anxiety about the Trump administration have spurred liberals and leftists into the fold. Websites such as ThePrepared offer useful, non-alarmist advice on disaster preparedness. The more sophisticated practitioners have always understood that prepping is a matter of both individual and collective wellbeing. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, better known as the Mormon church, operates a massive network of grain silos and food depots. People undergoing hardship receive food and household goods, for free or in exchange for volunteer service, at the church\u2019s Costco-style warehouses. The system is vertically integrated, with food supplied by church-owned farms. All Mormons are also encouraged to maintain emergency stockpiles in their home \u2013 not only for their own sake, but to assist neighbors when a hurricane or flood strikes. When disaster strikes, not if. The problem is that disasters always look like remote possibilities before they occur, and historical abstractions afterward. Even the coronavirus, as insurmountable as it seems, will eventually pass; we will return to normalcy, and then complacency, and maybe even go back to ridiculing preppers. Yet global warming probably means more and more of these kinds of crises \u2013 natural disasters, but also economic instability and possibly more pandemics, as thawing ice releases long-dormant pathogens. I suspect the real reason many people instinctively recoil from prepping is psychological. Prepping comes across as pessimistic or even cynical. But perhaps it is better to think of it as pragmatism. We should prepare for disasters for the same reason we buy life insurance or back up computer files: hope for the best, plan for the worst. Recently, while doing some quarantine cleaning, I found several books I acquired during younger \u2013 less lazy, and more idealistic \u2013 days: The Boy Scout Fieldbook; The US Army Survival Manual; Living Off the Country. It seems unlikely they\u2019ll prove too relevant here in Brooklyn, New York, but I\u2019ve decided to brush up anyway. I also found a book called Home Brewing Without Failures, by the unimprovably named HE Bravery. The utility of that one should speak for itself.",

All 103 people to have survived the virus in the territory have now recovered. The ACT has recorded three deaths. It is the first jurisdiction in Australia to record no active cases.</p> \n<p>Nationally, just 10 new cases were recorded. Most were in Victoria, where a cluster of seven cases were detected at an aged care home. New South Wales reported two new cases and Tasmania reported one. It\u2019s not clear if the NSW total includes three new residents at Newmarch House aged care home in western Sydney, who tested positive over the past 24 hours.

The proposals, which were shared on Friday by the health and human services (HHS) department with health ministries in the six other member states, suggested organisational changes intended to reinforce the WHO\u2019s independence and transparency. However, G7 diplomats said they had not been informed of whether the HHS proposals represented a comprehensive list of US conditions to resume funding of the global health organisation. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear if these are agreed administration-wide,\u201d a western diplomat said. The generally moderate tone of the proposals is at odds with the strident allegations made against the WHO by the president and state department.

The US has proposed a third, halfway, option, likened by US officials to the yellow signal on traffic lights. The HHS document also called for increased transparency in WHO reporting on member state compliance, a clear reference to US dissatisfaction with complimentary remarks about the initial Chinese government response made by the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. In another proposed reform with China in mind, the US is suggesting that member state compliance with international health regulations should be subject to regular review. \u201cHHS is not going to comment on alleged, leaked documents,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said. \u201cPresident Trump is holding the WHO accountable by putting a hold on United States funding.

Another is that Manaus\u2019s chronically underfunded health service was poorly equipped and understaffed even before medical workers began contracting Covid-19 themselves.</p> <p>But many also blame corruption and the government\u2019s failure to effectively implement containment measures once Covid-19 was detected. Only on 23 March \u2013 10 days after the first case was confirmed \u2013 did the state governor <a href=\"https://amazonasatual.com.br/wilson-lima-decreta-calamidade-fecha-comercios-e-dara-r-200-a-50-mil-familias/\">declare</a> a state of emergency, ordering all non-essential businesses to close.</p> <p>\u201cWe took too long to ask people to stay at home,\u201d said Leonardo Steiner, the archbishop of Manaus, which is a four-hour flight north of S\u00e3o Paulo.</p> <p>Even now, with the death toll soaring, social distancing is being flouted in some areas on the city\u2019s outskirts, with huge queues outside banks and locals refusing to wear masks or remain at home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d2430216210c72e62fa42357cd40066e71870674\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2430216210c72e62fa42357cd40066e71870674/0_58_3073_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Relatives of a coronavirus victim react at the Dr Jo\u00e3o Lucio Pereira Machado hospital in Manaus last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Relatives of a coronavirus victim react at the Dr Jo\u00e3o Lucio Pereira Machado hospital in Manaus last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno Kelly/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPart of the city seems like it couldn\u2019t care less \u2013 it\u2019s as if nothing is happening,\u201d said Barros, the photographer.</p> <p>The mayor admitted he had failed to keep people indoors but said Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, should shoulder much of the blame for deliberately undermining such measures. \u201cWe don\u2019t have hurricanes here.

Here the tsunami was having disregarded \u2026 social isolation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt saddens me to know these lives could have been saved and weren\u2019t saved, in part because Brazil\u2019s main leader \u2026 said it was OK to go out,\u201d Virg\u00edlio added. </p> <p>Marcia Castro, a Harvard University demographer who specialises in public health in the Brazilian Amazon, said it was unrealistic to expect people to follow health ministry advice when 43% of residents didn\u2019t even have access to water to wash their hands. \u201cWhat this pandemic is doing is throwing wide open the inequalities that have existed for so long,\u201d said Castro, whose studies suggest Manaus\u2019s health system will collapse further in the coming days.</p> <p>Of the 5,000-plus Covid deaths officially confirmed in Brazil only 274 have been recorded in Manaus.

In Parque Tarum\u00e3 \u2013 Manaus\u2019s biggest cemetery \u2013 excavators have carved out mass graves called \u201ctrincheiras\u201d \u2013 trenches \u2013 in which the dead were being stacked in three-high piles until a revolt from mourning families saw the practice halted. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos in there,\u201d said Freitas, whose 58-year-old mother was consigned to the trenches last week. \u201cShe spent her whole life working \u2026 she paid all of her taxes. She deserved more. We all do.\u201d Edmar Barros, a local photographer who has been documenting the burials, said he had never seen anything similar. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd what is happening here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation of just devastating sadness.\u201d Emergency and health services in Manaus are also buckling under the strain, with ambulances roaming for up to three hours in search of hospitals with space to admit the patients they have collected. Gruesome video footage has emerged from hospitals showing corridors lined with corpses shrouded in body bags and sheets. Another video shows an unconscious patient with his head wrapped inside a ventilator hood improvised from a large plastic bag. \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of mechanical ventilators, of oxygen, of staff, of stretchers. Everything is lacking,\u201d said Dr Dom\u00edcio Magalh\u00e3es Filho, the technical director of the ambulance service, Samu. Experts and officials say multiple factors explain the intensity of the catastrophe affecting the Amazon region\u2019s biggest city. One is that the coronavirus epidemic has struck at the tail end of the rainy season, when respiratory illnesses are rife and hospitals already stretched. Another is that Manaus\u2019s chronically underfunded health service was poorly equipped and understaffed even before medical workers began contracting Covid-19 themselves. But many also blame corruption and the government\u2019s failure to effectively implement containment measures once Covid-19 was detected. Only on 23 March \u2013 10 days after the first case was confirmed \u2013 did the state governor declare a state of emergency, ordering all non-essential businesses to close. \u201cWe took too long to ask people to stay at home,\u201d said Leonardo Steiner, the archbishop of Manaus, which is a four-hour flight north of S\u00e3o Paulo. Even now, with the death toll soaring, social distancing is being flouted in some areas on the city\u2019s outskirts, with huge queues outside banks and locals refusing to wear masks or remain at home. \u201cPart of the city seems like it couldn\u2019t care less \u2013 it\u2019s as if nothing is happening,\u201d said Barros, the photographer. The mayor admitted he had failed to keep people indoors but said Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, should shoulder much of the blame for deliberately undermining such measures. \u201cWe don\u2019t have hurricanes here. We don\u2019t have tsunamis. Here the tsunami was having disregarded \u2026 social isolation.\u201d \u201cIt saddens me to know these lives could have been saved and weren\u2019t saved, in part because Brazil\u2019s main leader \u2026 said it was OK to go out,\u201d Virg\u00edlio added. Marcia Castro, a Harvard University demographer who specialises in public health in the Brazilian Amazon, said it was unrealistic to expect people to follow health ministry advice when 43% of residents didn\u2019t even have access to water to wash their hands. \u201cWhat this pandemic is doing is throwing wide open the inequalities that have existed for so long,\u201d said Castro, whose studies suggest Manaus\u2019s health system will collapse further in the coming days. Of the 5,000-plus Covid deaths officially confirmed in Brazil only 274 have been recorded in Manaus. But the recent surge in burials leaves no doubt the real total is far higher. Twenty-four hours after Rosemeire Silva\u2019s interment, another local woman, 53-year-old Am\u00e1lia Brand\u00e3o Ribeiro, was rushed unconscious to hospital suffering Covid symptoms \u2013 in the front seat of an Uber taxi, since no ambulances were available. Ribeiro\u2019s frenzied arrival was caught on camera \u2013 with weeping relatives pleading for help before her lifeless body was eventually hauled inside by staff. \u201cThey never even brought a trolley,\u201d said Paula Ribeiro, her daughter. Ribeiro was declared dead soon after, with the cause listed as \u201cunknown\u201d. But it was two days before her children could bury her at the Parque Tarum\u00e3 \u2013 one of 128 funerals that day. The confusion was such that officials initially released a man\u2019s corpse to her family before the mistake was realized. Freitas said he knew little of the ailment that had robbed him of his mother. \u201cIt comes from China, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he said vaguely on Tuesday as President Bolsonaro sparked outrage by shrugging his shoulders at the country\u2019s dead. \u201cAll of us are afraid because we don\u2019t know what tomorrow might bring,\u201d Freitas said. \u201cToday we\u2019re alive. Tomorrow we just don\u2019t know.\u201d Additional reporting by Daylla Kobosque",

      "body": "<p>The Trump administration has ratcheted up its efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic to overhaul and overturn Obama-era environmental regulations and increase industry access to public lands.</p> <p>The secretary of the interior, David Bernhardt, has sped efforts to drill, mine and cut timber on fragile western landscapes. Meanwhile, the EPA, headed by the former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, has weakened critical environmental laws and announced in March that it would cease oversight of the nation\u2019s polluters during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>The rollbacks appear to follow a playbook put forth by influential conservative thinktanks, urging the White House to use the pandemic as justification for curtailing, or eliminating, environmental rules and oversight. President Trump should have \u201cthe ability to suspend costly regulations without extensive process\u201d, according to a recent <a href=\"https://dinosaur-lily-78e9.squarespace.com/recommendations\">report</a> by the Heritage Foundation.</p> <p> Critics, such as Melyssa Watson, executive director of the Wilderness Society, accuse the administration of using the pandemic as a smokescreen to further its pro-industry agenda. \u201cFrom rolling back EPA\u2019s pollution standards, to pushing for more oil and gas drilling and stifling the public review process, the federal government is fast-tracking rollbacks that deserve public scrutiny,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While millions of acres of public lands across the country have been shuttered to visitors, they remain open to oil and gas companies. And despite plummeting oil prices, the Bureau of Land Management has announced no plans to cancel, or even scale back, upcoming auctions that would make hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands across the western US available to energy companies.</p> <p>One of the most controversial sales would offer up 150,000 acres in southern Utah to energy companies.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration has ratcheted up its efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic to overhaul and overturn Obama-era environmental regulations and increase industry access to public lands. The secretary of the interior, David Bernhardt, has sped efforts to drill, mine and cut timber on fragile western landscapes. Meanwhile, the EPA, headed by the former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, has weakened critical environmental laws and announced in March that it would cease oversight of the nation\u2019s polluters during the Covid-19 crisis. The rollbacks appear to follow a playbook put forth by influential conservative thinktanks, urging the White House to use the pandemic as justification for curtailing, or eliminating, environmental rules and oversight. President Trump should have \u201cthe ability to suspend costly regulations without extensive process\u201d, according to a recent report by the Heritage Foundation. Critics, such as Melyssa Watson, executive director of the Wilderness Society, accuse the administration of using the pandemic as a smokescreen to further its pro-industry agenda. \u201cFrom rolling back EPA\u2019s pollution standards, to pushing for more oil and gas drilling and stifling the public review process, the federal government is fast-tracking rollbacks that deserve public scrutiny,\u201d she said. While millions of acres of public lands across the country have been shuttered to visitors, they remain open to oil and gas companies. And despite plummeting oil prices, the Bureau of Land Management has announced no plans to cancel, or even scale back, upcoming auctions that would make hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands across the western US available to energy companies. One of the most controversial sales would offer up 150,000 acres in southern Utah to energy companies. Some of the parcels are located within a half-mile of Canyonlands national park. The bureau did not respond to requests for comment. Environmentalists, however, say that the push to drill near the iconic red rock landscapes of Arches and Canyonlands is not only destructive but also unnecessary in light of an oil glut that has swamped storage capacity, driving oil prices last week into negative territory for the first time in history. \u201cThe idea that it would be \u2018critical\u2019 work to speed up oil production on public lands while the planet drowns in oil tells you all you\u2019d ever want to know about the corruption, both intellectual and actual, of the Trump administration,\u201d said the climate activist and author Bill McKibben.

      "bodyText": "China is gearing up for its first national holiday after months of lockdowns, with authorities lowering the emergency response level for Beijing just in time to allow freer travel. On Wednesday, authorities announced a downgrade of the emergency response level governing Hebei province and the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, from Thursday. The measures will allow tens of millions of people to leave their cities without having to undergo 14 days of strict home quarantine on their return. Arrivals from low-risk areas of China also no longer need to complete two weeks\u2019 home isolation in Beijing, and anyone from those areas currently in quarantine, either at home or in facilities, can stop on Thursday, reported the official state media agency, Xinhua. Quarantine obligations still apply to arrivals from overseas, Hubei province, and other medium to high-risk areas. The relaxation comes on the eve of the five-day national Labour Day holiday, and triggered an immediate jump in tourism-related bookings, although numbers were still well below the same period last year. The Chinese ministry of transport said it expected 117 million people to travel during the holiday. According to the Chinese travel booking app Qunar, within 30 minutes of the announcement of Beijing\u2019s emergency downgrade, flight bookings for leaving the city rose by 15 times previous levels, with people mostly heading to Chengdu, Chongqing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Changsha. Authorities also reopened the Forbidden City in Beijing for the first time since the lockdown, to a reduced number of 5,000 visitors per day. Within 12 hours of going on sale, tickets for all five days of the holiday had sold out. The rush to travel out of Beijing reflected China\u2019s belief that it has at least begun to get the outbreak under control. However, a foreign ministry spokesperson, Chen Bei, said the risk of new cases as a result of the rush of movement \u201cshould not be underestimated\u201d. On the afternoon before Labour Day there were more people in Beijing\u2019s commercial centre than usual, and more shops open. Everyone kept their masks on in the 30C (86F) heat. But while it was the first day of a little more freedom for some residents, not all were ready to start travelling so soon. One 19-year-old student, with the surname Wang, said he had not travelled since summer last year and would be staying home this weekend. \u201cI think I will stay put for three or four more months before considering making any travel plans, and even now I don\u2019t go out much, only occasionally to get some fresh air,\u201d Wang said. \u201cI think it\u2019s still safer to stay home more and slowly increase the time that I head out.\u201d Another couple said they had no plans to travel. \u201cI hope the situation will be better in October, at that time I might consider travelling,\u201d the woman said. On Wednesday, China\u2019s national health commission reported just four new cases in the country, all of which it said were imported. It reported 33 new cases of asymptomatic infections, including two imported cases. State media reported on Wednesday that Beijing\u2019s Haidian district had begun drive-through testing in an effort to identify more asymptomatic cases. The capital did not record as many infections as other cities such as Wuhan in the first few months of the outbreak, but the city was the hardest hit in China by imported cases, when people began returning in droves from overseas. In March, partial lockdown restrictions on Beijing were tightened, including the diversion of all international flights to other cities so passengers could undergo health checks before being allowed to travel on. Not long after, restrictions were lifted in Wuhan and other regions, but Beijing stayed under strict measures. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

I file for business interruption insurance, it does not go through since I am \u2018allowed\u2019 to operate full capacity,\u201d he hypothesized, adding further down in the now viral post, \u201cIf things blow up again, they are still on my tab not on the states, since they are no longer employed. Guys, this is about screwing the working class and small business, not about helping us.\u201d</p> <p>Economists are uncertain if Gianoulidis is entirely correct about the exact rationale behind the sudden announcement to reopen Georgia as coronavirus cases continue to rise, with nearly 25,000 confirmed in the state as of Tuesday afternoon.

      "bodyText": "When John Gianoulidis, owner of the Kafenio Greek Diner, heard the Georgia governor, Brian Kemp, announce restaurants could offer dine-in services once again this week, he feared the worst for his restaurant and coffee shop in Atlanta. Here\u2019s the deal, he typed out on Facebook. \u201cKemp mandates restaurants reopen, whether I reopen dining rooms or not. I file for business interruption insurance, it does not go through since I am \u2018allowed\u2019 to operate full capacity,\u201d he hypothesized, adding further down in the now viral post, \u201cIf things blow up again, they are still on my tab not on the states, since they are no longer employed. Guys, this is about screwing the working class and small business, not about helping us.\u201d Economists are uncertain if Gianoulidis is entirely correct about the exact rationale behind the sudden announcement to reopen Georgia as coronavirus cases continue to rise, with nearly 25,000 confirmed in the state as of Tuesday afternoon. The state\u2019s reopening has been so early that even Donald Trump urged Kemp not to do it. But they can agree the most in danger from Kemp\u2019s actions \u2013 both economically and healthwise \u2013 are those who open their businesses or return to work in Georgia\u2019s new sudden easing of restrictions. The state\u2019s current count of positive virus cases makes it the tenth highest in the country as employees were cleared to serve meals in a restaurant, offer up tattoos or provide hair and nails services and check-in gym goers for Zumba class.

And then when it\u2019s time to get back to work that employer stops filing for them,\u201d the Georgia department of labor communications director, Kersha Cartwright, said. But it\u2019s unclear when that line between gradual and full time was drawn and by whom it was to be decided \u2013 the state or the employer. Many business owners, like Gianoulidis, will continue to offer carry-out options, but want to wait to hear the risks versus rewards from health officials before opening and seating customers in close quarters, they say. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to figure out what\u2019s going on.

I was due to fly home that evening, but had been out most of the night, and lost my wallet and phone. No hotel, no cards, no cash. I had my printed flight tickets and my passport, but no way to get to JFK. I sat on a bench outside a bar, low and horribly hungover, to consider my circumstances, and I will always remember hearing <strong>Empire State of Mind</strong> by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys from the bar\u2019s open door. At that point a woman walked up to me and asked what was up. I told her, we sat and smoked a cigarette, then she suggested I probably needed a lift, took me inside and ordered beers. She gave me $20, told me to take care, and left.

They played <strong>I Follow Rivers</strong> by Lykke Li (Magician Remix) regularly, and something about the hedonistic, urgent nature of it seemed to sit perfectly with the utter freedom and joy I felt during this time.

At the time <strong>Sweet but Psycho</strong> by Ava Max was everywhere and became the soundtrack to the next few days for myself and two fellow travellers I met a few days earlier. Wandering the cobbled, dusty streets soaking up the atmosphere, making sure every evening to sing and dance up at the fortress for the incredible sunsets, even getting the locals involved. Every now and then I get a voice note from one of the trio singing along to the chorus. It always makes me smile.<br><strong>Isabelle</strong></p> <h2><strong>Disaster recovery, southern France</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp2ozbWXBGo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rp2ozbWXBGo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Campsite in the south of France with husband and six-year-old daughter, 1985. Huge storm. Beach slid into the sea, tents and belongings disappeared. Camp management cobbled together on-site accommodation, and a large awning for the international campers. There was a record player and one record \u2013 Michel Delpech\u2019s <strong>Pour Un Flirt</strong> from 1971. Candles and lanterns, swimwear, flip flops, wine and baguettes. We danced, laughed and danced more. Children and adults mixing for hours. It was fantastic.

Barmen stood guard to open the doors as the waves receded to allow customers in and out. Theoretically. Open went the doors, in came the wave \u2013 which broke mid-way inside the bar, carrying tables and chairs with it to the rear wall.

As we were climbing up to the top of one of the highest mountains on the island a guy came past us going down the mountain with his long blond hair flowing in the wind, and Donna Summer\u2019s I Feel Love blasting out from a Bluetooth speaker in his back pocket. The tune became the theme song for our holiday. Nick Manhattan transfer problem I once met an angel in Manhattan. I was due to fly home that evening, but had been out most of the night, and lost my wallet and phone. No hotel, no cards, no cash. I had my printed flight tickets and my passport, but no way to get to JFK. I sat on a bench outside a bar, low and horribly hungover, to consider my circumstances, and I will always remember hearing Empire State of Mind by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys from the bar\u2019s open door. At that point a woman walked up to me and asked what was up. I told her, we sat and smoked a cigarette, then she suggested I probably needed a lift, took me inside and ordered beers. She gave me $20, told me to take care, and left. Alex, the Angel of 23rd St. Julian A piazza paradise, Amalfi Coast My boyfriend and I were in Naples in the 1990s and often drove to the Amalfi Coast. We would stop in Positano for delizie al limone, creamy lemon cakes, and a swim and then head on to the gardens of Ravello. One evening the Gypsy Kings (a reduced line-up) played in Ravello\u2019s small piazza. That\u2019s when we first heard Volare. Later this was our first dance at our wedding. Juliet Anthem for an alpine ski bum I\u2019d just finished school after a horrendous final year and was working in a ski resort over the winter, revelling in life with no responsibilities beyond serving hotel guests their morning cornflakes and cleaning toilets. The rest of my time was spent whizzing about the Alps on skis and consuming dangerously large glasses of bad wine, free of charge, at the only club in town. They played I Follow Rivers by Lykke Li (Magician Remix) regularly, and something about the hedonistic, urgent nature of it seemed to sit perfectly with the utter freedom and joy I felt during this time. It still gives me the same rush of joie de vivre. Kirstin Bye-bye Brazil and bossa nova Agora, que fa\u00e7o eu da vida sem voc\u00ea? I held a party to say goodbye to Brazil 15 years ago and printed out copies of this song so we could sing it together. \u201cWhat will I make of life without you?\u201d I still don\u2019t know, but I would go back in a heartbeat to that magnificent country of music and open hearts and beauty. I brought my husband and son to Brazil, and we are still learning new bossa nova to bring melancholy and joy to our lives. My tip has no price: go to Brazil if you can. Meabh Cormacain All sweetness and twilight in Kosovo Last summer was spent flitting around Eastern Europe and towards the end of the trip I found myself in Prizren, Kosovo. At the time Sweet but Psycho by Ava Max was everywhere and became the soundtrack to the next few days for myself and two fellow travellers I met a few days earlier. Wandering the cobbled, dusty streets soaking up the atmosphere, making sure every evening to sing and dance up at the fortress for the incredible sunsets, even getting the locals involved. Every now and then I get a voice note from one of the trio singing along to the chorus. It always makes me smile. Isabelle Disaster recovery, southern France Campsite in the south of France with husband and six-year-old daughter, 1985. Huge storm. Beach slid into the sea, tents and belongings disappeared. Camp management cobbled together on-site accommodation, and a large awning for the international campers. There was a record player and one record \u2013 Michel Delpech\u2019s Pour Un Flirt from 1971. Candles and lanterns, swimwear, flip flops, wine and baguettes. We danced, laughed and danced more. Children and adults mixing for hours. It was fantastic. The music evokes the best holiday ever, and I found it in a junk shop in Peckham later. Pat Taylor The sea air and Sia, Puglia The first time I drove to my new little house in Puglia, I was by myself. It\u2019s a long way, and at one point, near the end, you drive on the Autostrada Adriatico. Gps instructions: follow the road for 596km. Almost empty sweeping road, long glimpses of beautiful sea to your left, sunshine \u2026 lots of sunshine. And Cheap Thrills by Sia. It came on again and again, and I opened the windows and sang very loudly. I got the CD for Christmas, and whenever I hear it I sing, I\u2019m back on the long sunny road, sunflowers, castles on hilltops, and summer is starting. Ruth Male order: Sitges, Catalonia It\u2019s 1984, a trailer disco in Sitges, and 500 or more gay men dancing and singing with Eartha Kitt\u2019s I Love Men. The track even has prominent castanets making it seem even more the right dance track for a camp Spanish resort. Chris Hewitston Out of Africa with Bob Dylan Mozambique by Bob Dylan is a timeless song that expresses pleasure and a relaxed atmosphere with an uplifting sense of freedom.

When I hear it now, I\u2019m transported to a quiet shingle beach, drying off in the 32C heat after snorkelling in that beautiful crystal blue sea. My partner and I have cancelled what would\u2019ve been our third trip back but 2021 will see us back in our happy place I\u2019m sure. In the meantime I\u2019ll listen to Fade Out Lines now and again on a sunny day in the garden. Lucy A Parisian awakening In the summer of 1968, when I was 16, I spent two weeks in Paris with my boyfriend. It was my first trip abroad, my passport fresh and new. The first impression was of a distinctly different smell \u2013 coffee, dust and urinals \u2026 The soundtrack everywhere that summer was Je t\u2019aime, moi non plus featuring Jane Birkin and Serge Gainsbourg. We hadn\u2019t heard it until getting to Paris because it had been banned by the BBC \u2013 even Auntie had noticed it was a hymn to sex! I still play it on my iPhone, but it doesn\u2019t make me blush any more. Deri Homestay owner who didn\u2019t want to give me up, Belize Running down a hill in Belizean jungle, escaping a slightly psychotic American homestay host, I found the road and a different world of sweet Belizeans. Clambered onto battered re-purposed US yellow school bus breathed heavy sigh of relief and ate the best orange ever. Passing jasmine-scented orange groves, on the radio Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley. Always been an indie kid, but weirdly I now have that song etched happily into me forever. Richard Terry A Neil Young wave of joy: Crete I was hitching through Europe 40-ish years ago and staying a couple of nights in Chania, Crete. It was a very high tide and a strong wind and Chania was braced for a buffeting ... which it duly got. The bars facing the lovely harbour had sandbagged their saloon-style doors. Barmen stood guard to open the doors as the waves receded to allow customers in and out. Theoretically. Open went the doors, in came the wave \u2013 which broke mid-way inside the bar, carrying tables and chairs with it to the rear wall. I picked up my beer as my table disappeared and set it down again once it returned, while Neil Young\u2019s Cortez The Killer blasted forth from huge wall mounted speakers. Joy. Steve Crick An Ibiza encounter with Grace Jones It\u2019s easy. July 1983. Ibiza. My first time. The Ku Club \u2013 then still open air with a pool \u2013 but drinks still expensive. The tune? Blue Monday by New Order. A song then that sounded like no other. And still doesn\u2019t. The DJ must have played it five times. And the crowd went mad. Why the memory, after all these years? Standing there, in this amazing club, listening to this breakthrough music. And who stands in front? Grace Jones. I\u2019d died and gone to music heaven. What a holiday. And what a tune. Mark Oley We\u2019re afraid that because of the coronavirus crisis there is no prize on offer for the week\u2019s best entry \u2013 though hopefully that will return soon Have a look at our past winners and other tips",

restaurants closed.</p> \n  <p>Myer had a 170.9 per cent year-on-year rise in entertainment sales driven by cooking appliances, with some of the best performing products being coffee machines and mixers.</p> \n  <p>Coles has seen a rise in purchases of vegetable, such potatoes, onions and carrots, while larger volumes of broccoli, lettuce and cabbage are being grown.</p> \n  <p>Woolworths said after disinfectants, bread mix was the second most popular purchase, with demand growing by 88 per cent between March 18 and April 14.</p> \n  <p>The supermarket chain also saw sales of dried herbs

Thank you for your company and correspondence, commendations and criticisms, all of it a welcome and vital part of our community\u2019s discussion. Tonight in Australia: More than 6,753 cases have been recorded, with fewer than 1,100 still active. South Australia has gone more than a week without any new infections. The ACT has zero active cases. The death toll is 92: NSW, 42; Victoria, 18; Tasmania, 13; WA, 8; Queensland, 4; SA, 4; ACT, 3. The latest death was that of an 86-year-old Tasmanian woman, thought to be linked to the Ruby Princess outbreak Twenty-one of the deaths were passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, four were on the Artania in WA and 12 were residents at the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney. More than 566,000 tests have been conducted across the country. More than 3 million people have registered with the federal government\u2019s tracking app CovidSafe since Sunday. On restrictions, closures and suppression measures: National cabinet wants to see 20 or fewer cases a week before Australia further eases restrictions. Australia\u2019s borders won\u2019t reopen for at least three months, the federal government says. Prime minister Scott Morrison has indicated a mid-May national cabinet meeting will assess lifting some social and economic restrictions. Initial jobkeeper payments \u2013 part of a $130bn package \u2013 will be received by employers soon. Australian manufacturers will get $48.3m in federal government funding to help modernise their operations and create 2,600 new jobs. In NSW from Friday, households will be allowed two adult visitors, and their children, under an initial easing of self-isolation measures. Most beaches are open for exercise, swimming and surfing only. In WA, up to 10 people are able to gather for non-contact recreational activities and outdoor personal training, while open homes and display villages will also be permitted. In Queensland, some stay-at-home restrictions will be eased this weekend, allowing people to travel 50km from their residence to visit parks, have picnics and jet ski. Shopping for non-essential items will also be permitted. The Northern Territory plans to reopen parks and reserves this weekend. Victoria has no plans to lift restrictions until May 11 at the earliest. South Australians with coronavirus isolating at home will receive daily support from two new dedicated teams of GPs and nurses via telephone. NSW students will attend school one day a week starting from May 11. Queensland will on May 15 review keeping children at home. No change has been flagged in Victoria. Western Australia hopes all students will return to classes by May 11 while 63% of students have gone back in SA. Still open: supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, public transport, some schools, hairdressers, petrol stations, postal and freight services, bottle shops, newsagents, retail shops. Restaurants restricted to takeaway/delivery in most states. In other developments: A report into the northwest Tasmania coronavirus outbreak says the most likely cause was the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Victoria has recorded a new cluster of Covid-19 cases at a nursing home. One million Australians are expected to apply for unemployment benefits due to job-losses stemming from the disease. A flight from India will bring more than 100 Australians back to WA on Friday. The Guardian\u2019s international liveblog continues here: States, community organisations, and faith groups come to the rescue of those in Australia excluded from federal government Covid-19 assistance: international students, working holiday makers, asylum seekers and refugees. A police officer and her partner have been charged with breaching the regional coronavirus travel restrictions in Western Australia. The pair are alleged to have driven across district lines from the Wheatbelt to the Perth/Peel region on 9 April and again on 15 April, without a lawful exemption. Under the Prohibition on Regional Travel directions, you can only travel between regions for work or education, for care or compassionate reasons, to carry freight, or because you have another reasonable excuse. \u201cIt is alleged, on both occasions the man driving the vehicle was advised by police he was not an exempted traveller and was given a direction to turn around,\u201d a spokeswoman from WA Police said. \u201cIt is further alleged the man failed to comply with this direction and immediately continued beyond the police checkpoint.\u201d The 24-year-old man was charged with two counts of failing to comply with a direction and will face court later this month. The police officer, who was off duty, was also charged. Police said the officer, a 29-year-old Swan View woman, is currently serving in the WA police force but would not be investigated by internal affairs because she had already resigned. Her resignation was \u201cunrelated to this matter\u201d, police said. More on the worsening row between Beijing and Canberra. Trent Zimmerman, Liberal MP for North Sydney, has left the diplomatic niceties at the door, calling the comments of China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, \u201cdownright despicable and menacing\u201d. For context, the rest of Zimmerman\u2019s comments on the issue were more conciliatory, but it\u2019s a long way back from despicable and menacing. The comments Zimmerman was referencing, were suggestions by Cheng of a potential Chinese consumer boycott of Australia over Canberra\u2019s pushing for an international, independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19. Cheng told the AFR: The Chinese public is frustrated, dismayed and disappointed with what Australia is doing now. I think in the long term ... if the mood is going from bad to worse, people would think \u2018Why should we go to such a country that is not so friendly to China?\u2019 The tourists may have second thoughts. The parents of the students would also think whether this place which they found is not so friendly, even hostile, whether this is the best place to send their kids here. It is up to the people to decide. Maybe the ordinary people will say \u2018Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?\u2019. Here\u2019s Zimmerman at greater length: The calls for the inquiry are perfectly reasonable. To be honest, I\u2019ve been very disappointed in the response that we\u2019ve had, particularly from the Chinese embassy in Australia. I thought the ambassador\u2019s comments were downright despicable and menacing. We should have a relationship with China which allows us to raise these issues, and recognising China will always be an important partner for us. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second largest economy, the largest consumer market in their own region. No one is talking about shutting the doors to China. We want to maintain the person-to-person relationship that we have with China. The relationship needs to be mature enough to be able to raise these issues \u2013 occasionally critically and occasionally expressing our differences without affecting the fundamentals of that relationship. The current dispute is, ostensibly, over Australia leading global calls for an independent, international investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, the first-known cases of which emerged in Wuhan, in China\u2019s central Hubei province. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and foreign minister Marise Payne publicly launched the push last week, amid accusations globally that China initially covered up the seriousness of the virus, costing the world lost precious weeks to prepare and respond. Morrison has also raised the issue with US president Donald Trump, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Australia\u2019s proposal has been met with furious ripostes from Beijing, mainly through the embassy in Canberra and the pages of the Global Times. The backdrop to this particular dispute is a number of long-running issues between Beijing and Canberra, most notably Australia\u2019s decision to exclude Huawei from Australia\u2019s 5G network, China\u2019s continued detention of Australian pro-democracy writer Yang Hengjun, and the overarching issue of Chinese influence in the Australian polity and economy. Good evening, Ben Doherty with you until stumps. This is remarkable. From my colleague Jillian Ambrose in London. Renewable electricity will be the only source resilient to the biggest global energy shock in 70 years triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, according to the world\u2019s energy watchdog. The International Energy Agency said the outbreak of Covid-19 would wipe out demand for fossil fuels by prompting a collapse in energy demand seven times greater than the slump caused by the global financial crisis. The Human Rights Law Centre has called on the federal government to permanently raise social security payments, after it confirmed in the Covid-19 senate inquiry today that the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplement won\u2019t continue past 24 September. HRLC\u2019s associate legal director, Adrianne Walters, said it would be cruel for the government to step backwards after effectively doubling the payments for six months. Walters said: A good government would ensure that every person has the means to buy nourishing food, keep warm on a cold night, sleep in a safe place and pay for school books and excursions for their kids. This means the Federal Government permanently raising social security payments for all and ending demoralising systems of compliance and penalties. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Government increased Jobseeker and other payments, recognising the unacceptability of a system that forces people to choose between eating and paying rent. A decent standard of living and compassion are values that must be reinserted into our social security system. On that note, I\u2019ll hand you over to my colleague Ben Doherty. In other news, NSW fire commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has left the building. Fitzsimmons resigned the RFS after 35 years at the start of April, and will head a new government disaster agency, Resilience NSW. An FYI for our readers in WA\u2019s great southern region: The three new cases among residents at Newmarch House come after the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said on Wednesday that two additional staff members tested positive to Covid-19. One of the staff members had been actively working at the home during the lockdown. Three more residents of Newmarch House aged care home in Western Sydney have tested positive to coronavirus, Anglicare Sydney says. It brings the number of residents to have tested positive to the infection to at least 37, with 22 staff members also testing positive. As of yesterday, 12 residents who tested positive have died. In a statement, Anglicare Sydney says: The reasons for this are still being investigated and we are working closely with NSW Public Health Unit and an Infectious Diseases Specialist. Anglicare Sydney would like to thank the Commonwealth and NSW Government for the additional support they are providing at Newmarch House. Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos has responded to calls from the state opposition that the deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, resign over a tweet. This is the tweet: Opposition leader Michael O\u2019Brien said the tweet was a sign that \u201cin Daniel Andrews\u2019 Victoria, left wing views are the main qualification for public office\u201d. We\u2019ll just state, for the record, that van Diemen\u2019s public health qualifications and experience are sound. The opposition has been calling for the Andrews government to lift restrictions for some time. Victoria and Tasmania are the only states not to announce a loosening of restrictions. The current public health orders in Victoria are due to expire on 11 May. Labor senator for the ACT Katy Gallagher was asked on the ABC for her reaction to the jurisdiction reporting no new active cases of Covid-19. She says it\u2019s a \u201cfantastic result\u201d but cautioned against calls to lift restrictions and return to in-person schooling. We are an island in the sea of New South Wales. We can\u2019t close borders in that sense. So there\u2019s still risks that are presented for us as a small jurisdiction. I know that the current chief minister will be weighing up a whole range of information and advice that\u2019s coming to him. But I think, and in time I would hope to see, some lifting of restrictions and a pathway to go back to as more normal way of living, and certainly as a mum with two kids at home at the moment, that\u2019s getting kids back to school as soon as it\u2019s safe to do so. South Australia has recorded no new cases of coronavirus for the eighth day in the row. Bishop says she has also been surprised at a press conference by the presence of a senior diplomat, as Greg Hunt was yesterday when Andrew Forrest invited the Victorian Chinese consul general to the press conference without the health minister\u2019s knowledge. Bishop: It would not be acceptable diplomatic practice to give the government hosting the press conference no notice or little notice of the attendance of a diplomat that hadn\u2019t been invited by the government. So that would not be usual diplomatic practice. Although I have experienced similar behaviour in the past, and so it\u2019s not unprecedented, it seems to be an unfortunate situation that occurred. Forrest and other billionaires, notably Kerry Stokes, have told the government to ease to pressure on China. Bishop said she is not privy to government briefings but imagined Scott Morrison was driven by public health concerns. Meanwhile, former foreign minister Julie Bishop is on the ABC talking about the government\u2019s call for an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus, which has upset Beijing. Bishop says it would be \u201cpreferable of course had China led a credible investigation into the origins of coronavirus\u201d. But clearly China doesn\u2019t want to cooperate with an independent international investigation, and that does make it challenging, not only for Australia, but for other countries that have been affected by coronavirus. And I think we should scale down the rhetoric, more calm and quiet diplomacy, so that we can understand more about this virus, how it got into human populations and whether decisions could have been taken that would have prevented its spread. So I think that China has a responsibility to support an investigation, if indeed it won\u2019t carry out a credible investigation for the rest of the world itself. Police in New South Wales have fined five women for allegedly breaching social distancing laws, after a video emerged of the women dancing on TikTok alongside NRL player Nathan Cleary. But Cleary himself has not been fined. This statement has been issued by police: Police have issued PINs to five women after photos and videos were shared on social media allegedly showing a group not complying with social distancing earlier this week. Officers from Nepean Police Area Command initiated an investigation after photos and videos were shared on social media concerning an incident at a home in Penrith on Saturday 25 April 2020. Following further inquiries, police this afternoon , issued PINs to five women \u2013 aged in their late teens to early 20s \u2013 for failing to comply with a Ministerial Direction. A 22-year-old man, who was filmed in the videos, was spoken to by police. No offence relating to him has been detected; however, he was issued a warning regarding social distancing. If you haven\u2019t been following this story, firstly, congratulations, and secondly, allow me to fill you in. Cleary is in trouble with the NRL, who fined him $4,000 after learning of the incident. Police said they didn\u2019t fine him because he hadn\u2019t left his house \u2014 the women came to him. It was, Cleary said, an impromptu 10-minute stop-off on their way home. But the emergence of the TikTok has cast doubt on that story, because TikTok challenges can take longer than 10 minutes to film. The Daily Telegraph doorstopped Cleary about it on Wednesday. Literally: their report said he spoke to them \u201cthrough the crack of his front door\u201d. Let\u2019s summarise the coronavirus results from today. The total number of cases in Australia increased by just 10 overnight, bringing the total to 6,748. Sadly the death toll has risen to 91 with the death overnight of an 86-year-old woman in Tasmania. The Australian Capital Territory reported no new cases and, as of today, has no active cases. The ACT had 106 cases: three people sadly died, and the remaining 103 have recovered. It\u2019s the first time in seven weeks the ACT does not have an active coronavirus case. Western Australia, Queensland, and South Australia recorded no new cases, as did the Northern Territory, although the NT has had no new cases for weeks. Victoria recorded seven new cases \u2014a cluster in an aged care home \u2014 and NSW two. Finally, McMillan says the AHPPC has provided advice to the national cabinet on the resumption of sport (that\u2019s both professional and community, and just recreational activities). She won\u2019t pre-empt that advice, but notes that the rules around sport have differed between states \u2014 Victoria has banned golf, for example, while jurisdictions like the ACT have not \u2014 so the easing of restrictions around playing sport is also likely to be state-specific. McMillan says that the three requirements set in place by the AHPPC and national cabinet in order to lift restrictions \u2014 broad sentinel testing, improved contact tracing, and a local response capability built into the health system \u2014 remain in place. She says 20,000 nurses have now registered to complete an additional critical care course that will allow Australia to expand the critical care capacity across the country, if necessary. About 3,000 nurses have also returned to the profession after a time off. But she says Australia should not become complacent. Testing for Covid-19 is now available to anyone in the health care or aged care workforce in Australia who has respiratory symptoms. McMillan says anyone with concerns should get tested. The really strong message to everybody, especially those who work with the most vulnerable, those working in the health and aged care sector, is please be very vigilant about any minor or slight symptoms you might have. A scratchy throat, a runny nose. Testing is available out there readily to everyone, if you are at all concerned you may have symptoms please don\u2019t go to work, seek guidance from your GP or a testing clinic and let\u2019s confirm you are Covid-19 free, let\u2019s not put anybody in the community at risk and we encourage that across the workforce. She is asked about reports of outbreaks at aged care homes, allegedly caused by a health worker attending work while unwell. We would not look to penalise anyone who inadvertently went to work and they were unwell, that\u2019s not an approach we would want to take. As of today, she says, hospitals and aged care facilities have screening processes in place where they are proactively asking staff if they feel unwell or have been in contact with anyone who is unwell. The chief nursing and midwifery officer, Alison McMillan, is giving an update on Australia\u2019s coronavirus situation. She\u2019s not one of the usual faces. McMillan says Australia saw just 10 new cases in the past 24 hours. Australia has now conducted 556,000 tests for Covid-19. Thirty-six people remain in hospital, of whom 25 are on ventilators. The number of people who have downloaded and registered for the CovidSafe app has reached 3.31m. McMillan says they are \u201ceternally grateful for everyone who has done that\u201d. And a reminder for everyone who has not yet chosen to do that, it is voluntary but we would like you to download and register for that so we can continue our fight against Covid-19 in Australia. Is that enough people for the app to be effective, a reporter asks? There is a suggestion that between 40-60% of the population may need to register for it to work well. McMillan says it is hard to tell, because authorities do not know where people who are registered with the app live, so they don\u2019t know how broad the coverage is in Australia. Everyone who downloads and registers for that app is one more that will help us in this fight. NRL players in return-to-work talks More on that potential spanner in the works to the NRL\u2019s plan to start training next week for a 28 May restart. Players are holding crunch talks this afternoon to discuss whether they should plough on without a revised pay deal in place. Nine is reporting that several high profile players are standing firm with the Warriors, who at this point are unsure about flying to Australia from New Zealand to play out the remainder of the season given there are no details on remuneration. Players were slated to return to the training pitch on Tuesday next week, with Monday set aside for educational programs on the strict biosecurity measures that will need to be put into place if the season is to restart. AAP reports: The development comes as talks between the league and its television networks continue on new broadcast revenues for the revised season. The NRL\u2019s plan is for the Warriors to depart New Zealand on Sunday and, while in self-isolation in Tamworth, join rival teams in preparing for a 28 May restart. Further complicating matters is the Warriors are yet to receive an official exemption to enter the country, or train together while in quarantine. While a charter flight has been booked, the club also continues to demand certainty around a number of issues before stepping on a plane. Chief among the concerns are how much players can expect to be paid, as well as the possible accommodation of families during their indefinite stay. The Warriors could spend up to six months in Sydney should international travel restrictions remain until the grand final in late October. Thank you to everyone who joined me for another week. I am going to hand you over to Calla Wahlquist for the next little while. I\u2019ll be back Monday. Add milk to your bolognese meat sauce, and take care of you. Rachel Stephen-Smith notes the dangers of a second wave, and encourages Canberrans \u201cnot to be complacent\u201d, because no vaccination yet exists. In terms of timeline from here, she said: So, we are going to be facing this global pandemic for some months to come and we will need to face up to that has a community and work through that together and what that means. We will not be going back, even as we ease restrictions, to the situation we had in November, or even February, we will not be gathering together again in large groups in thousands of people for some time yet.\u201d The ACT health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, is giving the afternoon update. She says the ACT won\u2019t be relaxing restrictions despite the territory eliminating its known cases of Covid-19. That won\u2019t please ACT parents who are remote teaching, after the ACT closed all schools, except for nine \u201chubs\u201d for term 2: People now be asking as they have for a few days, what does this in terms of lifting some of the restrictions that we have had in place? The chief minister will have more to say about this tomorrow. It is important to emphasise that it is not a race to lift restrictions. Some of the announcements that have been made in other jurisdictions are pretty much in line with some of the arrangements that were already in place in the ACT. Here in the ACT you have already been allowed to go and visit another person \u2018s house, as long as it is only one or two people together, and as long as those physical distancing arrangements can be maintained, that is one person every four square metres or staying 1.5m apart. We will have more to say tomorrow on some of the other measures we will be looking out over the next little while. Again, it is not a race. We do need to maintain vigilance in relation to Covid-19. We know that this virus and this disease continues to exist in Australia. We cannot close our borders in the ACT. We are an island in the heart of New South Wales and the heart of a broader region for people to live and work and cross the border all the time. So we have to do things in line with national cabinet. Bearing in mind what is happening in New South Wales but also things that work for our community. China\u2019s vice-foreign minister, Le Yucheng, has done an interview with NBC. While tensions with Australia are not mentioned specifically, he does address calls for an international investigation into Covid-19: You mentioned international investigation. We are candid, and we are open. We support professional exchanges between scientists, including exchanges for reviewing and summarizing experiences. What we oppose, however, is unfounded charges against China. One should not accuse China first and then run so-called international investigations just to make up the evidence. This is arbitrary investigation based on the presumption of guilt. That is what we firmly oppose. As I said just now, the WHO-led expert group visited Wuhan timely. As for the Wuhan Institute of Virology, it is open to international communication. Ever since its establishment, it has received visits by many international scientists, including those from the United States. Just recently, the head of the institute took an interview with a foreign media, and made it clear that the institute has neither the intention nor the capacity to engineer any kind of virus. ... The international investigation, if there is any, should have a solid basis. Why is this investigation only targeted at China? Is there any evidence to show that China does have problems? Why isn\u2019t there any investigation of other countries? Even for the sake of reviewing for improvement, then science-wise, don\u2019t those countries with rapid spread and surge of confirmed and fatal cases have their own problems? We oppose politically-driven investigation for the purpose of stigmatizing China.\u201d There was a Labor-Greens majority on this committee, so this outcome should not be a surprise: So this is a spanner in the 28 May NRL re-start date works: The ACT Health press conference will be broadcast here, if anyone wants to follow along. Authorities will be speaking more on the eradication of the (known) covid cases in the ACT, as well as the expanded community testing regime. Michael McCormack then takes a phone call in the middle of his press conference. Michael McCormack is still talking. He\u2019s trying to pretend that he doesn\u2019t care if the NSW Nationals leader, John Barilaro, decides to run for Eden-Monaro. If Barilaro ran, and won, he would be a MASSIVE threat to McCormack\u2019s quite tenuous hold on the federal Nationals leadership. McCormack\u2019s not the leader because he\u2019s popular in the party room. He\u2019s the leader because there is no other consensus candidate and not even the Nats were crazy enough to bring back Barnaby Joyce. McCormack is as successful at delivering his \u201cwhatever, he can do what he wants\u201d as I was when my brother got the last slice of cake I\u2019d been thinking about all day: Look, if John wants to put his hand up and run, of course I\u2019ll support him. Of course I\u2019ll support him. I will support any National party member who puts up their hand for that seat. We need a good local person to run in that seat and to contest that seat and hopefully win that seat. John certainly is a good local candidate. I am sure there would be possibly others as well who want to put up their hand and run for that seat. Spare a thought for the culture warriors. It\u2019s been a tough time for them as the nation focuses on facts, not feelpinions. For the record, it is possible to say that yes, Captain James Cook was a great navigator who achieved many things for his time while also saying that yes, he also brought a world of (ongoing) pain to First Nations people all over the world, ushering in a complete change of life as they knew it, which still has massive ramifications for those people today. The dude was greeted by Indigenous people 250 years and one day ago, and still wrote this southern land he \u201cdiscovered\u201d was empty, claiming it for the British Empire. It is not only a fact to acknowledge that, it is absolutely necessary. We follow up that wonderful news with a Michael McCormack press conference. What goes up, must go down. And so it is written. That is wonderful news for the ACT and I hope more Australian jurisdictions will soon be able to report the same. Here is the ACT Health word on that great news: There have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 106. A total of 103 cases have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. There are no active cases in the ACT. The ACT has recorded three (3) deaths. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 8,568. The ACT chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, has welcomed the news that the ACT no longer has any active cases of Covid-19 but has cautioned the community that the pandemic is still ongoing. \u2018Today marks the first time in seven weeks our territory has no active cases of Covid-19 and this is because of the strong work the community is doing to stop this virus,\u2019 Dr Coleman said. \u2018I want to thank you for practising physical distancing and making these huge changes to your daily life. Today\u2019s news is exactly why we have put these measures into place. \u2018However, it is important to stress that we should still protect the good work we have done. Please continue to follow ACT Health directives and practise good hygiene as we continue help fight this virus together. \u2018Tomorrow it will be one week since we expanded testing criteria to help us get an even better view of the situation in the community. The ACT has just become the first jurisdiction to record no known active cases in Australia. Three people died in the ACT and the territory recorded 106 cases over the last seven weeks. The other 103 people who had been diagnosed have recovered from the virus. Karen Andrews is announcing the recipients of the $215m \u201cmanufacturing modernisation\u201d program, which includes $1m to the company bringing back the Polly Waffle. Yes. You read that right. (For the record, scorched peanut bars are also back but softer, they still make chokitos and lolly gobble bliss bombs and they have also brought back the individual violet crumble squares.) This is obviously some of the most important news today: Not Covid related, but still very important: The ALP will have to confirm party membership of the woman most likely to be its candidate in the Eden-Monaro byelection, following the retirement announcement today by Labor\u2019s Mike Kelly. Bega Valley Shire mayor Kristy McBain is believed to top the list of possible candidates to be considered by the ALP national executive this afternoon. However, party officials will first have to check her credentials as it is understood McBain might not have her membership up to date. Guardian Australia has been told she was in Young Labor at university but then left the ALP, although her policies as mayor have been similar to Labor\u2019s. McBain and Labor\u2019s NSW head office have been contacted for comment. The national executive would be able to resolve the membership issue, if there is a problem, and preselection at the meeting today. McBain has the backing of opposition leader Anthony Albanese in what is expected to be a tight battle for the notoriously swinging seat. And so it begins The Australian Financial Review is reporting that billionaire mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest is putting together a bid for Virgin Australia. His investment group, Minderoo, is reported to have hired investment bank Credit Suisse as advisers. The report came as creditors of the airline met by videolink this morning. Minderoo has been contacted for comment. Forrest was last seen yesterday announcing his charitable foundation would buy 10m face masks at a press conference with health minister Greg Hunt that has caused some controversy because the billionaire invited along a Chinese diplomat, Zhou Long. In this-is-why-using-the-internet-should-maybe-need-a-licence news, there is a conspiracy theory which has been promoted by anti-vaxxers that the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, faked getting a flu vaccine. She did the usual politician-rolls-up-sleeve-for-shot routine, but the administer of the flu shot was so gentle, and fast, Palaszczuk didn\u2019t react, and some of the cameras missed it. So a photographer asked to re-stage the shot, which happened, and now people are using the staged photo as proof for their insane conspiracies. Palaszczuk got the shot. Get yours, if you can. If you need some easy iso cooking inspo, and want to be entertained at the same time, and haven\u2019t seen this, you should check out Nat\u2019s What I Reckon: He agrees with my oma that adding milk to bolognese is an excellent idea. Try it, if you haven\u2019t. Just to let you know, because I know how much the below the line chat means \u2013 we\u2019ll be turning off comments at about 3.45pm, when our exceptionally hard working moderator finishes her shift. The Australian government chief nursing and midwifery officer, Alison McMillan, will deliver the national Covid update today. She\u2019ll present that from 3.15pm. Michael Gunner then laid out the Northern Territory moving to stage two: Two weeks later, from noon Friday 15 May, Stage 2 begins. This includes simple and safe indoor events and activities that can be done in less than two hours and with physical distancing. Restaurants and cafes, pubs, bars. But for those venues it must include the consumption of food for this initial period. So, essentially, meal and a drink. Shopping centre food courts, gyms and other indoor training, like F45 and Crossfit, Pilates, yoga, dance lessons, things like that, indoor religious worship, libraries, beauty therapy for non-facial services, like getting your nails done. It will also include organised outdoor training activities for clubs and teams without physical contact. For businesses and organisations that open or expand operations under these rules, they will need to have a Covid-19 management plan in place. This will be a simple checklist to show how your venue can adhere to physical distancing, hygiene and cleaning principles. Michael Gunner has laid out the relaxed restrictions for the (best) territory: From noon tomorrow, restrictions will be adjusted on outdoor activities where physical distancing can be maintained. This includes playgrounds, pools, water parks and skate parks, exercising and personal training outdoors. Non-contact outdoor sports such as golf, tennis, shooting and athletics. Outdoor gatherings, including religious gatherings, weddings and funerals. Visiting parks and camping, and fishing - you can go fishing with people not from your household, so long as physical distancing is maintained. You can fish with your mates again. Tomorrow\u2019s changes also include real estate open inspections and auctions, and gatherings in your home with physical distancing. So, this weekend is set to be pretty great outdoors. Parks, playgrounds, pools, camping, fishing, golfing, getting married, if you can organise it that quick - take your pick. NBN Co has extended its additional capacity offer to internet service providers for another two months: NBN Co has also extended its offer to increase download data limits for its standard Sky Muster service to 90GB of data on average for another two months. This offer, which came into effect at the end of March, provides an additional 45GB for each standard Sky Muster service at no additional cost to internet providers. \u2018We are extending these offers by another two billing periods because we know how crucial it is for the nation to have access to reliable and fast broadband services as Australians continue to work, study and be entertained at home,\u2019 said Brad Whitcomb, chief customer officer-residential at NBN Co. That\u2019s because demand during the day is settling into a new high: For the week from Monday 20 April to Sunday 26 April, peak download throughput (the measure of data flowing through the nbn\u2122 access network) during daytime business hours, increased by 18 per cent to 9.2Tbps compared to the last week of February. The peak download throughput on the main wholesale service recorded in the early evening hours for the week beginning 20 April increased 17 per cent to 11.5Tbps compared to the pre-Covid-19 baseline, while the peak download throughput on the main wholesale service in the evening busy hours increased by 13 per cent to 12.5Tbps. Services Australia never told Stuart Robert the MyGov website had suffered a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, the Covid-19 Senate committee has heard. The government services minister made the incendiary claim on 23 March after the website crashed, before rescinding the claim in parliament. Under questioning by Labor\u2019s Murray Watt, Services Australia chief executive Rebecca Skinner said the agency had only ever told Robert the DDoS alarms had gone off and that the agency was in an environment where such an attack could be expected. She acknowledged the agency had \u201cnot categorically\u201d told Robert there had been an attack. Robert had fended off reporters\u2019 questions about the MyGov outage by stating the website had not crashed, but instead had fallen victim to a cyber attack. Skinner noted Robert went on to correct himself in parliament. Skinner also said the agency had been \u201csurprised\u201d by the large queues at Centrelink that week in March, prompted by increased lockdown and the government\u2019s boost to welfare payments. But she rejected suggestions the agency was unprepared, saying it would not have been economical to design the MyGov website to cope with such unprecedented traffic. Mark McGowan, who is in high-vis today (that\u2019s how you know things are slowly returning to normalish, because politicians are back on the hustle), says WA will extend its state of emergency for another two weeks. That new declaration will expire on 13 May, when it will be extended (most likely) again. That just means that authorities can direct people to move on, etc. Spoke too soon - I have just seen this report from AAP: A West Australian school principal has been stood down after she wrote to parents asking that only certain children attend class amid coronavirus concerns. Halls Head College principal Bronwyn White reportedly sent the letter last week, calling for only the children of essential workers or those unable to stay at home to turn up at the independent public school, south of Perth, for the first week of term 2 on Wednesday. She cited concerns about cleaning supplies and being able to apply physical distancing requirements, saying only Year 11 and 12 students should return for weeks two and three, then issued a retraction as the letter was in breach of education department guidelines. Comment has been sought from the department. Western Australian Secondary School Executives Association president Armando Giglia told ABC radio the department was going through usual processes. \u201cBureaucracy is bureaucracy,\u201d Mr Giglia said on Thursday. \u201cShe had the best interest of the students at heart \u2013 nobody denies that.\u201d We haven\u2019t heard too much more on schools this morning, but Tanya Plibersek had a chat to the ABC about how she is going with remote learning for her kids, as well as the messages parents are receiving: Confusion and, to be honest with you, a little bit of frustration. I\u2019ve discovered that I\u2019m not the most patient distance educator on the planet. Look it\u2019s a very confusing time for parents in particular, they\u2019re hearing one message from the federal government and a different message from their state government, and parents just don\u2019t know what the right thing is to do. The prime minister is urging them to send their kids to school and the premiers are saying please keep your kids at home. No parent wants to be in that circumstance and the principals and school staff who have been working so hard over the holidays, and the weeks before the holidays, to prepare for distance education are tearing their hair out. They\u2019re the meat in the sandwich here. Trying to support parents who are sending their kids to school, particularly those key workers who\u2019ve got no other option but to send their kids to school and they\u2019re caught between different messages from the prime minister and the premier of their state or territory. No one wants to be in that position. Andrew Forrest, another WA magnate with significant financial interests in China, who has also been calling for Australia to calm its farm over Beijing, spent the morning shrugging off criticisms he blindsided Greg Hunt by inviting a Chinese consul representative to his press conference yesterday. He told the Seven Network Hunt looked pissed off because of the media, not the situation: Yes, the minister walked out looking a bit grumpy, and the media jumped all over that. He looked a bit grumpy because a journo almost tried to trip him up to stop him leaving and ask him a heap of questions, and he refused, and said, no, you can take that up with China, or Andrew and me outside. He walked out like he meant to walk out. But that had nothing to do with the press conference. Over on our international coronavirus blog, Helen Sullivan reports Donald Trump\u2019s claims that China wants him to lose the 2020 election: US president Donald Trump, in an Oval Office interview with Reuters, has said he is looking into different options for the consequences China might face for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said. Trump said that coronavirus has \u201cupset very badly\u201d the US trade deal with China, and that China \u201cwill do anything they can to have me lose in 2020\u201d. Trump does not see the 2020 election as being a referendum on his handling of the pandemic, he said. For all the international news on the pandemic, you can head here: Anthony Albanese has released his official statement on Mike Kelly\u2019s resignation: The Federal Parliament will be poorer for the retirement of Mike Kelly as the Member for Eden Monaro. Mike Kelly is a great Australian. He has served our nation in uniform and he has served his community in our national Parliament. Mike\u2019s retirement is a direct result of renal health issues sustained in connection with his service in Somalia, Iraq and Timor Leste. He has been struggling with these health problems for some time and is retiring because of the heavy demands of servicing his large and diverse electorate. Mike is putting his community ahead of himself. Mike served the nation for 20 years in the Australian Army before retiring as a Colonel. He won the seat of Eden Monaro for Labor from the Coalition not once, but twice. In Government, Mike held five Parliamentary Secretary portfolios. He also served as Minister for Defence Materiel. I will miss Mike as part of the Federal Labor team. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I wish Mike, his wife Rachelle and his family the best for the future. Working from home means a lot of people are doing a lot more to keep everything afloat. To everyone who has taken on additional duties to keep their loved ones\u2019 heads above water \u2013 we thank you. Some jobseekers may miss out on the final instalment of the $550 coronavirus supplement at the end September, the Covid-19 committee has heard. Although it was touted as a six-month temporary boost by the government, the way the legislation has been drafted means the fortnightly additional supplement will start on 27 April and will end on 24 September. Some recipients will only receive their first payment from May, depending on when they report their income to Centrelink each fortnight, the Covid-19 Senate committee heard. These people will not receive a further payment beyond 24 September, meaning they will receive the supplement for a shorter period than six months. \u201cWhat that says to me is people will not get the six months if they are still on jobseeker [by then],\u201d said the Greens senator Rachel Siewert. The DSS secretary, Kathryn Campbell, told the committee: \u201cThe legislation says the 24th of September unless there is some change.\u201d But she said that she assumed that the person was \u201cstill on jobseeker\u201d, adding that the government was determined to get people back into work. Campbell acknowledged there \u201cmay have been some confusion\u201d about the length of the supplement. The West Australian newspaper has continued its run of \u201cEXCLUSIVE\u201d interviews with Kerry Stokes (who owns the paper), this time to air the magnate\u2019s views on why Australia needs to mend ties with China. I suppose that would have nothing to do with his significant financial investments in China. Anyone interested in the new jobseeker data can find it here. The Eden-Monaro byelection could be a three-way contest. The first of the funerals for the four police officers who were killed on Melbourne\u2019s eastern freeway will be held today. Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor will be farewelled at the Police Academy at 1pm. Under the physical distance rules, only her family will attend, with the funeral to be broadcast to colleagues. Victoria will hold a memorial for the police officers once restrictions are lifted. Police and emergency services have been given permission to flash their vehicle lights in tribute to the their colleagues. Treat yo self. Eat the cookie. AAP story has a story on how we are spending our money while at home \u2013 it seems every day is now spa day: Australians have turned into a nation of beauty-obsessed, wannabe chefs with little care for how our breath smells, if spending habits during the coronavirus lockdown are anything to go by. The country has been in partial shutdown since March to slow the spread of the deadly virus. In that time, toilet paper and dried pasta flew off the shelves. Supermarket chain Coles reported an increase in purchases of at-home products such as hair colour, but a downturn in some everyday items. \u201cAs customers increasingly work from home, we are seeing less demand for packaged salads, while social distancing has led to a downturn in sales of gums and mints,\u201d a Coles spokeswoman said. Australians may care less about their breath but they are not neglecting their faces despite beauticians and spas being shut down. Department store Myer, which closed its physical doors on March 27 and won\u2019t reopen until May, reports a 520 per cent increase year-on-year in beauty product sales and a whopping 600 per cent rise in skincare purchases. Online cosmetic store Adore Beauty has seen a 61.2 per cent increase in the sale of face masks in the past month and 62.7 per cent in exfoliators. As we pamper ourselves during the pandemic, we are doing so in comfort, with online retailer The Iconic recording an 800 per cent surge in slipper sales in two weeks. Myer also reported homeware sales were up 260 per cent compared with April 2019, showing the coronavirus may have created a nation of interior designers. People are also cooking up a storm with cafes and restaurants closed. Myer had a 170.9 per cent year-on-year rise in entertainment sales driven by cooking appliances, with some of the best performing products being coffee machines and mixers. Coles has seen a rise in purchases of vegetable, such potatoes, onions and carrots, while larger volumes of broccoli, lettuce and cabbage are being grown. Woolworths said after disinfectants, bread mix was the second most popular purchase, with demand growing by 88 per cent between March 18 and April 14. The supermarket chain also saw sales of dried herbs and spices rise by more than 70 per cent, dried soup mixes more than doubling. And Woolworths recorded a 1,000 per cent rise in demand for hand sanitiser compared with this time last year. Consumer group Choice said the results of individual retailers were seen across the country and overall, Australians were buying up on coffee machines, benchtop cookers and renovation-style content, as well as printers and antivirus software as more people worked from home. Victoria\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, says police checks are still happening: In terms of police checks we are now up to, since they started Operation Sentinel, up to 32,000 checks undertaken by Victorian police and in 24 hours they undertook 656 checks and issued 43 fines, which is both a mix of those lower numbers and a mixture of the greater use of discretion combined with people continuing to do the right thing. It does appear to be more people out but people continue to do all of the social distancing and follow the rules and the directives set by the chief health officer. Victoria is expanding its hotel accommodation scheme (where frontline health workers can stay in a hotel instead of going home between shifts and isolate away from families) to frontline emergency service workers and community workers. From AAP: Victoria has recorded seven new cases of coronavirus, with more expected to emerge after authorities revealed a cluster in an aged care facility. Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton told 3AW Radio on Thursday a cluster at the Hawthorn Grange aged care facility was under investigation, with extensive testing being conducted. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get on top of that. We\u2019ve identified those additional cases and tested across the board for residents and staff,\u201d Mr Sutton said. \u201c(Aged care facilities) are places where you absolutely need to act down on it immediately and that really means extensive testing, including individuals with no symptoms.\u201d The state\u2019s effort to test up to 100,000 people in two weeks has seen six new mobile coronavirus testing sites open across Melbourne on Thursday. The seven new cases bring the state\u2019s total tally to 1361, while the death toll remains at 18 after a woman in her 80s died on Tuesday. The announcement of a new cluster comes after two dozen staff at a hospital in Melbourne\u2019s west were put in self-quarantine. A patient who attended Sunshine Hospital\u2019s emergency department last Thursday tested positive for coronavirus. The patient required urgent surgery but had no known symptoms of COVID-19. The staff then developed a mild cough over the weekend and undertook a test for the virus, returning a positive result. Western Health\u2019s executive director operations Natasha Toohey says 24 hospital staff have entered self-quarantine as a precaution, with testing also underway. No other patients had been in close contact with the infected person \u201cThe safety of our staff is paramount and Western Health took immediate action in response to this positive result,\u201d Ms Toohey said. The Labor leader says the Coalition starts as favourite in the coming Eden-Monaro byelection. Kelly won the seat off the Coalition, lost it and won it again. It\u2019s not an easy electorate for Labor to hold \u2013 Kelly, despite his popularity in the region, only just held on at the last election. Anthony Albanese on Mike Kelly: We have seen today in the way that he has handled this difficult decision exactly why he has had the faith of the people of Eden-Monaro. He perhaps, has downplayed how tough the last six months has been for him. Ten surgical and medical procedures he has been through. I have spoken to him throughout that period and I know how difficult he has found it. But at the same time, every time I have spoken to him, even on the days where he is about to undergo a procedure, he has focused on the people of the electorate of Eden-Monaro. And his work that he did during the bushfire crisis was quite extraordinary, the commitment that he showed. The exclusion of disability pensioners and carers from the coronavirus supplement has generated a lot of frustration among some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people. We first covered the issue here. At the Covid-19 committee hearing, Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher asked the Department of Social Services why they were excluded from the $550-a-fortnight supplement. She gives the example that a single parent of a six-year-old receiving parenting payment now receives more than a carer of a six-year-old child with a disability. Campbell\u2019s argument is that the coronavirus supplement was designed to further support people who were also in paid work or looking for work. Asked if there was consideration given to applying the supplement to DSP recipients, Campbell says no. \u201cDSP recipients weren\u2019t generally in the workforce,\u201d she said. About 9% of disability pensioners and 7% of carer payment recipients also had earnings in December 2019, government data shows. That compares to 35% of people receiving parenting payment single. Except it seems, this option. Mike Kelly: I have to say, I know another phrase around here is \u201cIf you want friends, get a dog\u201d in politics, but I haven\u2019t found that. I don\u2019t have any enemies I have made in politics and I have friends on both sides of the chamber. You know, in my army career I stared into the face of true evil, whether it was genocidal warlords in Somalia or murdering militia in Timor or war criminals in Bosnia or staring into Saddam Hussein\u2019s face and the dirty dozen, so-called, in Iraq. So it kept me in the situation where I had a good perspective on all of this. And so I treat people on the other side of the chamber who I find is decent human beings, and having the national interest at heart, as I find that way. And I do count the number of them as friends. We may have deep disagreements about policy issues but, you know, I am quite happy to call some of them friends, and I feel grateful for that experience as well. And certainly my caucus colleagues. But now, of course, the focus has to be on all of us pulling together to face the crisis we are in right now, and I think for Eden-Monaro, I\u2019m sorry to be putting you to a byelection at the moment, but I do believe, you know, that with the restrictions and a process of being eased in the months ahead that it will be feasible to hold a byelection in that space as well. On his political career, Mike Kelly says: I have had a lot of ups and downs in politics, of course, as everyone does. I want to thank in particular Kevin Rudd for his support, his intention in making me defence minister, his backing to get the centre up and running. I was very proud to be part of that. Julia Gillard for making me minister for defence materiel. Bill Shorten\u2019s support for giving us a native shipbuilding industry and making that a bipartisan commitment and supporting me to be in the shadow security committee, and also the parliamentary joint committee on security and intelligence. That has been a wonderful experience of working together collegiality with colleagues across the chamber in the interests of national security and our nation generally, and it\u2019s been a really rewarding and enjoyable experience, along with working with my good friend the member for Berowra on the prevention of suicide, a subject close to my heart, and really supporting the work we have done together in that space. So those are possibly the most rewarding experiences in recent years. So thank you to all of those involved in that, and to Albo for continuing to support me in the shadow National Security Committee and the PJCIS. I\u2019m watching the Senate committee into Covid-19, which is examining social policy today. The agencies that will appear today are the Department of Social Services, Services Australia and the National Disability Insurance Agency. Already, we have some news: the Department of Social Services has revealed the number of jobseeker payment recipients increased from 815,000 on 28 February to 1.3 million on 24 April. The department is forecasting 1.7 million by September. \u201cIt is a significant number,\u201d said the department secretary, Kathryn Campbell. She said the current figures were \u201cbroadly in line\u201d what the department was expecting. Here is his entire statement: It is with great sadness that I have to announce that I am resigning as the Member for Eden-Monaro effective from Thursday 30 April. This has been an intensely difficult, gut wrenching decision. I contested the last Federal Election in good faith with the intention of serving the full term of this Parliament and beyond. However, I\u2019ve had serious renal health issues to work through over these last six months, related to my former Army service, which has required ten medical procedures. These issues are ongoing and I have another procedure to come in the next few months. Added to this is the recent classification by the Department of Veterans Affairs that I am permanently impaired due to my deteriorating osteoarthritis condition. This situation has made it impossible to fulfil the challenging duties that the community in Eden Monaro rightly expects of its member. At the same time, my wife is also having health issues and I need to provide more support to her than I have been able to. I regret that my resignation will result in a by-election that will be an inconvenience for the community. I hope, however, that this will also be an opportunity to bring to the forefront the extreme issues that are confronting us through the combination of the catastrophic bushfires and now the COVID-19 situation. In this way I hope Eden Monaro will get the extra attention it needs and deserves right now. The electorate office staff will remain in place to support all those who need help, through to the declaration of the by-election poll. I want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Eden-Monaro for allowing me to serve them throughout my time as Member. It has been the greatest privilege of my life. This community and region mean everything to me and I was not prepared to work on at a reduced capacity, given all the challenges ahead of us. I intend to keep fighting for our region and the issues that concern me, including our security and climate change challenges. I will also stay closely in touch with our ongoing recovery effort and the community organisations I am involved with. I wish the Australian Labor Party and our leader Anthony Albanese all the very best for the next election where I am sure they will form the next Government of Australia. I will continue to be a Labor man for the rest of my life. I wish all my parliamentary colleagues all the best in their endeavours. Mike Kelly said he would not be able to cope mentally with not being able to serve his community as it deserves: My whole life of 36 years of public service has been body and soul into whatever I\u2019ve done, and I\u2019m sort of paying a bit of a heavy price for that at the moment. But I would have continued on if I felt that I could have done the job to the extent to which it has to be done in Eden-Monaro. It is not the seat of Wentworth, it is larger than 66 countries, Eden-Monaro, these days. It is 42,000 sq km of rough terrain, difficult weather, incredibly diverse, incredibly challenging, where the community that is spread out and really requires you to be on the road a hell of a lot, thousands and thousands and thousands of kilometres. And I just can\u2019t do that physically any more. He thanks his family, his friends, his colleagues and his medical team for all their support. Mike Kelly is officially announcing his retirement. Anthony Albanese introduced him and said he was proud to call him a friend \u2013 which would continue. Kelly says he has been classified as permanently impaired by the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs because of a severe illness which originated when he was serving in the Middle East and he can no longer do his job effectively: People are aware, I think, that I have been going through some health issues. These are all service-related, going back to my time in the army. On the one hand, I suffered some severe episodes of dehydration which led to some renal issues, and of course, in the last few weeks the Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs has classified me as permanently impaired due to deteriorating osteoarthritis situation, which has been exacerbated by the nature of the work in Eden-Monaro. The renal situation was at times quite serious. I\u2019ve had 10 procedures in the last six months. In the bushfires and coronavirus situation have in some ways masked my inability to be on the road and be out in Eden-Monaro as much as I should have or would have liked to have been. Fortunately it\u2019s been possible for me to do my work, you know, remotely and online and on the phone through the bushfires and the rest of it. But we are coming to a time now when restrictions are likely to be eased, and it will be time for a member for Eden-Monaro to be on that road again. So the timing for me is about enabling that new member to do that work, to prevent myself from being in the position where I would let down my community, my caucus members and my leader by not being able to do this job to the full extent that it should be done, that the community demands and deserves. Andrew Forrest, who has seemed to have taken on a mantle as Australia\u2019s unofficial spokesman on China, has tried to shrug off criticisms of his press conference performance yesterday. He was asked about bringing along the Victoria Chinese consul general Zhou Long in the middle of a diplomatic spat, without letting the minister, Greg Hunt, know when on Sunrise this morning: China has really stepped up so I brought the Chinese consulate along because they\u2019ve helped Australia. Mums and dads and boys and girls are now able to get tested across our country. I brought the consulate along when we broke the back of the PPE crisis in Perth so I brought him along again in Melbourne. Here is AAP\u2019s story on it: Billionaire Twiggy Forrest is facing criticism for inviting the Chinese consul general to a press conference with Greg Hunt without the minister\u2019s knowledge. The relationship between the two countries is strained, with China openly criticising Australia which is calling for an international inquiry into the origins of coronavirus. Mr Hunt and Mr Forrest held a joint press conference on Wednesday to announce the mining magnate\u2019s foundation had sourced 10 million COVID-19 testing kits. But Mr Forrest also invited Victoria Consul General Long Zhou to address the media. He said the diplomat\u2019s attendance was \u201ca gesture of appreciation and friendship between our two great countries\u201d. Mr Long took the opportunity to talk up China\u2019s response to the pandemic. \u201cThe virus has, knows no ideology, border or race and in face of the epidemic the testings of all countries are closely interlinked. We\u2019re all in this together,\u201d Mr Long said. Several conservative government backbenchers, including Matt Canavan and Andrew Hastie, have criticised Mr Forrest\u2019s action. \u201cThis guy drops out of the sky in his private jet and enables the Chinese Communist Party to ambush a Commonwealth press conference. Yeah, we\u2019re not happy,\u201d Mr Hastie told The Australian. Former foreign minister Julie Bishop says by being on the United Nations security council China has an obligation to support an investigation into the virus, as the pandemic is a threat to international peace and security. \u201cThis is no time for there to be threats or coercion by any nation against another because we are in the midst of a global pandemic,\u201d she told Seven\u2019s Sunrise on Thursday. \u201cThis pandemic has been a threat to international security because of the profound disruption to the global economy. There must be an investigation into how the virus got into human populations so we can be better prepared.\u201d Send us your stories! Victoria Health has just announced this: Six new mobile coronavirus testing sites across Melbourne will open today, as part of the Victorian Government\u2019s blitz to test up to 100,000 people in two weeks. The new sites located at Bunnings West Footscray, Pacific Werribee, Pacific Epping, Watergardens Town Centre, Westfield Fountain Gate and Bayside Shopping Centre in Frankston are due to begin conducting tests this morning. It comes after four new mobile coronavirus testing sites opened yesterday at Chadstone, Doncaster, Highpoint and Northland shopping centres \u2013 bringing the total so far to 10. Jobseeker and other social safety net payments and the response are the focus of today\u2019s Covid Senate select committee hearing. That includes Stuart Robert\u2019s \u201cmy bad\u201d hack that wasn\u2019t. The national disability insurance scheme heads will also be at the meeting, where they will be asked about what is missing for those living with a disability in this response, or caring for someone with a disability. There is an easy answer to that straight off the bat \u2013 the Covid supplement. Queensland has recorded no new cases. Anthony Albanese will stand up with Mike Kelly at 10am to officially announce the Labor MP\u2019s resignation. You\u2019ll find the Tasmanian Health report into the north-west outbreak here. It is Senate Covid committee day. The Tasmanian report will add fuel to the fire for the tit-for-tat between Peter Dutton and Kristina Keneally: (For some context, Keneally has previously called Dutton\u2019s criticisms and focus on her \u201cunhinged\u201d, which is one of the reasons he used it here. And for the record, Dutton\u2019s criticism that Keneally is attacking \u201cuniformed officers\u201d of Border Force leaves out that it was Dutton who changed the department to first of all create \u201cBorder Force\u201d, secondly make them \u201cofficers\u201d and thirdly, put them in uniforms.\u201d) The Labor MP says it wasn\u2019t the choice he wanted to make, but his health determined it for him: I found it to be the greatest privilege in my life to represent his community because Eden-Monaro is deep in my blood and my heart. This region has been my family story for over 160 years, you know, the pioneers who helped to build the region. My great, great, great grandfather built the Tathra wharf and my great-great-grandfather ran the Bega cheese co-op and my great-grandfather ran for Eden-Monaro in 1940 and was a big part of fighting the battles during the Great Depression and other things, so it was a proud part of my life to be part of that family tradition in serving the region, and so to have two lay down that torch is very emotionally charged and distressing. Mike Kelly spoke to the ABC about his \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d decision to retire: What we will do now is put Eden-Monaro squarely at the front and centre of the national debate. It will be number one on the radar, it will be a battleground for the policy ideas we have to now have in terms of what we do for climate change, but also importantly for the recovery process through all of this. No region has suffered more through the double whammy, if you like, of climate change, bushfires and the coronavirus situation than Eden-Monaro, so it will be an opportunity for our issues to be front and centre for our particular trauma to be addressed and it will be our competition for who can provide those answers for our community. There are a lot of things that have been slipping from consciousness and below the radar that really need urgent attention, so by falling on my sword now I think I\u2019m doing the best in the region to make sure we are front and centre in the debate and we get the commitments that we need. It\u2019s been incredibly gut-wrenching. Just one person in Tasmania was diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Peter Gutwein says the government will be taking the lessons from the report into the north-west Tasmanian outbreak seriously: I do want to say that what this report will demonstrate very clearly is that most likely the Ruby Princess is the root cause of our problems on the north-west coast. In terms of how this highly infectious disease has then been spread, to be frank, it is something that we will never know. What we do know is that healthcare workers caught this, healthcare workers who would have been doing their very best to serve Tasmanians and to look after their patients and, as a result of that spread we have had the north-west cluster, the north-west outbreak, and importantly then as a government with the support of our health experts took the responses and the actions that we did. But I would say to everybody, don\u2019t use this report to blame people, use this report to ensure that we learn and as a state that we go forward and, importantly, we take every step that we possibly can to keep people safe. Peter Gutwein repeats that \u201cno one is to blame\u201d for the north-west outbreak. What we have is a dedicated health workforce, what we have is a highly infectious disease and, unfortunately, we have had an outbreak and we have done everything that we possibly can to get on top of that outbreak. There are lessons ... though, from all of this and by all of us I mean the entire state of Tasmania. One point that I do want to make is that sometimes our strong work ethic can be our worst enemy. It is a stark reminder to us that this virus moves quickly, that this virus, once somebody has been infected, can demonstrate no symptoms at all and it\u2019s important that whether people work in a hospital, whether they work in a manufacturing plant, whether they work in a shearing shed, the lessons from this report are such that we should all take on board that we need to ensure that no matter how good we feel, if we have a sniffle we shouldn\u2019t turn up to work. If we have any concern whatsoever then we should take the precautionary principles. We must continue to be cautious and we must continue to vigilant. Tasmania\u2019s premier, Peter Gutwein, says no passenger was to blame, and no health worker was to blame, but the north-west Covid outbreak started with the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Another woman, an 86-year-old, died in Tasmanian yesterday. She had been diagnosed with Covid-19. Hers was the 12th death in Tasmania. Eleven people have died in the state\u2019s north-west. Gutwein: Last night when I was thinking about how to outline this report today, and I would ask everybody to consider this as well, I thought that it was important to actually take a walk in the steps of the issues of those that have been Ruby Princess passengers but also those who have been healthcare workers. This is simply a case of people going about their lives, going about their jobs, while this dreadful set of circumstances has ensued and has wreaked havoc and misery on so many people. Hard-working and passionate healthcare workers continue to turn up to serve their community. What the report will indicate in many cases, unaware that they were carrying symptoms. In fact, most of them were unaware that they were carrying symptoms. Now, we know that our state is not immune to the virus and unfortunately, like the rest of the country, we are not immune to outbreak. What we do know is that this insidious disease is one that spreads very quickly, is highly infectious and the learnings that we take from this report today will enable us to consider our systems to ensure that we work even harder to keep people safe. As expected, Mike Kelly will announce his retirement this morning. We\u2019ll bring you that announcement, when it is (officially) made, when it happens. ANZ is this morning the second big-four bank to reveal a coronavirus-ravaged half-year result, telling the market profit was down by 51% for the six months to the end of March to $1.55bn. Coincidentally, this is the same percentage fall recorded by its rival NAB a few days ago. ANZ said it slashed the value of its loan book by $1.67bn, with just over $1bn of that due to the effects of the coronavirus crisis. It has also cancelled its dividend in line with strong suggestions from the prudential regulator \u2013 something NAB did not do. ANZ also cut the book value of a group of Asian banks in which it owns shares by $815m, \u201clargely due to the impact Covid-19 is having in those markets\u201d. These banks, which include the Malaysian bank linked to the 1MDB scandal, Ambank, have long been troubled investments for ANZ and it has been trying to sell its stakes. The cossbench senator Rex Patrick says he put in a freedom of information request for the advice the prime minister\u2019s department had at the beginning of the pandemic, and was denied. He says the government is being hypocritical by demanding transparency from China but not being open itself: The government has piled on every exemption category it can think of \u2013 international relations, national security, internal government deliberations and cabinet business \u2013 to withhold every word of five briefings provided to the prime minister between the 1st and 31st of January. This was the critical time in which the government first received reports of the coronavirus outbreak, and first learned of human-to human transmission, but decided to only screen flights from Wuhan and hand leaflets to passengers arriving from China. The Australian government is right to seek an international inquiry into the Covid-19 pandemic, and China needs to be much more transparent and cooperative. But our government\u2019s position would be much stronger and much less hypocritical if they committed to full transparency themselves and didn\u2019t engage in bureaucratic obstruction and obfuscation.\u201d The prime minister can fix this by directing his department to release the briefings. He should do so now. He needs to practice what he preaches. The expert medical committee will be advising the national cabinet this week on an exit strategy. But Dr Nick Coatsworth says there are still concerns a second wave will strike: It\u2019s fair to say that a second wave is a concern and the reason why all Australians will not remain complacent. I know that our behaviours will continue to remain the same. We\u2019ll maintain our 1.5-metre distance, we won\u2019t be shaking hands or hugging, we\u2019ll be performing hand hygiene. As our mobility increases, our behaviour must stay the stay. And then monitoring the number of Covid-19 cases closely, breaking down the clusters, breaking down the transmission chains very quickly and increasing the number of tests. All those things together mean we aim to avoid or minimise any second wave. The deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth (he shares the role with Prof Paul Kelly) says he doesn\u2019t expect there to be a national lifting of restrictions: I think it would be difficult to take an entirely national approach to this. The broad principles are set by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, going to national cabinet, and agreed upon at national cabinet. Then it\u2019s very clear that the epidemic is in different phases. Previously, on the show, we heard about the Northern Territory. That has had no community cases. For the Northern Territory to have the same measures that Victoria or New South Wales have would make no sense. Western Australia has 60% of their school students back in public schools as of yesterday. So we are a continent. It can be confusing seeing different states doing different things, but it is a necessary consequence of the federation having an epidemic that\u2019s behaving somewhat differently across the country. It is Gladys Berejiklian o\u2019clock. The NSW premier says there have been two new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. That is great news ahead of restrictions being (slightly) eased tomorrow. Essentially, the definition of \u201ccare\u201d is being expanded, to include two adult visitors to your home (you can take young children if you need to) but physical distancing remains in place. Berejiklian: We want to look at new opportunities in the future to ease restrictions. I have confidence everyone will respect what we put in place from tomorrow so we can all move forward together in a pleasing way. That\u2019s certainly my hope and my anticipation for the month of May. As you know, three big changes in May. Schools will be going back in a considerable way, obviously the restrictions on visiting others, and again on that point, can I stress, have conversations in your family, have conversations with your friends, if you\u2019re visiting people who are vulnerable, if you\u2019re visiting older people, you may choose not to visit based on your circumstances and theirs. Please make sure you have those conversations. And obviously, as we\u2019ve been advising, as we can tell through the data we\u2019re getting, a number of retail outlets previously closed have chosen to reopen or commence reopening. Polly Waffle is back! And this time it is the chocolate, not what comes out of MPs\u2019 mouths (because that never stopped). But Karen Andrews will announce who gets a slice of the $215m \u201cmanufacturing modernisation fund\u201d, which includes $1m for the return of the chocolate. Bring back the original Milo bar, you cowards. Also, the Eden-Monaro MP, Mike Kelly, is expected to announce his retirement today. The Labor MP has struggled with his health for some time, after he became grievously ill while serving in the Middle East. Anthony Albanese is expected to stand by his side as he makes the announcement. Scott Morrison is fairly chill about the Coalition\u2019s chances \u2013 byelections don\u2019t usually result in a swapped party, and sitting governments always struggle in those contests, but the NSW Nationals leader, John Barillo, has had his eye on the federal seat for a while and is quite popular in areas of the vast region, so who knows. If you are looking for a break from Covid news, Daniel Hurst has this for you, from an interview conducted on the A Rational Fear podcast, hosted by Dan Ilic: Josh Frydenberg appeared on Sky after dark last night to ram home the point Mathias Cormann and Scott Morrison had already made on Wednesday: the jobseeker (formerly Newstart) rate which was doubled to $1,100 at the start of the Covid-19 crisis will not have that increase extended. Forty dollars a day is not enough to live on when there is a pandemic, apparently. But it is fine as Australia navigates life after a pandemic. Frydenberg: We don\u2019t want these payments going out the door for a day longer than they have to. We\u2019re very conscious that these programs will end when it\u2019s appropriate to do so. But the tax cuts are still going ahead and company tax cuts are back on the agenda. There is money for that. After decades of being told it can\u2019t be done, we found out that governments can spend as much as they want on social enrichment programs, with a flick of the pen \u2013 but politics will always find a way to nose back in. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic. We\u2019re expecting more news today about easing restrictions in some parts of Australia, including in the Northern Territory, while the Tasmanian premier is expected to announce an exit plan. Creditors of the grounded airline Virgin Australia are also set to meet today. Here\u2019s a brief summary of yesterday\u2019s major developments: Australia has a total of 6,746 confirmed cases. Ninety people have died across the country from Covid-19. There was another death at Sydney\u2019s beleaguered Newmarch House aged care home. Twelve people have now died there. More than 3 million Australians have downloaded the government\u2019s Covidsafe app. The degenerating relationship between Canberra and Beijing deteriorated further, with tit-for-tat bickering, trade threats and a gate-crashed press conference, all emerging out of Australia\u2019s proposal for an independent inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 outbreak. There will be more on schools, and what a restriction exit strategy looks like. The deputy chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly yesterday said 11 May was the target, which would fit with the June timetable the prime minister has set. That means, if things still look good, then we\u2019ll start hearing how restaurants, gyms and domestic travel (among other small freedoms) will open up in two weeks. We\u2019ll cover the day as it happens. Thanks again for joining us. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

Patten told Raab he was concerned to see China\u2019s ambassador to the UK engaging in \u201cwolf diplomacy\u201d by denying there had been a cover-up about the origins and early spread of the virus and implying that \u201crespected politicians\u201d in the UK and abroad were \u201cpeddling lies and disinformation\u201d. He said there was an overwhelming case in support of \u201cestablishing as soon as possible a multilateral expert mission to Wuhan to find out exactly what happened there\u201d. \u201cSince Chinese communists are adamant that they have nothing to hide, they would presumably welcome such an inquiry,\u201d Patten wrote.

      "body": "<p>There were three great pandemics in the 20th century. The influenza pandemic of 1918 and the HIV pandemic during the 1980s and 1990s get the most attention. But the third, tuberculosis, was the deadliest by far and in many communities, it\u2019s not yet over.</p> <p>TB has much to teach us about the tools that can help to eradicate the current pandemic, and what happens when those tools aren\u2019t even tried. The disease killed more than <a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-releases-strategic-plan-address-tuberculosis-research\">one billion people between 1800 and 2000</a>. Although it is caused by a bacterium rather than a virus, the disease shares some frightening similarities with this current coronavirus.</p> <p>The pathogen that causes TB is airborne, transmitted from person to person in households and social spaces. People with TB spread the bacteria to new individuals when they breathe. Only half of those with TB display symptoms, allowing the deadly disease to spread undetected. And like today, the most vulnerable people are hit the hardest \u2014 older people, those with underlying conditions and people living in poverty.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-in-africa-what-happens-next\">Coronavirus in Africa: what happens next?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A century ago, TB was a terrifying reality for people all over the world. One in every nine deaths in the United States in 1906 was caused by tuberculosis (adjusted to our current population levels, this would be the equivalent of 540,000 Americans dying of TB every year). The disease killed as many people as cancer and diabetes, causing profound damage to economic and social life.</p> <p>Yet by the 1970s, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm\">rates of tuberculosis</a> had dropped markedly in the US and other wealthy countries. How was this achieved? With the help of diagnostic treatments, the US pursued a successful strategy called \u201csearch, treat and prevent\u201d. The key innovation wasn\u2019t drugs (although antibiotics helped eradicate the disease, the first antibiotic treatment for TB was demonstrated in the 1940s, by which time <a href=\"https://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/HistoricalStatisticsoftheUnitedStates1789-1945.pdf\">cases of the disease</a> had already fallen to around a fifth of 1906 levels). What made a huge difference was a community-based approach where people joined together to stop the spread of disease.</p> <p>The first step was freeing the sick of social and financial burdens. This allowed them to come forward for testing, care and support, without having to keep working and spreading the disease in the process. To this day, some of the only free health services available to everyone in the US are those relating to tuberculosis.</p> <p>Health authorities in the US went door to door searching for those who were sick and tracing people they had contacted. They treated sick people with food, medicine and shelter, and offered preventative therapies to stop others from becoming sick. Free TB care was only made possible through stable financing and community support, and cooperation between governments, employers, unions, faith groups and communities. Government financing and a community-based strategy were the key advances that made it possible to eradicate TB.</p> <p>But in many poor countries struggling with the pernicious legacy of colonialism, concerns about the cost of treatment trumped overwhelming scientific evidence. Instead of identifying and treating cases of TB across the population, these countries treated only the sickest and most infectious people. Focusing on the most extreme cases made sense, but it did little to stop the spread of the disease among asymptomatic carriers. In poorer countries, the results have been devastating: TB is the biggest infectious killer of adults globally, and continues to kill <a href=\"https://www.who.int/tb/global-report-2019\">on average 4,000 people every day</a>, mostly outside wealthy countries.</p> <p>These different approaches to treating TB can teach us much about the right and the wrong way to stop Covid-19. One of the main things we learned from TB is that epidemics can\u2019t be beaten in hospitals alone. Eradicating a disease like this has to take place in the community. Treating Covid-19 will depend on community testing, either across a population or by using methods of cluster sampling. There are multiple ways to curb community transmission of the disease \u2013 from face masks that prevent people from spreading particles that carry germs, to physical distancing measures<strong> </strong>and self isolation. We should also be examining how existing technologies, such as <a href=\"https://news.columbia.edu/ultraviolet-technology-virus-covid-19-UV-light\">germicidal ultraviolet lighting</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-020-0325-9\">vaccines that we already have at our disposal</a> could help protect against the transmission of Covid-19.</p> <p>Crucially, we shouldn\u2019t wait for a killer app or a vaccine to treat the coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "There were three great pandemics in the 20th century. The influenza pandemic of 1918 and the HIV pandemic during the 1980s and 1990s get the most attention. But the third, tuberculosis, was the deadliest by far and in many communities, it\u2019s not yet over. TB has much to teach us about the tools that can help to eradicate the current pandemic, and what happens when those tools aren\u2019t even tried. The disease killed more than one billion people between 1800 and 2000. Although it is caused by a bacterium rather than a virus, the disease shares some frightening similarities with this current coronavirus. The pathogen that causes TB is airborne, transmitted from person to person in households and social spaces. People with TB spread the bacteria to new individuals when they breathe. Only half of those with TB display symptoms, allowing the deadly disease to spread undetected. And like today, the most vulnerable people are hit the hardest \u2014 older people, those with underlying conditions and people living in poverty. A century ago, TB was a terrifying reality for people all over the world. One in every nine deaths in the United States in 1906 was caused by tuberculosis (adjusted to our current population levels, this would be the equivalent of 540,000 Americans dying of TB every year). The disease killed as many people as cancer and diabetes, causing profound damage to economic and social life. Yet by the 1970s, rates of tuberculosis had dropped markedly in the US and other wealthy countries. How was this achieved? With the help of diagnostic treatments, the US pursued a successful strategy called \u201csearch, treat and prevent\u201d. The key innovation wasn\u2019t drugs (although antibiotics helped eradicate the disease, the first antibiotic treatment for TB was demonstrated in the 1940s, by which time cases of the disease had already fallen to around a fifth of 1906 levels). What made a huge difference was a community-based approach where people joined together to stop the spread of disease. The first step was freeing the sick of social and financial burdens. This allowed them to come forward for testing, care and support, without having to keep working and spreading the disease in the process. To this day, some of the only free health services available to everyone in the US are those relating to tuberculosis. Health authorities in the US went door to door searching for those who were sick and tracing people they had contacted. They treated sick people with food, medicine and shelter, and offered preventative therapies to stop others from becoming sick. Free TB care was only made possible through stable financing and community support, and cooperation between governments, employers, unions, faith groups and communities. Government financing and a community-based strategy were the key advances that made it possible to eradicate TB. But in many poor countries struggling with the pernicious legacy of colonialism, concerns about the cost of treatment trumped overwhelming scientific evidence. Instead of identifying and treating cases of TB across the population, these countries treated only the sickest and most infectious people. Focusing on the most extreme cases made sense, but it did little to stop the spread of the disease among asymptomatic carriers. In poorer countries, the results have been devastating: TB is the biggest infectious killer of adults globally, and continues to kill on average 4,000 people every day, mostly outside wealthy countries. These different approaches to treating TB can teach us much about the right and the wrong way to stop Covid-19. One of the main things we learned from TB is that epidemics can\u2019t be beaten in hospitals alone. Eradicating a disease like this has to take place in the community. Treating Covid-19 will depend on community testing, either across a population or by using methods of cluster sampling. There are multiple ways to curb community transmission of the disease \u2013 from face masks that prevent people from spreading particles that carry germs, to physical distancing measures and self isolation. We should also be examining how existing technologies, such as germicidal ultraviolet lighting and vaccines that we already have at our disposal could help protect against the transmission of Covid-19. Crucially, we shouldn\u2019t wait for a killer app or a vaccine to treat the coronavirus. Effective antibiotics weren\u2019t discovered until years after TB had receded in affluent countries. Covid-19 might be different; if it behaves like other coronaviruses, those who have been infected may become immune. But the quest for a \u201csilver bullet\u201d shouldn\u2019t detract from interventions already known to work. The fight against tuberculosis showed that treating a pandemic only in one part of the world isn\u2019t enough to eradicate a disease. An estimated two-thirds of tuberculosis cases in wealthy countries today originate in places where a comprehensive response to TB was never implemented. Defeating a pandemic requires a global commitment. But the key to a successful community-based strategy isn\u2019t just case-finding or quarantine, though they will both play a role. It\u2019s trust. Why is trust so important? With TB, as with Covid-19, more than half of the people with the disease exhibit no symptoms.

These cells have large numbers of receptors \u2013 known as Ace-2 receptors \u2013 on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) \u201cThis virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,\u201d says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p> \n<p>Once inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell\u2019s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads.

In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others \u2013 by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fcb605-dc6b-400f-9a32-dea28497dcee\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMtzWVTPmLI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Why does the virus sometimes cause death?</h2> \n<p>Occasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.</p> \n<p>Even worse, in some cases, a person\u2019s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/term/cytokine-storm/\">cytokine storm.</a> (In Greek, \u201ccyto\u201d means cell and \u201ckino\u201d means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.</p> \n<p>Just why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear.

We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.\u201d</p> \n<p>The virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. \u201cWe have got to consider this pandemic from the virus\u2019s position,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK.

      "bodyText": "Coronaviruses have been causing problems for humanity for a long time. Several versions are known to trigger common colds and more recently two types have set off outbreaks of deadly illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). But their impact has been mild compared with the global havoc unleashed by the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed more than 100,000 lives. And the disease continues to spread. That is an extraordinary achievement for a spiky ball of genetic material coated in fatty chemicals called lipids, and which measures 80 billionths of a metre in diameter. Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant. On the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. Vaccines projects proliferate, antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. The questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic? Where did it come from and how did it first infect humans? The Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly originated in bats, which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats\u2019 immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into a reservoir of rapidly reproducing and highly transmissible viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins. \u201cThis virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,\u201d says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. \u201cAnd so if that wildlife animal has a virus it\u2019s picked up from a bat and we\u2019re interacting with it, there\u2019s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.\u201d As to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze. How does the virus spread and how does it affect people? Virus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors \u2013 known as Ace-2 receptors \u2013 on their surfaces.

Assaults may be falling but the restricted regimes imposed have caused further surges in the numbers of self-injury incidents.</p> <p>\u201cSince then prison regimes have tightened even further.

      "bodyText": "Self-harming in prison custody has hit a record high in England and Wales, figures reveal, with incidents recorded at an average rate of one every eight minutes last year. Self-harm incidents reached a record high of 63,328 in the 12 months to December 2019, up 14% from the previous 12 months, the Ministry of Justice data showed. The number of individuals self-harming increased by 3% in the same period to 12,977 and the average number of incidents for each person self-harming increased by 11% from 4.4 to 4.9. However, the figures show that in the year to March 2020, the number of self-inflicted deaths declined 8% to 80, while assaults were down 4% in the 12 months to December to 32,669 incidents. Frances Crook, the chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \u201cThe government\u2019s own figures, from before the coronavirus lockdown began, reveal the sheer scale of human misery behind bars across England and Wales. Assaults may be falling but the restricted regimes imposed have caused further surges in the numbers of self-injury incidents. \u201cSince then prison regimes have tightened even further. But these figures show that keeping prisoners safe during the pandemic involves so much more than seeking to reduce rates of infection. \u201cThe need to reduce the prison population could not be clearer. It is intolerable that prisoners should be spending 23 hours or more each day locked in cells, either in overcrowded conditions or prolonged solitary confinement, with nothing to do.\u201d Separate data from the MoJ revealed there were 3,367 prisoners held under the terms of the controversial imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence. The IPP sentence, scrapped in 2012, was a form of indeterminate sentence in which offenders were given a minimum jail tariff but no maximum for a range of crimes. Those given an IPP sentence are placed on licence indefinitely after release, meaning they can be recalled to prison at any stage. The psychological impact of the IPP regime has been at the heart of numerous deaths in prisons in recent years. There were 2,039 unreleased IPP prisoners on 31 March 2020, a fall of 15% in a year, but the number of those recalled increased in the same period by 25% to 1,328. Meanwhile, the proportion of the IPP prisoner population who are past their minimum tariff continued to increase to 94% at 31 March compared with 91% at the same time the previous year. There were 9,995 assaults on prison staff in the 12 months to December 2019, a 2% decrease from the previous 12 months. In the same period, there were 3,813 serious assault incidents, a decrease of 3% from the previous 12 months. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), part of the human rights organisation the Council of Europe, published a damning report on visits to prisons in England last year. The watchdog found that prison officers were allegedly punching compliant inmates who they suspected might misbehave in the future, in a practice known as \u201cpreventive strikes\u201d. More broadly, the committee said that despite some progress since its last inspection in 2016, the prison system in England was in \u201cdeep crisis\u201d, finding the jails visited to be \u201cviolent, unsafe and overcrowded\u201d. Deborah Coles, the director of the charity Inquest, which supports families of people who have died in custody, said: \u201cPeople in prison are totally dependent on the state for their safety. These latest figures show around six people are dying in prison every week and that levels of self-harm have shattered previous record highs. This reflects a long-running failure in the government\u2019s duty of care to protect lives in prison. \u201cRegretfully we fear the worst is yet to come as the impact of the virus is felt throughout the prison estate. The frustration and despair of prisoners faced with prolonged isolation in appalling conditions must be closely monitored and addressed.\u201d \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

In other words, it may take a disaster to usher in more equality, but not every disaster does.</p> <p>\u201cWe had very special circumstances for a generation after the second world war, when all the factors were present in the right way \u2014 strong growth, low inequality, a strong middle class, expansion of the welfare state, all these things simultaneously. That may be very difficult to replicate,\u201d says Scheidel.</p> <p>Nobody would want mass death on the scale of the bubonic plague in the 14th century to be the instrument by which we achieve social change. And fortunately mortality rates from coronavirus will be nothing equivalent to those levels. \u201cEvery year, 60 million people die of natural causes worldwide. The death toll from corona is probably going to be less, even in the worst case scenario.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus\u2019s transformative potential, Scheidel explains, consists in adding a shock to an already powerful groundswell of anger.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m very sceptical about is the idea that ideology, or rhetoric, or just political agitation by itself can change things. What you need is essentially a combination of a certain kind of ideas being out there, and then a shock to the established order that allows those ideas to become mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown culture has divided the haves from the have nots in the most tangible ways: while middle- and upper-class urbanites could flee to holiday homes, the lowest paid have been confined to cramped flats or forced to run the gauntlet of public transport to get to their key worker jobs.</p> <p>And, while white-collar workers complain about the complications of remote working, for a sizeable chunk of the world\u2019s labour force self-isolation means <a href=\"https://www.arabnews.com/node/1650216/world\">going hungry</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, as Scheidel points out, the damage done by the closure of schools has been felt unevenly. \u201cWe have a billion children around the world who are not going to school \u2026 and some are able to be schooled online because the households have proper internet connections and others don\u2019t. That\u2019s a very fundamental inequality. There are a number of these inequalities that have always existed, but we\u2019re becoming very painfully aware of them.\u201d</p> <p>Will all this awareness spill over into demands for political transformation? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take all that much,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAll we really need is a certain increase in the percentage of people who support certain policies for those policies to become mainstream. There is now a greater potential for a sufficiently large number of people to say, \u2018maybe we should be doing something about this\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>But there\u2019s an important caveat; much of the coronavirus\u2019s levelling potential will depend on our willingness to suffer significant economic losses in the short and medium term.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since the \u201cend of history\u201d in the 1980s ushered in 40 years of neoliberal deregulation, inequality has generally been seen as an acceptable or even necessary price to pay for prosperity. That changed after the 2008 financial crash ignited the Occupy movement, lifting the veil on the existence of the 1%. Suddenly, inequality went from being a subject studied by a handful of economists to one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/21/world-26-richest-people-own-as-much-as-poorest-50-per-cent-oxfam-report\">defining issues</a> of the last decade.</p> <p>Still, the 2008 crash <a href=\"https://www.socialeurope.eu/eu-income-inequality-great-recession\">wasn\u2019t the leveller </a>many had hoped it would be. In fact, it <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-how-the-financial-crisis-drastically-increased-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s\">produced the largest spike in wealth inequality</a> in postwar history by devastating the one thing low-income people in most western economies depend on most for their wealth: home ownership.</p> <p>On the same day that coronavirus caused the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/27/stock-market-today-live.html\">worst point drop</a> in the history of the Dow Jones, the economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 optimistically <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brankomilan/status/1232850693926637570?lang=en\">tweeted</a>: \u201cMy friend @WalterScheidel must feel vindicated. Coronavirus has already shaved off about 1/2 a Gini point of US wealth inequality. And this seems to be only a beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Milanovi\u0107 was referring to the Gini coefficient, a commonly used measure of inequality that measures income or wealth distribution among a population.</p> <p>Scheidel sees the newly collapsed assets of billionaires rebounding over the next few years as they did after the 2008 financial crash. \u201cIt took a few years, and then the top 1% were back to where they were before the financial crisis. That\u2019s likely to happen again with all the measures taken to shore up corporations and preserve the financial sector.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, mass unemployment and the loss of income or healthcare will hit the poor hardest, pushing many people into debt, further widening the gap between rich and poor.</p> <p>But could the coronavirus crash do what the 2008 crash didn\u2019t? Not if there\u2019s a swift recovery but, says Scheidel: \u201cIf we\u2019re entering a more long-term depression as a result of Covid-19, I think all kinds of more radical policies will be on the table for the first time in a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>Much, he thinks, depends on the early discovery of a vaccine. \u201cThen you could say science will save the status quo, because it makes it possible for us to return to business as usual quite swiftly.</p> <p>But now assume that science fails to do that because the virus is more complicated and can\u2019t be fixed in the short term, then you\u2019ll have a more severe protracted crisis, with greater potential for transformative change.\u201d</p> <p>That may translate to stronger state intervention, better protections for workers in domestic industries, limits to outsourcing, higher taxation and more robust healthcare systems \u2014 if only because it will be impossible to justify the shortages of face masks and other essential equipment that have already cost countless lives.</p> <p>It will also be difficult to resist the temptation to go back to business as usual. \u201cThere will be a strong push to go back to growth to finance the huge deficits that governments have been racking up, so, if anything, growth will be more important than before,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAt the same time, if the effects of the pandemic polarise societies even more, there will also be stronger agitation for more progressive or distributive policies. It will be very difficult to reconcile those two motivations.\u201d</p> <p>The real clash of interests, he predicts, will be between those determined to go back to the status quo even at the price of making existing inequality worse and those who want a reset.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see enough engagement with the fact that this is going to be a real struggle between countervailing forces that push in different directions. The big question is which one will have the upper hand, in which place, and for how long.\u201d</p> <p>The most unequal democracies like the US and the UK, where inequality of income is estimated to be among the highest in Europe, could experience the biggest shifts. \u201cThe less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cSo, somewhat paradoxically, the potential for actual change is biggest in the less equal countries.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, \u201cIf you are in China, the shock will not lead to more equalising policies. It will lead to a tightening of control and more business as usual.\u201d</p> <p>Time will tell if Scheidel can feel the vindication of Milanovi\u0107\u2019s forecast. As the pandemic devastates the world economy, hitting the poor hardest of all, short-term solutions aimed at restoring \u201cnormality\u201d are likely to outweigh lofty visions for a more equal society.</p> <p>And if he is right that the recipe for equality is prolonged suffering, things may have to get a lot worse before they can get better. For many, it won\u2019t be worth the wait.<br></p> <p>\u2022 Kyrill Hartog is a journalist and the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"https://www.areweeurope.com/\">Are We Europe</a> magazine<br><br></p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br><br><br><br></p>",

The death toll from corona is probably going to be less, even in the worst case scenario.\u201d Coronavirus\u2019s transformative potential, Scheidel explains, consists in adding a shock to an already powerful groundswell of anger. \u201cWhat I\u2019m very sceptical about is the idea that ideology, or rhetoric, or just political agitation by itself can change things. What you need is essentially a combination of a certain kind of ideas being out there, and then a shock to the established order that allows those ideas to become mainstream.\u201d Lockdown culture has divided the haves from the have nots in the most tangible ways: while middle- and upper-class urbanites could flee to holiday homes, the lowest paid have been confined to cramped flats or forced to run the gauntlet of public transport to get to their key worker jobs. And, while white-collar workers complain about the complications of remote working, for a sizeable chunk of the world\u2019s labour force self-isolation means going hungry. Similarly, as Scheidel points out, the damage done by the closure of schools has been felt unevenly. \u201cWe have a billion children around the world who are not going to school \u2026 and some are able to be schooled online because the households have proper internet connections and others don\u2019t. That\u2019s a very fundamental inequality. There are a number of these inequalities that have always existed, but we\u2019re becoming very painfully aware of them.\u201d Will all this awareness spill over into demands for political transformation? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take all that much,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAll we really need is a certain increase in the percentage of people who support certain policies for those policies to become mainstream. There is now a greater potential for a sufficiently large number of people to say, \u2018maybe we should be doing something about this\u2019.\u201d But there\u2019s an important caveat; much of the coronavirus\u2019s levelling potential will depend on our willingness to suffer significant economic losses in the short and medium term. Since the \u201cend of history\u201d in the 1980s ushered in 40 years of neoliberal deregulation, inequality has generally been seen as an acceptable or even necessary price to pay for prosperity. That changed after the 2008 financial crash ignited the Occupy movement, lifting the veil on the existence of the 1%. Suddenly, inequality went from being a subject studied by a handful of economists to one of the defining issues of the last decade. Still, the 2008 crash wasn\u2019t the leveller many had hoped it would be. In fact, it produced the largest spike in wealth inequality in postwar history by devastating the one thing low-income people in most western economies depend on most for their wealth: home ownership. On the same day that coronavirus caused the worst point drop in the history of the Dow Jones, the economist Branko Milanovi\u0107 optimistically tweeted: \u201cMy friend @WalterScheidel must feel vindicated. Coronavirus has already shaved off about 1/2 a Gini point of US wealth inequality. And this seems to be only a beginning.\u201d Milanovi\u0107 was referring to the Gini coefficient, a commonly used measure of inequality that measures income or wealth distribution among a population. Scheidel sees the newly collapsed assets of billionaires rebounding over the next few years as they did after the 2008 financial crash. \u201cIt took a few years, and then the top 1% were back to where they were before the financial crisis. That\u2019s likely to happen again with all the measures taken to shore up corporations and preserve the financial sector.\u201d Meanwhile, mass unemployment and the loss of income or healthcare will hit the poor hardest, pushing many people into debt, further widening the gap between rich and poor. But could the coronavirus crash do what the 2008 crash didn\u2019t? Not if there\u2019s a swift recovery but, says Scheidel: \u201cIf we\u2019re entering a more long-term depression as a result of Covid-19, I think all kinds of more radical policies will be on the table for the first time in a very long time.\u201d Much, he thinks, depends on the early discovery of a vaccine. \u201cThen you could say science will save the status quo, because it makes it possible for us to return to business as usual quite swiftly. But now assume that science fails to do that because the virus is more complicated and can\u2019t be fixed in the short term, then you\u2019ll have a more severe protracted crisis, with greater potential for transformative change.\u201d That may translate to stronger state intervention, better protections for workers in domestic industries, limits to outsourcing, higher taxation and more robust healthcare systems \u2014 if only because it will be impossible to justify the shortages of face masks and other essential equipment that have already cost countless lives. It will also be difficult to resist the temptation to go back to business as usual. \u201cThere will be a strong push to go back to growth to finance the huge deficits that governments have been racking up, so, if anything, growth will be more important than before,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cAt the same time, if the effects of the pandemic polarise societies even more, there will also be stronger agitation for more progressive or distributive policies. It will be very difficult to reconcile those two motivations.\u201d The real clash of interests, he predicts, will be between those determined to go back to the status quo even at the price of making existing inequality worse and those who want a reset. \u201cI don\u2019t see enough engagement with the fact that this is going to be a real struggle between countervailing forces that push in different directions. The big question is which one will have the upper hand, in which place, and for how long.\u201d The most unequal democracies like the US and the UK, where inequality of income is estimated to be among the highest in Europe, could experience the biggest shifts. \u201cThe less equal countries face darker choices between carrying on as before and experiencing real change,\u201d says Scheidel. \u201cSo, somewhat paradoxically, the potential for actual change is biggest in the less equal countries.\u201d By contrast, \u201cIf you are in China, the shock will not lead to more equalising policies. It will lead to a tightening of control and more business as usual.\u201d Time will tell if Scheidel can feel the vindication of Milanovi\u0107\u2019s forecast. As the pandemic devastates the world economy, hitting the poor hardest of all, short-term solutions aimed at restoring \u201cnormality\u201d are likely to outweigh lofty visions for a more equal society. And if he is right that the recipe for equality is prolonged suffering, things may have to get a lot worse before they can get better. For many, it won\u2019t be worth the wait. \u2022 Kyrill Hartog is a journalist and the editor-in-chief of Are We Europe magazine",

It directly advised on the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) in 2012, which led to 1,300 pages of policy being reduced to 65 in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\">triumphant bonfire of red tape</a>, and it has numerous committees influencing policy on all aspects of land planning and valuation. It describes part of its mission as \u201cunlocking the inherent value held within the world\u2019s physical assets\u201d, but the question is, for whom is the value being unlocked? And who, consequently, is missing out?<br><br>In the eyes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/06/housing-trickle-strategic-choice\">Bob Colenutt</a>, the answer is clear. In his urgent new book, <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/the-property-lobby\">The Property Lobby</a>, he identifies the RICS as one of numerous actors in a complex network of landowners, housebuilders, financial backers, professional bodies and politicians who are engaged in propping up the status quo to ensure that their interests prosper \u2013 at the expense of everyone else. The housing crisis is no accident, he argues, but the calculated product of an elite group who have no reason to fix it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f32e66b0b0e2409c8a7d0f173d45833967f4ce5f/0_0_6924_4537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Taking action ...

His career in community planning and local government regeneration has taken him from campaigning in Southwark, south London (helping to lay the foundations for the community-led <a href=\"https://coinstreet.org/\">Coin Street housing project</a> on the South Bank) to battling the development of Docklands and working for various London councils, before moving into academia. In 1975, he co-authored <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Property-Machine-Penguin-special/dp/0140523030\">The Property Machine</a>, a book whose message was nicely summed up by its cover illustration of a fat-cat developer gobbling up people\u2019s homes. Then, the big developers were office builders, backed by insurance companies and pension funds. Now, they are housebuilders, armed with an unimaginable arsenal of global capital. Many of the themes remain the same, but, in the intervening years, through successive takeovers, intensive political lobbying and close integration with the finance sector, the leading developers have swollen into an unstoppable force.<br><br>Combining the methodical precision of an academic with the persuasive passion of a radical campaigner, Colenutt identifies how we got into this situation, and provides several suggestions for a possible way out. In succinct chapters, he lays out the structure of what he calls the \u201cfinance-housebuilding complex\u201d, explaining how the housebuilding business works, how housing finance underpins the entire UK economy, how the powerful network of lobbying groups operates, how it has shaped planning policy, and how the grim cycle of low supply, high prices and poor quality homes is relentlessly perpetuated by vested interests.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e306104d249bc207fa3dbab249f572475173f29/0_0_1500_2368/633.jpg\" alt=\"The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt.\" width=\"633\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Property Machine by Peter Ambrose and Bob Colenutt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penguin</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the decades, governments of all colours have announced bold new methods to solve the housing crisis, but little has changed. Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/09/more-than-1m-families-waiting-for-social-housing-in-england\">council house waiting lists</a> and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty \u2013 not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">delivered through \u201cplanning gain\u201d</a>. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the \u201cregeneration\u201d of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/mar/14/winners-and-losers-london-social-housing-divide-barnet-camden\">break-up of communities</a>. It\u2019s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to \u201cthe ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.\u201d<br><br>Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/berkeleygroupholdings\">Berkeley Group</a>, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes \u2013 proudly described as \u201cpopular with overseas investors\u201d \u2013 was \u00a3715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company\u2019s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of \u00a348m in 2018, after a previous payout of \u00a323m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/03/berkeley-calls-affordable-housing-targets-unviable-as-chairman-earns-174m\">local authority targets were \u201cunviable\u201d</a>. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than <a href=\"https://www.building.co.uk/news/berkeley-profit-hit/5100149.article\">\u00a33bn</a>.<br><br>As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/heseltine-launches-panel-of-experts-to-kick-start-estates-regeneration\">Michael Heseltine\u2019s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel</a> in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the <a href=\"https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/news-and-insights/news/2014/berkeley-wins-queens-award-for-sustainable-development\">Queen\u2019s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014</a>. The next year, Pidgley <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2015/apr/01/tory-100-industry-captains-party-donors-tax-avoiders\">gave a donation to the Conservative party</a> and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b68829c76d4513933047332255f2f5886ea0d8d/0_107_4292_2574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steering profits ...

Tony Pidgley, chairman of Berkeley Group.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Good business deserves handsome rewards, the housebuilders retort. But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/01/help-to-buy-pushes-uk-housebuilder-dividends-to-23bn\">government subsidy through Help to Buy</a>, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">dodge their affordable housing obligations</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.cih.org/\">Chartered Institute for Housing</a> estimated that of the total \u00a353bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/07/persimmon-boss-asked-to-leave-amid-ongoing-outrage-over-bonus\">CEO Jeff Fairburn a \u00a375m bonus</a>, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process.<br><br>All of this is great news for the <a href=\"https://www.hbf.co.uk/\">Home Builders Federation</a>, the powerful volume housebuilders\u2019 lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">viability assessment</a>\u201d of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/31/britain-land-housing-crisis-developers-not-building-land-banking\">land-banking</a> and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits.<br><br>The list of powerful interests goes on. There is <a href=\"https://www.cla.org.uk/\">the CLA</a> (formerly the Country Landowners\u2019 Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that <a href=\"https://www.progressive-policy.net/press-releases/press-release-landowners-make-13bn-profit-in-one-year-as-high-land-prices-stifle-affordable-housing\">landowners in England made a \u00a313bn profit from land sales in 2016-17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/net-income\">far more than Amazon\u2019s net annual global profit in the same period, or since</a>. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop. The result is endless inflation in land values, which in turn reduces the amount of affordable housing that will ever be delivered. Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a \u201cStalinist land grab\u201d or a \u201cgarden tax\u201d.<br><br>Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/30/revolving-door-between-councils-and-lobbyists-raises-transparency-issues\">revolving doors between councils and developers</a>, to the culture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/10/tory-westminster-councillor-resigns-after-hospitality-inquiry\">hospitality and political donations</a>, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/17/truth-property-developers-builders-exploit-planning-cities\">riddle the planning system</a> \u2013 which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers\u2019 profits.<br><br>There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas. First, he calls for a national housing drive, \u201cpart of a newly reinvigorated welfare state, where housing, like health, is available to those in need as a human right\u201d. It would be just as repugnant to the property lobby as the idea of a UK-style NHS is to the US health insurance industry \u2013 a comparison that vividly illustrates how much it is needed.<br><br>Second, there must be fundamental land reform to bring development land forward for housing at sensible prices so that new housing can be truly affordable and existing prices can stabilise. Colenutt points to the <a href=\"https://righttobuildtoolkit.org.uk/briefing-notes/different-ways-to-bring-forward-land/\">examples of Germany and the Netherlands</a>, where local authorities buy up development land at its existing use value, draw up real masterplans, then offer sites to housebuilders, who build to the plans of the local authority. In this way, housebuilders are simply builders of houses, not land speculators.<br><br>He says it is finally time to tax developers\u2019 land banks and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25396103\">implement \u201cuse or lose it\u201d measures</a>, to discourage housebuilders from hoarding plots with planning permission. And, most importantly, the Treasury and the Bank of England must be weaned off their dependence on land and house prices, and rebalance the economy away from property. All of this is eminently possible, if the powerful property lobby can be resisted, and some local authorities are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/oct/28/meet-the-councils-quietly-building-a-housing-revolution\">beginning to take the lead</a>, in spite of central government policy. As the Coin Street Community Builders\u2019 slogan puts it: \u201cThere is another way.\u201d Seeing the stark reality spelled out in such clear terms in this book, there is no longer any excuse not to act.</p> <ul> <li><p>The Property Lobby: The Hidden Reality Behind the Housing Crisis by Bob Colenutt, is published by <a href=\"https://policy.bristoluniversitypress.co.uk/the-property-lobby\">Policy Press</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h2><br><br></h2>",

Headlines have continually told us that we are short of 4m homes, that thousands are homeless, that 1.2 million people are on council house waiting lists and that a million private tenants are in deep poverty \u2013 not counting the impending impact of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 but no effective action is taken. Instead, funding for social housing has been slashed while subsidies are lavished on the private sector housebuilders, in the hope that affordable housing will be delivered through \u201cplanning gain\u201d. Meanwhile, local authorities have been forced into public-private partnerships for major developments on their own land, including the \u201cregeneration\u201d of estates that leads to the loss of thousands of council houses and the break-up of communities. It\u2019s a Faustian pact from which the public is doomed never to benefit. As Colenutt puts it, the situation has led to \u201cthe ultimate absurdity of public authorities actively pursuing higher values from market-led development in order to find crumbs for social housing development.\u201d Meanwhile, the housebuilders get ever richer. Berkeley Group, one of the Top 10 UK builders, built 3,536 homes in 2017, which sounds like a decent contribution to meeting the housing shortage. That is, until you realise that the average price of these homes \u2013 proudly described as \u201cpopular with overseas investors\u201d \u2013 was \u00a3715,000. Tony Pidgley, the company\u2019s founder and chairman, received a personal payout of \u00a348m in 2018, after a previous payout of \u00a323m in 2015, when profits rose 42%. At the same time, Berkeley has consistently reduced the amount of affordable housing on its developments across London, on the grounds that the local authority targets were \u201cunviable\u201d. Over the past eight years, Berkeley made a profit of more than \u00a33bn. As Colenutt argues, it is not only the distribution of profits to a tiny number of executives that is so shocking, it is the political influence that goes with it. Pidgley was a member of Michael Heseltine\u2019s Estate Regeneration Advisory Panel in 2016 and advised the government on the disposal of public sector land. He received a CBE from David Cameron in 2012, and the Berkeley Group won the Queen\u2019s Award for Sustainable Development in 2014. The next year, Pidgley gave a donation to the Conservative party and wrote to the Daily Telegraph before the 2015 general election expressing his support for the Conservatives, citing their housing and development policies. Good business deserves handsome rewards, the housebuilders retort. But these vast profits are not the product of great expertise, nor of success in a free market. Colenutt outlines how they are fuelled by government subsidy through Help to Buy, along with grants from Homes England and deregulation of the planning system that enables housebuilders to dodge their affordable housing obligations. The Chartered Institute for Housing estimated that of the total \u00a353bn in government housing investment in 2017, almost 80% went in direct subsidies to the private sector. Persimmon, which infamously awarded its CEO Jeff Fairburn a \u00a375m bonus, revealed that nearly half of its house sales in 2018 were partly funded by Help to Buy. The disastrous policy has simply maintained house prices at their high level and maximised housebuilder profits in the process. All of this is great news for the Home Builders Federation, the powerful volume housebuilders\u2019 lobby, whose members construct most of the new homes in England and Wales. Through constant political lobbying and direct ministerial contact, the HBF has been instrumental in shaping government policies, from the nature of the NPPF, to the \u201cviability assessment\u201d of planning obligations, to the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. Countless reports have highlighted the damaging practices of land-banking and drip-feeding the supply of homes to keep prices high, yet the HBF insists that the housing shortage is caused by local authorities not allocating enough land for housing and asking for too much from planning obligations. As Colenutt notes, the central contradiction in the HBF platform is that at the same time as wanting the state to reduce its control over development, they lobby for more state subsidies and government intervention to support their business model and bolster their profits. The list of powerful interests goes on. There is the CLA (formerly the Country Landowners\u2019 Association, a more accurate description of its purpose), whose 33,000 members make up the largest private landowning group in England and Wales. When planning consent for housing is granted on farmland, its value can rocket a hundredfold. The National Housing Federation estimates that landowners in England made a \u00a313bn profit from land sales in 2016-17, far more than Amazon\u2019s net annual global profit in the same period, or since. Yet the CLA is incensed by accusations that its members are pocketing unearned windfalls. The organisation has proved wildly successful in protecting the interests of landowners, arguing that any attempt to capture the uplift in value for the public good through the planning process would stifle growth and remove any incentive to develop. The result is endless inflation in land values, which in turn reduces the amount of affordable housing that will ever be delivered. Meanwhile, the landowner lobby ensures that any attempt at reforming this byzantine system is decried in newspaper headlines as a \u201cStalinist land grab\u201d or a \u201cgarden tax\u201d. Colenutt packs many more targets into his 160 pages, from the revolving doors between councils and developers, to the culture of hospitality and political donations, to the innumerable loopholes and get-out clauses that riddle the planning system \u2013 which has itself been fundamentally altered, he argues, from dealing with the best use of land to safeguarding developers\u2019 profits. There is no easy means of untangling all this, but Colenutt offers some ideas. First, he calls for a national housing drive, \u201cpart of a newly reinvigorated welfare state, where housing, like health, is available to those in need as a human right\u201d. It would be just as repugnant to the property lobby as the idea of a UK-style NHS is to the US health insurance industry \u2013 a comparison that vividly illustrates how much it is needed. Second, there must be fundamental land reform to bring development land forward for housing at sensible prices so that new housing can be truly affordable and existing prices can stabilise. Colenutt points to the examples of Germany and the Netherlands, where local authorities buy up development land at its existing use value, draw up real masterplans, then offer sites to housebuilders, who build to the plans of the local authority. In this way, housebuilders are simply builders of houses, not land speculators. He says it is finally time to tax developers\u2019 land banks and implement \u201cuse or lose it\u201d measures, to discourage housebuilders from hoarding plots with planning permission. And, most importantly, the Treasury and the Bank of England must be weaned off their dependence on land and house prices, and rebalance the economy away from property. All of this is eminently possible, if the powerful property lobby can be resisted, and some local authorities are already beginning to take the lead, in spite of central government policy. As the Coin Street Community Builders\u2019 slogan puts it: \u201cThere is another way.\u201d Seeing the stark reality spelled out in such clear terms in this book, there is no longer any excuse not to act.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s five tests for starting a relaxation of the lockdown are \u201cnot a good enough guide\u201d for a long-term exit strategy, a thinktank has said. In a new paper, Lifting the Lockdown: How to Approach a Coronavirus Exit Strategy, the Institute for Government (IfG) says what was good at the outset of the coronavirus outbreak is not necessarily good for the end. \u201cHow to ease the coronavirus lockdown will require Boris Johnson to make some of the toughest choices to have faced any prime minister,\u201d said Joe Owen, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cThere can be no grand plan for exit, only a process of edging forward. The government\u2019s approach will have to evolve to take account of the best evidence, but these will be overwhelmingly political choices \u2013 and the government will need to be straight with the British people about the steps that will be taken in the months ahead.\u201d The government has set out five tests for starting to lift the lockdown, which look for: signs that the NHS is able to cope, a stage which it believes has been reached; that it has sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE); a \u201csustained and consistent\u201d fall in the daily death rate ; reliable data on decreasing infection rates; and signs that the risk of a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS can be avoided. But the IfG says that while these tests might be appropriate measures of bringing a pandemic under control, they are not the basis for a long-term exit strategy, which it says must be based on a different approach, ensuring measures are put in place \u201cthat reduce the risk of resurgence of the disease\u201d and give the economy a chance to function. This means increasing the capacity for testing and contact tracing and considering tighter border controls to stop fresh importation of the virus. The IfG says the next phase will involve walking the tightrope between guarding the nation\u2019s health and reopening businesses, schools and services, and warns against \u201ckeeping the economy on ice\u201d. Transparency and detailed communications, not just with the public but with employers, councils and devolved governments, will be key, it says, and the strategy on communications may need to change over time. It also warns the government to pay attention to continued public consent in a world where the impact of the lockdown has \u201cnot been evenly spread\u201d: some in non-essential hospitality or retail and aviation have or will lose their jobs and fear for their future, but others, for example in financial services, seem to be unaffected. Young workers, low earners and women are more likely to work in one of the sectors hardest hit by the shutdown.",

      "body": "<p><em>Tony Lloyd, the Labour MP for Rochdale in Greater Manchester, spent 25 days in Manchester Royal Infirmary with Covid-19, including 10 days in an induced coma on a ventilator. He talks to Helen Pidd about the humbling experience, from having strange dreams to how it\u2019s </em><em>focused his beliefs about the NHS.</em></p> <p>I\u2019d been feeling ropey for two weeks when I went into hospital on 2 April, ever since I\u2019d come back up to Manchester from Westminster. I\u2019d woken up really early, about 4am, and I just thought: this isn\u2019t right. I\u2019d perhaps been in denial until then. You know what northerners are like: after 200 years of having manure poured over our heads, we are used to soldiering on.</p> <p>I phoned 111 and expected to be told: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, if it gets worse, give us another ring.\u201d But they said they were going to send an ambulance. I had all the symptoms: I was running a high temperature, my breathing was challenging. I\u2019d been ill for that long and wasn\u2019t getting better. I think I was relieved to be taken seriously. There\u2019s a credibility thing. You don\u2019t want to ring up and someone says you\u2019re acting daft, you\u2019ve just got an ingrowing toenail or whatever.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>It is quite difficult to remember what happened next. Accessing these memories is hard; it\u2019s like they are in another place. But I do know that an ambulance turned up at my house and whisked me away to the Manchester Royal Infirmary. I could still walk 30 yards to the ambulance. I didn\u2019t need a stretcher: back then I was probably 10 times stronger than I am today.</p> <p>I was on my own that night and no one knew I had been taken to hospital. It was so early I didn\u2019t want to wake anyone up and so when my daughters couldn\u2019t get hold of me that morning they started to worry. They told me later that they came round to my house to look for me and when I wasn\u2019t there, they phoned around all the hospitals in Manchester to try to find me. By the time they tracked me down I was still in A&amp;E, waiting for a bed.</p> <p>After I tested positive I was moved on to the Covid ward. I was having problems breathing so they had me wearing a pressurised hood, a sort of tent over my head to push oxygen into me. After two days my temperature was still high \u2013 it was nearly 40C at one point \u2013 so I was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU).</p> <p>That\u2019s when the doctor told me they were going to put me in an induced coma. I can\u2019t remember it, but I must have been conscious then, because I did manage to ring Angharad, the eldest of my four children, and tell her what was happening. I\u2019d named her my \u201cdesignated person\u201d, the designated busybody who would phone up and talk to the doctors. She\u2019s since said it was one of the worst conversations she has ever had.</p> <p>Apparently I sounded very faint and weak and said that I just felt so tired and that I was going on a ventilator. It was my youngest daughter\u2019s birthday that day and she says I kept asking if she and everyone else in the family was OK.</p> <p>One of the consultants said to me later, when I was semi-compos mentis, that he selects the people he puts on ventilators according to who he felt was a good risk. There\u2019s got to be a medical judgment as to whether the patient can come through the quite brutal experience of being intubated and kept alive. I was one of the lucky ones. I had no underlying health conditions and was reasonably fit. I had been running on a treadmill a couple of weeks beforehand. I never considered myself high risk, even though I had turned 70 in February.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2cb700660389dc91b2af989876817d9cafa9113\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2cb700660389dc91b2af989876817d9cafa9113/1231_0_4184_2513/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner supporting NHS staff outside the blood donor centre at Manchester Royal Infirmary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner supporting NHS staff outside the blood donor centre at Manchester Royal Infirmary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was on a ventilator for 10 days and in ICU for 19 days in total. All I can remember from that period is wild dreams. There was one when I was stuck on a constant loop on the Manchester to Paris train. The good thing about my dreams is that they offer a better train service than this government. I was desperate to get off the train but I couldn\u2019t. I knew it wasn\u2019t where I ought to be, I was trapped. The doctors told me later this is quite normal. It\u2019s a trauma thing.</p> <p>Angharad has filled in the blanks of what happened while I was unconscious. Apparently after a week on the ventilator the doctors were getting ready to wean me off when I came down with a chest infection and my temperature shot back up. It\u2019s always a risk in hospital when they are putting tubes into you. They were about to do a tracheostomy, where they make a hole in the neck in order to place a tube into your windpipe, when there was some sort of delay, thankfully. By the time the surgeon was ready I had got better, so they didn\u2019t do the procedure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The professionalism is extraordinary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even when they started to wake me up, I wasn\u2019t behaving normally. I think I was looking at some of the medical staff like they were the Stasi. Angharad says I rang up at one point and told her they were holding me against my will. I remember at one point getting quite distressed because I thought they\u2019d put wooden pegs in my mouth. They had, sort of: these were real and necessary clips to secure the breathing tubes.</p> <p>The day after I was put on a ventilator, Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital in London, I later learned. He said something when he came out that I relate to, when he praised the people who cared for him. The professionalism is extraordinary but it\u2019s the humanity of it, the 150,000 small human gestures every hour that makes the NHS a human institution.</p> <p>When I was moved out of ICU I watched a guy across from me who couldn\u2019t feed himself. Every mealtime, a nurse took time to sit with him and gently feed him. I watched young women cleaning old men and that\u2019s what they did because they care, not because there\u2019s an enormous pot of gold for them at their end of their double shift.</p> <p>There was this particular nurse who walked me to the door when I was discharged. She supported me because I was unsteady and as I went off she clapped me. It\u2019s tremendous, really, because it\u2019s her and people like her who had done the work, not me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"766ef46668017d470784998d750383615b778469\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/766ef46668017d470784998d750383615b778469/0_122_6720_4033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Lloyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Lloyd: \u2019At the moment the priority for me is rebuilding my health and not being on the frontbench.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the doctors and nurses were not British-born, which is something we should all reflect on. That will remain the case and Priti Patel as home secretary has got to work out how we staff our NHS in the future. If we are not going to employ these people, there is no future for our NHS.</p> <p>It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really been a user of the NHS. I had a minor operation years back but other than that I haven\u2019t needed to use a hospital. Seeing it close up, it should make us all say: this is something that is so valuable, so worth fighting for and never again can we have a decade of underfunding where we end up without the ventilators, without the doctors and nurses.</p> <p>How can it be that we haven\u2019t got enough personal protective equipment (PPE)? How can it be a matter of random luck as to whether the people looking after your mum in a care home are protected? We have to learn the lessons from all of that.</p> <p>I was watching something about a nurse who died in Harrogate and she had said to her family that the PPE wasn\u2019t all it should be. But she went to work and people like her saved my life. So I am bound to feel a tremendous sense of humility.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t about two nurses working 48 hours by the prime minister\u2019s bedside, it\u2019s about dozens and dozens of amazing people who are amazing every day, who take it for granted that\u2019s what they do. That\u2019s why the NHS is beyond extraordinary. Maybe good old Captain Tom has tapped into something where people will begin to realise that there is more to life than the next parcel from Amazon. It\u2019s what binds us as a human family really. That enormous decency.</p> <p>I was discharged from hospital on Monday and on Tuesday I resigned as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, a post I have held for two years. I plan to stay on as an MP \u2013 I am not going to renege on my commitment to serve the people of Rochdale \u2013 but at the moment the priority for me is rebuilding my health and not being on the frontbench.</p> <p>I\u2019m staying with family in Manchester now. I couldn\u2019t possibly live independently at this stage. The things that you and I would find just routine in life cost me a lot of effort. Just having a shower feels like doing three days\u2019 work.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know what the long-term effects might be, but the doctors told me to expect my cough to linger. Not working is new for me: Angharad will tell you that in the days of landlines I was constantly on the phone at home and would only take the phone off the hook while we were having Christmas dinner.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changed me. Ask most Labour people if they like the NHS and they will say, yes, it\u2019s the thing of which we are most proud. But what this has done is translate for me a principle \u2014 believing in free public health at the point of use \u2014 into something that\u2019s about the people I saw delivering that healthcare and the patients whose journeys I shared.</p> <p>What it\u2019s done is focused rather than changed what I see \u2013 particularly my long-term belief that our society is disordered. If this pandemic doesn\u2019t make us rethink what kind of world we want to live in then I\u2019m not sure what will. We will have to use this experience as the anvil on which we beat out this new world.</p> <p>This is not just about fair pay, but actually how we value different things in society. Looking back, how could any government have underfunded the NHS for 10 years? Ask the public today who is in favour of that and, apart from George Osborne, no one would put their hand up. Even Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t think that now. In that sense it really is about saying we need a different evaluation of things, a different order of things.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t being romantic or naive. Most of us know that from time to time you might need these services. But now we have seen a society laid out in front of us that is in distress and things are not going right, and it will be some time until it begins to go right. We have to begin to use the resources of our society for all of us, not just some of us.</p>",

One of the consultants said to me later, when I was semi-compos mentis, that he selects the people he puts on ventilators according to who he felt was a good risk. There\u2019s got to be a medical judgment as to whether the patient can come through the quite brutal experience of being intubated and kept alive. I was one of the lucky ones. I had no underlying health conditions and was reasonably fit. I had been running on a treadmill a couple of weeks beforehand. I never considered myself high risk, even though I had turned 70 in February. I was on a ventilator for 10 days and in ICU for 19 days in total. All I can remember from that period is wild dreams. There was one when I was stuck on a constant loop on the Manchester to Paris train. The good thing about my dreams is that they offer a better train service than this government. I was desperate to get off the train but I couldn\u2019t. I knew it wasn\u2019t where I ought to be, I was trapped. The doctors told me later this is quite normal. It\u2019s a trauma thing. Angharad has filled in the blanks of what happened while I was unconscious. Apparently after a week on the ventilator the doctors were getting ready to wean me off when I came down with a chest infection and my temperature shot back up. It\u2019s always a risk in hospital when they are putting tubes into you. They were about to do a tracheostomy, where they make a hole in the neck in order to place a tube into your windpipe, when there was some sort of delay, thankfully. By the time the surgeon was ready I had got better, so they didn\u2019t do the procedure. Even when they started to wake me up, I wasn\u2019t behaving normally. I think I was looking at some of the medical staff like they were the Stasi. Angharad says I rang up at one point and told her they were holding me against my will. I remember at one point getting quite distressed because I thought they\u2019d put wooden pegs in my mouth. They had, sort of: these were real and necessary clips to secure the breathing tubes. The day after I was put on a ventilator, Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital in London, I later learned. He said something when he came out that I relate to, when he praised the people who cared for him. The professionalism is extraordinary but it\u2019s the humanity of it, the 150,000 small human gestures every hour that makes the NHS a human institution. When I was moved out of ICU I watched a guy across from me who couldn\u2019t feed himself. Every mealtime, a nurse took time to sit with him and gently feed him. I watched young women cleaning old men and that\u2019s what they did because they care, not because there\u2019s an enormous pot of gold for them at their end of their double shift. There was this particular nurse who walked me to the door when I was discharged. She supported me because I was unsteady and as I went off she clapped me. It\u2019s tremendous, really, because it\u2019s her and people like her who had done the work, not me. Many of the doctors and nurses were not British-born, which is something we should all reflect on. That will remain the case and Priti Patel as home secretary has got to work out how we staff our NHS in the future. If we are not going to employ these people, there is no future for our NHS. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve really been a user of the NHS. I had a minor operation years back but other than that I haven\u2019t needed to use a hospital. Seeing it close up, it should make us all say: this is something that is so valuable, so worth fighting for and never again can we have a decade of underfunding where we end up without the ventilators, without the doctors and nurses. How can it be that we haven\u2019t got enough personal protective equipment (PPE)? How can it be a matter of random luck as to whether the people looking after your mum in a care home are protected? We have to learn the lessons from all of that. I was watching something about a nurse who died in Harrogate and she had said to her family that the PPE wasn\u2019t all it should be. But she went to work and people like her saved my life. So I am bound to feel a tremendous sense of humility. It isn\u2019t about two nurses working 48 hours by the prime minister\u2019s bedside, it\u2019s about dozens and dozens of amazing people who are amazing every day, who take it for granted that\u2019s what they do. That\u2019s why the NHS is beyond extraordinary. Maybe good old Captain Tom has tapped into something where people will begin to realise that there is more to life than the next parcel from Amazon. It\u2019s what binds us as a human family really. That enormous decency. I was discharged from hospital on Monday and on Tuesday I resigned as shadow Northern Ireland secretary, a post I have held for two years. I plan to stay on as an MP \u2013 I am not going to renege on my commitment to serve the people of Rochdale \u2013 but at the moment the priority for me is rebuilding my health and not being on the frontbench. I\u2019m staying with family in Manchester now. I couldn\u2019t possibly live independently at this stage. The things that you and I would find just routine in life cost me a lot of effort. Just having a shower feels like doing three days\u2019 work. I don\u2019t know what the long-term effects might be, but the doctors told me to expect my cough to linger. Not working is new for me: Angharad will tell you that in the days of landlines I was constantly on the phone at home and would only take the phone off the hook while we were having Christmas dinner. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changed me. Ask most Labour people if they like the NHS and they will say, yes, it\u2019s the thing of which we are most proud. But what this has done is translate for me a principle \u2014 believing in free public health at the point of use \u2014 into something that\u2019s about the people I saw delivering that healthcare and the patients whose journeys I shared. What it\u2019s done is focused rather than changed what I see \u2013 particularly my long-term belief that our society is disordered. If this pandemic doesn\u2019t make us rethink what kind of world we want to live in then I\u2019m not sure what will. We will have to use this experience as the anvil on which we beat out this new world. This is not just about fair pay, but actually how we value different things in society. Looking back, how could any government have underfunded the NHS for 10 years? Ask the public today who is in favour of that and, apart from George Osborne, no one would put their hand up. Even Boris Johnson doesn\u2019t think that now. In that sense it really is about saying we need a different evaluation of things, a different order of things. This isn\u2019t being romantic or naive. Most of us know that from time to time you might need these services. But now we have seen a society laid out in front of us that is in distress and things are not going right, and it will be some time until it begins to go right. We have to begin to use the resources of our society for all of us, not just some of us.",

You can\u2019t put a pregnancy on pause, so imagine being forced into that position \u2013 it must be terrifying\u201d, said the Very Reverend Katherine Hancock Ragsdale, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation said</p> <p>Texas politicians\u2019 decision to ban abortion set off a month-long ping-pong of court battles. As Covid-19 spread ferociously in the US in March and April, federal court rulings restored, then abolished, abortion access multiple times, sometimes just hours apart.</p> <p>On 23 March, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, issued an <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/health-care-professionals-and-facilities-including-abortion-providers-must-immediately-stop-all\">executive order</a> halting all elective surgical procedures, specifically calling out abortion. Abortion providers sued on 25 March, a federal court agreed with them and blocked the state\u2019s order on 30 March.</p> <p>But the reprieve lasted only 21 hours. The fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, reinstated Texas\u2019s executive order on 31 March. The court\u2019s bench is arguably the most conservative in the nation, and is outwardly hostile to abortion rights.</p> <p>\u201cThey were open one day, and they were closed the next day, and they were allowed to do medication abortions one day, and not the next day,\u201d said Nikiya Natale, statewide manager of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps women pay for abortions.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had to cancel hundreds of appointments \u2026 and numerous times,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates clinics in Texas and four other states. Whole Woman\u2019s Health sued Texas to continue providing abortions. \u201cWomen are sobbing on the phone, begging,\u201d she said.

Three of them were Whole Woman\u2019s Health locations. That has left clinics across the state with a month\u2019s worth of patients on a waiting list.</p> <p>In other states, similar situations have played out. An epileptic woman in Tennessee with twins, premature infant daughters and a two-year-old son told a federal court of her attempt to get an abortion, when she was caught up in that state\u2019s ban.</p> <p>To prevent another pregnancy, she underwent a tubal ligation and used condoms as well. She was in disbelief when both failed. \u201cI feel science failed me,\u201d she told the court.</p> <p>When she tried to obtain an abortion, arguments were already under way in court.

      "bodyText": "A woman in Texas was isolating with her family. She was frightened and carried a secret: she was eight weeks pregnant. Even under normal circumstances, obtaining an abortion in Texas is described as \u201cmostly impossible\u201d. But during the Covid-19 pandemic, politicians in Texas and seven other states have worked to try to halt abortions entirely. They have undertaken costly lawsuits to restrict abortion in the name of health and safety, even as doctors lined up against them. Experts have described the order as the most chaotic 30 days since 2013, when Texas imposed severe restrictions on abortion clinics, later overturned by the supreme court. Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia have all seen confusion and intermittent bans as anti-abortion state politicians categorized abortion services as non-essential, and included abortion clinics in bans on elective surgical procedures. The orders have left women desperate, as appointments were cancelled, rescheduled and cancelled again subject to court rulings. \u201cI am scared to go outside,\u201d said the Texas woman, who the Guardian is not naming because her family is not aware she is pregnant and seeking an abortion. Her story was provided by We Testify, a group which collects women\u2019s stories of seeking abortions. \u201cI just saw the news about Ohio and that scared me that I can\u2019t get an abortion in time,\u201d she said about restrictions in that state. \u201cNow, they did it in Texas. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Abortion clinics across the US face existential threats under normal circumstances. Providers and clinics routinely face state harassment, angry protesters and threats of violence. Abortion providers said Covid-19 has exacerbated this fight, with some states claiming abortions need to be stopped during the pandemic to preserve hospital beds and personal protective equipment for workers. \u201cNo one is exempt from the governor\u2019s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,\u201d said the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, early in the pandemic. \u201cThose who violate the governor\u2019s order will be met with the full force of the law.\u201d Paxton did not return a call for comment. The American Medical Association, the country\u2019s largest association of physicians, has described such regulations as \u201cexploiting\u201d the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cInstead of saying, for example, \u2018There should be no abortion\u2019... [abortion opponents] are trying to create uncertainty about what the reality on the ground is,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and an expert on reproductive rights. At the same time, clinic directors have anecdotally reported a rise in demand amid the myriad uncertainties raised by the pandemic. More than 26 million Americans have lost jobs, with more unemployment claims expected, and at least 55,000 people have died as a result of the virus. One clinic in Wichita, Kansas, reported an almost threefold increase in patients, CBS reported. \u201cPeople are delaying all kinds of medical care to stay out of hospitals. You can\u2019t put a pregnancy on pause, so imagine being forced into that position \u2013 it must be terrifying\u201d, said the Very Reverend Katherine Hancock Ragsdale, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation said Texas politicians\u2019 decision to ban abortion set off a month-long ping-pong of court battles. As Covid-19 spread ferociously in the US in March and April, federal court rulings restored, then abolished, abortion access multiple times, sometimes just hours apart. On 23 March, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, issued an executive order halting all elective surgical procedures, specifically calling out abortion. Abortion providers sued on 25 March, a federal court agreed with them and blocked the state\u2019s order on 30 March. But the reprieve lasted only 21 hours. The fifth circuit court of appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana, reinstated Texas\u2019s executive order on 31 March. The court\u2019s bench is arguably the most conservative in the nation, and is outwardly hostile to abortion rights. \u201cThey were open one day, and they were closed the next day, and they were allowed to do medication abortions one day, and not the next day,\u201d said Nikiya Natale, statewide manager of the Texas Equal Access Fund, which helps women pay for abortions. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to cancel hundreds of appointments \u2026 and numerous times,\u201d said Amy Hagstrom Miller, founder and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, which operates clinics in Texas and four other states. Whole Woman\u2019s Health sued Texas to continue providing abortions. \u201cWomen are sobbing on the phone, begging,\u201d she said. The process, she said, felt like \u201cabuse\u201d. At one point, only four abortion clinics in Texas were open to serve a population of 5.8 million women of reproductive age, she said. Three of them were Whole Woman\u2019s Health locations. That has left clinics across the state with a month\u2019s worth of patients on a waiting list. In other states, similar situations have played out. An epileptic woman in Tennessee with twins, premature infant daughters and a two-year-old son told a federal court of her attempt to get an abortion, when she was caught up in that state\u2019s ban. To prevent another pregnancy, she underwent a tubal ligation and used condoms as well. She was in disbelief when both failed. \u201cI feel science failed me,\u201d she told the court. When she tried to obtain an abortion, arguments were already under way in court. One Friday in April, it was legal to get an abortion. But by Monday, before she could go to the clinic, it was banned. \u201cI was terrified again,\u201d she told the court. \u201cCaring for a toddler and two twin babies alone, while exhausted from and deeply anxious about an unwanted pregnancy, worrying every day that the pregnancy will suddenly leave me unable to care for my kids, and managing all of this in the midst of a pandemic.\u201d Monied interests have also come to support the bans. In just one example, one of Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorneys, Jay Sekulow, bragged about his faith-based not-for-profit legal centers support for Texas\u2019s abortion ban. \u201cThe [American Center for Law and Justice] has helped secure a huge victory for life in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals out of Texas,\u201d Sekulow tweeted. The back and forth has forced women, at least the few with means, to travel at an exceptionally dangerous time, boarding planes or driving out of state and violating stay-at-home orders. \u201cWe had someone who flew in from Texas,\u201d said Renee Chelian, founder of Northland Family Planning Clinics in Detroit, Michigan. \u201cShe had family here, but she got on a plane and flew. None of the rest of us are flying.\u201d When workers from Whole Woman Health\u2019s called to reschedule patients, some were in the car driving to neighboring Oklahoma and New Mexico.

Some of Chelian\u2019s clinic protesters, who are reliable regulars week-in and week-out, have joined pro-gun, anti-social-distancing rallies at the Michigan capitol of Lansing. \u201cAt the end of March, they were claiming as Christians they won\u2019t get the virus\u201d, she said.

      "bodyText": "Border Force officials carrying out passport and customs checks are being prevented from wearing face masks at work, staff claim, leaving them fearful that they must choose between their health or being disciplined. An order prohibiting officials from routinely wearing masks is said to have been given on 20 April. Some local managers had until then allowed staff to bring in and use their own protection. Two Border Force officials have died after contracting coronavirus in recent weeks. Only staff dealing with people who show symptoms of the virus or searching those clandestinely entering the country are provided with face masks. Managers have been told to ask staff to remove their masks in any other work situation, the Guardian understands. The Home Office did not deny the claim when it was put to a spokesman. The Immigration Services Union, representing officials working in the UK, Paris, Brussels, Lille, Calais, Dunkirk, Coquelles and Amsterdam, has advised its members to defy the Home Office, to which the Border Force answers.

      "bodyText": "Almost 1 million holidaymakers who were due to travel with Tui have had their trips cancelled after the company announced a fresh round of suspensions in response to the coronavirus crisis. The UK\u2019s biggest tour operator, which specialises in package breaks, said it was no longer able to offer beach holidays that involved travelling on or before 11 June. Cruises later in the year are also affected after the company postponed the launch of Tui River Cruises until 26 November. Tui had previously been forced to cancel holidays booked to take place before 14 May. It said the disruptions had affected a total of 900,000 people. The latest cancellations, which follow government advice against all but essential travel, affect 143,000 bookings and 400,000 holidaymakers. Customers will be sent a credit note in the first instance but can claim a refund if they do not want to reschedule. Those who opt for the credit note will receive an extra 20% to spend on a trip and have until 31 October 2021 to use the voucher. Travel firms have been coming under fire for their response to cancellations with many customers having problems getting their money back. Up to \u00a37bn could be owed for cancelled trips, and some companies appear to be stalling refunds. Last week Ryanair backtracked on its promise to process refunds within 20 working days and told customers they would now have to wait until the Covid-19 emergency has passed. The consumer group Which? said 20 of the UK\u2019s largest travel operators and airlines were breaking the law by not returning money to customers within 14 days. Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: \u201cTui\u2019s decision should allow customers who may be under financial pressure to start the process of getting their money back \u2013 but the company must ensure it is making the refund process as straightforward as possible, rather than pushing vouchers or credit notes.\u201d Tui said it was taking about 28 days to process refunds.

      "bodyText": "The England and Wales Cricket Board has been forced to push the Hundred\u2019s launch back to 2021 amid an admission from the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, that empty grounds are now the \u201conly option\u201d if the sport can somehow get under way this summer. And with the English game facing a potentially ruinous \u00a3300m loss in the event of coronavirus wiping out the season \u2013 1 July is the current start date but not remotely guaranteed \u2013 the ECB chief executive refused to rule out the idea of seeking private investors for the Hundred\u2019s eight mothballed teams. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Cricket Show, Harrison said: \u201cI think people are understanding that behind closed doors is our only option this year. The thought of crowds this summer is not something that is realistic in the context of the public health crisis.\u201d While it is hoped international cricket and the T20 Blast are possible in the event of a green light from the government, empty grounds and possible travel restrictions for overseas players meant the Hundred\u2019s 12-month delay was no surprise. But Harrison\u2019s apparent openness to external investment marks something of a sea-change in ECB thinking. Oakwell Sports Advisory, a consultancy firm that has worked previously with rugby investors CVC, recently produced a report that suggested the ECB look to sell equity stakes in the eight Hundred teams \u2013 including shares for the 18 first-class counties \u2013 as a way of raising capital. Co-authored by a former ECB employee, the Oakwell report suggested this model could open up possible tie-ins with Indian Premier League owners that, along with fresh money, might increase the possibility of India\u2019s star players featuring in future editions. Harrison said: \u201c[As regards the] point about opening opportunities for a different kind of business model, yes it does. Maybe coronavirus and the financial impact forces us to look at some of those opportunities. \u201cBut that is something we will do with the game, and certainly not something we will jump into, because we are broadly in a strong position. I am confident that, in partnership with the game, we can build our way out of this.\u201d Harrison claimed that the Hundred, under its current structure, was due to become just the second domestic league after the IPL to make a profit in its first year, stating the costs to be \u00a340m with projected revenues of \u00a351m. This does not, however, include the \u00a324m annual dividend paid to the 18 counties and the MCC. \u201cObviously that\u2019s all changed because of the situation that we\u2019re in, but it doesn\u2019t dilute the case for the Hundred and it doesn\u2019t dilute any of the excitement or the effort that we\u2019re going to be putting into it for 2021,\u201d Harrison said. As things stand the counties have each received roughly half of this year\u2019s promised \u00a31.3m payment from the Hundred as part of the \u00a361m rescue package announced in March. The first instalment of the ECB\u2019s new \u00a31.1bn five-year rights deal with Sky and BBC is said to have been paid but clearly the numbers down the line will be affected by the loss of major matches this year, such that there is already talk of an extra season needing to be added to the contract. The much-debated Hundred will also need a renewed marketing drive given an already drawn-out gestation period has been extended by 12 months, while the ECB is yet to confirm compensation for the 120 contracted players or whether another draft will be required. One issue is that a number of squads contain Kolpak players who currently qualify as \u2018locals\u2019 but will technically become overseas cricketers from 2021. It is just one detail to iron out amid an avalanche but Harrison is determined the competition must take place. He said: \u201cI have never wavered one bit about the validity of the case for the Hundred. I think it\u2019s definitely the case we made some mistakes in terms of how we presented it to the cricket market. \u201c[But] we took that one on the chin and since then we have been really clear about what the benefits of the Hundred are; the benefits for all we care about in cricket, our county institutions that been around for 150 years, four-day county cricket, Test cricket.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Senior figures in the Trump administration have put pressure on US intelligence agencies to provide evidence supporting claims that the coronavirus outbreak originated in state-run laboratories in China, a report in the New York Times claims. Intelligence analysts fear Donald Trump is looking for propaganda to be used in the escalating blame game over whether China covered up the crisis or even generated the virus in its laboratories. Trump has claimed that China\u2019s handling of the pandemic is proof that Beijing \u201cwill do anything they can\u201d to make him lose his re-election bid in November and told Reuters he was considering different forms of retaliation. The Washington Post reported that high-level meetings were under way in the White House to discuss options, including suing for compensation, which would involve stripping China of \u201csovereign immunity\u201d or cancelling debt obligations to China. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has repeatedly suggested that the coronavirus could have come from a virology laboratory in Wuhan, after cables surfaced from early 2018 in which US diplomats expressed concern about safety standards at the facility. The office of the director of national intelligence said in a statement on Thursday that it had concluded that the virus was \u201cnot manmade or genetically modified\u201d, but said that officials were still examining whether the origins of the pandemic could be traced to contact with infected animals or an accident at a Chinese lab. \u201cThe intelligence community [IC] also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.\u201d Most scientists who have studied the genetics of the coronavirus provided by China say that the overwhelming probability is that it leapt jumped from animal to human in a non-laboratory setting, as was the case with previous pandemics. In recent days Trump and his allies have sharpened their rhetoric on China, accusing it of failing to act swiftly enough to stop the spread of the virus or sound the alarm about the outbreak. Those reported as pushing US intelligence agencies to lend credence to the theory that the virus was created in Chinese labs include the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, the deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, and Richard Grenell, the acting director of national intelligence. In numerous TV interviews, Pompeo has said China suppressed information on the virus and withheld key facts from the World Health Organization, and he has hinted that he believes the virus originated in Chinese laboratories. But the suggestion that intelligence agencies are being put under pressure to produce evidence represents a step up from such comments. Such a finding would turn the international disaster into something akin to biological warfare, or a lab accident of catastrophic proportions. More than 1 million people have been infected and more than 60,000 have died in the US from the virus, adding political urgency to Trump\u2019s desire to shift blame for the crisis on to China. China has been resisting an international inquiry into the origins of the outbreak in Wuhan and, under pressure, says it is a matter for the WHO to investigate. The proposal is unlikely to mollify Trump, who has condemned the WHO as Chinese-centric and has suspended US funding from the UN agency pending a review. Chris Patten, the former governor general of Hong Kong and a long-term critic of Chinese efforts to control democracy in the former colony, has joined the calls for an international inquiry, accusing China of initially covering up the outbreak. The calls for an inquiry have been strongest in Australia, leading to a diplomatic confrontation between the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye. The calls have also been supported by Winston Peters, New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister. Peters said: \u201cIt is very hard to conceive, no matter what country it is, of there not being a desire from every country around the world \u2013 including the country of origin \u2013 for an investigation to find out how this happened.\u201d Cheng has warned of a Chinese boycott of Australian goods and services. Beijing has been caught in a bind, with its diplomats sometimes saying it is not even clear whether the virus originated in China, contending that it is a legitimate matter for inquiry by scientists, but then rejecting an international inquiry into the source of the outbreak. Chinese diplomats distinguish between an international inquiry, which they say is likely to be a political blame game, and a dispassionate examination by WHO scientists. Critics of China counter that the WHO\u2019s record shows it has neither the will nor the investigative powers required to look deep into the entrails of the Chinese Communist party and expose any cover-up. The WHO is dependent on the cooperation of its member states for access and has no mechanism to punish countries that keep its officials in the dark.

Unfortunately, measuring the impact of the virus is a fiendishly complex task. It\u2019s nothing like keeping score in a game. Starmer, as a lawyer, would know that we have to define our terms carefully. And so, assuming we want to make a comparison based on death rates, we first need to decide what a death rate is.</p> \n<p>You would think it would be easy for a bean-counting statistician to count deaths \u2013 the one certain thing (apart from taxes). But it is remarkably difficult. I have stopped taking much notice of the number given out at the daily press conferences, as it is only based on reports from hospitals, oscillates wildly around weekends, and recently included deaths that occurred a month ago.

      "bodyText": "At prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Keir Starmer said he had added up a total of 27,241 coronavirus deaths so far, leaving the UK \u201cpossibly on track to have the worst death rate in Europe\u201d. Is he right? Unfortunately, measuring the impact of the virus is a fiendishly complex task. It\u2019s nothing like keeping score in a game. Starmer, as a lawyer, would know that we have to define our terms carefully. And so, assuming we want to make a comparison based on death rates, we first need to decide what a death rate is. You would think it would be easy for a bean-counting statistician to count deaths \u2013 the one certain thing (apart from taxes). But it is remarkably difficult. I have stopped taking much notice of the number given out at the daily press conferences, as it is only based on reports from hospitals, oscillates wildly around weekends, and recently included deaths that occurred a month ago. And this week the number of UK deaths jumped up by nearly 5,000 to 26,097 in one day \u2013 rather close to Starmer\u2019s count \u2013 by retrospectively including non-hospital deaths that had tested positive for the virus. But even this is too low, as it does not include the many deaths of people who were not tested. The Office for National Statistics data on death registrations is the last word, although inevitably delayed by around 10 days, and these figures would be expected to take the current total to significantly more than 30,000. But we should be very cautious in comparing even this uncertain total with those of other countries. Every country has different ways of recording Covid-19 deaths: the large number of untested deaths in care homes have not featured in Spain\u2019s statistics \u2013 which, like the UK\u2019s require a positive test result. The numbers may be useful for looking at trends, but they are not reliable indicators for comparing the absolute levels.

Now she insisted on seeing him one last time by video link.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just so weird,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are looking at him and someone else is holding the phone. I managed to take a couple of screenshots. I was in shock, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d He looked blue, which she thought meant he had lacked oxygen before he died. He suffered from dementia, but otherwise had been reasonably healthy.</p> <p>Diana was full of praise for the care staff: \u201cThey are suffering just as much if not more than NHS staff. They have no protection for themselves but have had to watch the people who they have had a strong relationship with die without any medical care.\u201d</p> <p>She has been left feeling angry at the home\u2019s management, though, because after Harvey fell ill with a temperature and chest infection, she asked for daily calls with him and they did not happen.</p> <p>\u201cI feel absolutely gutted,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel completely lost. It is like a bad dream for me. I was not told he was going into a decline. They didn\u2019t tell me they thought he wasn\u2019t going to live. I could have spoken to him. I feel so let down by it all.\u201d</p> <p>She said his death was ascribed to dementia on the death certificate, but his symptoms and the speed of his decline indicated Covid-19. The last proper conversation she had with him was on the Thursday before Easter when he told her he didn\u2019t feel well.</p> <p>\u201cI told him I loved him and he told me he loved me.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Susan and Ruby Birch</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI have been sick with anxiety,\u201d said Susan Birch, whose mother, Ruby Birch, was diagnosed with Covid-19 on 22 April in her Birmingham care home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80cb93c51cf6e96e3198bb374bdf9bb3396913b9/0_0_800_1200/667.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Birch, top, talking to her mother Ruby Birch by Skype in her care home\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susan Birch, top, talking to her mother on Skype.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It did not help when the call came saying she was being placed into isolation so they could not speak to her for a week. Ruby, 76, who suffers from mental health problems, relied on social contact and entertainment in the home. All that was gone.</p> <p>The family sent in a mobile phone.</p> <p>\u201cEvery time I speak to her I bear in mind there may not be another chance,\u201d Susan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she is going to take a turn for the worse. I try to make the most of it and listen to everything she says. I have a keyboard and play Amazing Grace and we sing together.\u201d One day, Susan dug out a recording of her late father talking and played that back to her mother via Skype.</p> <p>The inability to find out what is happening in the home causes a lot of worry. Susan relies on \u201csnatched phone conversations with care workers\u201d. She does not understand why the manager has not contacted her.</p> <p>\u201cI saw care workers in the background in a Skype call a few weeks ago with zero PPE on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are trying to source some from my husband\u2019s employer in Brighton. He works for a company now using 3D printers to produce face shields. Hopefully these will be delivered soon.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Fara and Sheila Yasamee</strong></h2> <p>Sheila Yasamee, 96, a former midwife and mother of five, has lived in a care home in Bexhill, East Sussex, since September. But after the first Covid-19 death there last week and more infections this week, her family are considering getting her out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be21e4c2a73f2b909baefae41fbc81834394f6d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be21e4c2a73f2b909baefae41fbc81834394f6d9/0_0_2448_3264/750.jpg\" alt=\"Fara Yasamee with her mother, Sheila Yasamee.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fara Yasamee with her mother, Sheila Yasamee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: none</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extremely difficult,\u201d said her daughter, Fara Yasamee. \u201cIt may well come down to life or death. This is spreading and [puts] her health and life in real danger \u2026 She may die there because of it.\u201d</p> <p>The local GP has stressed that Sheila needs 24-hour care and equipment which cannot be guaranteed beyond the care home, and the local social care officials insist the choice is Sheila\u2019s. Plus her family realise that they would have to go into isolation to look after her to avoid infecting her themselves \u2013 and that could go on for months.</p> <p>Sheila \u201cdoes not really understand the situation and can\u2019t make an informed decision about whether to stay or not\u201d, Fara said. Her mother was \u201cgetting very low and depressed being in isolation and not seeing family \u2026 She keeps asking, how much longer is this going on?\u201d</p> <p>Since visits were stopped, Fara has spoken to Sheila regularly by phone but it is becoming frustrating not knowing what care is being delivered, what personal protective equipment staff are using, whether workers are sick or how many people are looking after her mother.</p> <p>\u201cI get the feeling that the care home is not being that transparent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation. It feels like whatever decision we take is not going to be right.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Katrina and Pat Wheeler</strong></h2> <p>On 20 April, Katrina Wheeler heard that coronavirus had entered the care home where her 81-year-old mother, Pat, lives 300 miles away. It meant Pat and the other residents would be confined to their rooms indefinitely.</p> <p>\u201cShe feels that she is imprisoned,\u201d said Katrina. \u201cShe knows why, but she can\u2019t make the connection with her being on her own.\u201d Pat, who has mental health difficulties, is struggling without being able to see her closest friend in the home, with whom she used to share much of her time.</p> <p>\u201cI feel guilty that I can\u2019t take her away from the environment and make her safe,\u201d said Katrina. She also spoke of difficulty getting information about how the outbreak is being handled.</p> <p>\u201cThey are not being forthcoming,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are probably extremely busy and it\u2019s the last thing on their mind, but information is really important in terms of what is going on.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday this week they were told that Pat was being tested for Covid-19 after showing symptoms.</p> <p>\u201cShe might not test positive but she is going to be in isolation until at least the end of the year,\u201d said Katrina. \u201cHow is she going to be able to cope with that?\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Cathy Gard</strong><strong>ner and Michael Gibson</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt was just awful, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d said Dr Cathy Gardner. A carer at her father\u2019s care home 150 miles away had called twice to say her 88-year-old father, Michael Gibson, was deteriorating with probable Covid-19 and she should come.</p> <p>After driving as fast as they could from Devon to the care home in Bicester, Gardner and her husband decided they could not go in and risk her mother catching the virus. So they looked at Michael, a former superintendent registrar of births, marriages and deaths, through the window instead.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you expect the situation to be at the end of someone\u2019s life and you can\u2019t be there and you can\u2019t hold his hand,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cHe looked peaceful, the staff were brilliant but not being with him was terrible.\u201d</p> <p>He was living at the home in Bicester because he had severe Alzheimer\u2019s.</p> <p>He had a chest infection five weeks ago and the GP was worried it was coronavirus, but they did not travel to see him because of the lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cI felt guilty. I felt we should be doing the right thing and shouldn\u2019t make the journey. You don\u2019t want to break the rules. Then one of his carers phoned us to tell us to come. We waited a bit but then she phoned again and said she didn\u2019t think he would survive as she\u2019d seen this before. Her own father had died the week before in the room next to my dad.\u201d</p> <p>Gardner said four other residents had died at the home and the number might be higher. She felt her father\u2019s death could have been prevented and was critical of the lack of testing of staff and residents. \u201cIt should have been a matter of course for care homes.\u201d she said. \u201cThe most vulnerable sector of the population and you decide not to test. That\u2019s bordering on manslaughter, in my view.\u201d</p> <p>As for the urgent drive to Bicester, she said: \u201cI was glad I saw him, as he died the next evening.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Himani Weir and Octavia Jayasuriya</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1272daa28f7d211f31eb2c0978abba41c26636bd/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Himani Weir.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Himani Weir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Himani Weir now wishes she had broken her mother out of the care home in south-east London where she died of a confirmed case Covid-19 on 16 April.

      "bodyText": "Being a relative of a care home resident today means guilt, frustration and fear. With close to 2,400 residents a week dying from the virus and predictions of a death toll higher than in hospitals, the anguish of not being able to hold loved ones is compounded by struggles to find out what is happening inside locked-down homes and concerns about exposure to the virus because of a lack of protective kit. Here, relatives speak out. June Findlater and David Thorburn \u201cWe thought he was safer than any of us,\u201d said June Findlater, whose 98-year-old father, David Thorburn, died from Covid-19 on Tuesday morning in a council care home near Glasgow. Three weeks ago, families were told the virus had arrived in the home with the shocking news a resident was dead. David, a \u201cvery dignified\u201d former engineering lecturer and Robert Burns enthusiast who \u201cenjoyed his meals\u201d, was suddenly at risk. \u201cIt was the first we heard,\u201d said June. \u201cMy heart sank. I knew there would be panic. Then there was another death. We started to think \u2018oh, no\u2019. Plus dad had a new cough.\u201d Information about what was happening was hard to glean and sometimes apparently contradictory. Last Wednesday, the message was that David was sitting up singing songs; the next day he stopped eating and drinking. \u201cIt was awful,\u201d June said. \u201cI wanted to go in [wearing] a black bin liner \u2013 home-made. We struggled to get feedback from staff. It\u2019s not about blame, we just wanted to be communicated with.\u201d What the family had not been told was that the GP had already concluded that David was suffering from Covid-19, and had written a prescription to treat him. They only found out four days later. \u201cWe know the care was good, but the communication has left us so disappointed.\u201d He died peacefully on Tuesday morning. But for June, who is still trying to find out exactly what happened, one thing is already clear: the residents were \u201csitting ducks\u201d. Diana and Harvey Samuels It was midnight on Easter Sunday when Diana Samuels last saw her husband, Harvey. The 82-year-old had died 90 minutes earlier of suspected Covid-19 in a care home in Harrow. For weeks, the only contact between them had been a weekly 20-minute WhatsApp video call. That was all that the home would arrange for residents during lockdown. Now she insisted on seeing him one last time by video link. \u201cIt was just so weird,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are looking at him and someone else is holding the phone. I managed to take a couple of screenshots. I was in shock, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d He looked blue, which she thought meant he had lacked oxygen before he died. He suffered from dementia, but otherwise had been reasonably healthy. Diana was full of praise for the care staff: \u201cThey are suffering just as much if not more than NHS staff. They have no protection for themselves but have had to watch the people who they have had a strong relationship with die without any medical care.\u201d She has been left feeling angry at the home\u2019s management, though, because after Harvey fell ill with a temperature and chest infection, she asked for daily calls with him and they did not happen. \u201cI feel absolutely gutted,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel completely lost.

It did not help when the call came saying she was being placed into isolation so they could not speak to her for a week. Ruby, 76, who suffers from mental health problems, relied on social contact and entertainment in the home. All that was gone. The family sent in a mobile phone. \u201cEvery time I speak to her I bear in mind there may not be another chance,\u201d Susan said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she is going to take a turn for the worse. I try to make the most of it and listen to everything she says. I have a keyboard and play Amazing Grace and we sing together.\u201d One day, Susan dug out a recording of her late father talking and played that back to her mother via Skype. The inability to find out what is happening in the home causes a lot of worry. Susan relies on \u201csnatched phone conversations with care workers\u201d. She does not understand why the manager has not contacted her. \u201cI saw care workers in the background in a Skype call a few weeks ago with zero PPE on,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are trying to source some from my husband\u2019s employer in Brighton. He works for a company now using 3D printers to produce face shields. Hopefully these will be delivered soon.\u201d Fara and Sheila Yasamee Sheila Yasamee, 96, a former midwife and mother of five, has lived in a care home in Bexhill, East Sussex, since September.

The 5ft 11in pick-and-roll savant became the first ever player \u2013 male or female \u2013 to surpass 2,000 points, 1,000 assists and 1,000 rebounds, while her 26 career triple-doubles shattered the previous record of 12 held by BYU\u2019s Kyle Collinsworth.</p> <p>This month, Ionescu (pronounced <em>yo-NESS-coo</em>) was selected by the New York Liberty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/wnba-draft-sabrina-ionescu-new-york-liberty\">with the No 1 overall pick in the WNBA draft</a>: a dream marriage of a budding 23-year-old superstar with the country\u2019s largest media market. A lucrative sneaker deal with Nike immediately followed. The sky, it would seem, is the limit.</p> <p>And it all might never have happened if she had taken no for an answer back at Walnut Creek Intermediate School.</p> <p>\u201cThe after-school program at my middle school didn\u2019t have enough girls for a team and they wouldn\u2019t allow me to play on the boys\u2019 team,\u201d Ionescu told the Guardian last week. \u201cSo I had to find a bunch of girls who were willing to play. Which I did.\u201d</p> <p>A daughter of Romanian immigrants who fled their homeland after the 1989 revolution, Ionescu took to basketball \u201cjust trying to keep up\u201d with her brothers in the driveway while growing up the San Francisco suburbs. An avid NBA fan, she modeled her game after her idols: Curry, Monta Ellis and John Stockton. \u201cI started falling in love with the game and playing more and more,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I realized this is what I want to do for the rest of my life and for as long as I can.\u201d</p> <p>Ionescu became one of the country\u2019s most sought-after prospects during a decorated career at Miramonte High School, where she poured in a school-record 2,606 points while leading the team to a 119\u20139 record over four years. She chose to play collegiately at Oregon over schools with far richer women\u2019s basketball traditions for the opportunity to build something from the ground up. \u201cI wanted to be a part of something,\u201d she explains. \u201cTo grow a program and grow the university into what it is today. I\u2019m excited to be able to say I was a part of that.\u201d</p> <p>Oregon coach Kelly Graves has regularly noted that Ionescu is not the fastest player on the floor and not the strongest, but no one wants to win more. That competitive fire drew the attention of NBA legend Kobe Bryant and the pair struck up a friendship after he attended an Oregon game at USC with his daughter Gianna in January 2019. \u201cThe basketball world is small, so we connected and spent time together from there,\u201d she says. \u201cIt meant everything to me.

The source said only \u201climited progress in bridging the gaps between us\u201d had been made at last week\u2019s talks, but there was \u201cconfidence that progress can be made quite quickly\u201d. The two sides will have to come closer to an agreement before a high-level meeting between ministers planned for June if the UK is to stay at the negotiating table. Boris Johnson is expected to take a more active role in trying to help unblock talks if that date approaches with no breakthrough. The source close to the UK\u2019s negotiating team said last week\u2019s talks, conducted by video conference, worked well but it was more difficult to build up a personal rapport when communicating remotely.

The reality show, which has been vital to ITV\u2019s financial performance in recent years, has already been delayed from its traditional June start date owing to the coronavirus pandemic. ITV\u2019s director of television, Kevin Lygo, said the production team had looked at filming Love Island in Cornwall later in the summer but had concerns that \u201cmaking it in the UK would not be the same show\u201d. He told a virtual session of the Edinburgh television festival that a final decision on whether to cancel the programme, which employs around 200 staff, would be made in the coming weeks.

      "body": "<p>With a horrifying toll of more than 26,000 people losing their lives from Covid-19, the UK has a dark cloud over it with many, including myself, trying to find hope and waiting to get closer to the light at the end of the tunnel. It is a huge test of patience and resolve.</p> <p>So many industries are on hold and trying to plan in a period full of uncertainty. Football is no different. Still we do not know when football will be back in this country, and in what form.</p> <p>In Spain, Germany and Italy teams are back in training or know they soon will be but in the UK we continue to wait. It may be the Premier League is delaying its decision until we have seen what happens in the countries that have been bold enough to make their own. Nothing can happen without government approval and the lockdown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/29/uk-government-at-least-a-week-away-from-giving-sport-the-green-light\" title=\"\">will not be eased until 7 May</a> at the earliest but I hope football can return in the foreseeable future \u2013 and perhaps, as far as fans are concerned, the doors don\u2019t have to be closed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/29/many-womens-football-clubs-are-short-of-backroom-staff-fifpro-survey-says\">Many women's football clubs are short of backroom staff, Fifpro survey says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of the ideas being batted around for the Premier League \u2013 to play in Dubai, or in camps, or in training grounds \u2013 sound unlikely but these are the conversations we should be having as we search for a way to finish the season. The government is keen for football to lift the spirits of the population. We will need to be ready.</p> <p>Without a vaccine, nothing except isolation will be entirely risk-free but we can find solutions that minimise risk as much as possible. Perhaps if enough community testing is done to know the virus is not getting out of control, plus reduced capacities at stadiums, mandatory masks and plenty of gloves and hand sanitiser, there could be a way to go back to football while keeping the risk to our health at minimal levels.</p> <p>Testing of players will also be important to ensure their health and safety. Daily health checks can be done before training and, of course, matches: everything from resting heart rates to the colour of urine can be measured on a normal day, so I envisage regular testing for Covid-19 is more than feasible.</p> <p>Without wishing in any way to play down this virus, we need to look for ways to reopen as many sectors of our economy as possible and I believe in the absence of a vaccine there must be an acceptable level of risk. The stakes are incredibly high \u2013 playing entirely behind closed doors, and even more so not completing the season at all, would mean huge losses, and perhaps risking the future of some clubs entirely.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7cdb154aa0d1b42e20e8afb3d8870ebe76cb58e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7cdb154aa0d1b42e20e8afb3d8870ebe76cb58e/0_99_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Within a week of starting my new role at Aston Villa, I was dealing with games being cancelled\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Within a week of starting my new role at Aston Villa, I was dealing with games being cancelled\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am extremely lucky the last couple of months have been professionally rewarding. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/22/eni-aluko-takes-job-as-aston-villa-womens-director-of-football\" title=\"\">My appointment as Aston Villa\u2019s sporting director for women\u2019s football</a> was announced in January but I only started in March. Within a week I was dealing with games being cancelled, training on hold, operational changes and contracts.

      "bodyText": "With a horrifying toll of more than 26,000 people losing their lives from Covid-19, the UK has a dark cloud over it with many, including myself, trying to find hope and waiting to get closer to the light at the end of the tunnel. It is a huge test of patience and resolve. So many industries are on hold and trying to plan in a period full of uncertainty. Football is no different. Still we do not know when football will be back in this country, and in what form. In Spain, Germany and Italy teams are back in training or know they soon will be but in the UK we continue to wait. It may be the Premier League is delaying its decision until we have seen what happens in the countries that have been bold enough to make their own. Nothing can happen without government approval and the lockdown will not be eased until 7 May at the earliest but I hope football can return in the foreseeable future \u2013 and perhaps, as far as fans are concerned, the doors don\u2019t have to be closed. Some of the ideas being batted around for the Premier League \u2013 to play in Dubai, or in camps, or in training grounds \u2013 sound unlikely but these are the conversations we should be having as we search for a way to finish the season. The government is keen for football to lift the spirits of the population. We will need to be ready. Without a vaccine, nothing except isolation will be entirely risk-free but we can find solutions that minimise risk as much as possible. Perhaps if enough community testing is done to know the virus is not getting out of control, plus reduced capacities at stadiums, mandatory masks and plenty of gloves and hand sanitiser, there could be a way to go back to football while keeping the risk to our health at minimal levels. Testing of players will also be important to ensure their health and safety. Daily health checks can be done before training and, of course, matches: everything from resting heart rates to the colour of urine can be measured on a normal day, so I envisage regular testing for Covid-19 is more than feasible. Without wishing in any way to play down this virus, we need to look for ways to reopen as many sectors of our economy as possible and I believe in the absence of a vaccine there must be an acceptable level of risk. The stakes are incredibly high \u2013 playing entirely behind closed doors, and even more so not completing the season at all, would mean huge losses, and perhaps risking the future of some clubs entirely. I am extremely lucky the last couple of months have been professionally rewarding. My appointment as Aston Villa\u2019s sporting director for women\u2019s football was announced in January but I only started in March. Within a week I was dealing with games being cancelled, training on hold, operational changes and contracts. I don\u2019t think any master\u2019s course could have prepared me for coronavirus hitting in my first month but in a way it\u2019s been great to be thrown in the deep end immediately and make important decisions in an unprecedented period. Though I\u2019m staying with my mum and all my siblings and working from home, I have tried as much as possible to keep working as I did before the lockdown, to continue that forward momentum. I know we may have to adapt if something else happens but the women\u2019s team are looking forward to returning, being in a strong position in the league and hopefully winning our last six games. There is no guarantee we will be promoted this year but we have to be prepared if and when football returns. I think everyone will have found it difficult sometimes to motivate players during lockdown but we have such a strong team of coaches, sports scientists and conditioning coaches that the players have always known exactly what to focus their training on.

Beckham, whose net worth is estimated at \u00a3335m and who had been sharing images on social media from the family\u2019s luxury lockdown at home in Oxfordshire when the news broke, was heavily criticised for a claim which would have cost about \u00a3150,000 in government funds.</p> \n<p>The furlough scheme has becoming a lightning rod for high emotion around how the huge economic burden of the crisis is to be shared between taxpayers and wealthy individuals and businesses.</p> \n<p>Beckham\u2019s reversal follows a pattern seen at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/06/liverpool-reverse-decision-to-furlough-staff-after-fierce-criticism-coronavirus\">Liverpool </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/tottenham-make-u-turn-on-decision-to-furlough-staff-after-fans-fierce-criticism\">Tottenham football clubs</a>. Both initially announced they would furlough non-playing staff, applying to the government-funded job retention scheme for financial support, but subsequently had a change of heart.</p> \n<p>In a letter to fans the Liverpool\u2019s chief executive, Peter Moore, said: \u201cWe believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, a source close to Beckham denied that the reversal had been prompted by the backlash, saying that she \u201cis well aware of the intense scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye, and doesn\u2019t complain about it\u201d.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the board said that the company \u201cnow believe that with the support of our shareholders, we can navigate through this crisis without drawing from the furlough scheme\u201d.</p> \n<p>Online sales of Victoria Beckham clothing since lockdown have exceeded the revised forecasts drawn up by the business at the onset of the crisis, and although Britain remains in lockdown crucial links in the international supply chain are now emerging from mothballing.</p> \n<p>All of the Italian factories which produce the label\u2019s garments are scheduled to be up and running by 11 May. Beckham is said to be keen to get back to designing the next collection \u2013 although the catwalk schedule is currently on pause, with fashion weeks in June and July cancelled and the major September shows in London, New York, Milan and Paris likely to be scaled down, postponed, or otherwise reimagined.</p> \n<p>The backtracking reflects signs of cautious optimism in the fashion industry, as some regions of the globe begin the process of reopening after the crisis.</p> \n<p>Predictions that quarantine would cause seismic shifts in consumer behaviour and snuff out demand for fashion and luxury in the long term are being called into question by recent reports from China.</p> \n<p>On 11 April, the first day of reopening, the Hermes boutique in Guangzhou took $2.7m, the brand\u2019s highest ever single day takings. The phenomenon is being dubbed \u201crevenge spending\u201d.</p> \n<p>The furore highlights the delicate position that Victoria Beckham and her brand occupy in British public life. As a designer she has a huge brand name, but a relatively small business. Against the global luxury giants against whom she competes for customers, her label is a minnow.</p> \n<p>Having taken \u00a330m in investment from Neo Investment Holdings three years ago, the designer and her husband own 47% of her label, with the majority owned by the board. The brand has established itself as one of the most respected and influential fashion houses on the show circuit, but has yet to turn a profit.</p> \n<p>The family star power of \u201cBrand Beckham\u201d brings her label the kind of public interest most designers can only dream of. The front row line-up of David Beckham and the couple\u2019s four children next to Anna Wintour has become an iconic fashion week image. But the Beckhams\u2019 status brings with it an expectation that Victoria is to be judged not as a fashion designer, but as a public figure.</p> \n<p>Before this crisis, the label is thought to have been on course to break even this year. Beckham has foregone her salary for the foreseeable future, and she and other shareholders are planning to put in more investment to keep the business functioning through the crisis.</p>",

The furlough scheme has becoming a lightning rod for high emotion around how the huge economic burden of the crisis is to be shared between taxpayers and wealthy individuals and businesses. Beckham\u2019s reversal follows a pattern seen at Liverpool and Tottenham football clubs. Both initially announced they would furlough non-playing staff, applying to the government-funded job retention scheme for financial support, but subsequently had a change of heart. In a letter to fans the Liverpool\u2019s chief executive, Peter Moore, said: \u201cWe believe we came to the wrong conclusion last week and are truly sorry for that.\u201d However, a source close to Beckham denied that the reversal had been prompted by the backlash, saying that she \u201cis well aware of the intense scrutiny that comes with being in the public eye, and doesn\u2019t complain about it\u201d. A spokesperson for the board said that the company \u201cnow believe that with the support of our shareholders, we can navigate through this crisis without drawing from the furlough scheme\u201d. Online sales of Victoria Beckham clothing since lockdown have exceeded the revised forecasts drawn up by the business at the onset of the crisis, and although Britain remains in lockdown crucial links in the international supply chain are now emerging from mothballing. All of the Italian factories which produce the label\u2019s garments are scheduled to be up and running by 11 May. Beckham is said to be keen to get back to designing the next collection \u2013 although the catwalk schedule is currently on pause, with fashion weeks in June and July cancelled and the major September shows in London, New York, Milan and Paris likely to be scaled down, postponed, or otherwise reimagined. The backtracking reflects signs of cautious optimism in the fashion industry, as some regions of the globe begin the process of reopening after the crisis. Predictions that quarantine would cause seismic shifts in consumer behaviour and snuff out demand for fashion and luxury in the long term are being called into question by recent reports from China. On 11 April, the first day of reopening, the Hermes boutique in Guangzhou took $2.7m, the brand\u2019s highest ever single day takings. The phenomenon is being dubbed \u201crevenge spending\u201d. The furore highlights the delicate position that Victoria Beckham and her brand occupy in British public life. As a designer she has a huge brand name, but a relatively small business. Against the global luxury giants against whom she competes for customers, her label is a minnow. Having taken \u00a330m in investment from Neo Investment Holdings three years ago, the designer and her husband own 47% of her label, with the majority owned by the board. The brand has established itself as one of the most respected and influential fashion houses on the show circuit, but has yet to turn a profit. The family star power of \u201cBrand Beckham\u201d brings her label the kind of public interest most designers can only dream of. The front row line-up of David Beckham and the couple\u2019s four children next to Anna Wintour has become an iconic fashion week image. But the Beckhams\u2019 status brings with it an expectation that Victoria is to be judged not as a fashion designer, but as a public figure. Before this crisis, the label is thought to have been on course to break even this year. Beckham has foregone her salary for the foreseeable future, and she and other shareholders are planning to put in more investment to keep the business functioning through the crisis.",

The closing segment features Lucinda Chua playing cello and Yussef Dayes on drums: a small reminder of London\u2019s fervent collaborative jazz scene. As for life in quarantine, she says: \u201cI thought: OK, I\u2019m in Pakistan, I need to try and do some sort of music. I managed to buy an acoustic guitar from a shop here, just a couple of days before the lockdown.\u201d Hours spent perfecting Nick Drake melodies have followed. \u201cIt\u2019s retaught me the special nature of actually just playing the instrument and not having anything else; trying to come up with ideas, just me and a guitar.\u201d With live performances facing an uncertain future, now is a good time to be songwriting. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s probably thinking: I need to make a banger,\u201d Iqbal says, laughing. \u201cJust live off royalties and not have to worry about playing gigs ever again.\u201d It is certainly one option, but she also articulates a sense of shared anxiety, both financial and artistic. \u201cThe coronavirus situation has made me rethink the whole process of being a DJ, and as a musician who makes most of their money from gigs. When you have to worry more about finances, it\u2019s also harder to focus on being creative. If there\u2019s no end in sight, then we need an alternative.\u201d In Karachi, Iqbal is grateful for the extra family time. \u201cMe and my grandad tried twice to drive to the seaside, but both times we got stopped at police roadblocks,\u201d she says. My mind jumps to recent news reports of brutal police suppression during the pandemic, but she assures me these officers were \u201cactually all right\u201d. Iqbal\u2019s situation is unique: far from home, but simultaneously closer than ever to her roots. For south Asians, the latter normally entails full culinary immersion. \u201cMy grandma makes really good aubergine dishes, so we\u2019ve been eating a lot of aubergine. And bhindi \u2013 well, in English, it\u2019s okra \u2013 too,\u201d Iqbal says. \u201cBeing in Pakistan, all the fresh fruit and veg just tastes so good: guavas, watermelons, oranges, chikoos [sapodilla].\u201d She has also taken to sharing Pakistani herbal remedies on Instagram, dubbing herself the Lockdown Herbalist. She has introduced her followers to bairi and neem trees, aloe vera from source and digestion aids such as ispaghol. Iqbal is quick to point out the western ironies. \u201cIn England, it\u2019s just a very bougie thing; you\u2019ll go into Whole Foods and you\u2019re like: what\u2019s trending? What health supplement can I try today?\u201d she says with a chuckle. \u201cWhereas, when you come to a country like Pakistan, it\u2019s very ancient; all of these things are ingrained in the society and culture for thousands of years. My grandma would literally have a heart attack if she saw they were selling little pots of turmeric in posh London chemists for \u00a350.\u201d By the time she returns, London will have changed irrevocably from when she left. \u201cI guess the atmosphere\u2019s going to be quite sombre,\u201d says Iqbal, who, coordinating with others online, has been pressuring the high commission for Pakistan and Westminster MPs for answers. I suggest that they are at the mercy of a confused repatriation policy, with the foreign office advising Britons to take commercial flights home from Pakistan, despite its strict lockdown. \u201cIt does feel that way a bit. It shouldn\u2019t be, because even if there\u2019s just one British citizen stranded somewhere, it\u2019s the duty of the British government to make sure that person can get home safely,\u201d she says. Despite her lost music, Iqbal remains grateful in the face of the crisis: \u201cYou just realise that nothing else really matters except being with your family.\u201d",

The ECB president spoke hours after the EU\u2019s statistical agency Eurostat reported the sharpest decline in eurozone activity since monetary union was launched more than two decades ago. France and Italy, the second and third biggest economies in the monetary union area, fell into recession as the EU\u2019s statistical agency Eurostat reported a bigger fall in gross domestic product in the quarter ending in March than the financial markets had been expecting.

I can\u2019t put a number on that, but that trend was happening anyway and will be vastly accelerated by the impact of coronavirus.\u201d Andrew Goodacre, the chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, told MPs that 20% of its members may not reopen because it would be more expensive for them to run their shops if footfall is low. The evidence from other countries such as Germany, where shops have started to reopen, suggests retail will be depressed for some time, said Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium. She and the heads of the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) urged the government to taper off the Covid-19 business support measures gradually, to avoid a cliff edge if they are withdrawn fully. Adam Marshall, of the BCC, warned that otherwise \u201cyou\u2019re going to see a lot more businesses heading into insolvency\u201d. Speaking on behalf of retailers, Dickinson said: \u201cThe government really mustn\u2019t turn off the tap once restrictions are lifted or when we get to the end of June, because there is no way that demand is going to just revert to what it was before. Certainly I have no doubt that people will be very cautious about how they shop for safety reasons and because of the pressure on money in their pocket.\u201d",

Two new centre forwards, if one of them was Gary Bull\u201d \u2013 Jon Millard. \u201cI\u2019m a permanently disappointed Newcastle United fan and I can\u2019t decide what disappoints me most \u2013 the fact a morally bankrupt regime is going to buy the club and play real life Fantasy Football with it, or the obsession so many of my fellow fans have with tempting Rafa back from his \u2018incredible project\u2019 in China\u201d \u2013 Daniel Kennedy. \u201cRe: \u2018The Fiver can\u2019t go on like this\u2019 [Wednesday\u2019s Fiver]. Why not? You have been since I started reading\u201d \u2013 Guy Robert. It\u2019s been six weeks since you succeeded in STOPPING FOOTBALL, yet still the Fiver plops into my mailbox every weekday. I don\u2019t know how you manage to keep coming up with interesting, informative and amusing content. Oh\u201d \u2013 Robert Blanchard. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Ferg Slade. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The president of the Haitian FA, Yves Jean-Bart, has been accused of sexually abusing young female footballers at the country\u2019s national training centre. The former Stoke and Reading forward Dave Kitson says he is \u201cready, willing and able\u201d to lead reforms at the PFA after criticising the handling of the coronavirus crisis. \u201cThe fact that certain individual Premier League players felt the need to act independently in their response is nothing short of embarrassing,\u201d Kitson seethed. Liverpool have said they are \u201cdisappointed\u201d after the city\u2019s mayor, Joe Anderson, claimed \u201cmany thousands of people would turn up outside Anfield\u201d for title celebrations if the season resumes. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl has revealed the one positive to come from Southampton\u2019s 9-0 shellacking at the hands of Leicester: a text from Lord Ferg after the game. \u201cI received an SMS from [Ferg],\u201d the Austrian purred. \u201cIf I had never lost 9-0 I would have never had contact with him. That was the positive thing from the result.\u201d In a move that has in no way come back to haunt them, the Premier League wrote to US trade officials in February urging further monitoring of Saudi Arabia and describing the country as \u201ca centre for [TV] piracy\u201d. And PSG have officially been crowned Ligue Urrrrrrn champions after the 2019-20 season was scrapped. The plucky upstarts were 12 points clear of Marseille with a game in hand when football was suspended in France. STILL WANT MORE? From Edin Dzeko to Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto, here are 10 more Premier League players who didn\u2019t get the respect they deserved. And in case you missed it, here\u2019s part one. Eni Aluko\u2019s start to life as a sporting director with Aston Villa did not go to plan, but she thinks bringing football back in any form will lift our spirits. The Premier League have some tough decisions to make in Big Phonecall on Friday with \u201cProject Restart\u201d in the balance, writes David Hytner. Ed Aarons fires up the PowerPoint and gives you the lowdown on the Premier League\u2019s completely-insane-but-we-would-probably-still-watch plan to play out the season. My Favourite Game continues!

I want to look you in the eye and say thank you.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Samantha Bee</h2> <p>On Full Frontal, Samantha Bee called attention to the US postal service, an essential, if often overlooked, institution in dire financial straits. It\u2019s hard to get excited about the postal service, Bee admitted, but it\u2019s \u201chot as hell \u2026 I mean the workers wear knee shorts, they give it to us in the rain, sleet and snow, and they\u2019re the only federal agency built entirely around on the principle of licking stuff.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbsfYPJwV1I\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JbsfYPJwV1I?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But without financial assistance from the government, it will run out of cash in June. Congressional Republicans rejected funding for the postal service in the latest stimulus bill, as Trump called it a \u201cjoke\u201d and claimed it undercharges Amazon for its packages (his administration has debunked this) on account of his personal obsession with Jeff Bezos for owning the Washington Post.</p> <p>The postal service, crucial for mail-in voting, has seen volume drop by a third, more than 1,200 workers out with coronavirus and many more concerned about lack of basic supplies and protections on the job. Still, it\u2019s \u201cone of the only federal agencies directly authorized in the constitution, and it\u2019s one of the most democratic institutions we have\u201d, Bee explained.</p> <p>\u201cBut even if their voters like it, Republican leaders hate when the government actually works,\u201d Bee added. \u201cThey\u2019re been trying to undermine the postal service for decades, going back to 1982, when Ronald Reagan signed a law requiring NBC\u2019s Thursday night lineup to feature at least one asshole mailman at all times.\u201d In all seriousness, Republicans have in recent years tried to lower wages, reduce benefits and cut routes in an effort to privatize the service. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to expect the post office to be a money-making enterprise! It\u2019s a public good,\u201d Bee said. \u201cExpecting the post office to turn a profit is like expecting public libraries to sell the right to use their bathroom.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1255692600343883776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A look at how COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on the food supply chain around the world: <a href=\"https://t.co/IPqV4wAKmg\">pic.twitter.com/IPqV4wAKmg</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1255692600343883776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed food supply fears, as meat-processing plants across the country shut down due to coronavirus updates. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/trump-executive-order-meat-processing-plants-coronavirus\">Trump signed an executive order</a> under the Defense Production Act to keep some processing plants open and running at maximum capacity. \u201cYou know, I will say this about Trump: he is very clear about what his priorities are in life,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBecause he was warned for months about the pandemic coming to America and he did practically nothing. But you tell the man once that there could be a beef shortage and he springs into action like the world\u2019s hungriest superhero.\u201d</p> <p>Still, few places in America have experienced higher rates of coronavirus than meat-processing plants. And \u201calthough there doesn\u2019t seem to be a danger to the food itself, in most of these facilities, the workers are quite literally putting their lives on the line\u201d. At many plants, several thousand employees work in close proximity; workers have alleged they were given hairnets to use as face masks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really sad that these workers are being forced to keep the food chain going but nobody is being forced to protect them while they do it,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cThey need equipment to keep safe while doing their jobs. And if you eat meat, you especially should want these workers to be treated right, because without them, the only way you\u2019ll get your bacon is if you fight the pig yourself.\u201d</p>",

Congressional Republicans rejected funding for the postal service in the latest stimulus bill, as Trump called it a \u201cjoke\u201d and claimed it undercharges Amazon for its packages (his administration has debunked this) on account of his personal obsession with Jeff Bezos for owning the Washington Post. The postal service, crucial for mail-in voting, has seen volume drop by a third, more than 1,200 workers out with coronavirus and many more concerned about lack of basic supplies and protections on the job. Still, it\u2019s \u201cone of the only federal agencies directly authorized in the constitution, and it\u2019s one of the most democratic institutions we have\u201d, Bee explained. \u201cBut even if their voters like it, Republican leaders hate when the government actually works,\u201d Bee added. \u201cThey\u2019re been trying to undermine the postal service for decades, going back to 1982, when Ronald Reagan signed a law requiring NBC\u2019s Thursday night lineup to feature at least one asshole mailman at all times.\u201d In all seriousness, Republicans have in recent years tried to lower wages, reduce benefits and cut routes in an effort to privatize the service. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to expect the post office to be a money-making enterprise! It\u2019s a public good,\u201d Bee said. \u201cExpecting the post office to turn a profit is like expecting public libraries to sell the right to use their bathroom.\u201d Trevor Noah And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed food supply fears, as meat-processing plants across the country shut down due to coronavirus updates. Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order under the Defense Production Act to keep some processing plants open and running at maximum capacity. \u201cYou know, I will say this about Trump: he is very clear about what his priorities are in life,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBecause he was warned for months about the pandemic coming to America and he did practically nothing. But you tell the man once that there could be a beef shortage and he springs into action like the world\u2019s hungriest superhero.\u201d Still, few places in America have experienced higher rates of coronavirus than meat-processing plants. And \u201calthough there doesn\u2019t seem to be a danger to the food itself, in most of these facilities, the workers are quite literally putting their lives on the line\u201d. At many plants, several thousand employees work in close proximity; workers have alleged they were given hairnets to use as face masks. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad that these workers are being forced to keep the food chain going but nobody is being forced to protect them while they do it,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cThey need equipment to keep safe while doing their jobs. And if you eat meat, you especially should want these workers to be treated right, because without them, the only way you\u2019ll get your bacon is if you fight the pig yourself.\u201d",

So yes, the ECB will be paying banks to take money off it.</p> <p>The ECB is also making another refinancing operation more generous -- by cutting the interest rate on its TLTRO programme to minus 0.5%. This will rise (<em>or do I mean fall?</em>) to minus 1% if they pass enough money onto businesses and consumers.</p> <p>In addition, the ECB voted to leave its main interest rates unchanged. So the headline rate is still 0%, with a minus 0.5% interest rate on commercial bank deposits at the ECB (again, meant to encourage them to lend).<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eaab7b28f0882b206dcff42\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T11:38:56.152Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Britain will spend more than \u00a3100bn this financial year trying to repair the damage caused by the coronavirus, according to the latest estimates.</strong></p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility is tracking chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s various pledges - from the jobs retention scheme to business rate relief.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap... A fresh flurry of grim economic data has confirmed that the global economy is falling into its worst contraction in decades, giving markets a jolt. Both France and Italy fell into recession this morning, as the latest GDP reports showed both countries had been hurt badly by lockdown measures to combat Covid-19. France shrank by 5.8% in January-March, as consumer spending and investment declined sharply. Italy\u2019s GDP dropped by 4.7%, wiping out many years of weak growth. The wider eurozone is also half-way into recession, after contracting by 3.8% in the last quarter. ECB president Christine Lagarde warned that there is worse to come -- she fears eurozone GDP could contract by 15% in the current quarter. America\u2019s jobless crisis has deepened too, with another 3.8m citizens filing unemployment claims (and many more struggling to get their claims heard). Having hit seven-week highs in early trading, stock markets fell back through the day - with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 eventually losing 3.5% of its value. Will May be better? Tune in tomorrow to see how the new month begins.... Goodnight! GW April was a good month for Europe\u2019s stock markets, despite a late wobble today. The Stoxx 600 index gained 6.2% this month, its best monthly gain since October 2015 (after the Greek debt crisis finally eased). Germany\u2019s DAX gained over 9% this month. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has just posted its worst day in a month, at the end of its best month in two years. The blue-chip index has closed down 214 points at 5901, a drop of 3.5%. That wipes out yesterday\u2019s rally, and half of Wednesday\u2019s gains too! But it still means the Footsie has risen by 4% in April, the best performance since April 2018 (April is often a good month for the markets - apologies for not mentioning this a month ago!). Reckitt Benckiser were the top riser, finishing up 3.5%, after reporting a surge in sales of cleaning products (but not condoms). Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown was the top faller, down 12%, after co-founder Stephen Lansdown sold \u00a3160m of stock. Royal Dutch Shell also slumped, down 11% after cutting its dividend sharply today. Shares in Zoom have dropped over 6% today, after the video-conferencing services admitted it wasn\u2019t quite as popular as thought... Zoom had initially said it had 300 million daily users, following the surge in remote working. But, it actually has 300 million daily meeting participants. The difference? Some regular users will be counted as multiple \u2018participants if they take part in more than one call per day. Despite today\u2019s declines, April has still been a very strong month for the markets. America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index has gained almost 13%, trimming its losses for the year to 9%. The US jobs report for April is released a week tomorrow. But we already know it will be grim, thanks to the weekly initial jobs claims numbers. Capital Economists estimate that America\u2019s unemployment rate has surged to at least 15% this month, wiping out twice as many jobs as were created over the last decade. We estimate that non-farm payroll employment fell by between 20 and 25 million in April, with the unemployment rate surging to between 15% and 20%. That would be an unprecedented loss of jobs in a single month, equating to more than double the total decline in employment during and after the financial crisis. Crumbs, the FTSE 100 has now lost 200 points for the day, a loss of over 3%.... Still 30 minutes of trading in which to recover (or get worse). The Covid-19 pandemic continues to hurt the travel sector badly too. TUI has cancelled holiday trips due to start on or before June 11, meaning disappointment for one million hopeful holidaymakers. Britain\u2019s economy has suffered another blow -- high street retailers Oasis and Warehouse are shutting, with the loss of 1,800 jobs: Just in: America\u2019s central bank is expanding one of its many new programmes to help the US economy ride out the Covid-19 pandemic. The Federal Reserve is expanding the scope and eligibility for the Main Street Lending Program -- which is meant to help small firms access affordable credit, and stop viable companies going bust. The Fed says it is responding to more than 2,200 suggestions of how to improve the programme. It says: More than 2,200 letters from individuals, businesses, and nonprofits were received. In response to the public input, the Board decided to expand the loan options available to businesses, and increased the maximum size of businesses that are eligible for support under the program. The changes include: Creating a third loan option, with increased risk sharing by lenders for borrowers with greater leverage; Lowering the minimum loan size for certain loans to $500,000; and Expanding the pool of businesses eligible to borrow. All the main American and European stock markets are firmly in the red today - risk is firmly off the menu: Bank shares are falling across the eurozone following Christine Lagarde\u2019s press conference. Traders have noted her gloomy forecasts -- the possibility that the eurozone shrinks by an unprecedented 15% in the April-June quarter. The deeper the recession, and the slower the recovery, then the longer it will be until monetary conditions can ever normalise. There\u2019s also some disappointment that the ECB hasn\u2019t boosted the size of its new PEPP stimulus package, or decided to start buying junk-rated bonds (yet anyway).... Stocks have dropped at the start of trading in New York too. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped 301 points at the open, down 1.2% at 24,332. There\u2019s not much sign of the optimism that lifted shares so strongly in April. Back in Frankfurt, Christine Lagarde is insisting that the ECB has plenty of firepower. Lagarde says the Governing Council did not discuss whether to buy junk-rated bonds under its asset purchase scheme, or whether to extend its new PELTRO loan programme beyond banks. But her main message is that the ECB \u201cwill not accept any risk of fragmentation\u201d in the euro area. She also points out that there is \u20ac3trn of credit available to banks at negative rates: European stock markets are falling deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 index has tumbled back through the 6,000 point mark, down 143 points or 2.3% at 5972. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are now down 1%, as markets end April on the back foot. Oof! U.S. personal spending has plummeted in March by the most on record. Household spending slumped by 7.5% last month, which is the worst since the Commerce Department started counting in 1959. That\u2019s rather worse than the 5.1% decline expected. It shows that the horrifying surge in US unemployment, and the widespread shutdown of the economy, has had a serious (if predictable) impact on America\u2019s economy. Christine Lagarde hammers home the point, telling reporters that the coronavirus pandemic has \u201cliterally halted economic activity across the globe\u201d. The hard economic data is only just starting to emerge, she points out. The ECB president then reveals that her economists think the eurozone could shrink by 15% in the current quarter. Lagarde also warns that policymakers still don\u2019t know how the pandemic is going to play out. Newsflash: ECB president Christine Lagarde has warned that the eurozone faces its worst slump in peacetime. Speaking on a virtual press conference, Lagarde says the region faces an \u201cunprecedented\u201d downturn. ECB economists believe that the economy will shrink by between 5% and 12% this year, Lagarde explains. It depends on the duration of the Covid-19 containment measures, and how successful the efforts to protect businesses and workers are, she adds. It\u2019s a timely warning, given we learned this morning that eurozone GDP shrank by 3.8% in January-March alone. Worryingly, there is a large backlog of Americans trying to sign on for jobless welfare. Our business editor Dominic Rushe reports: Another 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to batter the economy. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits and the numbers are still growing. The latest figures from the labor department released Thursday showed a fourth consecutive week of declining claims. While the trend is encouraging, the rate of losses means US unemployment is still on course to reach levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The figures are also still undercounting the number of people out of work. Some states are still dealing with backlogs of claims after their systems were overwhelmed by the massive volume of applications. More here: Newsflash: Another 3.84 million Americans filed new jobless claims last week, as the coronavirus lockdown continued to drive up unemployment. That\u2019s more than the 3.5m initial jobless claims that had been expected. It\u2019s down from 4.4m in the previous seven days, and the record high of 6.8m at the end of March. But it\u2019s still another very serious blow to America\u2019s economy, and lifts the total number of new jobless claims since the Covid-19 lockdown started towards 30 million. The ECB has resisted making any major moves today. Significantly, it has not increased the size of its new \u20ac750bn asset purchase scheme (the pandemic emergency purchase programme, or PEPP), which buys bonds and other assets to stimulate the economy. It has also not widened the programme to include junk-rated bonds. Instead, the ECB says: The Governing Council is fully prepared to increase the size of the PEPP and adjust its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed. Here\u2019s some early reaction to the European Central Bank making its emergency loans package even more generous, to try to help banks lend to the economy. Newsflash: The European Central Bank has responded to the economic crisis caused by Covid-19 by beefing up its stimulus package. The ECB\u2019s governing council has decided to launch a new programme dubbed PELTROS -- which stands for pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations. They are designed to \u201csupport liquidity conditions in the euro area financial system\u201d, says the ECB, to preserve \u201cthe smooth functioning of money markets by providing an effective liquidity backstop\u201d. That means more cheap liquidity for Europe\u2019s banks, as the PELTROS will be priced at 0.25% below the ECB\u2019s main interest rate (which has been left at 0% today). So yes, the ECB will be paying banks to take money off it. The ECB is also making another refinancing operation more generous -- by cutting the interest rate on its TLTRO programme to minus 0.5%. This will rise (or do I mean fall?) to minus 1% if they pass enough money onto businesses and consumers. In addition, the ECB voted to leave its main interest rates unchanged. So the headline rate is still 0%, with a minus 0.5% interest rate on commercial bank deposits at the ECB (again, meant to encourage them to lend). Britain will spend more than \u00a3100bn this financial year trying to repair the damage caused by the coronavirus, according to the latest estimates. The Office for Budget Responsibility is tracking chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s various pledges - from the jobs retention scheme to business rate relief. And it currently estimates that the total bill is \u00a3105bn, with Sunak\u2019s furloughing scheme costing \u00a349bn alone (although the Treasury should get \u00a310bn back in tax) However, this estimate doesn\u2019t cover the government\u2019s loan guarantee schemes, or the cost of taking over Britain\u2019s rail franchises. The details are here. European stock markets have turned south, after another morning of bleak economic data. In London, the FTSE 100 is down 81 points or 1.3% at 60330, handing back half of yesterday\u2019s rally. Royal Dutch Shell, the biggest company on the index, is doing the most damage - down 7% after sharply cutting its dividend. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are both down around 0.3%. Yesterday\u2019s rally was attributed to hopes that lockdowns would ease soon, and the Covid-19 treatments were coming down the line too. But, there are now reports that the UK will maintain its lockdown until June... Back in the UK, carmaker Nissan plans to reopen its Sunderland factory - the biggest single plant in the UK - at the start of June. Production at the plant, which produces Nissan\u2019s Qashqai and Juke models and the electric Leaf, has been suspended since 17 March, with many of its more than 6,000 workers furloughed. This suspension will now continue throughout May, meaning it will reopen later than many of the other major carmakers who are planning to restart around the middle of the month. Nissan said it will start \u201ca phased resumption of production in early June\u201d. Parts of the plant have already been open during the lockdown to produce face visors. In a statement, a Nissan spokesman said: Our goal is to navigate through this crisis while maintaining activities critical for business continuity and to make sure we are prepared for the time when business resumes in Europe and we can welcome the Nissan team back to work. I missed this earlier, sorry, but Austria\u2019s economy has also been hit by the pandemic. Austrian GDP shrank by 2.5% in the first quarter of 2020. That\u2019s not as bad as France, Spain and Italy, but still puts Austria halfway into recession. While we\u2019re playing catch-up, Belgium\u2019s GDP came out yesterday, and showed a sharp contraction of 3.9%. Recessions are bleak things. They typically mean rising unemployment, more company failures, a rise in bad debts, falling asset prices and widespread gloom and despair. But this time, they also mean that the Covid-19 lockdown measures are being followed. This chart from Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics shows how the countries who have imposed the toughest restrictions have suffered the biggest drop in GDP this quarter (although we don\u2019t yet have growth figures for Germany or the UK). Ouch! The Covid-19 lockdown has wiped out all Italy\u2019s growth since the eurozone crisis, and more! Oxford Economics\u2019 Nicola Nobile reckons Italy\u2019s economy has now shrunk back to its lowest level since the early 2000s: Newsflash: Italy has joined France in recession, after suffering its worst slump in decades. Italian GDP shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, new figures from ISTAT show. That is the worst since the data series began in 1995, showing that the coronavirus lockdown measures implemented in recent weeks have had a very damaging impact on growth. It follows a 0.3% contraction in October-December, meaning Italy has notched up two consecutive quarters of contraction. Today\u2019s GDP data only gives us an early sighter of the dark slump which Europe\u2019s economy is falling into. Economists predict another historic contraction in April-June, as the full force of the Covid-19 lockdowns hit growth. The eurozone economy is shrinking even faster than feared, according to Reuters: The eurozone economy contracted at a record rate and by more than expected in the first three months of the year and inflation slowed sharply as much economic activity in March came to a halt because of the COVID-19 pandemic, data showed on Thursday. According to a preliminary flash estimate of the European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat economic output in the 19 countries sharing the euro in January-March was 3.8% smaller than in the previous three months -- the sharpest quarterly decline since the time series started in 1995. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 3.5% contraction after a 0.1% quarterly growth in the last three months of 2019. Year-on-year the gross domestic product contraction was 3.3% in the first quarter. NEWSFLASH: the eurozone economy shrank by 3.8% in the first quarter of 2020, putting it halfway into recession. That\u2019s an extremely grim contraction, worse than during the financial crisis of 2008-09. The wider EU economy also suffered badly, with GDP shrinking by 3.3% during the quarter. More to follow... Here\u2019s a reminder of this morning\u2019s dire French growth figures (for those who weren\u2019t wide awake at 6.30am) Today\u2019s woeful French and Spanish growth figures will have dampened the mood as the European Central Bank holds its monetary policy meeting today. Sebastien Clements, currency analyst at international payments company OFX, says ECB chief Christine Lagarde and colleagues will be worried about the future. \u201cNot the ideal start to the day for President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, as both Spanish and French quarterly GDP figures came in at least 1% off the forecasted mark. It won\u2019t be the figure itself that causes a headache, but rather the potential of what may follow\u2026 \u201cLagarde has already laid her cards on the table with the bulk of the zone\u2019s stimulus options having been delivered in the form of PEPP implementation and collateral loosening, but her job is not yet done. With its back against the wall, is now a good time for the ECB to get ahead of the curve and inject some investor confidence in the form of maintaining a stable monetary position? Just this morning, I spoke with a client at a UK food distributor who has decided to close their European entity and set up in Asia for the sake of supply side ease, cost cutting and licensing issues.\u201d Newsflash: A quarter of UK businesses currently trading say that their turnover has more than halved this month. That\u2019s according to the Office for National Statistics, which has just published its latest \u2018faster indicators\u2019 of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy. It confirms that some businesses are being hit extremely hard by the lockdown, which is likely to push Britain into a desperately painful recession. Here are some key points from the report, which is online here. 1 in 4 (24%) of surveyed businesses in the UK continuing to trade reported that their turnover had decreased by more than half the normal level, in the period 6 April to 19 April 2020. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was the most popular government scheme applied for, with 66% of all responding businesses, whether continuing to trade or pausing trade in the latest wave, applying. Over 8 in 10 adults (84%) in Great Britain said they had either not left their home or only left for the permitted reasons (essential shopping, medical reasons, one form of daily exercise and key workers travelling to work) in the past seven days, for the Opinions and Lifestyle (OPN) Survey period 9 April to 20 April; a similar proportion to last week. The most common reasons for key worker parents not sending their children to school was the availability of alternative care and being concerned about the health and well-being of the child. These chart from Danske Bank\u2019s Aila Mihr show how Germany\u2019s unemployment total swelled alarmingly this month: A boom in disinfectant sales has benefited Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Dettol and Lysol. The company has ramped up production of its cleaning products and produced a year\u2019s worth of hand sanitiser in May alone. This resulted in 13.3% growth in like-for-like sales in the first three months of the year. Customers also snapped up Reckitt\u2019s flu medicine Mucinex and painkiller Nurofen. The firm now expects its annual sales to be better than it expected in February, when it forecast sales growth greater than last year\u2019s 0.8% rise. Laxman Narasimhan, RB\u2019s chief executive, said there was some evidence of pantry loading which would unwind, but it also looks like there are long-lasting changes in consumer behaviour. \u201cPeople want cleaner surfaces at home. They are cleaning more, washing more \u2026 Some behaviour becomes quite ingrained. There is a reinforcement of hygiene as a basis of health.\u201d Reckitt also said sales of Durex condoms declined in some countries, such as the UK and Italy. Narasimhan put this down to increased anxiety - worries about money and jobs. Back in the UK, the boss of Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket has predicted that disruption from the coronavirus outbreak will last until at least mid-September. CEO Mike Coupe reckons that physically distanced queues are likely to remain \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, dampening hopes of an early end to lockdown restrictions. Just in: The number of people out of work in Germany has surged. Germany\u2019s seasonally adjusted jobless rate has leapt to 5.8% this month, up from 5% in May, the Labour Office reports. The number of people out of work rose by 373,000 to 2.639m - much more than economists had expected. The Labour Office also reports that it has received 751,000 requests from companies to put a total of 10.1m staff on Germany\u2019s \u2018short-time work\u2019 scheme, called Kurzarbeit. Kurzarbeit allows companies to temporarily furlough workers or cut their hours. Staff still get part of their pay cheque, with the state stepping in to cover much of the shortfall. Shares in Royal Dutch Shell have tumbled 7% this morning after it disappointed investors by slashing its dividend by two thirds. CEO Ben van Buerden defended the move as a \u201cprudent\u201d response to the \u201cextremely challenging conditions\u201d caused by Covid-19, with oil prices tumbling this year. Van Buerden said: \u201cGiven the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook and the significant mid- and long-term uncertainty, we are taking further prudent steps to bolster our resilience, underpin the strength of our balance sheet and support the long-term value creation of Shell. This move, though, breaks a \u201cdecades-long taboo against cutting shareholder returns\u201d, writes my colleague Jillian Ambrose. [There\u2019s an argument that Shell\u2019s share price shouldn\u2019t fall - as the company is actually more valuable now its retaining this cash. Shareholders rarely see things this way, though] France\u2019s fall into recession hasn\u2019t dampened the mood on the Paris stock market, The CAC 40 index of leading French companies jumped by 0.9% in early trading to 4,711 points - a seven-week high. Germany\u2019s market has also rallied, but the picture is mixed elsewhere - with Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB both lower (after a strong rise yesterday). The latest economic data from China shows that its recovery from the pandemic is being hit by weakness abroad. China\u2019s official manufacturing PMI (which measures activity in the sector) dropped to 50.8 for April from 52 in March. That shows less growth, as a reading of 50 indicates stagnation. A rival survey from media group Caixin is gloomier -- its Chinese manufacturing PMI fell back ito contraction, at 49.4 (from 50.1). Both surveys reported that Chines factory production had picked up this month. But Caixin also reports a slump in exports, with orders dropping at the fastest pace since the 2008 crisis. Newsflash: Spain\u2019s economy is also shrinking - and faster than feared. Spanish GDP contracted by 5.2% in January-March compared with the previous quarter, according to new figures from the National Statistics Institute. That confirms that the tough lockdown measures imposed last month had an immediate, chilling, impact on growth as Madrid tried to get to grips with the Covid-19 pandemic. It\u2019s Spain\u2019s worst contraction since the current data series started in 1995, and a bigger drop than expected (just like France this morning). More gloom -- French consumer spending has taken a whopping dive last month, as the lockdown forced shops to close. Consumer spending fell by almost 18% last month, INSEE reports, despite a rise in food spending. It\u2019s the worst drop in consumer spending since at least 1980 (when the data series began). INSEE explains: Manufactured good consumption dropped sharply (\u201342.3% after \u20130.6%) and energy expenditure decreased markedly (\u201311.4% after \u20130.9%). Only food consumption increased (+7.8% after \u20130.1%). The fall in household consumption in March 2020 was essentially due to the implementation of lockdown measures from mid-March onwards. Obviously economists expected consumer spending to drop last month, but not by this much! French bank SocGen has posted a surprise loss, and set aside \u20ac820m to cover bad loans - in another sign that Covid-19 is hurting France\u2019s economy. SocGen also suffered trading losses during the market mayhem of the last quarter. Bloomberg has heard that its traders came unstuck on some dividend futures contracts.... Several major companies are reporting the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses today. Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell is slashing its shareholder dividend for the first time since te 1940s. Investors will get just 16 cents per share, from 47 cents per share, after profits plunged in the last quarter. Lloyds Banking Group is taking an \u00a3844m charge, to cover loses from the pandemic in the last quarter. Mining conglomerate Glencore has cut its production guidance, after output of copper, cobalt and coal output all fell amid sliding demand. France\u2019s grim growth figures are a clear sign that Europe is entering its deepest recession of the postwar era, says Bloomberg. The economy shrank 5.8%, the most since records began in 1949. The slump shows the dramatic effect of government-ordered shutdowns as just two weeks of closures and restrictions were sufficient to snuff out growth for the entire quarter. Figures for the euro area later on Thursday will probably show the end of a seven-year expansion, and worse is still to come as confinement has continued for the past month. The virus outbreak has plunged economies across the globe into a tumult that was unthinkable at the start of the year. China\u2019s economy shrank for the first time in decades in the first quarter and the U.S. saw its record expansion come to an end. The IMF expects the global economy to shrink 3% this year, with the euro area dropping 7.5%. Spain and Italy both report first quarter GDP data later on Thursday, and the European Central Bank announces its latest policy decision. The French economy is already in a technical recession after a small 0.1% contraction at the end of 2019. In the first quarter 2020, consumer spending dropped more than 6%, and investment plunged 11.8%, statistics office Insee said. A 5.8% plunge in GDP is really, really bad. As Frederik Ducrozet of Pictet Wealth Management shows here, it wipes out several years of French growth: Here\u2019s more reaction to France\u2019s plunge into recession this morning. France\u2019s economy shrank even faster than economists predicted, Reuters points out: The first quarter contraction was the biggest on a quarterly basis since World War II, surpassing the previous record of -5.3% in the second quarter of 1968 when France was gripped by civil unrest, mass student protests and general strikes. The slump even exceeded most economists\u2019 expectations, which on average were for -3.5%, although estimates in Reuters poll went as low as -7%. This chart from INSEE\u2019s growth report shows just how sharply France\u2019s economy shrank: This table shows the details, including a 6.1% tumble in consumer spending and an 11.8% drop in business investment (or \u2018gross fixed capital formation\u2019). Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Newsflash: France has plunged into recession, as the Covid-19 lockdown batters its economy. Data just released shows that French GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first three months of 2020, a very sharp decline in activity. That\u2019s the worst contraction since the second war, and follows a 0.1% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2019 - meaning the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy is now officially in recession. INSEE, the French statistics body, said the slump is: ...primarily linked to the shut-down of \u201cnon-essential\u201d activities in the context of the implementation of the lockdown since mid-March. INSEE also reports that household spending, company investment, and net trade all slumped in the last quarter. It explains: Household consumption expenditures dropped (\u20136.1%), as did total gross fixed capital formation in a more pronounced manner (GFCF: \u201311.8%). Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory changes fell sharply: it contributed to \u20136.6 points to GDP growth. Exports also fell this quarter (\u20136.5%) along with imports (\u20135.9%), in a less pronounced manner. All in all, the foreign trade balance contributed negatively to GDP growth: \u20130.2 points, after \u20130.1 points the previous quarter. Conversely, changes in inventories contributed positively to GDP growth (+0.9 points). I\u2019ll pull together more details and reaction now.... Later today we discover how the eurozone economy performed in last the quarter. We also get the latest US weekly jobless figures. They are expected to show that another 3.5 million people signed on for unemployment benefit last week. That would take the total up to almost 30 million people since the crisis began!

Often, we\u2019re too busy to stop and notice, but when we slow down, we can tune in to nature and start to notice what\u2019s been there right under our noses all along.</p> \n<p>Even if we have no space but a window ledge, growing plants, watering and nurturing them and watching as they flower and start to attract insects can lift the spirits, while bringing peace and tranquillity to your space \u2013 and of course it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to develop your wildlife photography skills and take some great pictures.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Enjoy it!<br></strong>The best wildlife photographers are people who do it for the pure joy of it \u2013 not to win awards or for social media likes. Doing something purely for yourself and not being motivated by the approval of others can be so much more enjoyable! It doesn\u2019t matter what camera kit you\u2019ve got or how rubbish your pictures are if they are just for you.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e06fb31f69ef403518997a09ab353841fed503ff\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e06fb31f69ef403518997a09ab353841fed503ff/0_0_6642_4433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Opportunistic pictures are the hardest to take.

Become a wildlife photojournalist<br></strong>Documenting a story is a great way to bring a narrative to your pictures. You could try to photograph and identify every insect you find in your garden, or simply document the growth of the plants and flowers. Looking back at a set of pictures taken over weeks is a great way to appreciate how quickly things change at this time of year. Perhaps make a lockdown diary or go on a back garden bug safari with your children and start a garden wildlife lockdown list.</p> \n<p><strong>3. Start a species project<br></strong>Focusing on a particular species is a great way to create an exciting gallery of images. Really paying attention to just one species is the best way to learn about its habits and behaviour, and develop your wildlife photography skills. Every time you take a picture of a subject, you automatically look for new ways to do it: a new angle, better lighting or perhaps an action shot.</p> \n<p><strong>4. Champion the underdog</strong><br>Following on from the previous tip, don\u2019t get hung up on trophy-hunting the sexy species! The less glamorous the animal, often the better the photographic opportunities \u2013 likely the ones ignored by other photographers. You don\u2019t need to travel across the world to photograph elusive wildlife \u2013 I have won awards with pictures of local pigeons, gulls and foxes. Even if you can only find slugs in your garden, you can still get creative!</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cd38546c2dc9b3ab88f94580d06f0bf7f817218b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd38546c2dc9b3ab88f94580d06f0bf7f817218b/0_0_10801_7201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You don\u2019t need to chase exciting species to get a great shot, such as this one of a European robin (Erithacus rubecula) spotted in Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You don\u2019t need to chase exciting species to get a great shot, such as this one of a European robin (<em>Erithacus rubecula</em>) spotted in Bristol.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Hobson/NPL/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>5. Let it come to you</strong><br>Opportunistic pictures are the most difficult to take; getting the camera out in a rush and trying to get a good picture before something disappears can be frustrating \u2013 and can make us miss an exciting wildlife encounter entirely. My best pictures come from observation and planning. For example, if you know that bees keep returning to a particular flower, or birds are regularly coming to a feeder, you can lie in wait and be ready with your camera when the next one returns. Wildlife is particularly bold at the moment as there are fewer people on the streets and the reduced noise means animals can better listen out for danger. You might be able to attract something not usually found in your area like a hedgehog or fox by leaving out some treats in your garden (it\u2019s easy to research online what is responsible and appropriate if you\u2019re planning to feed something).</p> \n<p><em>Find more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction\">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow biodiversity reporters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/phoeb0?lang=en\">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pgreenfielduk?lang=en\">Patrick Greenfield</a> on Twitter for all the latest news and features</em></p>",

Often, we\u2019re too busy to stop and notice, but when we slow down, we can tune in to nature and start to notice what\u2019s been there right under our noses all along. Even if we have no space but a window ledge, growing plants, watering and nurturing them and watching as they flower and start to attract insects can lift the spirits, while bringing peace and tranquillity to your space \u2013 and of course it\u2019s the perfect opportunity to develop your wildlife photography skills and take some great pictures. 1. Enjoy it! The best wildlife photographers are people who do it for the pure joy of it \u2013 not to win awards or for social media likes. Doing something purely for yourself and not being motivated by the approval of others can be so much more enjoyable! It doesn\u2019t matter what camera kit you\u2019ve got or how rubbish your pictures are if they are just for you. 2. Become a wildlife photojournalist Documenting a story is a great way to bring a narrative to your pictures. You could try to photograph and identify every insect you find in your garden, or simply document the growth of the plants and flowers. Looking back at a set of pictures taken over weeks is a great way to appreciate how quickly things change at this time of year. Perhaps make a lockdown diary or go on a back garden bug safari with your children and start a garden wildlife lockdown list. 3. Start a species project Focusing on a particular species is a great way to create an exciting gallery of images. Really paying attention to just one species is the best way to learn about its habits and behaviour, and develop your wildlife photography skills. Every time you take a picture of a subject, you automatically look for new ways to do it: a new angle, better lighting or perhaps an action shot. 4. Champion the underdog Following on from the previous tip, don\u2019t get hung up on trophy-hunting the sexy species! The less glamorous the animal, often the better the photographic opportunities \u2013 likely the ones ignored by other photographers. You don\u2019t need to travel across the world to photograph elusive wildlife \u2013 I have won awards with pictures of local pigeons, gulls and foxes. Even if you can only find slugs in your garden, you can still get creative! 5. Let it come to you Opportunistic pictures are the most difficult to take; getting the camera out in a rush and trying to get a good picture before something disappears can be frustrating \u2013 and can make us miss an exciting wildlife encounter entirely. My best pictures come from observation and planning. For example, if you know that bees keep returning to a particular flower, or birds are regularly coming to a feeder, you can lie in wait and be ready with your camera when the next one returns. Wildlife is particularly bold at the moment as there are fewer people on the streets and the reduced noise means animals can better listen out for danger. You might be able to attract something not usually found in your area like a hedgehog or fox by leaving out some treats in your garden (it\u2019s easy to research online what is responsible and appropriate if you\u2019re planning to feed something).

      "bodyText": "AstraZeneca, the Cambridge-based pharmaceutical group, is teaming up with Oxford University to manufacture and distribute a coronavirus vaccine if clinical trials currently under way show it is effective. News of the partnership boosted AstraZeneca\u2019s share price, helping it to become Britain\u2019s most valuable company by market capitalisation. The potential vaccine, aimed at preventing Covid-19 infection, is being developed at Oxford and is being tested on more than 1,100 healthy human volunteers in the first phase of clinical trials at five centres in southern England. Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive, said the collaboration combined the university\u2019s expertise in vaccinology and his company\u2019s manufacturing and distribution capabilities. \u201cOur hope is that by joining forces we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation,\u201d Soriot said. More than 1,000 volunteers aged between 18 and 55 are taking part in trials of the vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, at five test centres. The results of the trials could be available from May. If the vaccine proves successful, late-stage trials could take place in the middle of this year, in a significant acceleration of the usual vaccine testing process. AstraZeneca aims to produce tens of millions of doses by the end of the year if the treatment is effective. The Anglo-Swedish firm intends to work with international partners to distribute the vaccine, including making it available in low- and middle-income countries. Prof Sir John Bell, a regius professor of medicine at Oxford, said the university and AstraZeneca intended to work together to tackle pandemics for \u201cmany years to come\u201d, adding: \u201cWe believe that together we will be in a strong position to start immunising against coronavirus once we have an effective approved vaccine.\u201d The joint announcement helped AstraZeneca\u2019s share price move 1.4% higher on Thursday, to record highs of \u00a383.22, giving the drugmaker a market value of \u00a3109bn.

The DIY chain is classed as an essential retailer under the government\u2019s high street lockdown rules, but it shut up shop in March before making a staged return with 155 stores last week. B&amp;Q has followed the example of supermarkets by limiting the number of customers in stores, switching to card-only payments and installing perspex screens at checkouts. Owing to the bulky nature of some DIY materials, the retailer is allowing two people to shop together so that they can \u201cself-serve\u201d larger items. Rival chain Homebase is also returning to full strength. It currently has 70 of its 164 stores open, but said they would all be open by Saturday. The Homebase chief executive, Damian McGloughlin, said a lot of hard work had gone in to ensure it could \u201csafely welcome customers back through our doors\u201d. Pret a Manger said that on Friday, another 20 London stores would reopen to sell sandwiches and coffee as either takeaways or for delivery through apps such as Deliveroo and Just Eat. Stores will only open until 2pm, with the new wave of openings taking the number trading to 30. Pret\u2019s chief executive, Pano Christou, said the shops looked and felt a little different from before because of physical distancing measures: \u201cI believe we\u2019ve found a way to operate that reflects the government\u2019s guidance and looks after our teams and customers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep on learning from these shops as we look to reopen more over the coming weeks.\u201d A growing band of fast-food companies including Nando\u2019s, Burger King, KFC and Wagamama have also started to lift the shutters. Restaurants and pubs were closed as part of the lockdown but can prepare food in their kitchens for takeaway or delivery.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, the prime minister suggested the worst was over.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope,\u201d he said, three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself.</p> \n<p>Presenting his first Downing Street press conference since being discharged from hospital, the prime minister at times appeared breathless.</p> \n<p>He robustly defended his government\u2019s handling of the outbreak, after a slew of criticism during his absence from the political frontline. \u201cWe\u2019re learning lessons every day \u2013 but I do think that, broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Responding to the argument that a more stringent lockdown should have been imposed sooner, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s a very very demanding thing to ask a population to do \u2013 very tough \u2013 and so I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as possible with the peak of the epidemic.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson announced that the government would next week publish what he called a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d setting out \u201chow we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time restart the economy\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, he stressed any changes would only be enacted once the government was confident the outbreak was under control.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat you are going to get next week is really a road map, a menu of options. The dates and times of each individual measure will be very much driven by where we are in the epidemic, what the data is really saying and we are getting in a lot more data every day now and in the course of the next few days.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the prime minister\u2019s statement, after repeatedly calling on the government to set out its \u201cexit strategy\u201d \u2013 though Johnson declined to use that precise phrase.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been calling on the prime minister to have a plan for the next stage and exit strategy,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing hard on that in the last week or two. The prime minister has now said he\u2019s going to have a plan next week. So I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re going to see a plan. We\u2019ll look at it when we see it, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s five tests for relaxing lockdown restrictions include the availability of adequate PPE and testing, and a sustained fall in the death rate.</p> \n<p>But the prime minister laid particular emphasis on R, the reproduction number for the virus, measured as the average number of people each sufferer infects.</p> \n<p>The target is to keep the R rate of transmission below 1, but even small reductions in the rate can help avoid thousands of new infections a day. At the moment, the government\u2019s scientific advisers believe it is between 0.6 and 0.9.</p> \n<p>England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, urged caution, saying: \u201cAs soon as R goes over one, then you restart exponential growth \u2013 it may be slow if it is just over one, it may be a lot faster if it goes a lot above one \u2013 but exponential growth restarts and, sooner or later \u2013 and the higher it is, the sooner it is \u2013 the NHS will go back to the risk of being overwhelmed and the number of cases will go up.\u201d</p> \n<p>One source close to Downing Street said the government was also reluctant to lift the lockdown until the number of new daily infections was lower than around 5,000 per day \u2013 the measure which was used by Germany to determine when to ease social distancing.</p> \n<p>However, the UK is quite some way off that goal.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. Despite announcing an increase of 674 in the death toll of the virus, taking it to a total of 26,771, the prime minister suggested the worst was over. \u201cI can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope,\u201d he said, three days after returning to work as he recovers from Covid-19 himself. Presenting his first Downing Street press conference since being discharged from hospital, the prime minister at times appeared breathless. He robustly defended his government\u2019s handling of the outbreak, after a slew of criticism during his absence from the political frontline. \u201cWe\u2019re learning lessons every day \u2013 but I do think that, broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time,\u201d he said. Responding to the argument that a more stringent lockdown should have been imposed sooner, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s a very very demanding thing to ask a population to do \u2013 very tough \u2013 and so I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as possible with the peak of the epidemic.\u201d Johnson announced that the government would next week publish what he called a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d setting out \u201chow we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time restart the economy\u201d. However, he stressed any changes would only be enacted once the government was confident the outbreak was under control. \u201cWhat you are going to get next week is really a road map, a menu of options. The dates and times of each individual measure will be very much driven by where we are in the epidemic, what the data is really saying and we are getting in a lot more data every day now and in the course of the next few days.\u201d The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the prime minister\u2019s statement, after repeatedly calling on the government to set out its \u201cexit strategy\u201d \u2013 though Johnson declined to use that precise phrase. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling on the prime minister to have a plan for the next stage and exit strategy,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing hard on that in the last week or two. The prime minister has now said he\u2019s going to have a plan next week. So I think that shows that we were right to challenge on it, and I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re going to see a plan. We\u2019ll look at it when we see it, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\u201d The government\u2019s five tests for relaxing lockdown restrictions include the availability of adequate PPE and testing, and a sustained fall in the death rate. But the prime minister laid particular emphasis on R, the reproduction number for the virus, measured as the average number of people each sufferer infects. The target is to keep the R rate of transmission below 1, but even small reductions in the rate can help avoid thousands of new infections a day. At the moment, the government\u2019s scientific advisers believe it is between 0.6 and 0.9. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, urged caution, saying: \u201cAs soon as R goes over one, then you restart exponential growth \u2013 it may be slow if it is just over one, it may be a lot faster if it goes a lot above one \u2013 but exponential growth restarts and, sooner or later \u2013 and the higher it is, the sooner it is \u2013 the NHS will go back to the risk of being overwhelmed and the number of cases will go up.\u201d One source close to Downing Street said the government was also reluctant to lift the lockdown until the number of new daily infections was lower than around 5,000 per day \u2013 the measure which was used by Germany to determine when to ease social distancing. However, the UK is quite some way off that goal. The official figures show at least 6,000 people tested positive on Wednesday, but the real number is likely to be much higher than that because many cases in the community are not being tested. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told the Scottish public on Wednesday it was highly unlikely that there would be a loosening of lockdown restrictions next week. \u201cIt is likely by the time we get to this time next week, which is the 7 May review day, it will not be possible in any meaningful way to lift these restrictions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have worked very hard to bring down the transmission rate of the virus and we are definitely seeing results from those efforts. But our progress against the virus is too fragile for us to let up.\u201d In Whitehall, ministers have been scrambling to draw up plans for the next phase of the crisis, which Johnson\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, has described as a \u201cnew normal\u201d, rather than a return to the pre-lockdown life. Johnson said for the first time on Thursdaythat this could include the public being advised to wear face masks. Asked about the issue, the prime minister said: \u201cI do think face masks will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, and to give people the confidence that it is safe to go back to work.\u201d His remarks contradicted the stance of some cabinet colleagues.

This is something I and others have been pushing the government to change the guidance on.\u201d Downing Street believes more people could safely return to work even before the lockdown is formally lifted, if distancing measures are complied with. Some manufacturers, including the car maker Rolls-Royce, have restarted production lines \u2013 and the DIY chain B&amp;Q announced on Wednesday that it would reopen its stores.

I think that this government will want to encourage that bounceback in all kinds of ways,\u201d he said. In preparation for an easing of lockdown restrictions, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, is drawing up guidance for safe working in different types of setting. Business groups and unions are expecting to see a first draft of this weekend. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has been examining plans for what he has called a \u201cphased\u201d reopening of schools. Testing for coronavirus has increased significantly in recent days as eligibility has been extended to new groups, with 81,611 tests carried out on Wednesday, according to the Department of Health and Social Care, although only 54,575 individuals were tested because of the number of repeated tests on the same people. Testing capacity stood at around 90,000. It will not be clear until Friday afternoon whether Hancock has met his self-imposed target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.",

      "bodyText": "Similar to the fact that not everyone suffers equally in a recession, it is just as true that some people\u2019s wellbeing may improve during the coronavirus pandemic. As Farrah Jarral sets out (The lockdown paradox: why some people\u2019s anxiety is improving during the crisis, 29 April), this will be largely defined by people\u2019s circumstances, and it is hard to imagine that such an uplift will apply to those in economically insecure positions, or those responding to the crisis from the frontlines. However, much as any improvement in wellbeing should not be treated as universal, wellbeing should not be conflated with mental illness. Preliminary results from our survey of more than 800 people living with mental illness, many of them severely affected and living with diagnoses such as psychosis or borderline personality disorder, reveal that 80% felt their mental health was worse due to the impact of the coronavirus, with 28% indicating that it was much worse. While necessary to prevent the spread of this highly contagious virus, lockdown is depriving people of the things that they need to stay well, from peer support groups to the routine of work and social engagements. We\u2019re hearing from people who are not just feeling a lack of motivation or purpose but experiencing an increase in suicidal thoughts, or a deterioration in their health to the point they require urgent intervention to manage paranoid delusions or psychosis. We are all responding to this crisis differently, but we must acknowledge the impact of this pandemic on people severely affected by mental illness so we are not faced with a hidden epidemic. We may be in crisis mode at the moment, but mental health must be a priority in the response to the coronavirus, which is why sustained investment in mental health services is crucial.

The Government of National Accord (GNA), based in Tripoli, said it did not trust the Libyan National Army (LNA) of renegade general Khalifa Haftar. Late on Wednesday a spokesman for Haftar said the LNA was adopting a ceasefire for Islam\u2019s holy month of Ramadan in response to requests by the international community and \u201cfriendly countries\u201d. Libya has been split since 2014 between rival administrations in Tripoli and Benghazi. Haftar launched a war to capture Tripoli a year ago, advancing into the southern suburbs before his offensive stalled. His forces, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, have continually bombarded the capital. In recent weeks Haftar\u2019s forces have suffered a series of battlefield reverses during a surge in violence that has included indiscriminate shelling of clearly marked hospitals. On Monday he abruptly declared a popular mandate to take control of the whole country. The ceasefire offer suggests that he was told by his backers that he had overstepped the mark and needed to bow to international pressure for a lull in fighting if he was to recover lost diplomatic ground. He may also have reasoned that a ceasefire would give him time to reorganise his battered supply lines. Monday\u2019s political declaration was denounced by the US embassy in Libya and by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as well as indirectly criticised by France, one of Haftar\u2019s strongest covert backers. The declaration also implied that Haftar no longer recognised the authority of the elected house of representatives (HoR) in the eastern city of Tobruk, which he had been broadly allied with for many years. The head of the HoR, Ageela Saleh, had just put forward an eight-point political plan to try to reconcile the east of the country with the GNA.

On the day the lockdown was imposed on 23 March, the government had announced 336 deaths, but by the end of that day there had actually been 802 deaths in English hospitals alone, including 136 that day.",

They come from a range of sports: track-cycling, sailing, canoe/kayak, artistic- and open-water swimming, modern pentathlon, archery and shooting. Some were confirmed months ago prior to the postponement, others \u2013 like Smith \u2013 were only announced recently.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to delay the Games by 12 months due to coronavirus has left the AOC and its national sporting bodies with major selection dilemmas. Given some sports had already completed their processes, it would be a blow to those athletes for selection to now be deferred \u2013 potentially compounding the mental health challenges caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>But there are no guarantees that squads picked in early 2020 will still represent the best selections come mid-2021. Form is temporary, young names emerge and veterans fade \u2013 there are good reasons why Olympic selection is typically concluded just months out from the Games.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no perfect solution,\u201d says Shooting Australia\u2019s chief executive Luke van Kempen. \u201cAfter our final selection event we inquired with the AOC about whether we could postpone the team nomination, and whether or not that might be a good thing to do, but it turned out that we were obliged to continue with the selection process.</p> <p>\u201cThe squad we have announced is the squad that will go to Tokyo. That is the AOC policy: there is no room to de-select athletes, although of course an athlete can withdraw due to injury or changes in personal circumstances. The responsibility is on us to make sure we establish appropriate training and competition programmes \u2013 we have to do the best we can to ensure everyone is in peak performance when July 2021 comes around.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, there is heightened sensitivity about selections right now. Athletes who just missed the cut wonder where they will be in 12 months\u2019 time, while coaches consider how best to motivate selected and non-selected athletes. \u201cThere were some selections that were quite close, some tight competition for places,\u201d says Van Kempen. \u201cThat drives good performance.\u201d Such is the delicacy around the topic that one major sport refused to comment, instead directing queries to the AOC.</p> <p>It told Guardian Australia that completed selection processes should be honoured. \u201cAthletes have done everything that was asked of them and it is consistent with the International Olympic Committee\u2019s position that those who are qualified remain qualified,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cIt also means those athletes can now focus entirely on their preparation for Tokyo, which they are seeing as an advantage. In these uncertain times, certainty should be provided wherever possible in the best interest of sports and their athletes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"baf67732b209cc93872cba94adeb2694e50f47c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/baf67732b209cc93872cba94adeb2694e50f47c9/0_330_4978_2988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Wearn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Wearn is one of the lucky Australians to have already secured his place at the Tokyo Games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason McCawley/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Certainty has certainly been a big help for the Australian sailor Matt Wearn, who was among the first to be selected for the Games last year. \u201cWe felt the stress of a close selection would have a negative impact, and thought an early selection would help ensure a result come Tokyo,\u201d says Wearn, who two months ago won silver in the Laser class world championships.</p> <p>Having counted down the days to the Olympics since September, the postponement was at first a major blow. \u201cWe were ready to go,\u201d says Wearn \u201cI have been working towards this for quite a while so to have that taken away was hard to deal with. But now, to already be selected is a nice feeling \u2013 particularly in my class, where it is extremely tight for remaining spots among other countries.\u201d</p> <p>Wearn and his fellow sailors can now fully focus on their preparations for 2021. \u201cThe delay is a perfect opportunity to tick off a few more one-percenters that we might not have been able to work on prior to July,\u201d the West Australian adds. \u201cNow that we have more time we will keep thinking of things we can work on \u2013 in a way, that is a great upside.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately Wearn, Smith and the other 69 are in the fortunate minority. For the remainder of Australia\u2019s Olympic hopefuls, coronavirus has put their qualification plans on hold and left them facing an uncertain year With travel halted and Australians isolating indoors, domestic and international selection opportunities are non-existent. It will likely be months or even a year before the AOC can announce any additions to the Olympic squad.</p> <p>\u201cThe AOC is awaiting further advice from the IOC on adjusted qualification systems,\u201d the spokesperson added. Given the turbulent situation, the AOC \u2013 and the hundreds of Australians yet to qualify \u2013 may be waiting a while.</p>",

Some were confirmed months ago prior to the postponement, others \u2013 like Smith \u2013 were only announced recently. The International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to delay the Games by 12 months due to coronavirus has left the AOC and its national sporting bodies with major selection dilemmas. Given some sports had already completed their processes, it would be a blow to those athletes for selection to now be deferred \u2013 potentially compounding the mental health challenges caused by the pandemic. But there are no guarantees that squads picked in early 2020 will still represent the best selections come mid-2021. Form is temporary, young names emerge and veterans fade \u2013 there are good reasons why Olympic selection is typically concluded just months out from the Games. \u201cThere is no perfect solution,\u201d says Shooting Australia\u2019s chief executive Luke van Kempen. \u201cAfter our final selection event we inquired with the AOC about whether we could postpone the team nomination, and whether or not that might be a good thing to do, but it turned out that we were obliged to continue with the selection process. \u201cThe squad we have announced is the squad that will go to Tokyo. That is the AOC policy: there is no room to de-select athletes, although of course an athlete can withdraw due to injury or changes in personal circumstances. The responsibility is on us to make sure we establish appropriate training and competition programmes \u2013 we have to do the best we can to ensure everyone is in peak performance when July 2021 comes around.\u201d Unsurprisingly, there is heightened sensitivity about selections right now. Athletes who just missed the cut wonder where they will be in 12 months\u2019 time, while coaches consider how best to motivate selected and non-selected athletes. \u201cThere were some selections that were quite close, some tight competition for places,\u201d says Van Kempen. \u201cThat drives good performance.\u201d Such is the delicacy around the topic that one major sport refused to comment, instead directing queries to the AOC. It told Guardian Australia that completed selection processes should be honoured. \u201cAthletes have done everything that was asked of them and it is consistent with the International Olympic Committee\u2019s position that those who are qualified remain qualified,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cIt also means those athletes can now focus entirely on their preparation for Tokyo, which they are seeing as an advantage. In these uncertain times, certainty should be provided wherever possible in the best interest of sports and their athletes.\u201d Certainty has certainly been a big help for the Australian sailor Matt Wearn, who was among the first to be selected for the Games last year. \u201cWe felt the stress of a close selection would have a negative impact, and thought an early selection would help ensure a result come Tokyo,\u201d says Wearn, who two months ago won silver in the Laser class world championships. Having counted down the days to the Olympics since September, the postponement was at first a major blow. \u201cWe were ready to go,\u201d says Wearn \u201cI have been working towards this for quite a while so to have that taken away was hard to deal with. But now, to already be selected is a nice feeling \u2013 particularly in my class, where it is extremely tight for remaining spots among other countries.\u201d Wearn and his fellow sailors can now fully focus on their preparations for 2021. \u201cThe delay is a perfect opportunity to tick off a few more one-percenters that we might not have been able to work on prior to July,\u201d the West Australian adds. \u201cNow that we have more time we will keep thinking of things we can work on \u2013 in a way, that is a great upside.\u201d Ultimately Wearn, Smith and the other 69 are in the fortunate minority. For the remainder of Australia\u2019s Olympic hopefuls, coronavirus has put their qualification plans on hold and left them facing an uncertain year With travel halted and Australians isolating indoors, domestic and international selection opportunities are non-existent. It will likely be months or even a year before the AOC can announce any additions to the Olympic squad. \u201cThe AOC is awaiting further advice from the IOC on adjusted qualification systems,\u201d the spokesperson added. Given the turbulent situation, the AOC \u2013 and the hundreds of Australians yet to qualify \u2013 may be waiting a while.",

      "body": "<p>Police say they have received 194,000 calls \u201csnitching\u201d on people alleged to have broken the coronavirus lockdown, and say the draconian measures are getting harder to for people to observe the longer they go on.</p> <p>The figures from the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) give an insight into how the tough rules, and fears of the virus spreading, have affected communities.</p> <p>Sara Glen, a deputy chief constable who is part of the NPCC\u2019s leadership tackling coronavirus, said: \u201cWe have members of the public who are coming in on the phones and [via the internet] to report where they\u2019ve got concerns either at gatherings of people that they can see from their locations, or if they think people aren\u2019t adhering to the regulations and that\u2019s actually putting them at risk.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the calls about lockdown rules allegedly being broken are counted in figures on reports of antisocial behaviour, which surged to around 215,000 in the four weeks to 27 April, compared with about 106,000 in the same period last year.</p> <p>Glen said concerns were also being raised about what was going on in other people\u2019s households, such as possible domestic or child abuse.</p> <p>Five weeks since laws enforcing the lockdown began, and with a decision looming about an extension soon, police said it was getting harder for people to comply.</p> <p>The NPCC chair, Martin Hewitt, said: \u201cI think it is inevitable that people will get restless, this is now quite an extended period of time.\u201d</p> <p>He said last weekend police saw more traffic and people out, but compliance levels were the same. \u201cI just think there is an inevitability that as the weeks progress, this is harder for people, and we are moving into warmer weather.\u201d</p> <p>Increasing numbers of fines are being issued for infringing lockdown . In the two weeks to 13 April , which included the long Easter weekend, 4,152 fines were issued in England alone, and in the next fortnight there were 4,725 fines.</p> <p>Two-thirds of the fines are being given to people aged under 34, and eight out of 10 to men.</p> <p>Fines start at \u00a360, reduced to \u00a330 for prompt payment, and further breaches can lead to costs doubling each time, to a maximum of \u00a3960.</p> <p>Some 391 people were fined more than once. One person has been fined six times, three people have been fined five times, six people fined four times and 343 fined twice.</p> <p>Glen said \u201ctroublesome spots\u201d include beaches and rural communities in the countryside where people want to walk.</p> <p>Officers have been accused at times of heavy handedness for setting up checkpoints, shaming people with drones and in some cases getting confused by the new laws, leading to people being wrongly prosecuted or fined.</p> <p>But Hewitt said so far 0.02% of population had been fined \u2013 around one in every 5,000 people \u2013 supporting the impression of large-scale adherence to the lockdown, and police leaders believe their policy of enforcement being a last resort has worked.</p> <p>NPCC figures show a postcode lottery of enforcement. Thames Valley police recorded the highest number of fines, 649, while the biggest force, the Met in London, issued 634. Warwickshire issued 22 fines, the fewest of any force.</p> <p>Dorset issued 116 but next door in Devon and Cornwall there were 510 fines.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Police say they have received 194,000 calls \u201csnitching\u201d on people alleged to have broken the coronavirus lockdown, and say the draconian measures are getting harder to for people to observe the longer they go on. The figures from the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) give an insight into how the tough rules, and fears of the virus spreading, have affected communities. Sara Glen, a deputy chief constable who is part of the NPCC\u2019s leadership tackling coronavirus, said: \u201cWe have members of the public who are coming in on the phones and [via the internet] to report where they\u2019ve got concerns either at gatherings of people that they can see from their locations, or if they think people aren\u2019t adhering to the regulations and that\u2019s actually putting them at risk.\u201d Some of the calls about lockdown rules allegedly being broken are counted in figures on reports of antisocial behaviour, which surged to around 215,000 in the four weeks to 27 April, compared with about 106,000 in the same period last year. Glen said concerns were also being raised about what was going on in other people\u2019s households, such as possible domestic or child abuse. Five weeks since laws enforcing the lockdown began, and with a decision looming about an extension soon, police said it was getting harder for people to comply. The NPCC chair, Martin Hewitt, said: \u201cI think it is inevitable that people will get restless, this is now quite an extended period of time.\u201d He said last weekend police saw more traffic and people out, but compliance levels were the same. \u201cI just think there is an inevitability that as the weeks progress, this is harder for people, and we are moving into warmer weather.\u201d Increasing numbers of fines are being issued for infringing lockdown . In the two weeks to 13 April , which included the long Easter weekend, 4,152 fines were issued in England alone, and in the next fortnight there were 4,725 fines. Two-thirds of the fines are being given to people aged under 34, and eight out of 10 to men. Fines start at \u00a360, reduced to \u00a330 for prompt payment, and further breaches can lead to costs doubling each time, to a maximum of \u00a3960. Some 391 people were fined more than once. One person has been fined six times, three people have been fined five times, six people fined four times and 343 fined twice. Glen said \u201ctroublesome spots\u201d include beaches and rural communities in the countryside where people want to walk. Officers have been accused at times of heavy handedness for setting up checkpoints, shaming people with drones and in some cases getting confused by the new laws, leading to people being wrongly prosecuted or fined. But Hewitt said so far 0.02% of population had been fined \u2013 around one in every 5,000 people \u2013 supporting the impression of large-scale adherence to the lockdown, and police leaders believe their policy of enforcement being a last resort has worked. NPCC figures show a postcode lottery of enforcement. Thames Valley police recorded the highest number of fines, 649, while the biggest force, the Met in London, issued 634. Warwickshire issued 22 fines, the fewest of any force. Dorset issued 116 but next door in Devon and Cornwall there were 510 fines.",

      "bodyText": "Denmark and the Czech Republic have said partially easing their lockdowns has not led to a surge in new coronavirus infections, as the WHO continued to urge extreme caution and Germany relaxed some restrictions but extended others. As EU governments grappled with the complex and conflicting imperatives of easing the lockdowns crippling their economies while avoiding a disastrous second wave of infections, meanwhile, South Korea reported no new cases for the first time. Of the 44 European countries to have imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, 21 had started easing some of them and a further 11 were planning to do so soon, said Hans Kluge, regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe. Kluge warned that all governments must remain extremely circumspect. \u201cAs I have said before, this virus is unforgiving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must remain vigilant, persevere and be patient \u2013 and ready to ramp up measures again as and when needed.\u201d There was, though, encouraging news from the Czech Republic and Denmark, where phased exits from strict lockdowns implemented early in the pandemic are under way. In Denmark, daycare facilities and schools began reopening two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April. \u201cThere are no signs at all that the partial reopening has caused a bigger spread of infection,\u201d said Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University. \u201cAt least there is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern, but I can\u2019t see that at all.\u201d The Czech health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, said the country\u2019s number of new cases had been below 100 for the past eight consecutive days and also reported that a staggered reopening of shops and services had not so far led to a surge in infections. \u201cSo far we do not see a negative trend resulting from previous relaxations,\u201d Vojt\u011bch said. \u201cWe will proceed with caution, gradually in the upcoming waves, and I believe we are on a good path.\u201d Proceeding cautiously, Germany on Thursday said places of worship, museums, gardens, zoos, playgrounds and monuments could reopen over the coming days after the chancellor, Angela Merkel, met the heads of the 16 German states. But the federal government and state leaders postponed decisions on whether to reopen all schools and kindergartens and said physical distancing rules would stay in place at least until 10 May, with no further relaxations to be decided before 6 May. Merkel said reopening cafes and restaurants at this stage would be problematic because of the difficulty of checking whether \u201cpeople around one table are from one family, or from different households\u201d. She said Germany\u2019s goal currently remained to prevent the virus from spreading rapidly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any medication, we don\u2019t have any vaccine against the virus and ... therefore, the goal will always be to slow down the virus,\u201d Merkel said, adding that Germany had so far been \u201csuccessful in achieving this goal\u201d. Germany began easing its lockdown last week, when some shops were allowed to open provided they practised strict social distancing, but Merkel and government advisers have expressed serious concerns about the dangers of going to far, too fast, with the risk of the infection rate stating to rise again. In Spain, where the daily death toll fell to its lowest in six weeks on Thursday, the health minister announced time slots for specific outdoor activities, in an effort to avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March. Salvador Illa said that except in smaller towns with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants, people would be allowed out to walk or take other exercise from 6am to 10am and 8pm until 11pm, while people who needed carers or were over 70 could be out from 10am to midday and from 7pm until 8pm. Parents will be able to accompany children aged under 14 on walks between midday and 7pm. \u201cWe need to keep acting very wisely and very prudently and follow expert advice,\u201d Illa said. \u201cWe got into this together and we need to get out of it together. There\u2019s no other way.\u201d France categorised each of its 95 d\u00e9partements as either red, amber or green according to its risk level, with much of the north and east of the country \u2013 including Paris \u2013 red, and much of the west and south-west green. Based on infection rate and intensive care bed capacity, the designation will be updated daily until 7 May, when a decision will be made on how fast each will be able to come out of lockdown on 11 May. The country\u2019s environment minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, said the government will contribute \u20ac50 per person towards bicycle repairs from 11 May, as part of a package of measures to encourage cycling and keep cars off city roads. Under pressure from some regional politicians to lift Europe\u2019s longest lockdown sooner, Italy\u2019s prime minister also said the country\u2019s gradual return to normality must be carefully coordinated and based strictly on scientific advice, if it did not want to see a surge in infections. \u201cI\u2019ll say this clearly, at the risk of appearing unpopular,\u201d Giuseppe Conte told parliament on Thursday. \u201cThe government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ...

Belgian liberal Hilde Vautmans said his first statement had not been complete and called on Borrell to release earlier drafts of the disinformation report.</p> <p>Nathalie Loiseau, a former career diplomat and now one of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s closest allies in the European parliament, gave her backing to Borrell. She said the EEAS public report had been \u201cimpactful\u201d and did not mince words. But she wanted to know why it failed to mention Chinese diplomats\u2019 false claims about France, a key element thought to have been left out of the public report. A Chinese embassy website had claimed falsely that 80 French politicians had signed a statement using a racist slur to denigrate the head of the World Health Organization.</p> <p>Borrell replied that this case was not included because it was considered to fall into a different category, \u201cbullying by a diplomatic mission\u201d, rather than disinformation in open sources. He added that the case had been very widely reported by the media, \u201cso we were not trying to hide anything\u201d.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s chief diplomat also told MEPs he first knew of the row when he read the newspapers last Friday. He criticised MEPs for attaching more weight to an apparently disgruntled member of staff who had leaked emails to the New York Times.</p> <p>\u201cPlease be serious \u2026 why a single leak of a single member of the staff presenting their own impressions is more important than the whole work of the people there and my personal political commitment. Don\u2019t weak[en] the institution,\u201d Borrell said.</p> <p>The EU\u2019s counter-propaganda unit, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/eu-anti-propaganda-unit-gets-1m-a-year-to-counter-russian-fake-news\">East StratCom taskforce</a>, was created in 2015 to counter Kremlin-backed disinformation after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. It has since expanded to cover disinformation targeted at the western Balkans and neighbouring countries. The coronavirus pandemic has given it a global focus, with reporting on China and Iran.</p> <p>While declining to reveal the extent of EU contacts with China, Borrell did not hide Beijing\u2019s discontent, saying: \u201cThe Chinese were not happy. They were not happy at the beginning and they are still not happy now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

Speaking at a specially convened meeting of the European parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee, Josep Borrell said the content and the timing of the European External Action Service\u2019s public assessment on disinformation and the pandemic had been determined by the EEAS alone. \u201cWe have not bowed to anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no watering down of our findings, however uncomfortable it could be.\u201d A brewing row deepened last week after the New York Times reported that EU officials had delayed, and then rewritten, a report after China tried to block its release. \u201cThe Chinese are already threatening with reactions if the report comes out,\u201d a senior official told colleagues in an email seen by the paper. Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister, suggested there was confusion about two separate reports \u2013 a confidential one intended for diplomats, and a second for the public that was released on Friday by the EU\u2019s monitoring website, EU vs Disinfo. \u201cThere are two different publications,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake that the second one is the first one with a little bit of change.\u201d His initial explanation did not convince all MEPs. Belgian liberal Hilde Vautmans said his first statement had not been complete and called on Borrell to release earlier drafts of the disinformation report. Nathalie Loiseau, a former career diplomat and now one of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s closest allies in the European parliament, gave her backing to Borrell. She said the EEAS public report had been \u201cimpactful\u201d and did not mince words. But she wanted to know why it failed to mention Chinese diplomats\u2019 false claims about France, a key element thought to have been left out of the public report. A Chinese embassy website had claimed falsely that 80 French politicians had signed a statement using a racist slur to denigrate the head of the World Health Organization. Borrell replied that this case was not included because it was considered to fall into a different category, \u201cbullying by a diplomatic mission\u201d, rather than disinformation in open sources. He added that the case had been very widely reported by the media, \u201cso we were not trying to hide anything\u201d. The EU\u2019s chief diplomat also told MEPs he first knew of the row when he read the newspapers last Friday. He criticised MEPs for attaching more weight to an apparently disgruntled member of staff who had leaked emails to the New York Times. \u201cPlease be serious \u2026 why a single leak of a single member of the staff presenting their own impressions is more important than the whole work of the people there and my personal political commitment. Don\u2019t weak[en] the institution,\u201d Borrell said. The EU\u2019s counter-propaganda unit, the East StratCom taskforce, was created in 2015 to counter Kremlin-backed disinformation after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. It has since expanded to cover disinformation targeted at the western Balkans and neighbouring countries. The coronavirus pandemic has given it a global focus, with reporting on China and Iran. While declining to reveal the extent of EU contacts with China, Borrell did not hide Beijing\u2019s discontent, saying: \u201cThe Chinese were not happy. They were not happy at the beginning and they are still not happy now.\u201d",

Fourteen years after leaving home, 11 since his professional debut and eight since his second \u2013 and last \u2013 top-flight match in Spain; three months after the historic trophy that changed things and one after the move that might change everything, he wondered if his moment had come and knew that if it did he would grab it and not let go.</p> <p>Joining Arsenal was his fourth loan in as many seasons, his eighth club in seven years across four countries, three levels and two continents, including the team he never even met, and he had made 267 appearances, but something had started.</p> <p>And then it stopped.</p> <p>After all that, the coronavirus crisis halted everything. At the other end of a Zoom call in north London, bare white wall behind him, the Spaniard smiles. \u201cAt first, part of you thinks: \u2018Jeez,\u2019 I finally got here, then had to leave again after two days to finish negotiating the contract, came back, it was hard to get going, I hadn\u2019t done pre-season while everyone had been competing seven months. Bit by bit you get through the days, the weeks, and the moment you say \u2018I\u2019m ready, I can compete\u2019, this happens \u2026\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2020/apr/28/arsenal-world-title-1989-physio-sent-off-independiente-usa\">When Arsenal won a 'world title' despite having their physio sent off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe first thought was: \u2018Damn, I wanted to keep playing.\u2019 But this is no small thing; it\u2019s not a cold or flu. When you see its magnitude, professional questions are secondary. What matters is everyone\u2019s health.\u201d</p> <p>Pablo Mar\u00ed saw that first hand. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/arsenal-close-to-signing-defender-pablo-mari-from-flamengo\">Signed on loan from Flamengo</a> in late January, a difficult deal finally done, he sat in the stands when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/arsenal-olympiakos-europa-league-match-report\">Arsenal </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/arsenal-olympiakos-europa-league-match-report\">were beaten by Olympiakos</a> on 27 February. Four days later he made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/02/portsmouth-arsenal-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report\">his debut against Portsmouth</a> in the FA Cup. And five days after that came his first Premier League appearance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/arsenal-west-ham-premier-league-match-report\">against West Ham</a>. He was at a \u201cdisadvantage\u201d \u2013 a new arrival, on loan, halfway through the season, joining one of Europe\u2019s top five leagues for the first time since he was a teenager and making his first start at that level \u2013 but he impressed again. Two appearances, two victories, two clean sheets.</p> <p>He did not get a third. The game against Manchester City on 11 March was postponed after the Olympiakos and Nottingham Forest owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/arsenal-self-isolation-postpone-game-manchester-city-premier-league-coronavirus-covid-19\">Evangelos Marinakis, tested positive for Covid-19</a> and Arsenal\u2019s players went into isolation. The next day Mikel Arteta <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mikel-arteta-tests-positive-coronavirus-arsenal-head-coach-premier-league\">tested positive, too</a>. Seven weeks passed, the Spaniard on lockdown in a house with practically nothing in it before he returned to his club\u2019s London Colney training ground on Monday.</p> <p>Those days are a jumble of messages, disconcerting. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know if [Marinakis] was the reason, if the manager caught it somewhere else, but from that moment we were in quarantine. At first we were very scared: hoping he would be OK, that nothing would happen to him or affect his family,\u201d Pablo Mar\u00ed says. \u201cThings calmed: I think none of the team had the virus. We didn\u2019t do tests; we did 15 days at home, and no one had [symptoms].\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb4c7c171c1cc731f903e5a4e2dbc8d90c3be707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb4c7c171c1cc731f903e5a4e2dbc8d90c3be707/0_0_4616_3077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pablo Mar\u00ed wins a header over West Ham\u2019s Michail Antonio during the win in early March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pablo Mar\u00ed wins a header over West Ham\u2019s Michail Antonio during the win in early March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Brooks/Action Plus/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was not how he planned it, but then nothing has been quite the way Pablo Mar\u00ed planned it, lockdown another chapter in an unusual journey. His route to Arsenal, at 26, was not exactly direct. \u201cI\u2019ve been a professional 10 years and <em>por gracia o desgracia</em>, for better or worse, I\u2019ve been round and round.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s one way of putting it. Pablo Mar\u00ed joined Mallorca at 14, making his debut in Spain\u2019s third tier with the B team aged 17, then twice played in <em>Primera</em> \u2013 two substitute appearances six months apart. There were three years at Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona but that was followed by single seasons at Girona, where he barely played; NAC Breda in the Netherlands; and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, ending with playoff defeat.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t belong to any of them. When he left Gimn\u00e0stic, in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/aug/16/manchester-city-pablo-mari-gimnastic-tarragona-manu-garcia-alaves\">it was for Manchester City</a> but the next day Pablo Mar\u00ed was gone again, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/26/patrick-roberts-reaps-rewards-girona-manchester-city-connection\">loaned to Girona</a>. When he was finally sold, after two more loans, it was to Brazil of all places. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cby then we\u2019d changed cities four times in four years, so our mentality was different. A footballer\u2019s life is short and we\u2019d been waiting years for an opportunity. We didn\u2019t care where and we knew the moment we got it, we were going to take it.\u201d</p> <p>He did not get it in Manchester but there\u2019s no recrimination. He doesn\u2019t know if Arteta\u2019s time there might explain Arsenal\u2019s approach \u2013 \u201cI suppose you could connect those loose ends, I haven\u2019t asked Mikel,\u201d he says \u2013 but he never met Pep Guardiola. Never met anyone, in fact. \u201cYou go [to the City Campus] for medicals each year \u2013 blood tests, urine, scans \u2013 but when I went to the Netherlands and Coru\u00f1a the [City] first team hadn\u2019t started pre-season, so there was no one there. You never cross paths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"49992fddbb7e125d74b09cd8d044b180b9c75614\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49992fddbb7e125d74b09cd8d044b180b9c75614/808_911_1587_889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pablo Mari spoke to Guardian writer Sid Lowe via Zoom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"560\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pablo Mari spoke to Guardian writer Sid Lowe via Zoom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No Credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThat can feel a bit strange, but City were transparent. The plan was always to go on loan. They help you find teams but never oblige you and the last word <em>always</em> has to be yours. After two years, I said I wanted to return to Spain, go step by step awaiting a chance in <em>Primera</em>. Look, a player has to have one thing very clear: how much you\u2019re prepared to lose to be a professional. You have to ask yourself that question and be honest. It will never, ever be all lovely. Or all awful. My objective was clear: whether it was City or not, I was going to get to a big club. I was absolutely convinced, ever since I left home at 13.\u201d</p> <p>At 25, it still hadn\u2019t happened and yet he insists: \u201cI never thought of giving up. <em>Never</em>. I\u2019ve had really bad moments, but you can\u2019t ever leave something you love. Football might have thrown me out, but I was never going to throw it out.\u201d Even if, after a decade, you\u2019d been stuck in the third tier? \u201cI\u2019d still be playing. Absolutely for sure.\u201d</p> <p>Then Pablo Mar\u00ed smiles again. \u201cAnd look how things happen.\u201d</p> <p>Pretty well, just not the way he imagined it. The breakthrough came 5,200 miles from home. Flamengo, Brazil\u2019s most popular club, offered City \u20ac1.3m. \u201cMy footballing curve; I never thought this could happen. But over the years of work, injuries, without opportunities, I\u2019ve learned that deep inside an attitude builds which says: \u2018The moment someone gives me the chance, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting go.\u2019 Flamengo gave me that. Any doubts went up in a cloud of smoke.\u201d</p> <p>Almost overnight Pablo Mar\u00ed went from the second division to the Maracan\u00e3, a place where \u201c80,000 people never stop singing, living their day like there\u2019s nothing else in the world\u201d. Right place, right time. \u201cIf I\u2019d gone younger, it might have been different. It\u2019s thanks to those years fighting, hard times, that those six months were so wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>Pablo Mar\u00ed\u2019s first medals followed, the first Spaniard to win the Brazilian title and the Copa Libertadores, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/nov/23/flamengo-v-river-plate-copa-libertadores-final-live?page=with:block-5dd929ae8f083aa6d5789b40#liveblog-navigation\">secured with two late goals</a>. \u201c<em>Una</em> <em>barbaridad</em>,\u201d he calls it. \u201cI still don\u2019t have the words and don\u2019t think I ever will. I\u2019ll never forget it; it\u2019s etched on my heart.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"283ee9eff552df2761a89a9a90bdf074865314ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/283ee9eff552df2761a89a9a90bdf074865314ac/0_311_2304_2918/790.jpg\" alt=\"Pablo Mar\u00ed poses with the trophy after winning the Brasileir\u00e3o title with Flamengo in 2019.\" width=\"790\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pablo Mar\u00ed poses with the trophy after winning the Brasileir\u00e3o title with Flamengo in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wagner Meier/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nor will one particular Flamengo fan watching from London. When it is suggested that he is David Luiz\u2019s hero now, Pablo Mar\u00ed laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m his idol, but we did talk about the final. He\u2019s helped me loads: anything I needed, he was there. David is so intelligent, great in the dressing room, always joking but the first to pull on his overalls to work.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we were very comfortable playing alongside each other, which is a good sign: a big club needs the centre-backs to connect.\u201d</p> <p>The connection was swiftly broken by Covid-19. A foreigner in London for only six weeks and his house for two, Pablo Mar\u00ed might have been tempted to head home but he stayed. From there, he talks about Arteta, \u201cClose to the players but demanding too\u201d; about new teammates, players of \u201ctremendous quality\u201d; and their duties to everyone at the club, including through pay cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re discussing how to help, talking constantly. We have to support the club and the employees who work so hard for us. It\u2019s important to contribute.\u201d</p> <p>He talks, too, about NHS staff \u2013 doing \u201can immense job\u201d \u2013 and of keeping his small son entertained with no toys, \u201cthe poor thing\u201d, and working from an empty home, a routine finally broken this week. The club had been sending \u201cdaily plans, revising them regularly, and they sent me a bike, [gym] equipment, weights\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pablo Mar\u00ed does not know if the season will be salvaged and says mentally it is best not to think about that. What he does know is how he would like things to look beyond that. He doesn\u2019t want to walk out of lockdown and out of another club, either. \u201cEngland\u2019s good for me: there\u2019s a thousand things to improve, but I fit. I\u2019m happy and I\u2019d really like Arsenal to use the purchase option. With the coronavirus situation I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s difficult, but I hope I can belong here.</p> <p>\u201cMy moment has arrived. The chance to sign for four years, an opportunity I think I\u2019ve earned. It\u2019s time. I like the idea of no longer going round and round. If I have to, I\u2019ll keep going until my career ends, but I think I\u2019ve found a club to put down roots. A traditional club that supports its people, people who believe in it and give everything. I\u2019d like to be part of that, a great footballer for many years for Arsenal.\u201d</p>",

We didn\u2019t do tests; we did 15 days at home, and no one had [symptoms].\u201d This was not how he planned it, but then nothing has been quite the way Pablo Mar\u00ed planned it, lockdown another chapter in an unusual journey. His route to Arsenal, at 26, was not exactly direct. \u201cI\u2019ve been a professional 10 years and por gracia o desgracia, for better or worse, I\u2019ve been round and round.\u201d That\u2019s one way of putting it. Pablo Mar\u00ed joined Mallorca at 14, making his debut in Spain\u2019s third tier with the B team aged 17, then twice played in Primera \u2013 two substitute appearances six months apart. There were three years at Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona but that was followed by single seasons at Girona, where he barely played; NAC Breda in the Netherlands; and Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, ending with playoff defeat. He didn\u2019t belong to any of them. When he left Gimn\u00e0stic, in 2016, it was for Manchester City but the next day Pablo Mar\u00ed was gone again, loaned to Girona. When he was finally sold, after two more loans, it was to Brazil of all places. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cby then we\u2019d changed cities four times in four years, so our mentality was different. A footballer\u2019s life is short and we\u2019d been waiting years for an opportunity. We didn\u2019t care where and we knew the moment we got it, we were going to take it.\u201d He did not get it in Manchester but there\u2019s no recrimination. He doesn\u2019t know if Arteta\u2019s time there might explain Arsenal\u2019s approach \u2013 \u201cI suppose you could connect those loose ends, I haven\u2019t asked Mikel,\u201d he says \u2013 but he never met Pep Guardiola. Never met anyone, in fact. \u201cYou go [to the City Campus] for medicals each year \u2013 blood tests, urine, scans \u2013 but when I went to the Netherlands and Coru\u00f1a the [City] first team hadn\u2019t started pre-season, so there was no one there. You never cross paths. \u201cThat can feel a bit strange, but City were transparent. The plan was always to go on loan. They help you find teams but never oblige you and the last word always has to be yours. After two years, I said I wanted to return to Spain, go step by step awaiting a chance in Primera. Look, a player has to have one thing very clear: how much you\u2019re prepared to lose to be a professional. You have to ask yourself that question and be honest. It will never, ever be all lovely. Or all awful. My objective was clear: whether it was City or not, I was going to get to a big club. I was absolutely convinced, ever since I left home at 13.\u201d At 25, it still hadn\u2019t happened and yet he insists: \u201cI never thought of giving up. Never. I\u2019ve had really bad moments, but you can\u2019t ever leave something you love. Football might have thrown me out, but I was never going to throw it out.\u201d Even if, after a decade, you\u2019d been stuck in the third tier? \u201cI\u2019d still be playing. Absolutely for sure.\u201d Then Pablo Mar\u00ed smiles again. \u201cAnd look how things happen.\u201d Pretty well, just not the way he imagined it. The breakthrough came 5,200 miles from home. Flamengo, Brazil\u2019s most popular club, offered City \u20ac1.3m. \u201cMy footballing curve; I never thought this could happen. But over the years of work, injuries, without opportunities, I\u2019ve learned that deep inside an attitude builds which says: \u2018The moment someone gives me the chance, there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting go.\u2019 Flamengo gave me that. Any doubts went up in a cloud of smoke.\u201d Almost overnight Pablo Mar\u00ed went from the second division to the Maracan\u00e3, a place where \u201c80,000 people never stop singing, living their day like there\u2019s nothing else in the world\u201d. Right place, right time. \u201cIf I\u2019d gone younger, it might have been different. It\u2019s thanks to those years fighting, hard times, that those six months were so wonderful.\u201d Pablo Mar\u00ed\u2019s first medals followed, the first Spaniard to win the Brazilian title and the Copa Libertadores, secured with two late goals. \u201cUna barbaridad,\u201d he calls it. \u201cI still don\u2019t have the words and don\u2019t think I ever will. I\u2019ll never forget it; it\u2019s etched on my heart.\u201d Nor will one particular Flamengo fan watching from London. When it is suggested that he is David Luiz\u2019s hero now, Pablo Mar\u00ed laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m his idol, but we did talk about the final. He\u2019s helped me loads: anything I needed, he was there. David is so intelligent, great in the dressing room, always joking but the first to pull on his overalls to work. \u201cAnd we were very comfortable playing alongside each other, which is a good sign: a big club needs the centre-backs to connect.\u201d The connection was swiftly broken by Covid-19. A foreigner in London for only six weeks and his house for two, Pablo Mar\u00ed might have been tempted to head home but he stayed. From there, he talks about Arteta, \u201cClose to the players but demanding too\u201d; about new teammates, players of \u201ctremendous quality\u201d; and their duties to everyone at the club, including through pay cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re discussing how to help, talking constantly. We have to support the club and the employees who work so hard for us. It\u2019s important to contribute.\u201d He talks, too, about NHS staff \u2013 doing \u201can immense job\u201d \u2013 and of keeping his small son entertained with no toys, \u201cthe poor thing\u201d, and working from an empty home, a routine finally broken this week. The club had been sending \u201cdaily plans, revising them regularly, and they sent me a bike, [gym] equipment, weights\u201d. Pablo Mar\u00ed does not know if the season will be salvaged and says mentally it is best not to think about that. What he does know is how he would like things to look beyond that. He doesn\u2019t want to walk out of lockdown and out of another club, either. \u201cEngland\u2019s good for me: there\u2019s a thousand things to improve, but I fit. I\u2019m happy and I\u2019d really like Arsenal to use the purchase option. With the coronavirus situation I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s difficult, but I hope I can belong here. \u201cMy moment has arrived. The chance to sign for four years, an opportunity I think I\u2019ve earned. It\u2019s time. I like the idea of no longer going round and round. If I have to, I\u2019ll keep going until my career ends, but I think I\u2019ve found a club to put down roots. A traditional club that supports its people, people who believe in it and give everything. I\u2019d like to be part of that, a great footballer for many years for Arsenal.\u201d",

Testing capacity stood at around 90,000. There has been suspicion that the government may try to claim that reaching 100,000 capacity for tests as a victory on Friday, even if the testing goal itself is missed.

Ministers will not know until Friday how many tests were carried out on 30 April, but the number is likely to jump substantially because the criteria for those eligible for testing was widened this week to include over-65s with symptoms, those who work outside the home with symptoms, and all care home residents and carers, whether or not they have symptoms. Buckland said he was frustrated by the likely failure to hit the target but encouraged that the rate of increase in testing had expanded so rapidly. Earlier, hospital leaders launched a strident attack on the government\u2019s testing strategy, regardless of the target. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, dismissed the 100,000 target as a \u201cred herring\u201d that distracted from the lack of a coherent overall strategy. NHS Providers said in a report on Wednesday: \u201cNHS trust leaders believe they have done all they can to support the national testing effort so far but are increasingly frustrated with the lack of clarity on how the testing regime will be developed for this next phase. \u201cAt the moment they feel they are on the end of a series of frequent tactical announcements extending the testing criteria to new groups, with no visibility on any longer term strategy, and are being expected at the drop of a hat to accommodate these changes with no advance notice or planning.\u201d",

Below is a summary of the developments of the day. If you have any news tips or thoughts, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sarah_marsh_journalist/\">please do share them with me</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson said the UK did the \u201cright thing at the right time\u201d.</strong> Johnson says people should understand that the collating of data internationally is bedevilled with difficulties. The only real comparison will be possible at the end of this, when you look at total excess deaths. He said<strong> </strong>the UK avoided an \u201cuncontrollable and catastrophic\u201d epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths and that we were now \u201cpast the peak\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Following the lead of various world cities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/world-cities-turn-their-streets-over-to-walkers-and-cyclists\">including Bogot\u00e1 and Berlin</a>, Manchester has announced plans to close part of one of its main streets to cars</strong> and widen the pavements along others in order to help people walk and cycle safely while maintaining physical distancing \u2014 and move towards a car-free future.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have now been 26,771 coronavirus deaths in the whole of the UK in all settings, an increase of 674 on yesterday. </strong>These figures are just for people who tested positive for coronavirus. They do not include people who may have died from coronavirus who were not tested.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued a stern warning that GCSE and A-level grade assessments this summer</strong> should not unfairly penalise children from minority ethnic minority backgrounds, as well as disabled pupils and those with special educational needs.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 9,000 fines have been handed to people in England and Wales for allegedly flouting coronavirus lockdown laws, according to new figures.</strong> As PA Media reports, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council<strong> </strong>(NPCC) said <a href=\"https://news.npcc.police.uk/releases/police-chiefs-welcome-positive-start-to-recruitment-drive\">8,877 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) had been recorded by forces in England between March 27 and April 27</a>, while 299 were issued in Wales over the same period. Some 397 were for repeat offenders, with one person fined six times.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eab03128f08fcc89d8bb448\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/andrewsparrow\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T18:01:05.979Z\">7.01pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Boris Johnson's press conference - Summary and analysis</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson warned Britons that they could face an \u201ceven bigger\u201d coronavirus outbreak if the government rushed or mishandled the relaxation of the lockdown.</strong> He made the point in an opening speech which, while not giving any firm details of the government\u2019s plans, effectively paved the way for an announcement next week that seems likely to involve the lockdown being extended yet again in most significant respects. He made the point with a slightly confused Alpine metaphor. He said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have come through the peak.</p> \n   <p>Or rather we\u2019ve come under what could have been a vast peak, as though we\u2019ve been going through some huge alpine tunnel.</p> \n   <p>And we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us.</p> \n   <p>And so it is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain.</p> \n   <p>And so to avoid that disaster our fifth and final test is that nothing as I say we do should lift the R or the reproduction rate of that disease back above one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson then showed a video explaining the R number (the reproduction number - the rate at which a virus spreads) and why it was so important to keep this below 1. It was very hard to see the video as anything other than an attempt to explain the stringent social distancing measures will have to stay in place for a considerable time to come. You can watch it here.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1255893826457214979\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">There are five tests that must be met before social distancing measures can be adjusted.<br><br>One of these is the rate of infection, or R.<br><br>Keeping the R down will be vital to our recovery, and we can only do it with discipline and by working together. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayHomeSaveLives?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StayHomeSaveLives</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Z10K0Yp90m\">pic.twitter.com/Z10K0Yp90m</a></p>\u2014 UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1255893826457214979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that the government would publish \u201ca comprehensive plan\u201d next week explaining how it would be possible to move away from the lockdown. </strong>The Scottish and Welsh governments have already published their own version, and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has repeatedly called for a UK version. Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will be setting out a comprehensive plan next week to explain how we can get our economy moving, one, how we can get our children back to school, back into childcare, second, and third how we can travel to work and how we can make life in the workplace safer.</p> \n   <p>And in short how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time re-start the economy.</p> \n   <p>A huge amount of work has been going on on that that plan and as we produce it we are being guided by the science, and we will try to build the maximum political consensus as we produce it across all parties and across the UK.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, in response to a question from a member of the public (Michelle from Cornwall), Johnson also said that that the plan would not commit the government to relaxing particular restrictions by particular dates. That would depend on the data, he said. Michelle wanted to know when holidaymakers would be able to return to Cornwall. Johnson was unable to give her any firm indication at all.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the government may find \u201cingenious ways\u201d of suppressing coronavirus.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have to .. make sure we not only unlock the economy gradually, but also find ways of continuing to suppress the disease, and possibly find new, more ingenious ways of suppressing the disease. That\u2019s what we are working on now and you\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of that, I hope, next week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant, but he may have given a clue in his answer to a question on face coverings.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson backed the wearing of face coverings by members of the public in some circumstances.</strong> He said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What I think Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] is saying, and what I certainly agree with, is that as part of coming out of the lockdown, I do think that face coverings will be useful both for epidemiological reasons but also for giving people confidence they can go back to work. But you\u2019ll be hearing more about that thing next week.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/sturgeon-urges-scots-to-wear-coronavirus-face-masks-for-shopping-and-travel\">The Scottish government has already backed the wearing of face coverings on public transport and in certain shops. </a>Johnson\u2019s words suggest the UK government is going to issue very similar advice.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the UK has passed the peak of the epidemic.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That was less significant than it sounded, because it has been clear for some time now that the UK has passed the peak. <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/peak-covid-19-deaths-occurring-english-hospitals-passed-8-april\">This week scientists said the peak for coronavirus deaths in English hospitals was passed on 8 April </a>- 22 days ago.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that he did \u201cthe right thing at the right time\u201d when it came to imposing the lockdown.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as we possibly could with the peak of the epidemic.</p> \n   <p>That peak, as I said just now, has passed. I do think that broadly speaking, and we\u2019re learning lessons every day, but I do think that broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is is not a view shared my most members of the public; a poll today suggests two thirds of people think the lockdown was imposed too late. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaabe168f0882b206dcff8f#block-5eaabe168f0882b206dcff8f\"> 1.01pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed that it would be best to wait until all-cause excess death figures are available for all countries before making a judgment as to which countries have been the best and the worst at fighting coronavirus.</strong> This is an argument also endorsed by government scientists, but Johnson sounded more defensive today than on Monday, when <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-in-downing-street-27-april-2020\">in his speech outside No 10</a> he was talking about the UK\u2019s \u201capparent success\u201d. As <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">this chart illustrates</a>, in terms of total coronavirus deaths, the UK now has the third most in the world, behind only the US and Italy.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that he would not resort to austerity to manage the increased debt generated by this crisis. </strong>Asked if there would be a new era of austerity, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think the economy will bounce back strongly, I think that this government will want to encourage that bounce back in all kinds of ways.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve never particularly liked the term that you just used [austerity] to describe government economic policy and it\u2019ll certainly not be part of our approach.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This might turn out to be more of an aspiration, or an insight into Johnson\u2019s linguistic preferences, than a guide to his likely economic policy. As explained earlier, this crisis is set to leave a \u00a3200bn hole in the national finances this year.

The survey is the second full report after an initial pilot to quiz members of the public, and involved more than 679 Welsh residents selected at random, with results adjusted to population demographics.<br><br>Among results, the survey reveals 11% of people think they have had coronavirus \u2013 down from 13% the week before \u2013 with 9% unsure. \u201cOf those that think they have been infected, 8% have had this confirmed with a test,\u201d the survey adds. What\u2019s more, 12% of people say a family member or friend has been hospitalised or died from Covid-19, up from 8% the week before. <br><br>And while 58% of people think the government is doing a good job, 26% disagree or disagree strongly.<br><br>The virus also appears to be fuelling concerns, with 65% of those living with children worried about the children\u2019s wellbeing and almost one in five worrying a lot about their mental health. A similar proportion, 20%, said they worry a lot about losing their job or getting a new one.<br><br>Prof Karen Hughes, who coordinates the survey for Public Health Wales, added: \u201cWeek on week, we are monitoring the views and behaviours of people in Wales during the coronavirus restrictions.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman again played down the prospect of any significant change to the lockdown next week, saying it would be wrong to \u201cgamble away\u201d what has already been achieved.</strong> No 10 has been transmitting this message for some days, but this seemed to be an even stronger hint that people should not expect too much from the review of the lockdown due by Thursday next week. The spokesman said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything which could lead to the virus, which the British public have done so much to suppress, being able to spread in an exponential way again, and that will guide our approach as we move forward. People have made huge sacrifices in order to bring down the rate of infection, to protect the NHS and ultimately to save lives and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to an exponential growth in the disease again.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if the lockdown could continue until June, the spokesman said people would have to wait for the government decision. But he also reminded reporters of what <strong>Prof Chris Whitty</strong>, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has said about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/uk-coronavirus-live-news-boris-johnson-back-at-work-amid-talk-of-easing-lockdown?page=with:block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47#block-5ea7112c8f0821d5b0274a47\">how the virus will be around for a significant period of time.</a> The spokesman went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>As the PM himself has said, the worst thing we could do is relax the social distancing measures too soon and throw away all of the progress that has been made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is still examining the impact that different relaxation measures might have on R, the reproduction number (the infection rate of the virus), and that it did not present any findings to cabinet today.</strong> This work will be crucial because the government will only implement measures relaxing the lockdown that, taken together, do not push R above 1.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Boris Johnson chaired a political meeting of cabinet before the normal cabinet today.</strong> At normal cabinet ministers received updates from Whitty and <strong>Sir Patrick Vallance</strong>, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman came close to ruling out the lockdown measures being eased region by region, instead of on a UK-wide basis. </strong>Yesterday <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister, said that although he favoured maintaining a UK-wide approach, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39#block-5ea9a2728f08745586317f39\">there might be a case for letting island communities do their own thing.</a> But the spokesman played down the prospect of this happening. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We did consider, when we introduced the social distancing measures, bringing them in in some parts of the country ahead of others. We decided not to do that.

It could not legally be the basis for the suspension of repossession actions which had been imposed.</p> \n  <p>But Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the high court, suggested that the practice direction had been imposed in an emergency and that it was effectively \u201ctrialling\u201d changes to the rules. \u201cThis is to see what measures can deal with [cases] in the context of a clogging up of justice\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Lady Justice Simler said the emergency rules did not prevent access to justice but merely imposed a 90-day delay on the process of house repossessions.</p> \n  <p>Lawyers for the justice secretary, Robert Buckland QC, have intervened in the case because of its significance.</p> \n  <p>The Housing Lawyers Practitioners Committee has also been permitted to intervene. In a statement issued before the hearing, the organisation\u2019s co-chairs, Marina Sergides and Simon Mullings, said: \u201cThe issues are crucial to our members and their clients.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In their legal submissions to the court, lawyers for the HLPA said: \u201cIf the appellants succeed in persuading the court that [the practice direction] is ultra vires then [this freeze] will cease to apply to all possession claims.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That would expose many vulnerable people to losing their homes during the lockdown, they argued. \u201cA significant proportion of members\u2019 clients are also vulnerable as a result of physical and/or mental health problems, as a result of which they find it difficult properly to understand information and provide their solicitors with documents and instructions even face-to-face.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The submission added: \u201cThis is a time when litigants, particularly those of limited means, are liable to find it particularly difficult to engage with the courts and with their lawyers if they have them. Practitioners and the courts are under exceptional pressure and the resources available to them are depleted. The provisions take effect for a temporary period while court procedures in response to Covid-19 are evaluated and they are subject to review.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The hearing continues.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:36:19.435Z\">at 1.36pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaac2608f0874558631881d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rebeccasmithers\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T12:20:00.270Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Consumers still panic-buying toilet roll have another option from today.

The Tory-run county councils\u2019 network was furious that its members, all of which provide social care services, had recevied a 29% cash reduction compared with the first bailout, and faced a collective financial shortfall of \u00a3600m.</p> \n  <p>Cllr David Williams, the county councils\u2019 network chair, said: \u201cUnless a solution is forthcoming to address these growing additional pressures as the crisis goes on, and, crucially, our lost income, it is inevitable that the resources in shire counties made available to life-critical social care services will be reduced, resulting in extremely difficult choices facing our member councils.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMost importantly, unless further support is provided to all councils, some may feel that they have no choice but to suspend all non-essential expenditure, hampering our national efforts to defeat the coronavirus and prepare for the economic recovery.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The big winners are smaller districts.

No 10 was very keen to play down those suggestions, and today it is expected that his tone will be much more cautious, stressing the dangers of any significant move away from the restrictions currently in place.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8271289/Blueprint-work-PM-warns-wont-risk-second-wave-coronavirus.html?utm_source=POLITICO.EU&amp;utm_campaign=0ee8e24982-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_30_05_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_10959edeb5-0ee8e24982-189782117\">In the Daily Mail</a> <strong>Jason Groves</strong> quotes a Whitehall source using an interesting image to suggest that only modest changes are in the pipeline for next week. The source told him:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at whether we can undo the top button and make things more comfortable in one or two places for the economy.

I am told that what relaxation there will be will mostly concern outdoor activities. (Though it is worth remembering that there is more flex in the current guidelines than is generally realised. Anyone can go to work, for instance, if they can\u2019t work from home.) Schools in England are likely not to return until after half-term. Next week\u2019s review will, according to one of those involved, be about a \u2018timeline for when we can do things\u2019 rather than an opportunity to do them straight away.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s interview last night (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced#block-5eaa855b8f0882b206dcfced\">9.53am)</a> may have constrained Johnson even further. Until now the four nations of the UK have (with minor exceptions) been adopting a joint approach to coronavirus, agreed at meetings of the emergency committee Cobra, at which the devolved administrations are represented. But Sturgeon has repeatedly said that Scotland would diverge from the UK approach if she thought that was justified. If she were to decide next week that any relaxation of the lockdown would be unacceptable (which is what she hinted last night), it would be risky for Johnson to set different rules for England. Perhaps he would get credit for opening up the economy, but if coronavirus infection rates were to start to soar again south of the border, he would be open to the charge of being reckless with people\u2019s lives.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T10:31:48.540Z\">at 11.31am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa9dc58f08b27d8fdd71be\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jamie-grierson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T09:45:17.121Z\">10.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 3,000 additional officers have joined police forces under the recruitment pledge that formed a centrepiece to Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/more-than-3000-extra-officers-join-police-in-recruitment-drive\">new figures have shown.</a></p> \n  <p>Johnson promised to recruit 20,000 officers during the summer 2019 election campaign, which many noted would in fact replace roughly the same number that had been lost under 10 years of Conservative party austerity.</p> \n  <p>The government set out its plans to recruit 20,000 additional officers by March 2023 in September and the Home Office on Thursday published the first official set of statistics on progress towards that number.</p> \n  <p>They show 3,005 recruits joined the police specifically as part of the uplift programme.

As reported already (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eaa76168f0882b206dcfc93#block-5eaa76168f0882b206dcfc93\">8.06am)</a>, he conceded that the government might miss its target of getting the daily number of coronavirus tests up to 100,000 by the end of April. (Although today is the last day of April, the government has said we might have to wait until Saturday until we officially know whether or not the target has been hit, because it takes time to find out what has happened with home-testing kits.)</p> \n  <p>Here are some of the other lines from his interviews.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Buckland said that Nicola Sturgeon was right to warn that it might not be possible to lift any lockdown measures next week.</strong> The government has to review the lockdown measures by next Thursday, three weeks after the original measures were extended. In an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston programme last night Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that it might be impossible to relax any of the measures currently in place. She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People talk about lifting the lockdown - that is not going to be a flick of the switch moment, we\u2019re going to have to be very careful, very slow, very gradual. I\u2019m far from convinced at this stage that when we get to the next review point on the 7 May we\u2019ll be in a position to lift any of these measures right now, because the margins of manoeuvre that we\u2019re operating in right now are very, very, very tight and narrow.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about her comment, Buckland said Sturgeon was \u201cright to be cautious\u201d.

To continue following our coronavirus coverage, you can check out our global blog - Chancellor Rishi Sunak heralds a day of brighter developments. From the man of the moment, Captain Tom Moore, marking his 100th birthday. SNP leader Nicola sturgeon takes part in the nationwide applause. Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson\u2019s fiancee who gave birth to a boy yesterday, has thanked the NHS and paid tribute to the fund-raising efforts of Captain Tom Moore. England\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s football teams have given their thanks to health service and key workers. Labour leader Keir Starmer has tweeted this tribute. London mayor Sadiq Khan has posted a montage of tributes. The Labour party has posted this message on Twitter. Boris Johnson was outside 10 Downing Street to applaud NHS and key workers on his first week back to work after recovering from Covid-19. Thousands of people across the UK are now applauding the NHS and key carers from their gardens, porches and drives with some holding placards and banging utensils. The Shard is among the buildings which have turned blue to pay homage. In ten minutes time, the UK will unite once again to applaud the NHS and key workers at 20:00 BST (19:00 GMT). It is part of the Clap For Carers initiative which is now in its sixth week. Police have issued a warning to Londoners ahead of the nationwide applause to remain in their homes. Anyone gathering at the city\u2019s landmarks will be told to go home, the Metropolitan Police said. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said: \u201cMembers of the public who are not away from their homes for one of the reasons outlined in the government\u2019s emergency legislation should expect to be asked to return home.\u201d Hello all, we will be putting the blog on hold until 7.50pm (GMT). Below is a summary of the developments of the day. If you have any news tips or thoughts, please do share them with me. Boris Johnson said the UK did the \u201cright thing at the right time\u201d. Johnson says people should understand that the collating of data internationally is bedevilled with difficulties. The only real comparison will be possible at the end of this, when you look at total excess deaths. He said the UK avoided an \u201cuncontrollable and catastrophic\u201d epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths and that we were now \u201cpast the peak\u201d. Following the lead of various world cities including Bogot\u00e1 and Berlin, Manchester has announced plans to close part of one of its main streets to cars and widen the pavements along others in order to help people walk and cycle safely while maintaining physical distancing \u2014 and move towards a car-free future. There have now been 26,771 coronavirus deaths in the whole of the UK in all settings, an increase of 674 on yesterday. These figures are just for people who tested positive for coronavirus. They do not include people who may have died from coronavirus who were not tested. The UK\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued a stern warning that GCSE and A-level grade assessments this summer should not unfairly penalise children from minority ethnic minority backgrounds, as well as disabled pupils and those with special educational needs. More than 9,000 fines have been handed to people in England and Wales for allegedly flouting coronavirus lockdown laws, according to new figures. As PA Media reports, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said 8,877 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) had been recorded by forces in England between March 27 and April 27, while 299 were issued in Wales over the same period. Some 397 were for repeat offenders, with one person fined six times. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference. Boris Johnson warned Britons that they could face an \u201ceven bigger\u201d coronavirus outbreak if the government rushed or mishandled the relaxation of the lockdown. He made the point in an opening speech which, while not giving any firm details of the government\u2019s plans, effectively paved the way for an announcement next week that seems likely to involve the lockdown being extended yet again in most significant respects. He made the point with a slightly confused Alpine metaphor. He said. We have come through the peak. Or rather we\u2019ve come under what could have been a vast peak, as though we\u2019ve been going through some huge alpine tunnel. And we can now see the sunlight and pasture ahead of us. And so it is vital that we do not now lose control and run slap into a second and even bigger mountain. And so to avoid that disaster our fifth and final test is that nothing as I say we do should lift the R or the reproduction rate of that disease back above one. Johnson then showed a video explaining the R number (the reproduction number - the rate at which a virus spreads) and why it was so important to keep this below 1. It was very hard to see the video as anything other than an attempt to explain the stringent social distancing measures will have to stay in place for a considerable time to come. You can watch it here. He said that the government would publish \u201ca comprehensive plan\u201d next week explaining how it would be possible to move away from the lockdown. The Scottish and Welsh governments have already published their own version, and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has repeatedly called for a UK version. Johnson said: I will be setting out a comprehensive plan next week to explain how we can get our economy moving, one, how we can get our children back to school, back into childcare, second, and third how we can travel to work and how we can make life in the workplace safer. And in short how we can continue to suppress the disease and at the same time re-start the economy. A huge amount of work has been going on on that that plan and as we produce it we are being guided by the science, and we will try to build the maximum political consensus as we produce it across all parties and across the UK. But, in response to a question from a member of the public (Michelle from Cornwall), Johnson also said that that the plan would not commit the government to relaxing particular restrictions by particular dates. That would depend on the data, he said. Michelle wanted to know when holidaymakers would be able to return to Cornwall. Johnson was unable to give her any firm indication at all. Johnson said the government may find \u201cingenious ways\u201d of suppressing coronavirus. He said: We have to .. make sure we not only unlock the economy gradually, but also find ways of continuing to suppress the disease, and possibly find new, more ingenious ways of suppressing the disease. That\u2019s what we are working on now and you\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of that, I hope, next week. Johnson did not elaborate on what he meant, but he may have given a clue in his answer to a question on face coverings. Johnson backed the wearing of face coverings by members of the public in some circumstances. He said. What I think Sage [the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] is saying, and what I certainly agree with, is that as part of coming out of the lockdown, I do think that face coverings will be useful both for epidemiological reasons but also for giving people confidence they can go back to work. But you\u2019ll be hearing more about that thing next week. The Scottish government has already backed the wearing of face coverings on public transport and in certain shops. Johnson\u2019s words suggest the UK government is going to issue very similar advice. Johnson said the UK has passed the peak of the epidemic. He said: I can confirm today for the first time that we are past the peak of this disease. We are past the peak and we are on the downward slope. That was less significant than it sounded, because it has been clear for some time now that the UK has passed the peak. This week scientists said the peak for coronavirus deaths in English hospitals was passed on 8 April - 22 days ago. Johnson claimed that he did \u201cthe right thing at the right time\u201d when it came to imposing the lockdown. He said: I think it was completely right to make our period of lockdown coincide as far as we possibly could with the peak of the epidemic. That peak, as I said just now, has passed. I do think that broadly speaking, and we\u2019re learning lessons every day, but I do think that broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time. This is is not a view shared my most members of the public; a poll today suggests two thirds of people think the lockdown was imposed too late. (See 1.01pm.) Johnson claimed that it would be best to wait until all-cause excess death figures are available for all countries before making a judgment as to which countries have been the best and the worst at fighting coronavirus. This is an argument also endorsed by government scientists, but Johnson sounded more defensive today than on Monday, when in his speech outside No 10 he was talking about the UK\u2019s \u201capparent success\u201d. As this chart illustrates, in terms of total coronavirus deaths, the UK now has the third most in the world, behind only the US and Italy. He claimed that he would not resort to austerity to manage the increased debt generated by this crisis. Asked if there would be a new era of austerity, he replied: I think the economy will bounce back strongly, I think that this government will want to encourage that bounce back in all kinds of ways. I\u2019ve never particularly liked the term that you just used [austerity] to describe government economic policy and it\u2019ll certainly not be part of our approach. This might turn out to be more of an aspiration, or an insight into Johnson\u2019s linguistic preferences, than a guide to his likely economic policy. As explained earlier, this crisis is set to leave a \u00a3200bn hole in the national finances this year. (See 4.20pm.) Johnson announced that a further 674 people have died from coronavirus, taking the UK total to 26,771. This counts coronavirus deaths in all settings. But it only includes people who have tested positive for the virus, and it is thought that the true death toll is much higher. He said 81,611 coronavirus tests were carried out yesterday. The government has set a target of getting testing up to 100,000 by today. The Department of Health has clarified the total number of UK coronavirus deaths is 26,771, and not 26,711 as prime minister Boris Johnson said in his press briefing earlier. Following the lead of various world cities including Bogot\u00e1 and Berlin, Manchester has announced plans to close part of one of its main streets to cars and widen the pavements along others in order to help people walk and cycle safely while maintaining physical distancing \u2014 and move towards a car-free future. Soon, Deansgate, home to many shops and bars (and the Guardian\u2019s northern office), will be closed from King Street West to Blackfriars Street. The pedestrianisation will be on a \u201cshare with care\u201d basis, the council says, creating a shared space for pedestrians and cyclists. Last summer part of Deansgate was occupied by Extinction Rebellion and it has been a long-term goal of local campaign group Walk Ride Greater Manchester to see the street closed to cars. In other busy areas of Manchester, pedestrians are to be given more space using heavy-duty \u201cRhino\u201d barriers to create extended pavements, including on Princess Street and London Road in the city centre. The move comes after the Scottish government announced a \u00a310m fund to support pop-up active travel infrastructure across Scotland to help support physical distancing while walking or cycling. Hello everyone. I will be running the blog for the next 30 minutes before handing over to the night team. If you want to share any thoughts, insight or news tips, then please do via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Boris Johnson has suggested that the use of face coverings could be advised as part of measures to ease the lockdown. The prime minister said on Thursday that they would be \u201cuseful\u201d both for stemming the disease and \u201cgiving people confidence\u201d that they could go back to work. Johnson, in his first Downing Street press conference since being stricken with Covid-19, said the UK was \u201cpast the peak of this disease\u201d and \u201con the downward slope\u201d. Another coronavirus surge similar to the rapid onset of the infection would be very difficult to manage in Ireland, an official has warned. The country has played down hopes of a swift easing of social distancing restrictions and is expected to extend the emergency measures early in May. In early March, the country went from 50 people in intensive care to 140 - and that total remained \u201csignificantly elevated\u201d, Prof Philip Nolan said. He added: \u201cCurrently, there are 106 patients in ICU. \u201cIf a similar surge occurred on top of our current ICU figure, we would find it very difficult to manage the treatment of patients.\u201d Fly-tipping has increased by 300% in rural communities during the Covid-19 lockdown, according to new analysis. Researchers from the universities of Southampton and Portsmouth said the increase in illegal waste dumping has followed the closure of almost all tips, while at the same time the number of DIY projects has increased by householders stuck at home. The problem has been worsened with nearly half of all local authority recycling services in the country having been stopped or reduced, and charity shops being closed and not able to take unwanted goods. The use of face masks to limit the spread of Covid-19 risks social isolation for people with hearing difficulties, an academic has warned. Prof Kevin Munro, of the University of Manchester, believes that tackling the pandemic with increased use of masks could bring an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of preventing lip reading and hampering speech intelligibility. The audiologist said: \u201cAt the very least, removing visual cues can make communication more difficult because of the exertion required to listen - especially when there is background noise. Here is the full text of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech at the start of the press conference. And here are the slides (pdf) shown at the start of the press conference. The children\u2019s commissioner for England has issued a strong rebuke to the government, urging ministers to revoke controversial changes to regulations protecting children in care. The amendments, which came into force last week as temporary emergency measures intended to ease the pressure on overstretched local authorities during the coronavirus crisis, have attracted widespread criticism. Anne Longfield has now added her voice to mounting opposition to the changes, tweeting: \u201cWe would like to see all these changes revoked and do not believe that there is sufficient justification for them. This crisis must not remove protections from extremely vulnerable children, particularly at a time of increased vulnerability.\u201d Her intervention comes as children\u2019s rights campaigners begin to mount a legal challenge to the changes which they say remove vital legal safeguards which have been built up over decades to protect children in care. One of the key concerns is the removal of the requirement for a social worker to visit - or even telephone - a child in care every six weeks, reducing it to \u201cas soon as is reasonably practicable\u201d. A requirement for a six monthly review of a child\u2019s care has been similarly relaxed, raising concerns that children\u2019s voices will not be heard. In a strongly-worded statement, Longfield said: \u201cChildren in care are already vulnerable, and this crisis is placing additional strain on them - as most are not in school, less able to have direct contact with family and other trusted professionals, and facing the challenges of lockdown and anxiety about illness - all on top of the trauma they have already experienced. If anything I would expect to see increased protections to ensure their needs are met during this period. \u201cI would like to see all the regulations revoked as I do not believe there is sufficient justification to introduce them. As an absolute minimum, if the government refuses to revoke these regulations I wish to see guidance make clear that these changes will only every be used as a last resort and for as short a time as possible.\u201d The Department for Education maintains that the vast majority of statutory duties remain unaltered, but the changes will allow temporary flexibility to be used where absolutely necessary and expire in September. Pilots\u2019 leaders have repeated criticism of British Airways over plans to cut one in four jobs at the airline. Of the 12,000 jobs under threat at the company because of the dramatic impact of the current lockdown, about 1,100 are expected to involve pilots. Brian Strutton, general secretary of the pilots\u2019 union Balpa, said: \u201cBalpa is fighting to save every pilot job at BA. \u201cThe company has declined Government support, claiming it is financially secure enough to survive the coronavirus crisis, so it is hard to see how these cuts can be justified. \u201cThere are many options to ensure BA can continue its business and survive coronavirus, and Balpa does not accept that job losses are the only answer. \u201cPilots want evidence that all options have been explored fully.\u201d Another 43 people with Covid-19 in Ireland have died, taking the total to 1,232, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre said. Tax will be cut on sales of personal protective equipment from tomorrow, the Treasury announced. A zero-rate of VAT will apply to sales of PPE to help combat the spread of Covid-19 from May 1 until July 31. The three-month tax break, worth more than 100 million, will apply to PPE purchased by care homes, businesses, charities and individuals to protect against the virus. Treasury officials said the government acted as soon as possible to bring the measure into force. During the Brexit transition period, the UK is bound by European Law on VAT which the Treasury said required the UK to charge VAT on the equipment. But the European Commission has indicated support for member states to introduce temporary VAT reliefs to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Q: Key workers in Stoke are being told they have to drive to Manchester for testing. The testing site in Stoke is only available for NHS workers. Will that change? Johnson thanks the journalist for alerting him to this. In principle, every key worker should be able to get a test, he says. He says the UK is doing about as much testing as any other country. It has been ramped up, and it will be ramped up again. On the point about Stoke, he says he will be onto it. Q: How vital a role are Royal Stoke patients playing in the coronavirus drug trials. Whitty and Vallance say the people take part in hospital trials are playing a vital role. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Why is the UK\u2019s death rate so high, especially in care homes? Johnson says there are arguments about co-morbidities, and why some populations are more at risk. But he says he thinks it is too soon to come to conclusions. He says it is best to wait until all-cause excess death figures are available. Q: Do you think remdesivir, the Ebola drug, will be useful? Vallance says there have been two studies. The results are promising. It seems to have some effect. But it is not a magic bullet. Whitty says, as a cautious medical scientist, he wants to wait until he has read the peer-reviewed paper on this. The oral report has been promising, but he wants to see the final research. And he says it is important to remember that treatments get developed in stages. This is an encouraging first step. He says he thinks in the future good treatments will be available. Q: You have made the R rate the guiding star of your policy. What is a manageable R rate? Johnson says he will give a layman\u2019s account. There are different Rs in different environment. What matters is stopping the national rate go above 1. We are starting to get much better data now about what is happening, he says. He says this means, as they go forward, they can be much more \u201csophisticated\u201d in the way they respond. Q: Can we expect some clarity on face masks next week? Johnson says, as part of coming out of the lockdown, face coverings will be \u201cuseful\u201d, both for epidemiological reasons, and also to give people confidence to go back to work. Johnson backs the use of face coverings in some circumstances. Whitty says the government is very concerned that people are not seeking treatment for other conditions, like cancer. The NHS is trying to ensure that as much as possible services are now switched on. Those services that are most urgent will be prioritised, he says. Johnson says people should be going to hospital if they have urgent conditions. Q: The UK may have the worst death toll in Europe. What lessons have you learnt from this? Johnson says people should understand that the collating of data internationally is bedevilled with difficulties. The only real comparison will be possible at the end of this, when you look at total excess deaths. He says he put in the lockdown at an earlier stage, relatively, than France and Spain. He says he thinks the UK did the right measures at the right time. They made it coincide with the peak, he says. But he says the peak has based. He says, \u201cbroadly speaking\u201d, he thinks they did \u201cthe right thing at the right time\u201d. There was a real risk that people might not get ventilators, or access to intensive care. This country did come together to protect the NHS, he says. On the international data, wait and see. Whitty says we are \u201cnowhere near the end of this epidemic\u201d. He goes on: Let\u2019s not go charging in to who\u2019s won and who\u2019s lost. He says there is an excellent article in today\u2019s Guardian on this by David Spiegelhalter. It says we need to wait to make these comparisons. Q: National debt is rising by hundreds of billions. How great a risk is there of a new era of austerity after this? Johnson says he thinks the economy will bounce back strongly. He says the government will encourage that in a number of ways. He says he has never liked the term austerity. It won\u2019t be part of his approach, he says. Q: There have been 26,000 deaths since you last stood at that lectern. And huge economic damage has been done. Are you telling people they will have to wait before you can reopen the economy? Johnson says we mourn for lives lost, but for the economic damage too. People\u2019s dreams are being shattered. The government has made a huge effort to protect people. It is doing everything it can. He pays tribute to Rishi Sunak. But if the UK is to bounce back as strongly as it can, we must not have another bout of this, or \u201canother bad spike\u201d. That is why we have to calibrate our measures so carefully, he says. That might involve finding \u201cnew ways, more ingenious ways\u201d of suppressing the disease too. Q: What level has R have to be? Whitty says there is no obvious answer. But it must be below 1. If it is above 1, exponential growth in the disease will happen. But he warns that there are other health impacts of coronavirus. Vallance says before this we were talking of the \u201cdoubling time\u201d of the epidemic. We are now talking about the \u201chalving time\u201d he says. Katie from Liverpool asks what help is available for people with mental health issues. Johnson says this is very important. He says the fact that pressure has been taken off the NHS means it now has the capacity to deal with other patients. He says money is being put into mental healthcare charities. This is why it is all the more urgent to come out of lockdown, but to continue to suppress the disease. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, says the gov.uk website has contact details not just for the NHS, but for organisations like the Samaritans. If people are feeling low, they should use these numbers. There are people out there to help you. Johnson says it is vital that people use these helplines. Johnson is now taking questions from members of the public. Michelle from Cornwall asks what the plan is for tourism in places like Cornwall. She says she is getting questions daily about when lets will open again. Johnson says people have been staying away. It is vital that that does not fray yet. Next week the government will publish a road map, listing options. As for dates, that will depend on the data. He says he does want to reopen tourism. But they have to get the timing right. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, is presenting the daily slides now. Here is the chart for hospital admissions, which are coming down. Here is the chart showing the decrease in the number of deaths. That video sounded very much like one produced to explain why the lockdown will not be relaxed next week. A video is now being played explaining the five tests. It focuses on the R number. And it explains how if R is more than 1, the virus will spread quickly. If it is less than 1, the rate of infection will slow down and come under control. In March, at its peak, R was around 3. But since then, thanks to the social distancing measures, it has fallen below 1. But it is vital it stays below 1, the video says, and the government will be monitoring it carefully. Johnson says that at no stage has the NHS been overwhelmed. He says the UK avoided an \u201cuncontrollable and catastrophic\u201d epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths. He says he can confirm that the UK is now \u201cpast the peak\u201d. (In fact, that has been obvious for some time.) He says the UK will have to beat this \u201cby our resolve and ingenuity\u201d. He says he will publish a comprehensive plan next week. It will cover three things: how we can restart the economy; how we can get our children back to school; and how we can get people into work. There will be five key tests, he says. First, we must be able to protect the NHS and its ability to cope. Second, there must be a sustained fall in deaths. Third, the infection rate must be falling. Fourth, we must deal with the challenges of testing and PPE. And, fifth, we must ensure that there is no second peak that could overwhelm the NHS. He says we can see the pasture ahead of us. But it is vital not to run straight into another disaster. That means nothing we do can lift the R, the reproduction number, above 1. Boris Johnson is holding his press conference. He says 81,611 tests were carried out yesterday. There have now been 26,771 coronavirus deaths in the whole of the UK in all settings, an increase of 674 on yesterday. (These figures are just for people who tested positive for coronavirus. They do not include people who may have died from coronavirus who were not tested.) Opinium has some new polling about trust and coronavirus that will shed some light on the controversy generated by the No 10 claim that public confidence in the media has \u201ccollapsed\u201d. (See 1.58pm.) It is good to see the Guardian ahead of all other newspapers in the trust column. We are not as trusted as the UK government (the public aren\u2019t right about everything), but, looking at the most trusted column (the 7-10 one) Downing Street should be wondering by the Welsh government (a bit) and the Scottish government (a lot) are both trusted more than the UK government. Downing Street has released this picture of Boris Johnson chairing a largely digital cabinet meeting this morning. From the BBC\u2019s health editor, Hugh Pym: The health department in Northern Ireland has now released today\u2019s detailed coronavirus figures. The headline numbers were announced by the health minister, Robin Swann, earlier. (See 3.12pm.) The Guardian\u2019s latest Science Weekly podcast is out. Sarah Boseley talks to Prof Helen McShane about why there has been interest in the tuberculosis vaccine and whether it could play a role in protecting us against Covid-19. The UK\u2019s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued a stern warning that GCSE and A-level grade assessments this summer should not unfairly penalise children from minority ethnic minority backgrounds, as well as disabled pupils and those with special educational needs. David Isaac, the EHRC\u2019s executive chair, said Ofqual, England\u2019s exams regulator, should warn schools to account for potential bias in making assessments to determine grades in the place of exams. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get this right the future of some disadvantaged young people is severely at risk. We can\u2019t let the crisis happening now affect the future of disadvantaged pupils when so many, particularly disabled pupils and those of ethnic minority background, already face an uphill battle,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cAt this time it is critically important that public authorities meet the requirements of the public sector equality duty, and consider the needs and disadvantages facing pupils with different protected characteristics when they are deciding and implementing their response to the coronavirus emergency.\u201d In its response to Ofqual\u2019s consultation, the EHRC called for teachers to be told how to \u201cminimise the risk of conscious or unconscious bias\u201d in assessing pupils, and for pupils to have a \u201cmeaningful and timely route of appeal, including on grounds of suspected unlawful discrimination\u201d. In March the government and Ofqual announced that formal exams for A-levels and GCSEs would be scrapped and replaced by assessments by schools, moderated by examination boards and Ofqual\u2019s formula to award individual grades to each pupil. Governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have adopted similar methods. A spokesperson for Ofqual said: \u201cWe do recognise there are concerns about the potential for students to be disadvantaged by this approach and published an equality impact assessment, informed by a review of research literature on bias in teacher assessments, when our consultation was launched. We have and will be engaging further with organisations and groups that have raised concerns about this issue. \u201cOur standardisation model will be designed to ensure, so far as is possible, that students are not advantaged or disadvantaged on the basis of their socio-economic background or because they have a particular protected characteristic. \u201cStudents who do not feel their calculated grade reflects their performance will also have the opportunity to sit an exam in the autumn. We will shortly consult on details of the autumn exam series \u2013 we hope anyone with views about how the series might run, or its impact on particular students, will respond to our further consultation.\u201d Here is a good question from below the line. There is no accurate running total, but the Office for Budget Responsibility produced a good, provisional guess in the report (pdf) it published two weeks ago looking at the impact of coronavirus on the public finances. The news reports focused on the OBR\u2019s suggestion that GDP could fall by 35% in the second quarter of the year, leading to unemployment rising by more than 2m, and so these figures were slightly overlooked. These OBR figures are based partly on government policies already announced and partly based on a \u201creference scenario\u201d - a plausible assumption as to what might happen, including a three month lockdown followed by three months of partial lockdown. The figures are breathtaking. The government would have to spend an extra \u00a3100bn this year, the OBR suggests. The figures are on page 18, or in this chart here. But that\u2019s only the start. The OBR also looked at the amount the government was likely to lose through lost tax revenue, and this sum came to an astonishing \u00a3130bn for this financial year. The chart is on page 20. That is why the OBR thinks the coronavirus crisis could see government borrowing rise by more than \u00a3200bn, creating the biggest single-year deficit since world war two. Public Health Wales has released this week\u2019s survey of how the public feel about the coronavirus and its impact on their lives. The survey is the second full report after an initial pilot to quiz members of the public, and involved more than 679 Welsh residents selected at random, with results adjusted to population demographics. Among results, the survey reveals 11% of people think they have had coronavirus \u2013 down from 13% the week before \u2013 with 9% unsure. \u201cOf those that think they have been infected, 8% have had this confirmed with a test,\u201d the survey adds. What\u2019s more, 12% of people say a family member or friend has been hospitalised or died from Covid-19, up from 8% the week before. And while 58% of people think the government is doing a good job, 26% disagree or disagree strongly. The virus also appears to be fuelling concerns, with 65% of those living with children worried about the children\u2019s wellbeing and almost one in five worrying a lot about their mental health. A similar proportion, 20%, said they worry a lot about losing their job or getting a new one. Prof Karen Hughes, who coordinates the survey for Public Health Wales, added: \u201cWeek on week, we are monitoring the views and behaviours of people in Wales during the coronavirus restrictions. Over the coming weeks we will be examining how age, gender and poverty affect people\u2019s ability to cope and ensure such information is available to those delivering support services. The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases among prison staff has outripped prisoners for the first time since the lockdown restrictions were imposed, the latest daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As at 5pm on Wednesday, 341 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 72 prisons, a 1% rise in 24 hours, while 364 prison staff across 64 prisons were confirmed to have the virus, an 8% rise in the same period. Prison staff have had access to testing, while prisoner testing has been \u201climited and variable\u201d, according to a recent Public Health England report. There are around 81,100 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons, and around 33,000 staff work in the public sector prisons. The figures published by the MoJ are not live cases but include individuals who have recovered. Hello everyone. As we work continue with the live feed we really value your input. Please do share any insight, information or news tips with via any of the channels below. Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com As lockdown transforms the UK into a nation of DIY barbers and hairstylists, Community Integrated Care - one of Britain\u2019s biggest social care charities - is asking celebrities and the public to \u201cshow they care\u201d with their hair. The #CareWithHair challenge encourages people to share their DIY hair styling experiences on social media and donate the money they would have spent on professional hair treatments. All money raised will help support the wellbeing of social care workers and the people they support through the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. Famous faces committed to taking part include several leading Super League rugby league stars, such as Peter Mata\u2019utia (Castleford Tigers), Willie Isa (Wigan Warriors), and Danny Walker (Warrington Wolves), England Rugby and Saracens hero Owen Farrell as well as England lioness and Manchester City footballer Georgia Stanway - shown clipping the hair of boyfriend and rugby player Oliver Ashall - and Sky Sports host Terry O\u2019Connor. Parliamentarians in Wales have been told there is \u201cno easy way out\u201d of the coronavirus crisis. Giving evidence to the Welsh assembly\u2019s health committee, Dr Rob Orford, Wales\u2019 chief scientific adviser for health, said the government did not have \u201ca lot of headroom\u201d because infection levels would increase if lockdown restrictions were significantly lifted. He said: There is no easy way out, there is no easy answer. This is going to be a hard-fought battle and we will need to feel our way forwards working with colleagues at a UK level and internationally to find the best ways ... There is no silver bullet to this problem. More than 9,000 fines have been handed to people in England and Wales for allegedly flouting coronavirus lockdown laws, according to new figures. As PA Media reports, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) said 8,877 fixed penalty notices (FPNs) had been recorded by forces in England between March 27 and April 27, while 299 were issued in Wales over the same period. Some 397 were for repeat offenders, with one person fined six times. Police have been given powers to hand out a \u00a360 penalty, that is reduced to \u00a330 if paid within two weeks, for breaches of the government\u2019s restriction of movement rules. Boris Johnson has released the text of a letter he has written to Capt Tom Moore, the war veteran and NHS fundraiser who is celebrating his 100th birthday today. Robin Swann, the health minister in the Northern Ireland executive, has said there have been another nine deaths in Northern Ireland of patients who tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths in the region recorded so far by his department to 347. NHS England has announced 391 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 20,131. The full details are here. NHS England says: Patients were aged between 15 and 101 years old. 15 of the 391 patients (aged between 49 and 97 years old) had no known underlying health condition. Of the 391 new deaths announced today, 78 occurred on 29 April, 140 occurred on 28 April and 42 occurred on 27 April. Public Health Wales has reported a further 22 deaths from coronavirus, taking the total in Wales to 908. The full details are here. Boris Johnson has been urged to publish the UK\u2019s exit strategy from the coronavirus lockdown to give clarity to businesses and communities across the country. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said that, while there was an understanding of the need for lockdown, transparency was needed for what comes next. In an interview with ITV News, Starmer also said he believed an inquiry into the UK\u2019s response to the pandemic was \u201cinevitable\u201d. \u201cI think the government were slow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment, and may now be slow on our exit strategy,\u201d he said.

I will try to respond to you in due course. Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the main points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman again played down the prospect of any significant change to the lockdown next week, saying it would be wrong to \u201cgamble away\u201d what has already been achieved. No 10 has been transmitting this message for some days, but this seemed to be an even stronger hint that people should not expect too much from the review of the lockdown due by Thursday next week. The spokesman said: We don\u2019t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything which could lead to the virus, which the British public have done so much to suppress, being able to spread in an exponential way again, and that will guide our approach as we move forward. People have made huge sacrifices in order to bring down the rate of infection, to protect the NHS and ultimately to save lives and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to an exponential growth in the disease again. When asked if the lockdown could continue until June, the spokesman said people would have to wait for the government decision. But he also reminded reporters of what Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has said about how the virus will be around for a significant period of time. The spokesman went on: As the PM himself has said, the worst thing we could do is relax the social distancing measures too soon and throw away all of the progress that has been made. The spokesman said that Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is still examining the impact that different relaxation measures might have on R, the reproduction number (the infection rate of the virus), and that it did not present any findings to cabinet today. This work will be crucial because the government will only implement measures relaxing the lockdown that, taken together, do not push R above 1. The spokesman said Boris Johnson chaired a political meeting of cabinet before the normal cabinet today. At normal cabinet ministers received updates from Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. The spokesman came close to ruling out the lockdown measures being eased region by region, instead of on a UK-wide basis. Yesterday Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that although he favoured maintaining a UK-wide approach, there might be a case for letting island communities do their own thing. But the spokesman played down the prospect of this happening. He said: We did consider, when we introduced the social distancing measures, bringing them in in some parts of the country ahead of others. We decided not to do that. We decided it was more effective to bring in the measures on a nationwide basis. The spokesman indicated that this would be the approach the government would follow going ahead. He also said all four nations of the UK were keen to carry on moving ahead as one. The spokesman refused to concede that the government was not likely to meet its target of getting coronavirus testing up to 100,000 per day by today. He pointed to the progress made in recent weeks towards hitting this target as evidence that testing had intensified. The spokesman was unable to cite evidence defending a claim that \u201cpublic confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency\u201d. At the end of last week another Downing Street spokesman made that claiming in a response to the Guardian\u2019s story about Dominic Cummings taking part in Sage meetings that included the line: \u201cPublic confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.\u201d Asked to defend the statement, the spokesman, who is a civil servant, said this was a matter for his party political press colleagues (who also speak on the PM\u2019s behalf). As this YouGov chart illustrates, polling suggests that the crisis has not led to a collapse in trust in the media. The spokesman said Johnson would be taking part in the Clap for Carers event tonight. The spokesman refused to give any more information about the PM\u2019s new baby son. He would not even say whether or not Carrie Symonds and the baby remained in hospital. An attempt to overturn the judiciary\u2019s temporary freeze preventing evictions and home repossessions during the pandemic is being made in the court of appeal. Lawyers for an insolvency firm have lodged an emergency application over the alleged failure to keep up payments on mortgages on two houses in Hertfordshire that were already the subject of a legal dispute. The judicial practice direction ensuring that no one would lose their homes during the outbreak or be the subject of legal action that could result in being made homeless was authorised by the master of the rolls, Sir Terence Etherton, who is head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales. Philip Rainey QC, acting for Mehmet Arkin, an insolvency practitioner, told the court of appeal in a hearing conducted over remote video links on Thursday, that the rules were \u201cultra vires\u201d - having not been made in accordance with the law. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly important during an emergency that restrictive measures have a proper basis in law,\u201d Rainey told the court. \u201cThere are very good reasons why parliament would wish to impose restrictions on what would normally be acceptable in a democracy but there must be a proper legal basis.\u201d The practice direction used by the judiciary, number 51.2, only refers to matters that the courts are \u201cpiloting\u201d as experiments within the court system, Rainey said. It could not legally be the basis for the suspension of repossession actions which had been imposed. But Sir Geoffrey Vos, chancellor of the high court, suggested that the practice direction had been imposed in an emergency and that it was effectively \u201ctrialling\u201d changes to the rules. \u201cThis is to see what measures can deal with [cases] in the context of a clogging up of justice\u201d. Lady Justice Simler said the emergency rules did not prevent access to justice but merely imposed a 90-day delay on the process of house repossessions. Lawyers for the justice secretary, Robert Buckland QC, have intervened in the case because of its significance. The Housing Lawyers Practitioners Committee has also been permitted to intervene. In a statement issued before the hearing, the organisation\u2019s co-chairs, Marina Sergides and Simon Mullings, said: \u201cThe issues are crucial to our members and their clients.\u201d In their legal submissions to the court, lawyers for the HLPA said: \u201cIf the appellants succeed in persuading the court that [the practice direction] is ultra vires then [this freeze] will cease to apply to all possession claims.\u201d That would expose many vulnerable people to losing their homes during the lockdown, they argued. \u201cA significant proportion of members\u2019 clients are also vulnerable as a result of physical and/or mental health problems, as a result of which they find it difficult properly to understand information and provide their solicitors with documents and instructions even face-to-face.\u201d The submission added: \u201cThis is a time when litigants, particularly those of limited means, are liable to find it particularly difficult to engage with the courts and with their lawyers if they have them. Practitioners and the courts are under exceptional pressure and the resources available to them are depleted. The provisions take effect for a temporary period while court procedures in response to Covid-19 are evaluated and they are subject to review.\u201d The hearing continues. Consumers still panic-buying toilet roll have another option from today. A brand new recycled toilet paper brand has been launched, with all profits helping to fund wellbeing packs along with travel and accommodation costs for NHS frontline workers. So-called Serious Tissues was set up by the brains behind Change Please, a Big Issue Invest-backed social enterprise which helps get homeless people off the street by training them as coffee baristas. The new product is made from paper and cardboard recycled from offices and homes. Originally designed to help tackle the climate change crisis and save some of the 10m trees cut down every year to make toilet paper, the new product was meant to go on sale in the summer. But the launch was brought forward in response to the Covid-19 outbreak and to direct all profits to NHS Charities Together. Reports from adults concerned about child abuse have increased by almost a fifth during the coronavirus lockdown, the NSPCC has said. Its helpline received 2,216 calls about children facing neglect, physical and emotional abuse in the first four weeks of the lockdown. This compares with 1,867 calls made in the four weeks prior. Lockdown measures are likely to be \u201cintensifying abuse and increasing the impact it has on children who can\u2019t escape it\u201d, the child protection charity said. At her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon has told the Scottish public it is highly unlikely that there will be a loosening of lockdown restrictions next week. Noting the next review lockdown guidance planned for 7 May, she warned that \u201cit may well be too early even by this time next week to reduce the current restrictions\u201d. Saying she wanted to be as open as possible, she stressed that \u201cour assessment as of today of the data and the evidence is that it would not be safe\u201d to lift the restrictions. She urged the Scottish public not to ease up on travel restrictions in particular, revealing that there has been a significant increase over the last week: people using concessionary bus travel by one-sixth, and car traffic up by 5%. Saying that she remained \u201can eternal optimist\u201d that the situation would improve, she acknowledged that \u201ceverybody is getting really frustrated\u201d, adding that it was \u201cmuch tougher for certain groups of people, people with children, people who don\u2019t have a garden, people who live in tenement flats\u201d. She told reporters: \u201cI can\u2019t wave a magic want and make that frustration go away. What I can do is tell you why it is necessary.\u201d Evidence is building that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting abnormalities in patients, which could increase their risk of death. Researchers in Ireland have reported finding that patients with severe coronavirus infection have micro blood clots in their lungs \u2013 something they say is not seen in other lung conditions, and could explain why people with severe Covid-19 have a drastic drop in blood oxygen levels. The study, published in the British Journal of Haematology by researchers at the Irish Centre for Vascular Biology, RCSI and St James\u2019s hospital, Dublin, also reveals the higher the levels of various markers indicating abnormal blood clotting, the worse a patient\u2019s prognosis. \u201cFurther studies will be required to investigate whether different blood thinning treatments may have a role in selected high-risk patients in order to reduce the risk of clot formation,\u201d said Prof James O\u2019Donnell director of the Irish Centre for Vascular Biology. It is not the first study to highlight clotting issues among those with Covid-19. Previous studies have suggested severe Covid-19 may be associated with an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and stroke \u2013 even in young people \u2013 while recent work by other researchers has also raised concerns about blood-clotting complications in Covid-19 patients. The Irish team say unusual blood clotting may help to explain why people of some ethnicities appear to be at greater risk from Covid-19 than others, since black people have a higher risk of blood-clotting problems than white people and Asian people have a lower risk than both. \u201cOur findings raise the intriguing possibility that pulmonary vasculopathy may contribute to the unexplained differences that are beginning to emerge highlighting racial susceptibility to Covid\u201019 mortality,\u201d the Irish team write. The number of people who believe the government did not act quickly enough in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak is increasing, according to a poll. Two thirds of adults think ministers brought in strict measures to deal with the emergency too late, a rise from 57% two weeks ago, the Ipsos Mori survey (pdf) found. The snapshot poll said people were also becoming less concerned about the risks to them personally from the outbreak. In the past month, the percentage of people expressing concern about the risk to themselves over time has dropped nine points to stand at 69%. Tony Lloyd, the Labour MP for Rochdale in Greater Manchester, spent 25 days in Manchester Royal Infirmary with Covid-19, including 10 days in an induced coma on a ventilator. He spoke to the Guardian\u2019s north of England editor, Helen Pidd, about the humbling experience, from strange dreams to how it\u2019s changed him for good.

Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The government is to step up its campaign to find British workers to pick fruit and vegetables during the coronavirus lockdown. The environment, food and rural affairs minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble said farms currently had sufficient seasonal labour. But he said the campaign to plug the gap left by having fewer pickers from abroad would be \u201cescalated\u201d next month. In a virtual Lords question time session, Gardiner said he was confident people would come forward to pick \u201cexcellent\u201d British fruit and vegetables. Nicola Sturgeon starts her daily briefing by confirming 11,353 positive cases of coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of 319 from yesterday. There are now 1,748 patients in hospital with suspected or confirmed Covid-19, an increase of 21; 109 in intensive care, a decrease of five from yesterday. She also said that 2,538 patients who had the virus had left hospital since 5 March. But in the last 24 hours there were a further 60 deaths registered, taking that total to 1,475. A fifth of high street stores plan to stay closed permanently after the coronavirus lockdown unwinds, retail leaders have told MPs. Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of the British Independent Retailers Association, told the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee it has been the \u201cworst time ever for retail\u201d after the pandemic hit the UK. He said 20% of retailers surveyed by the trade body claimed they did not intend to reopen after the lockdown. Goodacre added: \u201cFor those even saying they would look to reopen, there is a huge caveat about the level of trade on whether they would continue to reopen. \u201cIf the footfall is impacted and social distancing exists and they find it hard to meet needs of customers and workers, it would be more expensive to reopen than to stay closed.\u201d At the government press conference on Tuesday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was asked by the New Scientist\u2019s Adam Vaughan how many contact tracers the government has already recruited. There are supposed to be 18,000 in place by the middle of next month. Hancock did not know, but he said he would try to get an answer. Now Vaughan has been told the Department for Health and Social Care won\u2019t release that information. As he writes, \u201ca spokesperson [for the department] confirmed that recruitment had begun and said work was under way to ensure a rapid increase in tracers, but would not say how many there are now.\u201d More than 1,800 workers are set to lose their jobs at Oasis and Warehouse and two other brands, after administrators said they were unable to find a buyer for the business. Deloitte said that all stores would close indefinitely and online sales would be stopped. The failure to save any part of Oasis Warehouse Limited, the company behind the two brands, along with The Idle Man and Bastyan Fashions, will result in the loss of 1,803 jobs. Deloitte said it had sold the intellectual property and the company\u2019s stock to restructuring expert Hilco Capital, but Hilco had decided not to buy the rest of the business. Administrator Rob Harding said: \u201cCovid-19 has presented extraordinary challenges which have devastated the retail industry. It is with great sadness that we have to announce a sale of the business has not been possible and that we are announcing so many redundancies today.\u201d He added: \u201cThis is a very difficult time for the group\u2019s employees and other key stakeholders and we will do everything we can to support them through this. New video technology is being introduced to enable criminal trials in crown and magistrates courts to be conducted securely over remote video links during the pandemic. The first phase of the new video platform, known as Kinly Cloud Video Platform (CVP), will be rolled out to more than 100 courts in England and Wales. HM Courts and Tribunal Service has so far run 412 remand hearings using CVP, brought on line 26 police custody suites and connected 95 advocates, 42 crown prosecutors, 20 probation officers and two translators. The courts minister, Chris Philp, said: It is essential that justice continues to be served in these difficult times and this new platform will help equip courts across England and Wales with secure and robust video technology to enable them to carry out more of their vital work. We have already seen a huge rise in the number of cases being heard remotely, and this innovation will ensure the wheels of justice continue to turn. Researchers say the preliminary results from UCL trials to treat Covid-19 with the drug Remdesivir are \u201creally promising,\u201d but acknowledged that there was \u201ca little way to go\u201d. They said that \u201cin principle\u201d the treatment could assist in the process of easing the UK lockdown but that it would depend more on dealing with transmission within the community. They added that more informative results would be available near to the end of May. Supermarkets have been urged to welcome all families \u201cwith kindness and compassion\u201d, following a surge in reports of single parents across Scotland being challenged or turned away by staff and abused by members of the public as they try to shop with their children, our colleague Libby Brooks reports. There is a lot of concern that the lockdown could disproportionately affect women - even if the disease itself kills more men. The Fawcett Society put it like this: Women are more likely to be in low paid and insecure work, and existing inequalities, especially for BAME women, mean that they are being disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak. Women still do the majority of unpaid care and school and nursery closures mean women are having to give up work or reduce their hours. On top of this, the majority of key workers in highest risk role are women and with PPE shortages their lives are being put at risk. Reflecting these concerns, Caroline Nokes, the chair of the Commons women and equalities committee has called on the government to publish the equalities assessment of the Coronavirus Act, the emergency legislation passed giving the government powers to deal with the crisis. The impact assessment for the act states that an equalities assessment was \u201ccarried out separately as part of the public sector equalities duty\u201d - but it hasn\u2019t been published. In evidence to the committee, Liz Truss, the women and equalities minister, said that this was because of the potential \u201cchilling effect on being frank in those assessments\u201d if the people preparing them knew they would be published. But the committee has argued that the assessment isn\u2019t only to inform the government - its also to inform those likely to be hit hardest, and help experts and organisations mitigate the worst effects. Nokes said in a letter to Truss: Many individuals and groups submitting evidence to our inquiry have highlighted how they consider the existing measures to have disproportionately impacted them. Such measures may, of course, be necessary and unavoidable. Surely, in a fair and democratic society, it is only right that we are able to have an open conversation about the equality assessment; to allow committees such as ours, individuals and other groups to scrutinise the government\u2019s work and contribute to mitigating any negative consequences. High Street coffee chain Pret a Manger is to reopening a further 20 of its shop kitchens from tomorrow, offering takeaway and delivery only via Deliveroo, Just Eat and UberEats. It is also rolling over a 50% discount for NHS workers until 15 May. The 20 shops being reopened are in central and Greater London, and follow earlier openings of 10 outlets near major hospitals in the capital. As well as a limited menu of its most popular sandwiches, salads, baguettes, drinks and snacks, it will be selling essential items such as milk, butter and coffee. Customers and staff will be separated by perspex screens at the till areas, and subject to strict social distancing measures in all areas of the shops. Hello everyone.

Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Hundreds of people gathered to pay tribute to an NHS staff member who died after contracting coronavirus as her funeral cortege passed the hospital where she worked. Jane Murphy, 73, worked at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary for almost 30 years, first as a cleaner before being retrained as a clinical support worker. She had been placed on sick leave when the coronavirus outbreak first emerged due to her age and is believed to have died on 16 April. Her funeral cortege passed the hospital on Thursday morning to allow colleagues to pay their last respects. The road up to the accident and emergency department was lined by medical staff who threw flowers on to the hearse, and it stopped outside the entrance so more floral tributes could be placed inside. Janice Alexander, the hospital\u2019s site director, said: \u201cJane was an exceptionally well-respected and well-loved colleague at the Royal Infirmary, who will be greatly missed by many. \u201cFrom everyone at the site, and across NHS Lothian, I would like to extend our heartfelt thoughts and wishes to Jane\u2019s family at this difficult time.\u201d Around four in 10 key workers are concerned about their health and safety during the coronavirus pandemic, a survey has revealed. Some 179 (59.7%) key workers questioned by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said their jobs wre being affected by the Covid-19 outbreak. Of these, 39.6% said they had health and safety fears, while others were also concerned about increased working hours. The ONS has included estimates of the experiences of key workers for the first time in its weekly analysis of the impact of coronavirus on society and the economy. The allocation of a \u00a31.6bn government bailout to help councils meet extra coronavirus costs has triggered a familiar political row after it emerged smaller authorities in the leafy south of England had benefited at the expense of poorer northern authorities. Steve Rotheram, the elected mayor of Liverpool city region, said the government had in effect chosen to take money away from councils which were struggling to meet spiralling costs on the frontline of the social care battle against coronavirus. He said Liverpool city region would be left hundreds of millions out of pocket as a result of a change in the way bailout cash was allocated, while one of its six councils, Knowsley, the second most deprived in the country, would see its share cut by 39%. Having issued a first \u00a31.6bn bailout in March using an allocation formula based on need, which favoured many of those councils which provide social care, the second tranche of government bailout ordered this month switched to a population-based formula, favouring districts, which don\u2019t provide social care. Analysis by urban councils body Sigoma showed that the switch favoured authorities in the south-east and east of England, whose average bailout share went up 20% and 11% respectively, compared with councils in London, down 4%, the north-west, -13%, and the north-east, -19%. But the sense of being short-changed did not fall neatly along straightforward regional or political lines. The Tory-run county councils\u2019 network was furious that its members, all of which provide social care services, had recevied a 29% cash reduction compared with the first bailout, and faced a collective financial shortfall of \u00a3600m. Cllr David Williams, the county councils\u2019 network chair, said: \u201cUnless a solution is forthcoming to address these growing additional pressures as the crisis goes on, and, crucially, our lost income, it is inevitable that the resources in shire counties made available to life-critical social care services will be reduced, resulting in extremely difficult choices facing our member councils. \u201cMost importantly, unless further support is provided to all councils, some may feel that they have no choice but to suspend all non-essential expenditure, hampering our national efforts to defeat the coronavirus and prepare for the economic recovery.\u201d The big winners are smaller districts. Most will receive at least \u00a31m extra, the government said. They had been lobbying ministers hard for more funding, arguing that the wipeout of key income streams on which they are heavily reliant under lockdown, such as car parking and fees had left many districts close to bankruptcy. Cllr John Fuller, chairman of the District Councils\u2019 Network, said: \u201cWe are pleased that government has listened to districts and acted on our call for vital extra funding so that we can continue to fight coronavirus, reduce homelessness, protect the vulnerable and collect waste. English councils fear that a continuation of lockdown trends of soaring service cost and shrinking income will leave them with a shortfall of at least \u00a35bn for the year, and there are likely to be fresh calls for extra government cash. The government said it has for the time being abandoned plans to implement a new \u201cfair funding\u201d formula to allocate annual grant funding for English councils. This caused a huge political row earlier this year when modelling showed Tory-run shires would benefit at the expense of mainly-Labour-run urban authorities. Seven more charter flights to repatriate 2,000 British travellers from India have been announced by the government. More than 15,000 Britons will have been brought home from the country on 59 rescue flights once the latest schedule is completed, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said. The seven additional flights will operate daily from Amritsar to Heathrow airport between 5 and 11 May. The minister for South Asia and the Commonwealth, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, said: \u201cOur charter programme has already helped more than 10,000 British travellers return home from India by ensuring flights to the UK have run every day since 8 April, with thousands more due to depart in the coming days. \u201cThese additional flights will help over 2,000 more people get back to their loved ones here in the UK. \u201cI would like to thank the government of India for their help in making it happen.\u201d Jan Thompson, the acting high c0ommissioner to India, said: \u201cThis fifth round of flights brings the total number of planes we have organised from India to 59. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, told the business select committee that 69% of non-food retailers have been \u201csignificantly\u201d impacted by the virus. She added: There is no way that anybody is expecting that demand will revert to what it was before - there will be a slow gearing back up. What implementing social distancing will mean is that normal capacity to serve customers will be restricted and, certainly from a public perspective, I have no doubt that people will be very cautious about how they shop, for safety reasons and because of pressure on money in their pockets.\u201d It\u2019s important not to turn off the tap, so the government has to be careful about how financial support schemes taper off. Hello everyone. I will be working with Andrew on the live feed today. Please do share any insight, information or news tips with via any of the channels below. Thanks so much. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com At the start of this week there were reports suggesting that Boris Johnson would be using his appearance at the daily government press conference to give some details of his plans to relax the lockdown. No 10 was very keen to play down those suggestions, and today it is expected that his tone will be much more cautious, stressing the dangers of any significant move away from the restrictions currently in place. In the Daily Mail Jason Groves quotes a Whitehall source using an interesting image to suggest that only modest changes are in the pipeline for next week. The source told him: We are looking at whether we can undo the top button and make things more comfortable in one or two places for the economy. But any idea of a widespread lifting is plain wrong. In his column in this week\u2019s Spectator, James Forsyth makes a similar prediction. Next week\u2019s review of the lockdown will lead only to the mildest of easing. I am told that what relaxation there will be will mostly concern outdoor activities. (Though it is worth remembering that there is more flex in the current guidelines than is generally realised. Anyone can go to work, for instance, if they can\u2019t work from home.) Schools in England are likely not to return until after half-term. Next week\u2019s review will, according to one of those involved, be about a \u2018timeline for when we can do things\u2019 rather than an opportunity to do them straight away. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s interview last night (see 9.53am) may have constrained Johnson even further. Until now the four nations of the UK have (with minor exceptions) been adopting a joint approach to coronavirus, agreed at meetings of the emergency committee Cobra, at which the devolved administrations are represented. But Sturgeon has repeatedly said that Scotland would diverge from the UK approach if she thought that was justified. If she were to decide next week that any relaxation of the lockdown would be unacceptable (which is what she hinted last night), it would be risky for Johnson to set different rules for England. Perhaps he would get credit for opening up the economy, but if coronavirus infection rates were to start to soar again south of the border, he would be open to the charge of being reckless with people\u2019s lives. More than 3,000 additional officers have joined police forces under the recruitment pledge that formed a centrepiece to Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign, new figures have shown. Johnson promised to recruit 20,000 officers during the summer 2019 election campaign, which many noted would in fact replace roughly the same number that had been lost under 10 years of Conservative party austerity. The government set out its plans to recruit 20,000 additional officers by March 2023 in September and the Home Office on Thursday published the first official set of statistics on progress towards that number. They show 3,005 recruits joined the police specifically as part of the uplift programme. In total, forces recruited 6,435 officers from November 2019 to March 2020, including recruitment planned before the government campaign was announced. All families of frontline NHS Scotland staff who die as a result of coronavirus will receive financial support, Holyrood\u2019s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has confirmed. After England and Wales announced similar schemes earlier in the week, the Scottish government will pay a total lump sum of twice the staff member\u2019s annual earnings and a continued pension to surviving partner or dependent child in the event of a death in service. The median NHS Scotland wage is \u00a336,241. Westminster health secretary Matt Hancock has announced a \u00a360,000 payment for families of NHS and social care workers who die from coronavirus. The Scottish scheme does not yet include social care workers. The death in service benefit, which is already part of the NHS Scotland pension scheme, is being extended to include temporary, bank and locum staff, as well as permanent NHS staff who are not in the pension scheme. A total of 11 NHS staff and carers have died as a result of coronavirus in Scotland since the start of the pandemic. Boris Johnson\u2019s five tests for starting a relaxation of the lockdown are \u201cnot a good enough\u201d guide for the long-term exit strategy from the coronavirus pandemic, the Institute for Government has warned. In a new paper, Lifting Lockdown: how to approach a coronavirus exit strategy, the independent thinktank says what was good at the outset of the outbreak is not necessarily good for the end. Joe Owen, one of the report\u2019s authors, said: How to ease the coronavirus lockdown will require Boris Johnson to make some of the toughest choices to have faced any prime minister. There can be no grand plan for exit, only a process of edging forward. The government\u2019s approach will have to evolve to take account of the best evidence, but these will be overwhelmingly political choices \u2013 and the government will need to be straight with the British people about the steps that will be taken in the months ahead. The government has set out five tests for starting to lift the lockdown, which look for: signs that the NHS is able to cope, which it believes it has achieved; that it has sufficient protective personal equipment (PPE); a \u201csustained and consistent\u201d fall in the daily death rate; reliable data on decreasing infection rates; and signs that the risk of a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS can be avoided. But the IfG says that while these tests might be appropriate measures of bringing a pandemic under control, they are not the basis for a long-term exit strategy. An exit strategy must be based on a different approach ensuring measures are put in place \u201cthat reduce the risk of resurgence of the the disease\u201d and give the economy a decent chance. This means it must increase the capacity for testing and contact tracing and considering tighter border controls to stop fresh importation of the virus. It says the next phase will be about walking the tightrope between guarding the nation\u2019s health and re-opening businesses, schools and services, and warns against \u201ckeeping the economy on ice\u201d. The University of Oxford has partnered with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for the development, manufacture and large-scale distribution of the coronavirus vaccine candidate that is currently being trialled in the UK, PA Media reports. The agreement was announced today, with the details set to be finalised in the coming weeks. The move will allow for rapid vaccination around the world if the candidate proves to be effective, the university said. Human trials of the vaccine developed by the University\u2019s Jenner Institute began last week, with hundreds of people volunteering to be part of the study which received \u00a320m in government funding. There are more details in a news release from AstraZeneca here. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has welcomed the news. Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, said he hoped some results of a human trial of a coronavirus vaccine would be available by the middle of June. He told Today \u201cseveral hundred\u201d people have been vaccinated and the challenge now is to be able to manufacture at scale once it is approved by the regulators. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, was doing the government media round for No 10 earlier. As reported already (see 8.06am), he conceded that the government might miss its target of getting the daily number of coronavirus tests up to 100,000 by the end of April. (Although today is the last day of April, the government has said we might have to wait until Saturday until we officially know whether or not the target has been hit, because it takes time to find out what has happened with home-testing kits.) Here are some of the other lines from his interviews. Buckland said that Nicola Sturgeon was right to warn that it might not be possible to lift any lockdown measures next week. The government has to review the lockdown measures by next Thursday, three weeks after the original measures were extended. In an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston programme last night Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that it might be impossible to relax any of the measures currently in place. She said: People talk about lifting the lockdown - that is not going to be a flick of the switch moment, we\u2019re going to have to be very careful, very slow, very gradual. I\u2019m far from convinced at this stage that when we get to the next review point on the 7 May we\u2019ll be in a position to lift any of these measures right now, because the margins of manoeuvre that we\u2019re operating in right now are very, very, very tight and narrow. Asked about her comment, Buckland said Sturgeon was \u201cright to be cautious\u201d. He went on: I think the common thread between the governments is one of extreme caution following the evidence of the Sage [Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies] committee, making sure that we don\u2019t do anything in a premature way that could risk a second spike. That would be a disaster. He also said that, although a lot of work was going on in government on what might happen in the next phase, that did not mean there would be a sudden move towards relaxing the rules. He said: That\u2019s, of course, not saying that we\u2019re suddenly going to move into a new phase - we need to be absolutely sure that the five tests that were set out some weeks ago are going to be met, and in particular the need to avoid that second or even third spike in the disease is clear to me both in terms of health and the well-being of the economy as well. He said that he was considering legislating to reduce the number of jurors needed for trials. (See 9.14am.) But he also said that that would \u201ctake time\u201d and that he was looking at other measures that could be introduced to allow jurors to return to courts as early as next month. He said getting information about the number of coronavirus deaths in care homes was not straightforward, which was \u201cfrustrating\u201d for government. He explained: It\u2019s a lot more localised and it works through the local registration process, and that\u2019s frankly been frustrating because obviously we want that information as early as possible. The fact is that the care sector is huge, many tens of thousands of different settings for people and the picture isn\u2019t going to emerge as quickly as it would do, say, in the hospital network in the UK. Capt Tom Moore, who is celebrating his 100th birthday today (see 8.32am), has now raised more than \u00a330m for NHS charities, according to the latest updates on his JustGiving page. The number of jurors in trials could be reduced to enable courts to restart soon while observing social distancing, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales has suggested. Lord Burnett of Maldon said the judiciary was also looking at whether larger venues, such as university lecture theatres, could be used to ensure jurors keep sufficiently apart from one another during the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cI would support a move to reduce the number of jurors. That was done during the second world war,\u201d Burnett told the BBC. \u201cPlainly, it would be easier to ensure a safe trial for everybody, with social distancing and other precautions.\u201d Twelve jurors sit on trials in England and Wales but more are usually gathered together in a confined courtroom for the process of selecting the jury. During the second world war the number of jurors was reduced to seven for most trials. More than one courtroom might have to be used, Burnett suggested, for each trial with a video link to a separate room for the media and public to observe. The justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said that he hoped jury trials \u2013 suspended during the pandemic \u2013 might be able to restart as early as next month. Emergency legislation might be required if new forms of the trial system are adopted. The suspension of most hearings has heightened concern about the backlog of cases that was already building up in the criminal justice system due to cuts in the number of judges\u2019 sitting days. At the end of last year there were 37,434 cases waiting to be heard in England and Wales. David Lammy, the new shadow justice secretary, said: Covid-19 presents an unprecedented challenge to our criminal justice system. Defendants and the victims of crime cannot languish indefinitely awaiting trial. We need to get on with radical solutions which can allow jury trials to restart in a way which is safe for everyone and follows public health advice. Large courtrooms currently sitting empty and other big public spaces should be considered for socially distanced trials. If we don\u2019t, come the autumn, the justice system will be at breaking point. Aged 108, she is the UK\u2019s oldest known victim of coronavirus after surviving the Spanish flu outbreak nearly a century ago \u2013 but the care home where Hilda Churchill died does not want her to be forgotten. Kenyon Lodge, in Salford, Greater Manchester, is appealing to the community to help build a memorial garden to celebrate the home\u2019s \u201cangels\u201d, including those who have died during the pandemic. Churchill, who died last month just eight days before her 109th birthday and a day after testing positive for Covid-19, was cared for at the home in the final months of her life. The former seamstress lived through two World Wars, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 which killed 50 million people, including her baby sister. Born in 1911, the grandmother and matriarch of her family, had four children, 11 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren. Now the 60-bed nursing home where she lived is asking gardeners, builders and members of the public to help create a garden of remembrance at the home. Nurse practitioner Emma Rogers made a public appeal for a tree surgeon, to trim back trees in the grounds, ground workers to build a pathway for wheelchairs, skip hire firms and fencers. Meanwhile, Local school children have also been asked to paint stones as decoration. The home also hopes to install a decking area where residents and bereaved family members, who have been denied a proper funeral due to social distancing rules, can go to reflect and remember. Rogers, launching the appeal on the Go Fund Me website, said: We want to celebrate the lives of our angels, pay our respects and say our goodbye with their loved ones by our sides. We decided to create a memorial garden in the grounds of their home. We have been given so many generous donations already at the home and we are very grateful for the kindness shown. We want to give our angels the best they deserve, with a lovely place to go to, spend time to reflect and share our happy memories, we will always remember them, they are our Kenyon Lodge Angels.\u201d The home\u2019s manager, Gulzar Nazir, said the home has lost \u201cquite a few people\u201d during the pandemic. A flypast is helping to mark the 100th birthday celebrations of Capt Tom Moore, the second world war veteran who has been elevated to national hero status after raising almost \u00a330m for the NHS. Moore, who captivated the country with his fundraising effort to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday today, smashed his initial target of \u00a31,000. A Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flypast of a Spitfire and a Hurricane has been organised by the RAF to mark Capt Moore\u2019s birthday, and he has been appointed as an honorary colonel of the Army Foundation College. After watching the flypast, Capt Moore said: I\u2019m one of the few people here who has seen Hurricane and Spitfires flying past in anger. Fortunately today they\u2019re all flying peacefully.\u201d Earlier this morning, he received a special video message from the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and performer Michael Ball sang him happy birthday. In a message, which he dictated to his grandson Benjie, to mark his birthday, Capt Moore said: Reaching 100 is quite something. Reaching 100 with such interest in me and huge generosity from the public is very overwhelming. People keep saying what I have done is remarkable, however it\u2019s actually what you have done for me which is remarkable. I felt a little frustrated and disappointed after I broke my hip and it knocked my confidence. However, the past three weeks have put a spring back in my step. I have renewed purpose and have thoroughly enjoyed every second of this exciting adventure, but I can\u2019t keep walking forever. The donations page will close at midnight this evening. NHS Charities Together still have their urgent appeal, so people can donate to them that way. I am going to spend my birthday with my family, both here in person and with my daughter remotely, and then I am going to have a few days\u2019 rest. My legs may be tired, but my mind is racing and I\u2019m hoping to be back very soon with other ways in which I can help people, help others. Please always remember, Tomorrow Will Be A Good Day.\u201d A cabinet minister has acknowledged that the government may not meet its target of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests by the end of the month. After intense criticism, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, pledged the country would be conducting the tests by the end of April but, with only 52,429 carried out in the 24 hours to yesterday, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has now conceded it might not happen. He told BBC Breakfast: Even if it [the target] isn\u2019t met, we\u2019re well on our way to ramping this up and 100,000 is an important milestone, but frankly we need more. He added: \u201cYes, 52,000 isn\u2019t 100,000, I know that ... but we are straining every sinew to get there... If he [Hancock] hadn\u2019t set a target he would have been criticised for being unambitious. I think now is the time in respect of this to be bold ... being brave, I think, is something we should acknowledge even if the target isn\u2019t met today.\u201d Just 52,429 tests were carried out in the UK in the 24 hours to yesterday, on 33,455 people. An antiviral drug originally used to treat Eebola has shown \u201cvery encouraging results\u201d at cutting recovery times for Covid-19 patients, according to a scientist leading the trials. Abdel Babiker, professor of epidemiology and medical statistics at UCL, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: These are very encouraging results from the first large-scale randomised trial to report on any treatment of Covid-19.\u201d The group of hospitalised adults with advanced coronavirus who received Remdesivir recovered \u201cmuch faster\u201d than the group that received a placebo, he said. Better air quality caused by the Covid-19 lockdown has resulted in an estimated 1,700 fewer deaths in the UK, according to a study. The Europe-wide report found that levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) - produced by road traffic and heavy industry - have dropped by 40% in the past 30 days and that there has been a 10% reduction in the average level of particulate matter pollution. It has caused an estimated 11,000 fewer deaths related to air pollution across Europe, including an estimated 1,752 in the UK \u2013 the second-highest number in the study behind Germany (2,083). However, the numbers are dwarfed by the Covid-19 death death toll across Europe, including the UK, where fatalities passed 26,000 yesterday and are set to rise further. The study, by the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), found there had been a 37% drop in power generation from coal across Europe as a result of the lockdowns, while oil consumption had fallen by 33%. Other avoided health impacts included 6,000 fewer new cases of asthma in children, 1.3 million fewer days of work absence, 1,900 avoided emergency room visits caused by asthma attacks, and 600 fewer premature births, the study said. The study\u2019s authors Lauri Myllyvirta and Hubert Thieriot said their analysis used detailed air quality statistical modelling to separate the effects of weather conditions and changes in emissions. The researchers wrote: The Covid-19 crisis has brought about untold human suffering, and its side-effects should not be celebrated. \u201cThe major public health benefits of reduced coal and oil burning, over just one month are, however, a striking demonstration of the benefit to public health and quality of life if European decision-makers prioritise clean air, clean energy and clean transport in their plans to recover from the crisis, and reduce coal and oil consumption in a rapid and sustainable way.\u201d Good morning folks, it\u2019s Simon Murphy here at the helm of the live blog to steer you through the start of the day\u2019s coronavirus developments in the UK. As the Covid-19 death toll in the UK passed 26,000 yesterday \u2013 with new figures including fatalities in care homes as well as hospitals \u2013 Boris Johnson will today face the cameras at 5pm as he returns to the Downing Street conference later after overcoming the virus himself. Following the birth of his new child yesterday, both Johnson and others will have a chance later to thank healthcare staff battling the pandemic as the nation again unites later for Clap for Carers at 8pm. First though, the prime minister will chair cabinet as the government today looks set to miss its deadline for carrying out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April. Just 52, 429 tests were carried out in the UK in the 24 hours to yesterday, on 33,455 people. Elsewhere, later this morning at 9.30am there will be a business, energy and industrial strategy Committee on coronavirus impact and digital, culture, media and sport Committee quizzing Facebook and Twitter. A World Health Organization Europe briefing will take place at 10am.",

For the first time in his life, there are signs of self-doubt. When he looks in the mirror, he now sees his reflection beginning to fragment.

Here satire nearly died. For as scientists struggle to pin down the UK\u2019s R rate to between 0.6 and 0.9, no one has the first idea of Boris\u2019s own reproduction rate. We know its current level is at least six \u2013 though even Boris doesn\u2019t appear to know if it\u2019s more \u2013 and with every likelihood of adding to the score in the years ahead. If Boris were a virus he would be deadly.</p> <p>On and on he bumbled. We would have to wait until some time next week for the government to make it clear it still had no real plan for ending lockdown. Things were definitely getting better but no one had a clue how to ease things while ensuring R remained lower than one.

He couldn\u2019t say anything on tourism to Cornwall \u2013 \u201cthere will be more information later\u201d \u2013 and his suggestion that people with mental health issues should call NHS helplines rang hollow as successive Tory governments have cut mental health provision to a bare minimum.

But critics say the Coalition is attempting to shift the blame for its own policy failures. The government estimates childcare attendance is running at between 40% and 60% of previous levels.</p> \n<p><strong>The World Health Organization has confirmed that the coronavirus pandemic is increasing across Africa</strong>,<strong> </strong>with the regional director saying the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-live-news-more-cases-of-covid-linked-syndrome-in-children-as-uk-deaths-top-spain-and-france\">WHO was \u201cvery concerned about west Africa\u201d</a>, based on rates of community spread. The full extent of the disease is unknown, with official statistics reporting just 34,000 known cases, but the WHO warned that medical shortages, both of staff and provisions, remained a major concern for the months ahead. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has confirmed he has contracted Covid-19 and will begin self-isolating, as infections pass 100,000 in his country. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">Britain is \u201cpast the peak\u201d</a>, with 674 deaths recorded overnight.</p> \n<p><strong>US national intelligence officials have put out a statement saying <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/cia-pushes-back-at-trump-efforts-to-link-coronavirus-to-chinese-laboratories\">they do not believe coronavirus was human-made or genetically modified</a></strong>,<strong> </strong>after the president reportedly asked officials to investigate whether China had created the virus. Donald Trump has repeatedly accused China of failing to act to prevent the global spread of Covid-19, claiming Beijing \u201cwill do anything\u201d to see him lose the next election.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 1 May. Top stories Parents are being encouraged to dob in childcare centres they suspect of profiteering from Covid-19, with the education department emailing providers warning them they could lose their government funding if it is found that they have excessively limited their capacity. But critics say the Coalition is attempting to shift the blame for its own policy failures. The government estimates childcare attendance is running at between 40% and 60% of previous levels. The World Health Organization has confirmed that the coronavirus pandemic is increasing across Africa, with the regional director saying the WHO was \u201cvery concerned about west Africa\u201d, based on rates of community spread. The full extent of the disease is unknown, with official statistics reporting just 34,000 known cases, but the WHO warned that medical shortages, both of staff and provisions, remained a major concern for the months ahead. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, has confirmed he has contracted Covid-19 and will begin self-isolating, as infections pass 100,000 in his country. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said Britain is \u201cpast the peak\u201d, with 674 deaths recorded overnight. US national intelligence officials have put out a statement saying they do not believe coronavirus was human-made or genetically modified, after the president reportedly asked officials to investigate whether China had created the virus. Donald Trump has repeatedly accused China of failing to act to prevent the global spread of Covid-19, claiming Beijing \u201cwill do anything\u201d to see him lose the next election. Meanwhile, reports have emerged that Trump has threatened to sue his campaign manager after a drop in his poll ratings. Some 3.8 million more US workers lost their jobs last week, bringing total layoffs to more than 30 million over the past six weeks. Australia A shareholder majority has called upon Australia\u2019s largest oil and gas company to do more to combat climate change, with Woodside Petroleum urged to set emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris climate agreement in what shareholder activists are calling \u201ca breakthrough moment\u201d. Legal experts have dismissed claims that green tape has risen in Australia by \u201c445%\u201d as politically motivated, saying the figures proffered by the Institute for Public Affairs are based on a \u201cflawed\u201d methodology developed by a US conservative thinktank. A leading Australian federal government agency has denied it sought to threaten a transparency website after its chief legal counsel sent a letter to the non-profit Right to Know website demanding the site remove \u201cdefamatory material\u201d relating to its former boss. A new study has cast doubt over the government\u2019s $4bn Murray-Darling irrigation efficiency program, with academics revealing that irrigators who received the subsidies extracted up to 28% more water than others who did not. A company part-owned by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and his brother, Richard, illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands in the NSW Monaro region, the federal environment department has concluded. The company has been ordered to restore 103 hectares of native grassland but avoided a fine and criminal finding. The world Libya\u2019s government has rejected a Ramadan ceasefire offer from the renegade general Khalifa Haftar, with the nation\u2019s six-year civil war set to continue. Haftar, who has his base in the country\u2019s east, has suffered a series of military setbacks amid reports he may have lost key allies in the eastern city of Tobruk. France has announced it will sell some of the nation\u2019s antique furniture to help its health system, with reports that some 100 objects dating from the 19th century will go under the hammer. The veteran South African anti-apartheid activist Denis Goldberg has died aged 87. A close associate of Nelson Mandela, Goldberg spent 22 years in prison on treason charges after he was arrested in 1963 alongside Mandela. A 72-year-old UK man has claimed the world record for the oldest person to row solo across the Atlantic. After three months at sea, Graham Walters says he\u2019s relieved to be back on dry land \u2013 though coming back to the coronavirus pandemic feels like \u201can alternative universe\u201d. Recommended reads Having travelled the globe to exotic destinations in search of \u201cstillness and contemplation\u201d, Brigid Delaney writes that Covid-19 has presented the chance to explore interiority much closer to home. \u201cUnderneath the noise, movement, entertainment, drama \u2013 the days \u2013 of our lives, is something deeper, more quiet.

But the need to connect is driving seniors to adapt to new technology, and often quite comfortably. Listen On today\u2019s episode of Full Story, Gabrielle Jackson talks to two doctors \u2013 an oncologist and a GP working in a Covid clinic \u2013 about how their practice has changed and what this means for the future of healthcare in Australia.

      "bodyText": "Photos of packed beaches in southern California made headlines around the United States this week, prompting a furious state governor to order all beaches in Orange county closed this weekend. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday that the closures would only apply to the county, which saw the largest crowds, and that he hoped it wouldn\u2019t last long. Other counties have reopened with limits, and will continue to do so. But what are the true risks of coronavirus infections at the beach? There\u2019s no simple answer, but public health experts and epidemiologists told the Guardian that some of the backlash and concern may be unwarranted. As some local counties have criticized the statewide closures, the scientists also argued that there could be safe ways to allow access \u2013 and that there may be benefits to reopening.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol on Thursday as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. A tightly packed crowd of protesters, some carrying rifles, attempted to enter the floor of the legislative chamber, and were held back by a line of state police and capitol staff, according to video footage posted by local journalists. \u201cLet us in! Let us in!\u201d the protesters chanted, as they stood shoulder-to-shoulder inside the statehouse. Few of them were wearing face masks. Some of the protesters shouted anti-government slogans, including comparing the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, to Hitler. One Democratic state lawmaker posted a photograph of men with rifles standing in a gallery yelling down at lawmakers below. \u201cSome of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them,\u201d the state senator Dayna Polehanki wrote on Twitter. One protest sign outside the statehouse on Thursday read: \u201cTyrants get the rope.\u201d Thursday\u2019s protest in Lansing, Michigan\u2019s capital, was much smaller than the 15 April \u201cOperation Gridlock\u201d protest when supporters of Donald Trump organized thousands of people to publicly demonstrate against what they said was the overreach of Whitmer\u2019s strict stay-at-home order. Many people at Thursday\u2019s \u201cAmerican Patriot Rally\u201d, including militia group members carrying firearms and people with pro-Trump signs, appeared to be ignoring state social-distancing guidelines. Members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were at the protest, armed with guns, and one member said that the group was there as a \u201csecurity detail\u201d for the event organizers, MLive.com reported. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors American extremist organizations, includes a \u201cMichigan Liberty Militia\u201d among its list of extreme antigovernment groups. Police allowed several hundred protesters to peacefully enter the capitol building around 1pm, where they crammed shoulder-to-shoulder near the entrance to legislative chambers. The slow reopening of state economies around the country has taken on political overtones, as Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with Trump\u2019s re-election promoted such protests in electoral swing states, such as Michigan. State legislative approval of Whitmer\u2019s state of emergency declaration, which gives her special executive powers, was set to expire after Thursday. Late in the day, the Republican-led legislature refused to extend the state\u2019s coronavirus emergency declaration and voted to authorize a lawsuit challenging Whitmer\u2019s authority and actions. The governor, unfazed, responded with orders stating that an emergency still exists, while declaring new 28-day states of emergency and disaster. The declaration is the foundation for Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home measure, which will remain in effect through 15 May, and other directives aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Whitmer accused GOP lawmakers of \u201cputting their heads in the sand and putting more lives and livelihoods at risk. I\u2019m not going to let that happen\u201d. \u201cGovernor Whitmer, and our state legislature, it\u2019s over with. Open this state,\u201d Mike Detmer, a Republican US congressional candidate, told the crowd. \u201cLet\u2019s get businesses back open again.

A spokeswoman for the Michigan senate minority leader confirmed that at least one lawmaker on Thursday \u201cchose to wear a bullet-proof vest\u201d. It is legal to openly carry firearms inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol building. Other speakers at the event, which had different organizers than the Operation Gridlock protest, questioned the deadliness of Covid-19. They also said Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order violated constitutional rights, and urged people to open their businesses on 1 May in disregard of her order.

Make UK \u2013 the body that represents manufacturers \u2013 said ministers might need to look beyond the provision of subsidised loans if they were to help producers through a slump on course to be even more severe than current official estimates. With its latest survey showing a dramatic fall in orders and sales, Make UK is particularly concerned about the outlook for larger mid-sized firms that are not listed on the stock exchange but form a vital part of the UK\u2019s manufacturing base. Stephen Phipson, Make UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAll the indications at the moment indicate that, even if a gradual easing of lockdowns begins soon, the impact of this shock will continue to hit companies and livelihoods for some time to come. As such, government may need to be flexible with its future support schemes in the same way that industry is going to have to be flexible with its recovery plans.\u201d In its lobbying of ministers, the employers\u2019 organisation has been arguing that there will be a medium-term need for government to support a recapitalisation effort for businesses that will struggle to repay debt incurred during lockdown. \u201cSome of the current schemes don\u2019t work for everyone, with a lot of firms very nervous about taking on big debts in this climate with no certainty about when they can repay it,\u201d Phipson said. \u201cIn that context, government should be working with the banks and other partners to consider a wider range of options.\u201d In its projection of the likely path of the economy this year, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility said it expected manufacturing output to fall by 55% in the second quarter. Make UK said that on the basis of its survey of almost 300 companies, the fall in manufacturing was likely to be larger and that conditions were unlikely to return to anything like normal for some time to come. It urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to consider extending the government\u2019s furloughing scheme beyond the end of June. Its survey showed: Over three-quarters of companies said sales have decreased. Four-fifths of companies have reported a decrease in orders. One in five companies said their orders have fallen by more than half. One in five companies have furloughed up to a quarter of staff, 15% by up to half. One-third of companies will wait for an increase in orders before taking staff off furlough. Phipson said: \u201cWhile many manufacturers continue to operate and supply our food, vital medical equipment and PPE, there is no disguising that for the sector overall these are deeply worrying times. \u201cThe extent of the collapse in demand is such it means that the recent OBR forecast could be an underestimate unless there is a quite remarkable turnaround, which, to be frank, just isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The first two weeks of the coronavirus lockdown triggered an unprecedented rise in food bank use as the economy was hit and household incomes plunged, data from hundreds of emergency food aid charities reveals. The Trussell Trust, the UK\u2019s biggest food bank network, said it experienced its busiest ever period after lockdown was announced on 23 March, when it issued 50,000 food parcels in the space of a week, almost double its usual volume. A similar picture emerged from the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan), which said its food banks recorded a 59% increase in demand for emergency food support between February and March \u2013 17 times higher than the same period a year ago. Labour called on the government to take urgent action through the benefits system to help families who had fallen into hardship. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cFood banks are doing an incredible job in tough circumstances with unprecedented demand, but the government should be ensuring that people have the resources they need to stop their families going hungry.\u201d Food bank charities warned that the current high levels of demand for food parcels were unsustainable and called for new income support measures. \u201cWe need emergency measures to ensure people can makes ends meet during this crisis. We have the power to come together as a country and make sure support is there to stop any of us being swept into poverty during this emergency,\u201d said the Trussell Trust\u2019s chief executive, Emma Revie. She said government measures to support struggling families, such as the job retention scheme and a \u00a320-a-week increase to universal credit, were welcome but not enough to prevent increasing numbers of people falling into hardship. The trust called for a boost to benefit payments for families with children, and for the lifting of policies that limited the amount of benefit support families were entitled to, such as the two-child policy and the benefit cap. Food banks across the UK \u2013 already working at maximum capacity \u2013 have struggled with food stocks as Covid-19 hit, with five Trussell Trust food banks and a handful of Ifan food banks forced to close. Staff numbers also plummeted as the predominantly older volunteer workforce self-isolated. The Trussell Trust said overall food levels have stabilised, after help from major supermarkets. Stocks remain depleted, however, and there is concern that some volunteer teams may be close to burnout, and may face disruption again if lockdown is relaxed and volunteers return to their full-time jobs. The dramatic recent increase in food bank reliance, which comes after years of gradually rising food bank use, were caused by people\u2019s income dropping \u2013 often because they had lost their job \u2013 or because their benefit payments failed to keep up with the cost of living, the trust said.

The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work.

Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person \u201cin need\u201d and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/sitting-at-home-seems-wrong-coronavirus-volunteers-helping-the-nhs-a-photo-essay\">'Sitting at home seems wrong': NHS coronavirus volunteers \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa57e48f0882b206dcfbe0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:55:09.300Z\">5.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings.<br></p> \n  <p>Most recently, a video of her face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant </a>into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral.

I\u2019ll have the blog for the next few hours, so please do get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: UK prime minister says the country now \u2018past the peak\u2019. Boris Johnson defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government\u2019s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. Trump claims he has seen evidence of Covid-19 originating in Wuhan lab. When asked if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d Germany eases lockdown measures. Germany is to re-open museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. Brazil sees record 7,218 new cases, raising the total to 85,380, Reuters reports the health ministry saying on Thursday.The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901. Denmark says partial reopening has not accelerated virus spread. Denmark became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago. Spain allocates times slots for outdoor activities, as death toll falls. Spain\u2019s daily death toll fell to its lowest level in nearly six week, with 268 fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight. Eurozone records 3.8% slump, as European Central Bank chief warns of worse to come, with the eurozone potentially on course for a 15% collapse in output in the second quarter. Another 3.8 million Americans lose jobs as US unemployment continues to grow. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits. Covid-19 outbreak increasing across Africa, WHO warns. World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment. Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country\u2019s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Tajikistan reports first coronavirus cases. Tajikistan, which was thought to be one of the few countries untouched by coronavirus, has recorded its first coronavirus cases. South Korea reports no new domestic cases for first time since 29 February. South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak. War-torn Yemen reports first virus deaths. The country reported its first two deaths and a new cluster of Covid-19 cases amid worries that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time. Czechs say coronavirus spread is contained as country reopens. The Czech Republic has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight consecutive days. People out of work in Germany increased by 373,000 to 2.64 million in April. Data from the labour office also showed the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%, up from 5% in March, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. US state and local governments could need close to $1 trillion in aid over several years to cope with the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned. She told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to cover all of it, but to the extent that we can keep the states and localities sustainable, that\u2019s our goal.\u201d Asked if state and local aid would be the largest part of upcoming relief legislation, Pelosi said: \u201cI\u2019ve talked about almost a trillion dollars right there, I would hope so. But we do have other issues that we want to deal with.\u201d President Donald Trump said he would \u201cthink about what\u2019s happening.\u201d Canada\u2019s coronavirus curve is flat but worrying trends are emerging, particularly outbreaks in vulnerable indigenous communities, the country\u2019s top medical officer said. The daily death toll in Canada has risen by 10 pr cent or more only once in the last 11 days. The total number of people killed by the coronavirus increased by 6% to 3,082 in a day, official data showed on Thursday. \u201cThe COVID-19 curve is flat ... (but) we have to be very cautious going down the other side of the epidemic curve,\u201d chief public health officer Theresa Tam told a briefing. \u201cAlready on this path we have seen some worrisome transmission events emerging,\u201d she said, citing increasing cases in remote aboriginal communities in several of Canada\u2019s 10 provinces. Meanwhile, Alberta unveiled a plan to reopen its economy gradually, starting on Monday with some non-urgent surgeries, golf courses and services such as physiotherapists and social workers. The next stage begins as early as May 14, reopening retail businesses, hair salons, daycares and restaurants. Moving to that stage hinges on increased testing and contact tracing, and rules for using masks in crowded spaces. Alberta has not set dates for reopening schools. Ontario, which has not set dates to restart its economy, issued more than 60 guidelines for businesses when they reopen, ranging from markers and barriers to maintain physical distancing, and additional labor inspectors to ensure compliance. Friday\u2019s Guardian leads on Boris Johnson announcing the UK has passed the peak of Covid-19 cases. The FT splashes on US stocks on the brink of their best month since 1987 Tomorrow\u2019s i goes with face masks potentially being an everyday accessory. The Mirror goes down a similar line on going past the peak of cases. The Times leads on Johnson announcing the UK has passed the peak of the virus. Tomorrow\u2019s Daily Telegraph leads on Boris Johnson saying his plan to relax the lockdown will be unveiled next week. Tomorrow\u2019s Daily Mail Friday\u2019s UK front pages are rolling in, starting with The Independent In more tougher rhetoric against Beijing, Trump said he does not have to stop debt payments to China and can instead impose tariffs. That awkward moment in the press conference on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Trump added he could not say why he has a high degree of confidence that the virus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. He also said it was possible that China either could not stop the spread of the coronavirus or let it spread. When asked if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, President Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d Trump\u2019s reflections on the death toll in the US. A bizarre moment from Trump about the Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluding Covid-19 \u201cwas not manmade or genetically modified\u201d but investigations into the origins of the outbreak are ongoing. Trump added an extension of $600 unemployment payments is being looked at. On relations with China, he declined to say whether he holds Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, responsible for any misinformation about coronavirus. In his White House briefing, President Trump said the government has provided more than $1 billion in grants to networks that help Americans who are older or disabled. Portugal\u2019s government has announced the country\u2019s football league, the Primeira Liga, can resume behind closed on doors from May 30. \u201cThis return of football will only be for the Primeira Liga and with tight restrictions,\u201d Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa said. \u201cThe games will be played behind closed doors, with no spectators in the stands, whatever the stadium, be it a league match or the Portuguese Cup final.\u201d Costa earlier announced his strategy to progressively lift lockdown measures imposed six weeks ago. The three-phase plan, starting on Monday, will open up different sectors of the economy every 15 days starting with small neighbourhood shops, hairdressers, car dealerships and bookshops. Less than 24 hours after Los Angeles became the first major US city to offer free coronavirus tests, a website used for sign-ups strained under the demand as appointments were completely booked for anyone not showing symptoms. Mayor Eric Garcetti announced the free testing on Wednesday, saying they are available to anyone in the county of roughly 10 million people, although priority would be given to healthcare workers and people showing symptoms of Covid-19. He said: \u201cIf you think you have Covid-19, if want the reassurance that you do not, if you\u2019ve been around people that you have seen with symptoms, get a test. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a price on the piece of mind of knowing that you can\u2019t infect somebody around you.\u201d The tests were funded in part by CORE, a nonprofit organisation co-founded by actor Sean Penn, using a $375,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, denies claims that a report alleging disinformation tactics by the Chinese government during the pandemic was edited because of pressure from Chinese authorities. Borrell said the original version was changed because his staff wanted to \u201cavoid inaccuracies in our terminology\u201d. He added: \u201cIt was decided by the staff without any interference or pressure from outside or inside. We do not shy away from calling out clear disinformation cases by China, which are in the report.\u201d Amazon announced it had revenues of $75.4bn in the first three months of the year \u2013 equating to over $33m an hour. The US vice-president Mike Pence wore a mask today as he toured a General Motors facility in Indiana which is now making ventilators after coming under fire for failing to wear one earlier this week. On Tuesday he visited a clinic in Minnesota but failed to cover his face despite it being in violation of the facility\u2019s policy. He was pictured surrounded by healthcare staff all wearing masks. Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state Capitol in Lansing objecting to Governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s request to extend emergency powers to combat COVID-19. The protest appeared to be the largest in the state since April 15, when supporters of President Donald Trump organised thousands of people for \u201cOperation Gridlock,\u201d jamming the streets of Lansing with their cars to call out what they said was the overreach of Whitmer\u2019s strict stay-at-home order. The slow reopening of state economies around the country has taken on political overtones, as Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with Trump\u2019s re-election promoted such protests in electoral swing states, such as Michigan. Many people at Thursday\u2019s \u201cAmerican Patriot Rally\u201d, including militia group members carrying firearms and people with pro-Trump signs, appeared to be ignoring state social distancing guidelines as they clustered together within six feet of each other. Here\u2019s a report from our South American correspondent Tom Phillips outlining the growing concerns in Brazil over Bolsonaro\u2019s approach to coronavirus. The president has previously attacked what he termed the \u201chysteria\u201d over Covid-19, sacked his health minister and has sabotaged efforts to enforce social distancing measures. Brazil has reported a record 7,218 confirmed new cases of coronavirus in the last 24 hours, raising the total to 85,380, Reuters reports the health ministry saying on Thursday. The death toll rose by 435 to 5,901, it said. There has been outrage in the country over the approach of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. Earlier in the week, when asked by reporters about deaths exceeding the 5,000 figure, he said: \u201cSo what \u2026 I\u2019m sorry. What do you want me to do?\u201d The California governor, Gavin Newsom, has ordered beaches in Orange County to close until further notice. He made the announcement, days after tens of thousands of people in Orange County packed beaches during a sunny weekend. The governor said he hoped the order would not last very long, but felt it was necessary to protect public health. He said the order only applied to beaches in Orange County. Several California coastal communities have allowed beaches to be open with some restrictions. A group of Serbian opposition leaders staged a protest during an evening curfew to voice their criticism of the populist government\u2019s measures against the new coronavirus. Also on Thursday, thousands banged pots and blew whistles from their windows and balconies, even as authorities eased a previously announced 83-hour curfew planned for the upcoming weekend. Serbia\u2019s populist government in mid-March introduced some of the harshest measures in Europe, imposing a state of emergency, banning people over 65 years old from leaving their homes and imposing daily and weekend curfews. Government critics have insisted that the authorities of the autocratic President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 have used the state of emergency to curb democracy and media freedoms. Vu\u010di\u0107 has denied this. Leaders of several opposition parties gathered at the start of the curfew at 6pm, holding speeches outside the Serbian parliament building in Belgrade. They wore masks but didn\u2019t fully respect social-distancing measures. No opposition supporters were invited to the protests, but some supporters of the government showed up, shouting at the opposition leaders. No major incidents were reported. The curfew initially was meant to last until Monday morning to prevent people from socialising during the May Day holiday, but the government earlier on Thursday shortened the ban, following public pressure. Serbia has reported 9,009 infections while 179 people have died. The Balkan country has started easing the measures, but experts have warned that the situation is still volatile. The number of deaths from Covid-19 in Peru has surpassed 1,000, the country\u2019s ministry of health said on Thursday. The ministry said the number of deaths had risen to 1,051 from 943 the previous day, while the number of cases had risen by 3,045 to 36,976. Peru has the second highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in Latin America. Police and soldiers closed a busy food market in the capital Lima after mass rapid testing confirmed more than 160 of its traders had tested positive. South Africa reported another 297 positive cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, bringing the total in the country to 5,647, the health department said. \u201cThe total number of tests conducted to date is 207,530, of which 10,403 were done in the last 24 hours,\u201d the Ministry of Health said. Deaths remained at 103. Wednesday\u2019s increase of 354 in infections was the highest in a 24-hour cycle. South Africa\u2019s five-week strict national lockdown ends on Friday, but with only a clutch of industries being allowed to operate in a bid to keep the economy going while keeping the spread of the virus at bay. A rise in cases of Covid-19 across northern Nigeria has seen several states controversially deport hundreds of \u201calmajiris\u201d - mostly children, studying in Islamic boarding schools - back to their states of origin. The states, most in Nigeria\u2019s majority Muslim north, say the deportations are to halt the spread of Covid-19. Yet the deportations of mostly vulnerable children appear to be spreading it across states where the capacity to trace and test for Covid-19 is extremely limited. This afternoon, the Kaduna state government, in north-west Nigeria, said 16 new cases of Covid-19 were of almajiris, recently deported from neighbouring Kano state, where hundreds of unexplained deaths have occured in the last week. Doctors in Kano told the Guardian there has been a rise in pneumonia cases in recent weeks, heightening fears of a Covid-19 outbreak. The mass deportations of vulnerable children, who may have Covid-19 has caused alarm in Nigeria. Almajiris, enrolled in conservative Islamic schools, are often sent away from their homes without school fees, with many resorting to begging on the streets. As extreme poverty has grown, the system has become increasingly exploited. In the last 6 months, several almajiri schools have been shut after it emerged thousands were being enslaved, tortured and sexually abused. Authorities have been accused of ill treatment, with reports of almajiris being left in other states without protection. State-to-state deportations are contentious yet do occur in Nigeria, where state rights are sensitive. The increasing deportations of these children, some of whom appear to have Covid-19, moving between poor states with limited health services is worrying. Their health infrastructure to test or trace for the spread of Covid-19 is severely limited. Nigeria overall is struggling to boost testing, with just 13,000 tests administered. The number of confirmed infections across the country is relatively low - 1.728 - but the daily rise in new cases has been gradually accelerating. The New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, said the New York subway will close between 1am and 5am from 7 May to allow the MTA to disinfect the carriages, train and stations, to protect essential workers from contracting coronavirus. The Czech Republic will allow cultural and sports events involving up to 100 people to go ahead from 11 May as part of the next phase of relaxing restrictions imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus, officials said. This will include cinema screenings, theatre performances and religious services. The move comes sooner than the government had originally planned after it said the spread of the virus was now contained. Large events, however, such as music festivals due this summer with thousands of people, will not take place, the culture minister, Lubom\u00edr Zaor\u00e1lek, said. The country of 10.7 million people is cautiously opening up its economy after it shut schools, shops and restaurants in March and imposed a lockdown. The Czech Republic has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight days, and the number of active cases has also been on the decline. Stores of up to 2,500 square metres reopened on Monday. From 11 May, shopping malls and larger shops are also set to reopen, along with outdoor restaurants and pubs, hairdressers, and museums. The last phase is due on 25 May with restaurants, pubs and hotels returning to action. Denmark says partial reopening has not accelerated virus spread Authorities in Denmark, became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago, said the spread of Covid-19 had not accelerated. Day care centres and schools began reopening in the Nordic country two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April. The move came after the number of infections and deaths slowed. Spain allocates times slots for outdoor activities, as death toll falls Health authorities in Spain have said time slots for specific outdoor activities will be used to help the country avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March. Spain\u2019s daily death toll fell to its lowest level in nearly six week, with 268 fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight. Eurozone records 3.8% slump, as ECB chief warns of worse to come The head of the European Central Bank has warned that the eurozone could be on course for a 15% collapse in output in the second quarter as evidence of the economic toll caused by Covid-19 pandemic started to emerge, with France and Italy falling into recession. Another 3.8 million Americans lose jobs as US unemployment continues to grow Another 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to batter the economy. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits and the numbers are still growing. Covid-19 outbreak increasing across Africa, WHO warns World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment. Unlike developed countries that can rely on relatively well-resourced health systems to treat large numbers of sick people, most African nations are hoping they can slow the spread of the disease to protect very limited facilities. Russian prime minister diagnosed with coronavirus Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country\u2019s highest-profile case of the disease yet. Russia recorded a record daily rise in cases, taking the total of cases past 100,000. On Thursday 7,099 new cases were recorded, bringing the nationwide tally to 106,498. UK prime minister says the country now \u2018past the peak\u2019 The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson- who was himself seriously ill with Covid-19 - said that the country has past its peak, and defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government\u2019s daily press conference, Johnson said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage Tajikistan reports first coronavirus cases Tajikistan, which was thought to be one of the few countries untouched by coronavirus, has recorded its first coronavirus cases. South Korea reports no new domestic cases for first time since 29 February South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. War-torn Yemen reports first virus deaths The country reported its first two deaths and a new cluster of Covid-19 cases amid worries that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time and attempts at a humanitarian ceasefire to contain the new crisis are failing. Czechs say coronavirus spread is contained as country reopens The Czech Republic has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight consecutive days, and the government will continue to cautiously open up the economy, the health minister said. Japan likely to extend nationwide state of emergency over the coronavirus Prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe is expected to extend the measure until the end of May or until 6 June, as the country\u2019s healthcare system continues to face an \u201cextremely tough situation\u201d, he said. People out of work in Germany increased by 373,000 to 2.64 million in April Data from the labour office also showed the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%, up from 5% in March, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. British pharmaceutical company will know whether its Covid-19 vaccine candidate is effective by June or July AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the company will continue working with Oxford Vaccine Unit to bring it to patients as soon as possible. Germany is to re-open museums, galleries, zoos and playgrounds and allow religious services to resume, in measures agreed by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the leaders of 16 federal states. This will take place under strict conditions. Certain states have already allowed some of these activities to restart, but measures on people keeping physical distance from each other will stay in place. Large-scale public gatherings will remain banned until the end of August. \u201cWe must work to make sure we bring the number of new infections down further,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cIf the infection curve becomes steep again, we need to have a warning system to notice it early and be able to act.\u201d The French government has unveiled its coronavirus map dividing the country into \u201cgreen\u201d areas, where lockdown regulations will be relaxed, and \u201cred\u201d areas, where strict measures will remain in place. A number of departments were declared \u201corange\u201d, meaning they will be watched closely over the next week before being declared red or green on 7 May. France has been under one of the most strict lockdowns since 17 March, with people facing heavy fines for leaving home without good reason. The lockdown is due to end on 11 May. Three criteria were used to decide what people living in the 96 mainland departments and five overseas departments would be allowed to do when the national confinement finishes: the number of new Covid-19 cases in the previous seven days; the capacity of the department\u2019s hospitals to deal with the epidemic; and the department\u2019s ability to test, track and contain the virus. The health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, said the maps were only indicative at this stage. \u201cThe map changes nothing of the lockdown until 11 May. Don\u2019t change what you are doing. Stay at home until 11 May,\u201d V\u00e9ran said. The definitive map, used to determine who can do what and where after 11 May, will be published on 7 May. The \u201cgross\u201d figure in the updated numbers is the number of new admissions to hospital or intensive care; the net number is the increase or reduction taking into account the number of people admitted against those who have died or been discharged. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of Publique Sant\u00e9 France, the French health authority, gave the updated figures. Number of cases: 129,581 Number in hospital: 26,283 (+1,048 gross, -551 net) Number in i/c: 4,019 (+121 gross, -188 net) Deaths in hospital: 15,244 (+191) Deaths in homes: 9,132 (+98) Total deaths: 24,376 (+289) In Ghana, confirmed coronavirus cases have surged above 2,000, increasing 24% in a matter of days, health officials announced. The Ghana Health Service reported 403 new cases, bringing the total to 2,074. The spike was announced ten days after President Nana Akufo-Addo eased a three-week lockdown in the capital of Accra and in the city of Kumasi. Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros announced its first confirmed case, making it the 53rd of Africa\u2019s 54 countries to report Covid-19. Only the small southern African kingdom of Lesotho has not reported a single case of the disease. African nations have now reported more than 37,400 cases, including 1,598 deaths, the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In South Africa, which has the continent\u2019s highest number of reported cases at 5,350, community health workers continued testing in Johannesburg. The Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Costa, has announced its strategy to progressively lift lockdown measures imposed six weeks ago. The three-phase plan, starting on Monday, will open up different sectors of the economy every 15 days starting with small neighbourhood shops, hairdressers, car dealerships and bookshops. The head of the European Central Bank has warned that the eurozone could be on course for a 15% collapse in output in the second quarter as evidence of the economic toll caused by Covid-19 pandemic started to emerge, with France and Italy falling into recession. After news that the 19-nation monetary union area had contracted a record 3.8% in the first three months of 2020, Christine Lagarde said much worse was possible in the April to June period, when the impact of lockdown restrictions would be most severe. Read the full story here: The Russian prime minister Mikhail Mishustin has said he has been diagnosed with coronavirus and will self-isolate from the government in the country\u2019s highest-profile case of the disease yet, reports the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Roth in Moscow. Mishustin disclosed that he was infected during a video call with Vladimir Putin, Russian state news agencies reported on Thursday evening. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how severe Mishustin\u2019s case of the disease was, although one news agency reported that he had an elevated temperature of 39 degrees. Mishustin has been tasked with leading the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, which surpassed 100,000 cases in Russia on Thursday. First deputy prime minister Andrei Belousov would take on his duties in his absence, Mishustin said. \u201cDear Vladimir Vladimirovich, I have just found out that the tests I gave for coronavirus have come back positive. Accordingly \u2026 I will go into self-isolation, fulfilling my doctors\u2019 orders. This is necessary to do in order to protect my colleagues,\u201d Mishustin reportedly told Putin during a video call. Putin has led semi-regular video calls with members of the government from his residence at Novo-Ogaryovo. He has not been pictured with other members of the government in the last several weeks. As nations around the world are wondering what a good lockdown exit strategy looks like, Spain has released details about the time slots during which adults will be allowed outside to walk and exercise, reports Sam Jones in Madrid. And it looks pretty rigid: The health minister, Salvador Illa, said that people will be allowed out to walk or take other exercise from 6am to 10am and then from 8pm until 11pm. People over 70, and those who need help walking, or who rely on carers, will be allowed out from 10am to midday, and then from 7pm til 8pm. Parents will be able to accompany children aged under 14 on walks between midday and 7pm. The new rules come into force first thing on Saturday morning. Walkers are entitled to an hour\u2019s daily exercise within a 1km-radius of home, and while there are no time or distance limits for runners or those taking part in individual sports, they must stay within their home area. Social distancing guidelines must be observed, with people staying at least 1.5m away from others. Illa also said that towns of fewer than 5,000 inhabitants would be exempt from the time restirctions, allowing people to go out to walk or exercise when they wanted. People will also be allowed to return to their fruit and vegetable gardens and allotments to gather produce. The minister said the strict lockdown imposed on 14 March had worked. When the state of emergency began, the daily infection rate was 35% - today it\u2019s at 0.6%. We need to keep acting very wisely and very prudently and follow expert advice. We got into this together and we need to get out of it together. There\u2019s no other way. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said that the country has past its peak, and defended the decisions the UK government has taken. Speaking at the UK government\u2019s daily press conference, Johnson \u2013 who has just returned to work after a near-death brush with coronavirus, and the birth of his son \u2013 said that the NHS has not been overwhelmed at any stage. He says the UK avoided an \u201cuncontrollable and catastrophic\u201d epidemic that could have caused 500,000 deaths. The government has faced criticism for not giving the public a clear idea of what its exit strategy from the coronavirus lockdown might look like. He said he will publish a comprehensive plan next week, which will cover three things: how to restart the economy; how to get children back to school; and how to get people into work. So far, so simple. There will be five key tests: The ability to protect the NHS and its ability to cope A sustained fall in deaths A falling infection rate A solution to the challenges of testing and PPE Confidence that a second peak will not overwhelm the NHS For all the live updates from that press conference please do visit our UK coronavirus liveblog: Last bit on Sweden (for now): Alberto Nardelli, Buzzfeed\u2019s Europe editor (and formerly of this parish) did an excellent analysis of the figures earlier this week. He compared the number of deaths in Denmark and Sweden, and argued that the data showed many more people were dying in the latter. It\u2019s a deep dive \u2013 but worth the time. If, like me, you have become slightly obsessed with the different approach Sweden has taken compared with its Nordic neighbours (just me, then?), this Forbes piece is worth a read. After describing scenes of \u201cnormal\u201d life which many European countries are currently only able to dream of, it continues All this follows a handful of mostly optimistic reports from the Public Health Agency in Sweden indicating that the rate of new infections and deaths remains stable even as numbers continue to rise. The number of people in intensive care at any one time has stayed flat, and most of the field hospitals that were set up in March remain empty. Of particular interest are reports that around one quarter of Stockholm (some say even more) is believed to have already had the virus. Though that number has been debated, several experts appear increasingly confident that the number of asymptomatic cases is much higher than initially thought. Now is an especially interesting time to keep an eye on what happens as many countries in Europe, including Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbors, begin to ease restrictions themselves. Swedish authorities seem to have accepted that infections and deaths would inevitably climb at a certain rate, so the numbers here look much worse than in neighboring countries. Would be very interested to hear from any readers in Sweden about how they feel about their government\u2019s response to the pandemic. You can read more about the nation\u2019s policy from the Guardian\u2019s excellent Europe correspondent Jon Henley, who very recently reported on politicians asking not to be judged prematurely, and comments from its chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, that the lockdown measures taken by other countries now opening up were difficult to justify. The Canadian arctic territory of Nunavut has reported its first case of Covid-19 \u2013 something officials had long feared as inevitable, reports the Guardian\u2019s Leyland Cecco in Toronto. The territorial chief public health officer, Dr Michael Patterson, said: We did anticipate that it was only a matter of time before our territory had a confirmed case, and unfortunately today is that day. We recognize that this news may be frightening. The case was recorded in Pond Inlet, a small community of 1,600 people. Officials have started contact tracing within the community. The government\u2019s rapid response team is expected to arrive in the community on Thursday afternoon. All travel to and from Pond Inlet has been restricted, including travel by air and land. The government has made an exception for cargo and emergency travel. The premier, Joe Savikataaq, said: There is no need to panic. Nunavut has had time to prepare, and we are in a solid position to manage this. We ask people not to place any blame, not to shame and to support communities and each other as we overcome Covid-19 in Nunavut. Health experts have feared the isolated communities in the Arctic, many of which experience chronic overcrowding in homes and disproportionately high rates of respiratory illness, would be among Canada\u2019s most vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. Anna Banerji, the director of global and indigenous health at the University of Toronto\u2019s faculty of medicine, previously told the Guardian: If a whole bunch of people become sick in the Canadian Arctic or in these remote communities, and these people are getting sick from the coronavirus, then what happens? People will die. Another 3.8 million people lost their jobs in the US last week as the coronavirus pandemic continued to batter the economy. The pace of layoffs appears to be slowing, but in just six weeks an unprecedented 30 million Americans have now sought unemployment benefits and the numbers are still growing, writes my colleague Dominic Rushe. The latest figures from the Department of Labor released on Thursday showed a fourth consecutive week of declining claims. While the trend is encouraging, the rate of losses means US unemployment is still on course to reach levels unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Read the full report here|: The Associated Press is reporting that New York police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood on Wednesday after an overwhelmed funeral home resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, according to officials. AP reports: Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official. No criminal charges were brought and the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation, spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The Andrew T Cleckley Funeral Home was cited for failing to control the odors. The home was able to obtain a larger, refrigerated truck later in the day, the official said. Workers suited up in protective gear could be seen in the afternoon transferring bodies into the refrigerated truck. In the US again, Anthony Fauci has today said that states reopening their economies \u201ccan\u2019t just leap over things\u201d that would potentially allow the coronavirus to rebound. In an interview on NBC\u2019s Today show, Savannah Guthrie asked Fauci whether the states that are beginning to reopen have the capability to do contact tracing. Fauci responded that while he could not go through a list of each of them, he urged those that don\u2019t have that capability to \u201cgo very slowly\u201d. He said: You can\u2019t just leap over things and get into a situation where you\u2019re really tempting a rebound. That\u2019s the thing I get concerned about. I hope they don\u2019t do that. Fauci said states should follow federal guidelines and only begin to reopen if they have a two-week decline in the number of new Covid-19 cases. He cautioned that states must have the capability of identifying, isolating and contact tracing people who test positive because \u201cthere will be blips \u2014 there\u2019s no doubt\u201d. \u201cWhen you pull back, there will be cases,\u201d he said. In the US, federal guidelines on social distancing will expire tonight and at least two dozen states are set to begin reopening with greater social movement and business activity tomorrow or over the weekend. This is from our US coronavirus liveblog: While Donald Trump is keen for this to happen, his own public health experts are urging extreme caution about states relaxing their own stay-at-home orders (as opposed to mere guidelines). There were more than 2,600 new deaths in the US from coronavirus yesterday. And last night California announced it was going to close its beaches and state parks just days after allowing them to open, after people crowded there in an unsafe way. And: Top public health expert Anthony Fauci this morning said the preliminary results from early trials of the drug remdesivir in treating coronavirus were \u201cclearly positive\u201d though \u201cmodest\u201d and were a \u201cfirst step in what we project will be better and better drugs\u201d to treat Covid-19. Presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has formed his \u201cvetting team\u201d to search for his best vice presidential candidate \u2013 while calls for him to address directly a recently elevated accusation of sexual assault in the past are growing. The latest unemployment figures in the US are due out at 8.30 and our business team will cover that separately. They will not make good reading. You can follow all US coronavirus-related news here: Tajikistan, which was thought to be one of the few countries untouched by coronavirus, has recorded its first coronavirus cases, according to a report from the website Asia Plus. According to the Ministry of Health and Social Protection of the Population (MoHSPP), 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases had been reported in the country as of 29 April. Health officials had previously said pneumonia was sweeping through the population, according to the report. Here\u2019s a list from Al Jazeera of countries with no confirmed cases of coronavirus: Comoros; Kiribati; Lesotho; Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Nauru; North Korea; Palau; Samoa; Solomon Islands; Tonga; Turkmenistan; Tuvalu; Vanuatu World Health Organization officials in Africa have said the Covid-19 outbreak is still increasing across the continent despite widespread efforts at containment, writes the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jason Burke. Unlike developed countries that can rely on relatively well-resourced health systems to treat large numbers of sick people, most African nations are hoping they can drastically slow the spread of the disease to protect very limited facilities. There are more than 34,000 confirmed cases across the continent, with about a third of those on its northern Mediterranean coast. The statistics are likely to significantly underestimate the true extent of the spread of the disease. Many countries have issued targeted lockdowns in major cities, as well as dusk-to-dawn curfews and restrictions on travel, but most have stopped short of nationwide lockdowns like that in South Africa, citing the economic and social costs of such measures. WHO officials warned that such choices could mean consequences in terms of the spread of Covid-19, but said they recognised the challenge of making tough decisions. They did however express concern at surging numbers of cases in some regions. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO\u2019s director for the Africa region, said: We are very concerned about west Africa where we are seeing some community spread in a significant number of countries compared with others. Senegal, with a population of nearly 16 million, has recorded 933 cases, with nine deaths as of Thursday. The government has declared a state of emergency, closed schools and issued restrictions on gatherings and travel, but cases have continued to rise. There are also concerns that outbreaks are not being recognised. There are unconfirmed reports from local doctors and media of large numbers of deaths involving a respiratory illness in Somalia, northern Nigeria and elsewhere. A limited ability to test has slowed investigation. Michel Yao, WHO Africa\u2019s emergency operations manager, said identification by symptoms could be enough if there had already been confirmed cases of Covid-19 in a given area. In South Africa, which now has 5,350 confirmed Covid-19 cases and more than 100 deaths, the peak of the outbreak is likely to be between July and September, depending on how the disease evolves during the southern hemisphere\u2019s winter and the impact of containment measures, the health minister, Zweli Mkhize, said. A strict lockdown imposed five weeks ago in South Africa will be marginally softened tomorrow (Friday), with some exercise now allowed and a handful of designated industries returning to work. Prof Salim Abdool Karim, the principal government adviser on Covid-19, said South Africa had performed better than developed countries in slowing transmission, although the number of cases has continued to rise. He said: We have got quite clear evidence that we have flattened the curve and that the number of cases we are seeing, and the number of infections probably occurring, has declined quite substantially. Deep problems remain, however, with a shortage of trained medical personnel still a major concern. More news from Denmark, where authorities say the spread of Covid-19 has not accelerated since it became the first country outside of Asia to ease lockdown measures a fortnight ago. Day care centres and schools began reopening in the Nordic country two weeks ago, followed by hairdressers and other small businesses on 20 April. The move came after the number of infections and deaths slowed. \u201cThere are no signs that the Covid-19 epidemic is accelerating,\u201d the State Serum Institute, which is responsible for preparedness against infectious diseases, said. The \u201cR rate\u201d, which indicates the average number of infections one person with the virus causes, increased slightly in the past two weeks but remained below 1.0, it said. Earlier this week, Germany announced its R rate had edged up back to 1.0 after a lockdown relaxation. Denmark, which was one of the first nations in Europe to shut down, had 452 coronavirus-related deaths as of Thursday, with the number of hospitalisations falling steadily during April. \u201cThere are no signs whatsoever that the partial reopening has caused a bigger spread of infection,\u201d said Christian Wejse, a scientist at the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University. \u201cAt least there is no indication that we are heading into another wave. That has been the concern, but I can\u2019t see that at all,\u201d he told Reuters. Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said yesterday that the spread of the virus was \u201cunder control\u201d and that she would present a plan for the next steps in the reopening before 10 May. \u201cWe are by no means home safe, but we have a really good starting point now to get the number of infected further down,\u201d Wejse said. Scientists have found evidence for mutations in some strains of the coronavirus that suggest the pathogen may be adapting to humans after spilling over from bats. The analysis of more than 5,300 coronavirus genomes from 62 countries shows that while the virus is fairly stable, some have gained mutations, including two genetic changes that alter the critical \u201cspike protein\u201d the virus uses to infect human cells. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stress that it is unclear how the mutations affect the virus, but since the changes arose independently in different countries, they may help the virus spread more easily. The spike mutations are rare at the moment but Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study \u2013 which has yet to be published in a journal or peer reviewed \u2013 said their emergence highlighted the need for global surveillance of the virus so that more worrying changes could be picked up fast. Hibberd said: This is exactly what we need to look out for. People are making vaccines and other therapies against this spike protein because it seems a very good target. We need to keep an eye on it and make sure that any mutations don\u2019t invalidate any of these approaches.\u201d Studies of the virus revealed early on that the shape of its spike protein allowed it to bind to human cells more efficiently than Sars, a related virus that caused an outbreak in 2002. The difference may have helped the latest coronavirus infect more people and spread rapidly around the world. Scientists will be concerned if more extensive mutations in the spike protein arise, not only because they may alter how the virus behaves. The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work. Other potential therapies, such as synthetic antibodies that home in on the spike protein, could be less effective, too. Hosting the Tour de France for more than a century, it is a country already famous for cycling. Now French commuters are being urged to swap cars for bicycles when the Covid-19 lockdown ends. The government has announced plans to develop temporary bike lanes, with an additional \u20ac20m subsidy towards the cost of repairs. The initiative, by the energy and transport ministry, also includes an increase in bicycle parking spaces and training to get people back in the saddle. France, where there has been more than 24,000 coronavirus deaths, is due to ease lockdown measures on 11 May. The minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne said: While 60% of trips made in France are less than 5km, the coming weeks represent an opportunity for many French people, already cyclists or not, to choose biking.\u201d The \u201cbicycle repair boost\u201d programme, which will provide up to \u20ac50 for repairs by sponsored mechanics, as well as supporting a scheme that allows employers to cover up to \u20ac400 of travel costs of staff who commute by bike. Paris currently has about 370km of bike paths and the temporary lanes are expected to increase that to 650km. Breaking news from Denmark where it has emerged police, security and intelligence officials have carried out an operation to thwart preparations for an Islamist terrorist attack, according to a statement from police. In Germany, the country\u2019s foreign minister has warned the coronavirus pandemic must not be exploited as an excuse to hinder the work of international observers monitoring the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, where Moscow-backed rebels run statelets independent of Kiev\u2019s control. Speaking after a video conference of foreign ministers from countries involved in mediation efforts, Heiko Maas agreed on a series of points. Maas agreed with his counterparts from France, Ukraine and Russia that there needed to be increased prisoner exchanges between the warring parties, efforts to ensure retired people in the east could access their Ukrainian pensions and more crossing points to add to the five currently in place along the 500km of the contact line. \u201cIn recent times too many excuses have been found to hesitate,\u201d he said of a faltering implementation of a ceasefire, calling for observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to be given unhindered access. \u201cThe health concerns in the pandemic must not be used as an excuse.\u201d But Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that Kiev and Moscow were still far from finalising a prisoner swap of all inmates. The conflict, which broke out in 2014, has killed more than 13,000 people, left a large swathe of Ukraine de facto controlled by the separatists and aggravated the deepest east-west rift since the cold war. More from Italy, where it emerged earlier the economy has gone into recession, with the country\u2019s prime minister announcing some regions might be able to unwind Covid-19 restrictions more rapidly than others. But the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, also warned local authorities against rushed, unilateral rollbacks. It comes after Italy, which has registered the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe with 27,682 fatalities, has endured some of the world\u2019s toughest lockdown measures. But, according to Reuters, regions run by rightwing parties \u2013 which are not part of the ruling government coalition \u2013 have kicked back against plans for a gradual, nationwide easing of curbs, saying the proposed schedule, due to start on Monday, is too timid. Highlighting the growing discord, Calabria, in the south-west of the country, announced that bars and restaurants in its region can reopen immediately so long as they have outdoor tables - a month ahead of the government\u2019s proposed schedule. In a speech to parliament, Conte said he would be willing to work with regions in future to enable them to relax measures more quickly if they had particularly low rates of infection. \u201cThere will not be a plan based on sudden initiatives by individual local authorities, but rather one based on scientific findings,\u201d he said, warning that a quick end to curbs could fuel the contagion and lead to a surge in infections. He added: I\u2019ll say this clearly, at the risk of appearing unpopular. The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... we are still in this pandemic.\u201d Autonomous moves by regions would be considered illegitimate, he added, opening the way for confrontations with regional chiefs set on defying the central government. It\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the live blog while my colleague, Alexandra Topping, takes a well-earned break. I\u2019ll do my best to keep you updated with developments over the next hour or so. There\u2019s a series of updates on the situation in the UK after a briefing of political journalists over on our UK coronavirus liveblog. It appears increasingly unlikely that there will be any major change to the current lockdown next week after the prime minister\u2019s spokesman again played down the prospect, saying it would be wrong to \u201cgamble away\u201d what has already been achieved. No 10 has been transmitting this message for some days, but this seemed to be an even stronger hint that people should not expect too much from the review of the lockdown due by Thursday next week. The spokesman said: We don\u2019t want to relax the social distancing measures or do anything which could lead to the virus, which the British public have done so much to suppress, being able to spread in an exponential way again, and that will guide our approach as we move forward. People have made huge sacrifices in order to bring down the rate of infection, to protect the NHS and ultimately to save lives and we are not going to gamble those sacrifices away by taking steps that could lead to an exponential growth in the disease again. When asked if the lockdown could continue until June, the spokesman said people would have to wait for the government decision. But he also reminded reporters of what Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has said about how the virus will be around for a significant period of time. The spokesman went on: As the PM himself has said, the worst thing we could do is relax the social distancing measures too soon and throw away all of the progress that has been made. My colleague Khushbu Shah has written a great piece from Atlanta, Georgia, where the governor, Brian Kemp, has announced the state will reopen even as coronavirus cases continue to rise, with nearly 25,000 confirmed in the state as of Tuesday afternoon. G7 finance ministers are today discussing strategies to accelerate economic activity once their economies reopen, the US Treasury has said. The Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and his counterparts from the other G7 countries also discussed the importance of foreign direct investment and the use of investment screening mechanisms to identify national security risks, a department spokesperson said. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has said it is highly unlikely there will be a loosening of lockdown restrictions next week. Noting the next review lockdown guidance planned for 7 May, she said: \u201cIt may well be too early even by this time next week to reduce the current restrictions.\u201d She stressed that \u201cour assessment as of today of the data and the evidence is that it would not be safe\u201d to lift the restrictions. She urged the Scottish public not to ease up on travel restrictions in particular, revealing that there had been a significant increase over the last week. People using concessionary bus travel rose by a sixth, and car traffic by 5%. In the last 24 hours there were 319 new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Scotland, bringing the total to 11,353. There were a further 60 deaths registered, taking that total to 1,475. Eye-popping story on the ingenuity of criminals, who are using food delivery services as a cover to transport drugs and other illegal goods during the coronavirus crisis. Reuters reports: Interpol said it had received reports from police in Ireland, Malaysia, Spain and Britain identifying delivery drivers transporting drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, ketamine and ecstasy. Earlier this month, the Spanish National Police identified and arrested seven people dressed as food delivery drivers in Alicante and Valencia, said Interpol. It added that those involved in the Spanish case were caught delivering cocaine and marijuana by bicycle, motorcycle and car, with some of the drugs concealed inside home delivery backpacks. In Ireland, police recovered 8 kg (17 lbs) of cocaine as well as two handguns hidden in pizza boxes, added Interpol. In Germany, a company working with the US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has begun human trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine that could supply millions by the end of the year, according to the two firms. Pfizer says it will begin testing the experimental vaccine in the United States as early as next week, and says a vaccine could be ready for emergency use in the autumn, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. There\u2019s a CNN report here. Thanks to Guardian reader Claus Schr\u00f8der-Hansen for bringing it to my attention. Cyprus has released details about how it plans to reopen after its lockdown. The strategy to lift the restrictions and restart the economy has been divided into four phases, which will be adjusted depending on the epidemiological data. Phase one is set to start on 4 May and will include the reopening of the construction sector, retail apart from shopping malls and open markets. By phase 4, set to start on 14 July, theatres and cinemas, festivals and concerts, casinos and play areas are expected to be open. More details on the opening of schools are expected today. The Cyprus Mail has more details here. My thanks to Guardian reader Roger Dawson who flagged this. Health authorities in Spain have said time slots for specific outdoor activities will be used to help the country avoid confusion and further contagion when adults are allowed out on Saturday to exercise for the first time since mid-March, reports my colleague Sam Jones. Details of the timetable are due to be explained later today by the health minister. They are thought to include a set time for people to run or go out to exercise as families. Children in Spain \u2013 which has been in lockdown since 14 March \u2013 have been allowed out to exercise with a parent or guardian since last Sunday. Speaking on Spanish radio on Thursday, the transport minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, said trips outside would be \u201csequenced\u201d to prevent what he called \u201can explosive exit\u201d. He told Cadena Ser: It\u2019s a set of measures that will see certain hours agreed with regional and local governments. It will all need to be thoroughly discussed to avoid an explosive exit and so that trips outside with children can happen along with those of couples or people doing sport. France has plunged into recession. Data shows that French GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first three months of 2020, a very sharp decline in activity triggered by the coronavirus lockdown. Italy\u2019s economy has entered recession Italian GDP shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, new figures from ISTAT show - that is the biggest drop since the data series began in 1995. South Korea reports no new domestic cases for first time since 29 February. South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Spain\u2019s daily death toll falls to lowest in nearly six weeks. The number of fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight in Spain was 268. War-torn Yemen reports first virus deaths. The country reported its first two deaths and a new cluster of Covid-19 cases amid worries that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time and attempts at a humanitarian ceasefire to contain the new crisis are failing. Russia cases pass 100,000 with record daily rise. 7,099 new cases were recorded on Thursday, bringing the nationwide tally to 106,498. Czechs say coronavirus spread is contained as country reopens. The Czech Republic has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight consecutive days, and the government will continue to cautiously open up the economy, the health minister said. Japan likely to extend nationwide state of emergency over the coronavirus. Prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe is expected to extend the measure until the end of May or until 6 June, as the country\u2019s healthcare system continues to face an \u201cextremely tough situation\u201d, he said. People out of work in Germany increased by 373,000 to 2.64 million in April. Data from the labour office also showed the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%, up from 5% in March, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. A British pharmaceutical company will know whether it\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine candidate is effective by June or July. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the company will continue working with Oxford Vaccine Unit to bring it to patients as soon as possible. More disheartening economic news from the eurozone. Italy has joined France in recession, after suffering its worst slump in decades which has wiped out all of the growth since the eurozone crisis, and then some. This from our business live blog: Italian GDP shrank by 4.7% in the first quarter of 2020, new figures from ISTAT show. That is the worst since the data series began in 1995, showing that the coronavirus lockdown measures implemented in recent weeks have had a very damaging impact on growth. It follows a 0.3% contraction in October to December, meaning Italy has notched up two consecutive quarters of contraction. You can follow all our live updates on business and economic news here: The International Energy Agency has said lockdowns in response to the pandemic will see global emissions fall by a record 8% - the biggest drop on record. But clearly there is a flip side to this positive news. IEA head Fatih Birol adds: Given the number of deaths and the economic trauma ... this historic decline in global emissions is absolutely nothing to cheer. The impact of the global coronavirus outbreak will be so significant that renewable electricity will be the only source resilient enough to survive, according to the world\u2019s energy watchdog. This is from the Guardian\u2019s report by energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose. The International Energy Agency said the outbreak of Covid-19 would wipe out demand for fossil fuels by prompting a collapse in energy demand seven times greater than the slump caused by the global financial crisis. In a report, the IEA said the most severe plunge in energy demand since the second world war would trigger multi-decade lows for the world\u2019s consumption of oil, gas and coal while renewable energy continued to grow. The steady rise of renewable energy combined with the collapse in demand for fossil fuels means clean electricity will play its largest ever role in the global energy system this year, and help erase a decade\u2019s growth of global carbon emissions. Read the full report here: The Guardian\u2019s excellent data team, specifically Caelainn Barr and Pamela Duncan, have tried to unpick the figures surrounding Covid-19-related deaths in the UK and this piece is really worth a read. Thanks so much to my colleague Jess Murray for her efforts this morning, I\u2019ll be looking after the global live blog for the next 8 hours or so. If you have tips and suggestions, or think we\u2019ve missed a story please do get in touch. We appreciate our readers from all over the globe and love it when you get in touch. Personally, I particularly like the kind messages...but welcome constructive criticism too! I\u2019m on alexandra.topping@theguardian.com and @lexytopping on Twitter. My DMs are open. I\u2019m signing off now and handing over to my colleague Lexy Topping who will be running things for the next few hours. Thanks for everyone for reaching out with their suggestions and comments, I really appreciate it. The death toll from the outbreak of Covid-19 in Iran increased by 71 in the past 24 hours to 6,028, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on Thursday. The total number of diagnosed cases of the coronavirus in Iran, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the outbreak, has reached 94,640, he said. In his final message, Kluge said Covid-19 \u201cis not going away any time soon\u201d and healthcare systems must adapt accordingly. We must be alert and open to new ways of delivering and receiving healthcare. We cannot risk seeing the tragedy of Covid-19 mirrored in a second catastrophe of ill health from other causes. He said the new Covid-19 Health System Response Monitor, launched by the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, is collating evidence of how health systems are responding to the pandemic. At the daily WHO briefing, Kluge said the WHO remained worried about interruptions to routine vaccinations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which could result in \u201ccollateral damage\u201d to children and vulnerable groups. He warned that measles continues to spread in some parts of Europe, affecting over 6,000 people in the first two months of this year. We cannot allow this situation to worsen. We should do everything within our powers to prevent children becoming victims of this pandemic due to their vulnerability of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, diphtheria, mumps and rubella. Covid-19 cannot be permitted to claim this collateral damage. Of the 44 countries in the European region that have implemented domestic movement restrictions, 21 countries have started easing some of these measures, and a further 11 are planning to do so in the coming days, said Hans Kluge, regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe. Speaking at a daily WHO press briefing, Kluge said countries must remain cautious. As I have said before \u2013 this virus is unforgiving \u2013 we must remain vigilant, persevere and be patient, ready to ramp up measures as and when needed. He said it was important that during the transition period, healthcare systems have the capacity to \u201coperate along a dual track\u201d, delivering regular health services while also able to respond aggressively to the virus when needed. The regional president of Madrid has been criticised after defending her administration\u2019s decision to contract fast food companies to feed children from low-income families during Spain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. Children in and around the capital who are normally eligible for free school meals have been receiving pizza and sandwiches from well-known Spanish chains despite worries from nutritionists. Speaking in the regional assembly on Wednesday, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso accused her political opponents of using the issue to try to score cheap points. She said: I don\u2019t think giving a kid pizza is a problem. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t like [these foods] and have never eaten them in your life \u2026 but I swear that 100% of children love them. The regional premier took careful aim at critics in the far-left, anti-austerity Unidas Podemos party, claiming that if they were in power, children in Madrid would be eating \u201cVenezuelan meals \u2013 which is to say nothing at all\u201d. Nutritionists, however, remain unimpressed by such arguments. \u201cSo, 100% of kids love pizza,\u201d the nutritionist and dietician Julio Basulto wrote on Twitter. \u201cSure they do. But they also love sweets, cakes, ice creams, chocolates, Doritos and Red Bull.\u201d Basulto said that while the odd pizza did not harm, a steady diet of them would lead to an unbalanced diet. He also pointed out that the governments of other Spanish regions had found ways to feed children from poorer families without resorting to fast-food chains. The number of fatalities related to Covid-19 recorded overnight in Spain fell to 268, the lowest in nearly six weeks, the country\u2019s health ministry said. The overall death toll rose to 24,543 on Thursday, up from 24,275 on the previous day, the ministry said. The number of cases registered in the country rose to 213,435 from 212,917 the day before. Japan Airlines\u2019 annual net profit plunged nearly 65%, the company said on Thursday, as it faced the \u201cunprecedented\u201d impact of the coronavirus pandemic on aviation demand. JAL said net profit for the fiscal year ending in March fell 64.6% to 53.4bn yen ($500m) on annual sales of 1.4trn yen, down 5.1%. The results were largely in line with a profit warning the airline issued last week. JAL said demand had plunged owing to entry bans around the world, the cancellation of major domestic events, and a state of emergency in Japan with authorities urging citizens not to travel. \u201cOur group is facing an unprecedented situation,\u201d the company said in a statement. For now, JAL plans to cut its number of flights by 90% on international routes and by more than 60% on domestic routes from its flight schedule announced before the pandemic. But the firm said it remained optimistic about the outlook. It said: The decline in flight demand due to the impact of the new coronavirus is a temporary phenomenon and our mid- and long-term forecast that demand for flights from and to Japan will grow greatly has remained unchanged. Indonesia confirmed 347 new coronavirus infections on Thursday, taking the total in the south-east Asian country above 10,000 for the first time with 10,118 infections, said the health ministry official Achmad Yurianto. Yurianto reported eight new deaths, taking the total fatalities to 792, while 1,522 have recovered. More than 72,300 people have been tested. The spread of Covid-19 has been contained in the Czech Republic and the government will continue to cautiously open up the economy, the health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, said on Thursday. The country has seen the number of new cases drop below 100 for the past eight consecutive days, and the number of active cases has also been on the decline. The ministry said the reproduction rate of the virus had dropped to 0.7, which means every newly infected person passes the infection to fewer than one other person. There were 7,581 cases in the country as of Thursday morning, and 227 deaths. Positive developments have prompted the government to start reopening shops and services as well as non-urgent medical care, as doctors fear the impact of neglect in standard care. Vojt\u011bch told a press conference: So far we do not see a negative trend resulting from previous relaxations. We will proceed with caution, gradually in the upcoming waves, and I believe we are on a good path. The country has also seen a decline in the number of hospitalised patients, to 348 on Wednesday from a peak of 446 on 9 April. The government, under pressure from businesses and the general population, has lifted most limits on movement and sped up reopening shops and services. Stores of up to 2,500 square metres reopened on Monday. The head of the health ministry\u2019s epidemiological advisory team, Rastislav Mad\u2019ar, has cautioned about the faster relaxations, saying they may be risky. Schools are not to reopen fully until September, and the government is also keeping in place an obligation to wear face masks in public and a ban on large public gatherings. The government is hoping a system of tracing and testing contacts of infected people, newly boosted by an army of testers, mobile apps and location data from phones and payment card transactions, will be enough to contain any flare-ups without the need to reintroduce blanket restrictions. Malaysian health authorities reported 57 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, raising the cumulative total to 6,002 cases. The health ministry also reported two new deaths, bringing the total fatalities to 102. Schools in Hungary will remain closed until the end of May and events with more than 500 participants cannot be held until 15 August, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s chief of staff, Gergely Guly\u00e1s, said on Thursday. Orb\u00e1n announced on Wednesday that some restrictions outside Budapest imposed to contain the coronavirus outbreak will be lifted, starting next week. Existing restrictions will continue for now in the capital, which has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths in the country. The German government\u2019s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), this morning announced the latest reproduction number of the novel coronavirus as 0.75. Lothar Wieler, the RKI\u2019s president, said the latest official data showed a \u201cpleasing development\u201d, indicating the spread of the virus in Germany was slowing down. The basic reproduction rate (R), which indicates how many new cases one infected person generates on average, had been announced as edging up to one in Monday\u2019s report \u2013 causing concern as it seemed to suggest the spread of the virus was regaining momentum. The RKI, which uses a method called nowcasting to estimate the R number, said while it had in recent days tweaked the method by which it estimated the number of new infections, the reproduction numbers from the start and the end of the week were still comparable. Germany on Thursday recorded a total of 159,119 confirmed Covid-19 infections, an increase of 1,478 compared with yesterday. Wieler said the capacity for testing for the virus had been ramped up in Germany, to 860,000 tests a week. 476,000 tests were carried out last week, out of which 5.4% were positive. Sailors at a Sri Lankan naval base have become the biggest cluster of coronavirus infections in the Indian Ocean island nation, with 248 testing positive for the disease, authorities said on Thursday. Sri Lanka\u2019s army chief, Lt Gen Shavendra Silva, said that out of 30 cases discovered in the last 24 hours, 22 are navy sailors and another seven had close contact with them. The virus is believed to have entered the camp on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo, last week when sailors were deployed to find a group of drug addicts who had contact with a Covid-19 patient and were evading quarantine. The virus then spread to different parts of the country when sailors went on home leave. About 4,000 navy troops are being quarantined inside the camp while 242 relatives have been taken to four quarantine centres run by the navy. Sri Lanka has had 649 Covid-19 patients and seven deaths. About half of the sick were diagnosed after 22 April and include 257 sailors or close contacts. According to the newspaper Lankadeepa, at least six villages have been sealed off this week in different parts of Sri Lanka because of exposure to the sailors who returned home. About 1,300 other people have been asked to self-quarantine, the paper reported. In a bid to control the spread of the virus, the government has cancelled home leaves for troops and ordered them to return to camps. On Wednesday night, Sri Lanka reimposed a 24-hour countrywide curfew, which had been in force since 20 March but was relaxed during daytime in more than two-thirds of the country. Police said they had arrested more than 41,000 curfew violators since last month. The Philippines reported 276 new coronavirus infections and 10 more deaths, bringing its total number of cases to 8,488 and fatalities to 568. It also said 20 more individuals had recovered, bringing total recoveries to 1,043. The number of people out of work in Germany increased by 373,000 to 2.64 million in April as the coronavirus outbreak began to bite, data from the labour office showed on Thursday, and the unemployment rate increased to 5.8%. The jobless rate had stood at 5.0% in seasonally adjusted terms in March. The labour office said 751,000 requests for short-time work for a total of 10.1 million people were made in March and until 26 April. It said that did not mean all of those people would actually end up on the short-time work scheme. For comparison, in the crisis year of 2009, applications for the short-time scheme were made for 3.3 million people, the labour office said. Short-time work is a form of state aid that allows employers to switch employees to shorter working hours during an economic downturn to keep them on the payroll. Luxembourg plans to test its entire population for coronavirus, the education minister, Claude Meisch, said on Tuesday. The small European country, which borders France, Germany and Belgium, has an estimated population of just over 600,000. The Luxembourg Times reports the country has a budget of \u20ac40m for the tests, provided by the ministry of higher education and research. During a press conference on Tuesday, Meisch said: We must live with the virus and control it. More testing will give people more freedom. The government is continuing to look into how we can move forward with the deconfinement measures. Testing began on Tuesday, with priority for children who are set to return to school from 4 May. The rest of the population will be tested on a voluntary basis at 17 stations around the country, with cross-border workers also encouraged to be tested. By 19 May, Luxembourg is set to have the capacity to test 20,000 people a day. In Afghanistan, the health ministry has reported its biggest daily rise of new coronavirus cases amid intensified warfare across the country. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, said on Thursday that 232 patients tested positive for Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, taking the total number of infections to 2,171. Three more Covid-19 patients died overnight, pushing the total number of deaths to 64. For days Afghanistan was struggling with a shortage of diagnostic testing equipment. A health ministry spokesman said that problem had now been solved and testing capacity was rising. Kabul is so far the country\u2019s worst-affected area, with 573 confirmed cases and 20 more reported today. Despite lockdowns in several provinces to contain spread of the virus, in most cities streets are still crowded with vehicles and people walking freely, which experts fear will make the fight against the coronavirus more challenging. Health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar warned the public on Wednesday that the peak of the virus is yet to come and said the \u201cnumber of new infections is rising daily so we\u2019re heading toward the peak and I ask people to stay at home\u201d. Meanwhile, war continues to rage across the country. At least five civilians, including women and children, were killed in Ghazni province Wednesday evening. According to a Ghazni police statement, the incident occurred when a civilian\u2019s vehicle hit a Taliban roadside mine in Andar district. The United Nations mission in Afghanistan has said more than 533 civilians, including 152 children, were killed in the first quarter of 2020. China has no interest in interfering in the US presidential election, it said on Thursday, following comments by President Donald Trump that Beijing \u201cwill do anything they can\u201d to make him lose his re-election bid in November. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, told reporters during a daily briefing that the election was an internal affair of the United States and that Beijing hoped Americans would not try to drag China into it. \u201cChina will do anything they can to have me lose this race,\u201d Trump said during an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, adding that he believes Beijing wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure Trump has placed on China over trade, the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and other issues. The chief executive of British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca said it would know by June or July whether a coronavirus vaccine it is working on with the University of Oxford will be effective or not. CEO Pascal Soriot told the BBC on Thursday: By June, July we will already have a very good idea of the direction of travel in terms of its potential efficacy. We\u2019ll continue working with the Oxford Vaccine Unit to bring it to patients and to regulatory authorities first of all as soon as possible. Yemen has reported its first two deaths and a new cluster of Covid-19 cases amid worries that the virus has been circulating undetected for some time and attempts at a humanitarian ceasefire to contain the new crisis are failing. Five new cases were confirmed in the southern city of Aden on Wednesday night, leading the local separatist administration - which renewed calls for independence last week - to announce a two-week shutdown. Two of the patients died after testing positive for the coronavirus, officials said overnight. Yemen has previously only reported one case, a port worker in the town of al-Shihr some 540km away. Although he made a full recovery, officials were unable to identify patient zero. Health workers and aid agencies have been dreading a widespread outbreak of coronavirus in Yemen, where testing facilities are almost non-existent and five years of war have decimated the medical sector. Worst-case scenario planning from the World Health Organization says up to 93% of the population could become infected. The Saudi-led coalition fighting against Iran-backed Houthi rebels announced a unilateral ceasefire last month to help Yemen contain the spread of Covid-19, but fighting in several areas has worsened instead. Coalition airstrikes on Houthi territory increased by 30% last week, war monitor the Yemen Data Project said on Wednesday. Russia reported 7,099 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, a record daily rise, bringing its nationwide tally to 106,498. The official nationwide death toll rose to 1,073 after 101 people died in the last 24 hours, Russia\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said. The German chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s chief of staff said on Thursday that social distancing measures in Europe\u2019s largest economy would \u201ccertainly\u201d be extended until 10 May for the time being. Helge Braun told broadcaster n-tv a larger discussion about further steps to ease the lockdown would happen on 6 May. Some shops have already reopened. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, is likely to extend a nationwide state of emergency imposed over the coronavirus, possibly by another month, local media reported on Thursday. The measure was initially declared on 7 April across seven regions experiencing a spike in infections, but was later expanded to cover the entire country. With the initial month-long period coming to an end next week after the country\u2019s annual Golden Week holidays, local media reported that Abe was now expected to extend the measure, either until the end of May or for another full month until 6 June. In parliament on Thursday, Abe said the country\u2019s healthcare system continues to face an \u201cextremely tough situation\u201d. He told lawmakers on Wednesday that \u201ceven now, we are seeing new infections\u201d, adding: \u201cCan we say on May 6 the state of emergency is over? I think severe situations are continuing.\u201d Local media, including the Nikkei newspaper, reported the government would convene a panel of experts on Friday to discuss the virus and the state of emergency, adding that the experts had already informally backed a move to extend the measures. It was not yet clear when any extension would be announced, but Abe has said he will not wait until the last minute, to allow business and institutions including schools time to prepare accordingly. The declaration has limited effect compared with measures seen in some parts of Europe and elsewhere. It allows governors to call on people to stay at home and urge businesses to close, but there are no punishments for those who fail to comply. The Italian central government is set to issue an injunction, ANSA news agency reports, after authorities in the southern region of Calabria gave the all clear for bars and restaurants with outside tables to reopen, sources said on Thursday after a cabinet meeting. The move is at odds with a central government decree to gradually relax the coronavirus lockdown, which states that bars and restaurants should not reopen until June, except for takeaway services. It also clashes with a previous decree that keeps the current lockdown measures in force until Monday. Regions with centre-right governors are pressing to have more autonomy in deciding how to ease the lockdown. But the regional affairs minister, Francesco Boccia, said on Wednesday that regional governments must move in step with the central government in Rome on relaxing lockdown measures or they will be cited for not complying. He said: The regions must show the same unity as that requested from citizens. Singapore confirmed 528 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, its health ministry said, taking the city state\u2019s total cases to 16,169. AstraZeneca will make and distribute globally the University of Oxford\u2019s potential Covid-19 vaccine, the British drugmaker said on Thursday. The Cambridge-based company did not give details on when it will start producing the vaccine. While there are more than 70 vaccines in development for the coronavirus, industry experts say they expect development of a successful vaccine to take at least 12-18 months, compared with the average vaccine development time of 5-7 years. The company\u2019s chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in a statement: Our hope is that, by joining forces, we can accelerate the globalisation of a vaccine to combat the virus and protect people from the deadliest pandemic in a generation. The Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group have been working on a vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and said earlier this month large-scale production capacity was being put in place to make millions of doses even before trials show whether it is effective. The team last week dosed the first volunteers in a trial of the vaccine, with possible early readouts in May. Potentially some positive news for the job market in all the gloom. Finance, technology and consumer goods firms are hiring tens of thousands in the United States and other countries, according to data from professional networking site LinkedIn. Across seven countries in North America, Europe and Asia, healthcare providers are among the busiest recruiters given the ongoing battle against Covid-19, LinkedIn said. But lifestyle changes during lockdown are also driving demand for financial consultants, factory workers, animators and game designers, and delivery workers. Overall, the hiring rate has plunged in the first quarter from the year-ago period, and in late April remains lower than a year ago across most countries surveyed by the platform. But the data offers a glimmer of hope, with a gradual uptick in China where the coronavirus emerged last year and which leads the world in surfacing from a months-long lockdown. LinkedIn, with over 690 million users worldwide, counts new hires when people add a new employer to their profile. The rate is the number of new hires divided by the total number of LinkedIn members in a country. The figures, tracked since mid-February, are not corroborated by official jobs data and do not represent the actual number of jobs in an economy. Government figures are usually released with a time-lag of several weeks. Guy Berger, principal economist at LinkedIn in California, told Reuters: We are confident that our data is directionally correct in that there has been a huge decline in hiring in the US and abroad. According to the data, hiring in China plummeted 50% during the height of its coronavirus crisis in mid-February, compared with 12 months earlier. Since restrictions were eased in early April, the hiring rate has inched up, and for the week ending 24 April was 3% lower than the same period in 2019. Hiring in the US, UK, France and Italy \u2013 which lead the world in coronavirus-related deaths \u2013 remains hugely depressed, but is falling less rapidly than a few weeks ago as the countries pass the peak of their epidemics, LinkedIn said. On Sunday Thailand will start reopening some businesses, such as outdoor markets, barber shops and pet groomers, after the number of new coronavirus infections dropped into single digits this week, a government spokesman said. The south-east Asian nation reported seven new infections but no deaths on Thursday, taking its tally since the outbreak began in January to 2,954 cases, with the death toll staying at 54. Even after Sunday\u2019s reopening, a nighttime curfew and ban on sales of alcohol will stay until the end of May unless otherwise specified, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin of the government\u2019s centre for Covid-19 situation administration. Among the six categories set to reopen are small retailers, street food stalls and restaurants outside shopping malls, and parks and outdoor sports facilities, he told a news conference. But department stores, movie theatres, gyms and spas, as well as most indoor sports venues, will stay closed to ensure there are no large gatherings. Thailand this week extended an emergency decree until the end of May, effectively prolonging some measures already in place. These include a ban on incoming international passenger flights, Taweesin said, as well as the alcohol ban ordered on 10 April. \u201cUnless changes are announced, alcohol sales will not happen at this time,\u201d Taweesin said. Now it will watch the situation for the next 14 days to decide whether to free up more businesses or clamp down again to contain the virus. Taweesin said: If the number of infections stays stable, we will ease restrictions further. But if the number rises to double or triple digits again, we will have to reassess everything. The holiest month on the Islamic calendar, Ramadan is usually a time when Muslims come together for prayer and to share food after fasting from dawn to dusk. But in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, many Muslims are confined to their homes, unable to travel, and public venues, including many mosques, are shut. Britain could miss its target of carrying out 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April, the justice minister, Robert Buckland, said on Thursday. Some 52,429 tests were carried out on Wednesday, according to the latest figures, putting Britain on course to miss the target set by the health minister. \u201cEven if it isn\u2019t met, we are well on our way to ramping this up,\u201d Buckland told the BBC. Ukraine now has 10,406 confirmed coronavirus cases and 261 deaths, the health minister, Maksym Stepanov, told a briefing on Thursday. The government has put lockdown measures in place until 11 May and has said it expects the pandemic to peak in Ukraine early next month. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has angered many in Brazil after he responded to questions about the country\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 by saying: \u201cSo what?\u201d This week, Brazil\u2019s coronavirus death toll topped 5,000 and there are nearly 80,000 confirmed cases reported. The president said: So what? I mourn [the deaths], what do you want me to do? I am called Messias [reference to his surname Messias, which means Messiah in Portuguese] but I can\u2019t perform miracles. It\u2019s Jessica Murray here, I\u2019ll be leading the live blog covering coronavirus developments across the globe (mainly outside the UK) for the next few hours. As usual, feel free to get in touch with your questions and personal experiences via jessica.murray@theguardian.com or @journojess_ on Twitter, and I\u2019ll do my best to respond to as many messages as I can. In California, governor Gavin Newsom is likely to announce on Thursday the closure of the state\u2019s beaches and parks after crowds jammed beaches last weekend, according to a memo cited by local media. The memo was sent by the governor\u2019s office to California\u2019s police chiefs, local media reported. Newsom\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment late on Wednesday. According to the memo, posted by the FOX 11 Los Angeles channel: After the well-publicized media coverage of overcrowded beaches this past weekend, in violation of Governor Newsom\u2019s Shelter in Place Order, the Governor will be announcing tomorrow that ALL beaches and all state parks in California will be closed, effective Friday, May 1st. Olive and Mabel are back (phew!), this time competing for \u201cwho can disgrace themselves more on a walk\u201d: That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. My colleague Jessica Murray will be with you on the blog for the next few hours. Meanwhile, I have spilled the beans on how I broke my foot \u2013 while blogging \u2013 two weeks ago: My colleague Graeme Wearden has fired up our business liveblog, where he reports that France has plunged into recession, as the Covid-19 lockdown batters its economy. Data just released shows that French GDP contracted by 5.8% in the first three months of 2020, a very sharp decline in activity. That\u2019s the worst contraction since the second war, and follows a 0.1% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2019 - meaning the eurozone\u2019s second-largest economy is now officially in recession. Follow the coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business below: The official global death toll passes 225,000. At least 227,644 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data. More than 3,193,961 confirmed infection shave been recorded worldwide. South Korea reports no new domestic cases for first time since 29 February. South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Trump says China wants him to lose 2020 election. US president Donald Trump said that coronavirus has \u201cupset very badly\u201d the US trade deal with China, and that China \u201cwill do anything they can to have me lose in 2020\u201d in an interview with Reuters. Trump does not see the 2020 election as being a referendum on his handling of the pandemic, he said. China\u2019s Forbidden City will reopen on Friday. Three months after it closed due to the coronavirus crisis, Beijing\u2019s sprawling Forbidden City will reopen, in the latest signal that the country has brought the disease under control. The imperial palace sitting across Tiananmen Square was shut down on 25 January as authorities closed tourist attractions and took other extraordinary measures to contain the virus, including locking down an entire province. Japan expected to extend state of emergency by a month. Japan\u2019s government is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency for another month, after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201csevere\u201d. US drug trial shows \u2018clear cut\u2019 effect, says top medic. While a Chinese trial demonstrated no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d to administering the antiviral drug remdesivir to Covid-19 patients, a separate trial in the US shows a \u201cclear-cut\u201d effect, according to the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci. Police called after New York funeral home stores bodies in trucks. Police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said. More cases of rare syndrome in children. Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. South Africa\u2019s virus cases jump past 5,000 after highest daily rise. The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa surged past the 5,000 mark on Thursday after it saw the largest single-day jump to date, health ministry figures showed. A total of 354 new cases were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 5,350, and the number of fatalities spiked by 10 to 103. Why we seem to be dreaming much more \u2013 and often of insects From going to bed too late thanks to endless scrolling through theories about the pandemic, to waking up in the night worrying, it is safe to say that Covid-19 is wreaking havoc with our sleep. A major survey conducted by King\u2019s College London with Ipsos Mori showed that two in five people in the UK have reported sleep disturbance. Prof Bobby Duffy, the research lead and director of the Policy Institute at King\u2019s, says: \u201cThere is a clear relationship between increased stress and impact on sleep; 53% of those who said they found the crisis stressful reported sleep difficulties.\u201d But many people around the world are also experiencing a new phenomenon: pandemic dreams: Several researchers are collecting dream data during the pandemic, including Dr Deirdre Barrett, a clinical and evolutionary psychologist at Harvard Medical School. Some dreams she has collected during the current pandemic are literal \u2013 \u201cpeople are having trouble breathing or spiking a fever\u201d \u2013 but many are abstract. After all, we know coronavirus is there, but we can\u2019t see it. \u201cThere are earthquakes, tidal waves and tornadoes; every kind of uncontrollable disaster. But the biggest dream cluster is bugs; flying bugs attacking the dreamer, cockroaches swarming, masses of squirming worms.\u201d The Dutch are gambling on an \u2018intelligent lockdown\u2019 to beat coronavirus, AFP reports. Shops are open and families cycle along in the sunny spring weather in the Netherlands, which has opted for what it calls an \u201cintelligent lockdown\u201d to curb the coronavirus pandemic. In contrast to most other European countries, where people are virtually housebound, the Dutch authorities have merely advised people to stay home and to keep 1.5 metres (five feet) of social distance. While restaurants, bars, museums and its infamous sex clubs remain shut, and the famed cannabis \u2018coffee shops\u2019 are open for takeaway only, the outdoors-loving Dutch are otherwise allowed to leave home when they want. Schools meanwhile start to reopen from 11 May. The Netherlands has the 14th-highest number of confirmed infections worldwide, with 38,998, and 4,727 people have lost their lives in the country so far. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte - who came up with the phrase \u201cintelligent lockdown\u201d - has been clear on the policy. \u201cWe don\u2019t work like that in the Netherlands, where the government says \u2018you have to do this, you have to do that,\u201d Rutte told a press conference at the end of March. The authorities have admonished the public when the country\u2019s beaches have become too crowded, but while police have closed car parks to stop crowds flocking there at the weekends, they remain open. The Dutch position - very similar to Sweden\u2019s - also reflects a wider philosophical split in both Europe and the world on how to balance the need to curb the disease against the catastrophic economic damage caused by harsh lockdowns. Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has donated a $100,000 prize she won from a Danish foundation to the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) for use against the COVID-19 pandemic, the world body said Thursday. \u201cLike the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child rights crisis,\u201d Thunberg, 17, was quoted as saying in the UNICEF statement. \u201cIt will affect all children, now and in the long term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m asking everyone to step up and join me in support of UNICEF\u2019s vital work to save children\u2019s lives, to protect health and continue education.\u201d The Danish anti-poverty non-governmental organisation, Human Act, will match the $100,000 donation, the statement added. UNICEF said the funds would give it a boost as it struggles to support children impacted by anti-virus lockdowns and school closures, particularly in the fields of \u201cfood shortages, strained health care systems, violence and lost education.\u201d Thunberg said at the end of March that she had \u201clikely\u201d contracted the coronavirus, after experiencing several symptoms after a trip to central Europe. Here\u2019s a look at Thursday\u2019s front pages in the UK on Thursday, 30 April: Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Emotional fallout of Covid-19 lockdown yet to peak, says New Zealand scientist New Zealand has begun moving out of a strict national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19, but the emotional consequences of the shutdown are yet to peak, says one of the country\u2019s veteran scientists. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the peak of the distress as a result of the lockdown. It will emerge over the coming weeks,\u201d said Sir Peter Gluckman, who was the chief science advisor to New Zealand\u2019s prime minister from 2009 until 2018. \u201cWith that will emerge some groups of people who will do well, they will find in the change opportunity, but many people who will be very uncertain, very scared, frustrated, angry, and we know from other disasters that about 10% or more even will progress to actual depression and to suicidality.\u201d However Gluckman also said the country possessed unique assets that could see it navigate the coronavirus crisis better than other nations would. In the UK, the cabinet will meet today to discuss when to start easing the lockdown as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached. Despite a record 52,000 tests being carried out on Wednesday, 19,000 were re-tests and hospital leaders criticised ministers for \u201ca series of frequent tactical announcements\u201d about testing targets. They said it was a \u201cred herring\u201d that had distracted from wider policy failures. Just days after Matt Hancock pledged to meet the 100,000 target by the end of April, the government turned down an offer of 10,000 testing kits a day from a US company. The chief coroner has issued guidelines that inquests into the death of NHS staff should not examine the impact of lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) on wards. Some beautiful photos here from the UK of NHS volunteers: Photographer Olivia Harris writes of the photo essay: The stories are really what make the pictures interesting. Everyone I\u2019ve photographed is helping out the NHS in one way or another, but I found community groups, or mutual aid networks, are much more active on the ground. I\u2019m interested by the comparative effectiveness of the mutual aid structure v the lumbering official NHS volunteer scheme. Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person \u201cin need\u201d and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings. Most recently, a video of her face as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral. As Trump spoke, Birx appeared to purse her lips and looked down, her hands clasped in her lap. Around her neck and shoulders was a silk scarf, loosely tied \u2013 almost in the style of a girl scout. The scarf was Herm\u00e8s. Or, to be precise, Herm\u00e8s\u2019 \u201cRetour \u00e0 la Terre\u201d, in peach. We know this because there is now an Instagram account devoted to Dr Birx\u2019s scarves. She wears a different one almost every day, tied in a variety of styles, a move that has spawned her scarves their own online fanbase. Strangely, Dr Birx has not had much time to comment on the meaning behind her scarves. We know that one, an Afework Tekle art silk scarf from Ethiopia, was a gift from a colleague. Another, also Herm\u00e8s, costs around US$700. Some, like one called Eagle and another called Daughters of the American Revolution, are patriotic. Then there\u2019s the scarf featuring a cherry blossom motif, which may or may not be a reference to BrainDead, a TV show in which aliens living in Washington\u2019s cherry trees take over the minds of politicians. It seems likelier that Dr Birx had the Northern Hemisphere spring on her mind \u2013 but who knows? More now on South Korea, which has recorded no new domestic cases of Covid-19 for first time since February. The KCDC reported four new infections, all imported cases, taking the national tally to 10,765. The death toll rose by one to 247, while 9,059 have been discharged. Of the total, 1,065 were imported cases, where more than 90% were Koreans, according to a KCDC statement. South Korea\u2019s caseload has been slowing in recent weeks after it recorded hundreds of new cases every day between late February and early March. The government has subsequently relaxed some of its social distancing guidelines. It expected to ease up on more restrictions in coming days if its caseload maintains a decline. The health authorities also concluded no local transmission occurred from a parliamentary election this month, where authorities took safety measures, including requiring voters to wear masks and plastic gloves when casting ballots. \u201cTwenty-nine million voters participated in the 15 April parliamentary election ... Not one case related to the election has been reported during the 14 days of incubation period,\u201d Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy, told a briefing. The official global death toll passed 225,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with the official toll at 227,644. At least 3,193,961 people have been infected worldwide. South Korea reports no new domestic cases for first time since 29 February. South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Trump says China wants him to lose 2020 election. Trump said that coronavirus has \u201cupset very badly\u201d the US trade deal with China, and that China \u201cwill do anything they can to have me lose in 2020.\u201dTrump does not see the 2020 election as being a referendum on his handling of the pandemic, he said. Donald Trump has said the federal government will not be extending its coronavirus social distancing guidelines once they expire on Thursday. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who have died of coronavirus surpassed 60,000, a toll far higher than any other country. China\u2019s Forbidden City will reopen on Friday, three months after it closed due to the coronavirus crisis - the latest signal that the country has brought the disease under control. The sprawling imperial palace was shut down on January 25. Japan expected to extend state of emergency by a month. Japan\u2019s government is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency for another month, after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201csevere\u201d.

More cases of \u2018Covid-linked\u2019 syndrome in children. Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. South Africa\u2019s virus cases jump past 5,000 after highest daily rise. The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa surged past the 5,000 mark on Thursday after it saw the largest single-day jump to date, health ministry figures showed. A total of 354 new cases were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 5,350, and the number of fatalities spiked by 10 to 103. Half world\u2019s workers \u2018at risk of unemployment\u2019. The International Labour Organisation has warned that almost half the global workforce \u2013 1.6 billion people \u2013 are in \u201cimmediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed\u201d by the economic impact of Covid-19, Philip Inman, a Guardian economics writer, reports. Official UK death toll up by 4,419, after the government included deaths outside hospital for the first time. As of 5pm on Tuesday, total of 26,097 patients had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to Public Health England. Brazil sees record increase in cases. Brazil has reported a record increase in cases, with its ministry of health confirming 6,276 more infections in a 24-hour period, taking the country\u2019s total to 78,162. Ireland looks set to extend its lockdown, despite growing calls to ease restrictions and salvage the economy.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Wednesday that new cases of Covid-19 infections, deaths and intensive care admissions appeared too high to start relaxing rules that are to expire on 5 May. Swiss government extends ban on large public events. The Swiss government has extended its ban on public events exceeding 1000 people until the end of August, even as it announced the easing of some other restrictions on sporting events, shops, restaurants and museums. Sweden passes 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Sweden rose past the 20,000 mark on Wednesday, after the Nordic country reported another 681 infections. Five coronavirus cases have been reported in Aden, southern Yemen, by the country\u2019s internationally recognised government, raising the prospect that the war-ravaged country will soon also have an outbreak of the new disease. China\u2019s parliament is to hold its annual meeting from 22 May - more than two months later than planned. Conditions for holding the meeting have been met as the coronavirus situation has improved, decision makers said. Russia\u2019s coronavirus case tally neared the 100,000 milestone,after the country reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide tally to 99,399, Reuters reports. UK government is still aiming for 100,000 daily tests by tomorrow, according to the environment secretary, George Eustice. He said the search for an effective antibody test was still under way and denied that earlier introduction of testing at care homes would have saved lives. The coronavirus outbreak needs to be contained before 2021 Olympics can go ahead, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said. \u201cThe Olympic Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d The UK prime minister Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a baby boy. Johnson returned to frontline work on Monday after falling ill with coronavirus and spending time in intensive care. Air passenger numbers are down 99% in the UK, the home secretary told MPs, as she defended the government\u2019s decision not to test individuals entering the country. On Friday, a total of 9,906 people entered the country. Trump claims China will \u2018do anything\u2019 to stop his re-election as coronavirus row escalates The Guardian\u2019s Alison Rourke and Lily Kuo report: Donald Trump has claimed that China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus is proof that Beijing \u201cwill do anything they can\u201d to make him lose his re-election bid in November. In an interview with Reuters, the US president said he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said, without going into detail. Trump has increasingly blamed China for the pandemic and on Wednesday again said Beijing should have let the world know about the coronavirus much sooner. He also speculated about retaliation: \u201cThere are many things I can do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for what happened.\u201d For the first time, Trump linked Beijing to his re-election chances in November. \u201cChina will do anything they can to have me lose this race,\u201d he said, adding that he believed China wants his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, to win the race to ease the pressure on US-China trade relations. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly using public relations to try to make it like they\u2019re innocent parties,\u201d he said of Chinese officials. Podcast: what has the BCG vaccine got to do with Covid-19? Sarah Boseley talks to Prof Helen McShane about why there has been interest in the tuberculosis vaccine and whether it could play a role in protecting us against Covid-19: Papua New Guinea\u2019s health minister, who took the job just a few months before the coronavirus outbreak hit, has spoken about his country\u2019s fight to prepare for Covid-19, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. The Pacific nation just north of Australia is dealing with outbreaks of malaria, dengue fever, drug-resistant tuberculosis and had a recent outbreak of polio. Its health system is notoriously fractured and underfunded. So far there have been eight cases detected in the country of roughly 9 million people, and no deaths. The cases are spread across four regions and the sources of some cases are unknown, sparking fear that there could be widespread undetected community transmission. There are still grave concerns that Papua New Guinea \u2013 which Wong estimates has 600 to 700 doctors, 3,000 hospital beds and just 15 ventilators \u2013 is not set up to cope if the outbreak worsens. \u201cOur biggest problem is PPE gear,\u201d says Wong. \u201cWhen we first started out, we didn\u2019t have any PPE gear in the country \u2026 the National Department of Health [NDOH] was behind the eight ball. We definitely missed the boat a few times when we tried to get PPE gear and we didn\u2019t pay for it in time and we lost out to other countries, the bigger countries.\u201d NHS looks into taking BAME staff off frontline for their safety NHS staff from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds will be given different roles away from the frontline under plans to reduce their disproportionately high death rate from Covid-19. BAME personnel should be \u201crisk-assessed\u201d and reassigned to duties that leave them at lesser risk of contracting coronavirus, under guidance set out by NHS bosses in England. The move was unveiled in a letter sent on Wednesday to hospital trusts, providers of mental health care, ambulance services and organisations providing community-based healthcare. Life is never easy for China\u2019s nearly 300 million migrant workers, but with the coronavirus zapping jobs at a historic clip, life is particularly difficult, AFP reports. The global pandemic will force millions worldwide to spend Friday\u2019s International Workers Day in unemployment and uncertainty. But perhaps nowhere is the pressure felt as keenly as in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, where the Communist Party has long staked its legitimacy on delivering jobs and prosperity in return for public acquiescence to its political monopoly. The situation raises the spectre of millions of angry citizens potentially protesting over their misfortune. At this point, nobody expects mass worker unrest in tightly controlled China, but joblessness is soaring after the economy shrank for the first time in decades in the first three months of the year. China has cancelled the 2020 Boao Forum for Asia, which Beijing is trying to promote as the region\u2019s answer to Davos, due to the coronavirus epidemic, the official China News agency reported on Thursday. The annual conference, initially scheduled for March 24-27, was postponed in early March due to the COVID-19 outbreak, which first emerged late last year in China. The virus has so far killed more than 4,600 and infected nearly 83,000 in mainland China. South Korea reported on Thursday no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its 29 February peak, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. KCDC reported four new infections, all imported cases, taking the national tally to 10,765. The death toll rose by one to 247. More from Japan, where one of the country\u2019s best-known comedians has apologised for suggesting that financial hardship caused by the coronavirus outbreak would force attractive women to work in the commercial sex industry once the crisis is over. Takashi Okamura, one half of the comedy duo Ninety-nine, said he deeply regretted\u201d the remarks, made late last week during his All Night Nippon radio show. The 49-year-old said in a statement that he had made the comments \u201cwithout considering circumstances around the world,\u201d adding they were \u201cextremely inappropriate towards people who are in a tough position\u201d, according to the Kyodo news agency. Okamura had been responding to a listener who complained that he was unable to visit commercial sex establishements during the pandemic. \u201cAfter the coronavirus is over, something fantastic will happen,\u201d Okamura responded. \u201cYou will think, \u2018I\u2019ve never seen girls like this\u2019 ... so please hold on, save your money and spend it (in the sex industry)\u201c once the pandemic has ended. Nippon Broadcasting System, which airs the show, said Okamura\u2019s remarks showed \u201ca lack of understanding of the current coronavirus crisis, as well as a lack of respect for women\u201d. Japan\u2019s government is expected to extend a nationwide state of emergency for another month, local media have reported, after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, described the coronavirus outbreak as \u201csevere\u201d. Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures on 7 April, enabling local governors to request that people avoid unnecessary trips outside and that nonessential businesses close. There are no fines or other penalties for non-compliance, however. The measures, which have since been introduced in all 47 of Japan\u2019s prefectures, were due to stay in place until 6 May \u2013 the end of a series of public holidays known as Golden Week \u2013 but the Nikkei business daily said on Thursday that Abe was poised to extend them by another month. \u201cIt is still very uncertain whether we will be able to say, \u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 on 6 May,\u201d Abe said in parliament on Wednesday, as local leaders voiced concern that infections could spread if people stopped socially distancing and started moving around again. Abe is expected to announce the extension after meeting experts on Friday, the Nikkei said, adding that he would take into account how the virus was spreading, whether people were reducing their contact with others, and the state of the country\u2019s health services. While the number of daily cases in Tokyo appears to have stabilised since a peak of 201 on 17 April, a government official told the newspaper that the apparent slowdown in the capital and other areas did not warrant a relaxation of restrictions. \u201cWe will have a hard time lifting the state of emergency unless we can bring new infections down to 20 or 30 people,\u201dthe official said. Japan has reported just over 14,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 420 deaths. Let\u2019s hear it for the mums: Podcast: Should the UK bail out Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic? Guardian wealth correspondent Rupert Neate looks at why billionaire Sir Richard Branson is asking the UK government to give his Virgin Atlantic airline a \u00a3500m bailout to help it survive the economic fallout of the lockdown. Police were called to a Brooklyn funeral home Wednesday after it resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented truck, the Associated Press reports. Police were called to a Brooklyn neighbourhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said. Investigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official. No criminal charges were brought and the official, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the investigation, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The Andrew T. Cleckley Funeral Home was cited for failing to control the odours. The home was able to obtain a larger, refrigerated truck later in the day, the official said. Workers suited up in protective gear could be seen in the afternoon transferring bodies into the refrigerated truck. New York City funeral homes have struggled as at least 18,000 people have died in the city since late March. The city set up temporary morgues. Hospitals used refrigerated tractor trailers to cart away multiple bodies at a time, sometimes loading them in public view on the sidewalk. Crematoriums have been backed up. Funeral directors across the city have pleaded for help as they have run out of space. A pregnant Native American woman incarcerated in a federal prison in Texas was diagnosed with coronavirus and died in federal custody on Tuesday, officials said. Andrea Circle Bear, 30, had been sentenced to more than two years in prison on a drug charge this January. She delivered her baby by caesarean section while on a ventilator in a Texas hospital on 1 April, and died there on 28 April. Circle Bear\u2019s child survived, but officials declined to provide any additional information on the baby\u2019s condition or where the child is now, \u201cout of respect for the family and for privacy reasons\u201d, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman said. The 30-year-old woman \u201chad a pre-existing medical condition\u201d that made her more at risk for a severe case of coronavirus, according to federal officials, who did not specify what the condition was. Watch as Trump says coronavirus will be \u2018eradicated\u2019 \u2013 while US death toll passes 60,000: \u2018It\u2019s going to leave. It\u2019s going to be gone. It\u2019s going to be eradicated,\u2019 US president Donald Trump said of the coronavirus during a White House round table with business leaders. His comment comes as the number of Americans who have died of coronavirus passed 60,000. Trump was asked if he wanted the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help fast track the use of a closely watched intravenous therapeutic drug, remdesivir, currently undergoing trials for treating Covid-19 patients. \u2018We want everything to be safe, but we would like to see very quick approvals, especially with things that work,\u2019 Trump said. The US\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said that the antiviral drug remdesivir will become the standard of care for Covid-19 after early results showed it helped patients recover more quickly from the illness. President Donald Trump also told Reuters on Wednesday he does not believe opinion polls that show his likely Democratic presidential opponent, Joe Biden, leading in the 2020 race for the White House. During an interview in the Oval Office, the Republican president said he did not expect the election to be a referendum on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and added he was surprised the former vice president was doing well. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the polls,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI believe the people of this country are smart. And I don\u2019t think that they will put a man in who\u2019s incompetent.\u201d In case you missed it: in the interview Trump also said that coronavirus has \u201cupset very badly\u201d the US trade deal with China, and that China \u201cwill do anything they can to have me lose in 2020.\u201d Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Panama reached 6,378 on Wednesday, a rise of 178 from the previous day, and deaths climbed by two to 178, the health ministry said. Director of Epidemiology Lourdes Moreno gave the Central American country\u2019s latest data at a news conference. China meanwhile has again reported zero new deaths from coronavirus. There were four new imported cases, down from 21 the day before, and four local cases, down from 22 the day before. Asymptomatic cases increased by 33 new cases, a higher count than 26 cases the day before. There are currently 82,862 confirmed cases and 4,633 deaths, according to government figures. China is taking more steps indicating it feels the virus is under control. The country\u2019s parliament is to hold its annual meeting from 22 May, and the Forbidden City will reopen on Friday in Beijing. US president Donald Trump, in an Oval Office interview with Reuters, has said he is looking into different options for the consequences China might face for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI can do a lot,\u201d he said. Trump said that coronavirus has \u201cupset very badly\u201d the US trade deal with China, and that China \u201cwill do anything they can to have me lose in 2020.\u201d Trump does not see the 2020 election as being a referendum on his handling of the pandemic, he said. The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa surged past the 5,000 mark on Thursday after it saw the largest single-day jump to date, health ministry figures showed. A total of 354 new cases were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the overall total to 5,350, and the number of fatalities spiked by 10 to 103. \u201cThis is the highest number of cases in a 24 hour cycle recorded to date and represents a 73 percent increase relative to the day before,\u201d said the ministry in a statement. The day before, a total 203 new cases had been reported. South Africa remains the continent\u2019s worst infected country, followed by Egypt. It is due to start gradually easing its strict lockdown regulations from 1 May. The restrictions have been in place since 27 March. China\u2019s Forbidden City will reopen on Friday, three months after it closed due to the coronavirus crisis - the latest signal that the country has brought the disease under control, AFP reports. The sprawling imperial palace sitting across Tiananmen Square was shut down on January 25 as authorities closed tourist attractions and took other extraordinary measures to contain the virus, including locking down an entire province. The Palace Museum, which manages the Forbidden City, announced Wednesday that it will reopen from May 1, with a daily limit of 5,000 visitors - down from 80,000 before the pandemic. Authorities have implemented other measures to reduce risks of infections at the cultural site, which in normal times attracted huge crowds. Visitors will have to wear masks and show health codes on a special mobile phone app that indicates if they are an infection risk before entering. Temperatures will be taken at the entrance and anyone coughing or showing a fever will be turned away. Visitors will have to stand one metre from each other. Within half an hour of the announcement, around 2,500 tickets for 1 May were booked, according to the ticketing website. A top World Health Organization official declined comment on Wednesday on reports that Gilead Science\u2019s remdesivir could help treat Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, but said that further data was needed, Reuters reports. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to make any specific comment on that, because I haven\u2019t read those publications in detail,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, told an online briefing in response to a question, adding it can sometimes take a number of publications to determine a drug\u2019s efficacy. \u201cClearly we have the randomised control trials that are underway both in the UK and US, the \u2018Solidarity trials\u2019 with WHO. Remdesivir is one of the drugs under observation in many of those trials. So I think a lot more data will come out,\u201d he said. Ryan added: \u201cBut we are hopeful this drug and others may prove to be helpful in treating Covid-19.\u201d In case you missed it, here is our full story on the nearly 100 cases of a rare \u2018Covid-linked\u2019 syndrome in children reported in at least six countries. The Guardian\u2019s Ian Sample and Denis Campbell report: Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. The first cases came to light this week when the NHS issued an alert to paediatricians about a number of children admitted to intensive care units with a mix of toxic shock and a condition known as Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder that affects the blood vessel, heart and other organs. So far 19 children have been affected in the UK and none have died. The French health minister, Olivier Veran, said on Wednesday that the country had more than a dozen children with inflammation around the heart, and while there was insufficient evidence to prove a link with coronavirus, he said the cases were being taken \u201cvery seriously.\u201d At least three children in the US aged six months to eight years are being treated for a similar condition. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. A reminder that tips, questions, comments and stories from your part of the world are welcome on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections. Nearly 100 cases of the unusual illness have emerged in at least six countries, with doctors in Britain, the US, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland now reported to be investigating the condition. This worrying news comes as the UK has included deaths outside hospital in its official figure for the first time, bringing the toll to 26,166: higher than France and Spain\u2019s tolls. The official global death toll exceeded 225,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data, with the official toll at 226,771. At least 3,187,919 people have been infected worldwide. Donald Trump has said the federal government will not be extending its coronavirus social distancing guidelines once they expire on Thursday. Meanwhile, the number of Americans who have died of coronavirus surpassed 60,000, a toll far higher than any other country. US drug trial shows \u2018clear cut\u2019 effect, says top medic. While a Chinese trial demonstrated no \u201csignificant clinical benefits\u201d to administering the antiviral drug remdesivir to Covid-19 patients, a separate trial in the US shows a \u201cclear-cut\u201d effect, according to the head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci. More cases of \u2018Covid-linked\u2019 syndrome in children. Doctors around the world have reported more cases of a rare but potentially lethal inflammatory syndrome in children that appears to be linked to coronavirus infections.

Half world\u2019s workers \u2018at risk of unemployment\u2019. The International Labour Organisation has warned that almost half the global workforce \u2013 1.6 billion people \u2013 are in \u201cimmediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed\u201d by the economic impact of Covid-19, Philip Inman, a Guardian economics writer, reports. Official UK death toll up by 4,419, after the government included deaths outside hospital for the first time. As of 5pm on Tuesday, total of 26,097 patients had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to Public Health England. Brazil sees record increase in cases. Brazil has reported a record increase in cases, with its ministry of health confirming 6,276 more infections in a 24-hour period, taking the country\u2019s total to 78,162. Ireland looks set to extend its lockdown, despite growing calls to ease restrictions and salvage the economy.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Wednesday that new cases of Covid-19 infections, deaths and intensive care admissions appeared too high to start relaxing rules that are to expire on 5 May. Swiss government extends ban on large public events. The Swiss government has extended its ban on public events exceeding 1000 people until the end of August, even as it announced the easing of some other restrictions on sporting events, shops, restaurants and museums. Sweden passes 20,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Sweden rose past the 20,000 mark on Wednesday, after the Nordic country reported another 681 infections. Five coronavirus cases have been reported in Aden, southern Yemen, by the country\u2019s internationally recognised government, raising the prospect that the war-ravaged country will soon also have an outbreak of the new disease. China\u2019s parliament is to hold its annual meeting from 22 May - more than two months later than planned. Conditions for holding the meeting have been met as the coronavirus situation has improved, decision makers said. Russia\u2019s coronavirus case tally neared the 100,000 milestone, after the country reported 5,841 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing its overall nationwide tally to 99,399, Reuters reports.
