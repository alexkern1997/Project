      "bodyText": "Trump has reportedly suggested the US coronavirus death count is an exaggeration, even though experts have said the official tally is likely an undercount, considering some people died of the virus without being tested. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany denied the report at her briefing moments ago. McEnany defended Trump\u2019s decision to block Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying before the House. The press secretary described the request from the Democratic-controlled House as a \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d even though Fauci will testify before the Senate next week. Trump said the White House coronavirus task force would \u201ccontinue on indefinitely,\u201d a reversal from his comments yesterday suggesting the group\u2019s work would be winding down. The president said today he \u201chad no idea how popular the task force is.\u201d Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution limiting his ability to take military action against Iran without congressional approval. \u201cThis was a very insulting resolution, introduced by Democrats as part of a strategy to win an election on November 3 by dividing the Republican Party,\u201d the president said. It\u2019s unlikely that either legislative branch will have the two-thirds majority to override Trump\u2019s veto. Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump for pushing to reopen the country, as health experts warn relaxing social distancing restrictions too soon could cause a surge in coronavirus cases. \u201cDeath is not an economic motivator, stimulus, so why are we going down that path?\u201d Pelosi said. The Supreme Court declined to block Pennsylvania\u2019s shutdown order. The justices, echoing an earlier decision from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, affirmed Democratic governor Tom Wolf\u2019s right to shut down most non-essential businesses to limit the spread of the virus. Trump said Dr Rick Bright is a \u201cdisgruntled guy.\u201d Bright has said he was removed from his role overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine after he refused to promote hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment. A migrant detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in California has died from Covid-19, according to the ACLU. \u201cThis is a terrible tragedy, and it was entirely predictable and preventable. For months, public health experts and corrections officials have warned that detention centers would be Petri dishes for the spread of Covid-19 \u2014 and a death trap for thousands of people in civil detention,\u201d said Andrea Flores, the ACLU deputy director of immigration policy. \u201cUnless ICE acts quickly to release far more people from detention, they will keep getting sick and many more will die,\u201d she added. Joe Biden just singled out and praised Amy Klobuchar during a virtual campaign event. Klobuchar is leading \u201cefforts in the United States Senate to provide for the money and the means by which we can have early voting,\u201d Biden said, complementing the Minnesota senator for her work on the issue. Klobuchar looks like a top candidate for Biden\u2019s running mate pick. Here\u2019s an overview of who else could be under consideration: WHO warns of more lockdowns if transition not managed carefully. The director general of the World Health Organization warns of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions \u201cextremely carefully and in a phased approach\u201d. preparedness. Germany eases restrictions but retains \u2018emergency brake\u2019. The country\u2019s top football league, the Bundesliga, is set to resume this month \u2013 one of various restrictions to be lifted as Germans are once again allowed to meet a limited number of friends and family and some shops are allowed to reopen. UK could start easing virus lockdown next week. The British government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, says, adding his hope that some measures could come into force the following day. Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson says \u201cevery death is a tragedy\u201d, calling the statistics \u201cappalling\u201d. Spain extends state of emergency after bitter political dispute. Pred Sanchez\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government secured an extension until 24 May. Congress\u2019s approval for the latest extension of the crisis powers comes after days of bitter rowing and frantic negotiations. Diplomatic split widens amid virus origin row and China shrugs off US claims and calls for focus on beating pandemic. China will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging, its UN ambassador says. China\u2019s foreign ministry says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is wrong to claim he has evidence suggesting the virus originated in a Chinese lab. The US-China relationship is one of disappointment and frustration, the White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has said, highlighting the deepening rift between Washington and Beijing. Sweden nears 3,000 deaths. \u201cWe are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number,\u201d Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, says. The country\u2019s public health agency reports that a total of 23,918 cases have been confirmed and 2,941 deaths recorded; an increase of 87 deaths from the day before. Rather than enforcing a lockdown, Sweden has allowed many businesses to remain open, while asking citizens to keep their distance. Iran warns of \u2018rising trend\u2019 as virus cases top 100,000. Iran records 1,680 new infections, the highest daily figure since 11 April, taking its overall caseload beyond the 100,000 mark. The country\u2019s apparent success in controlling the epidemic has gone into reverse, with a sharp rise in the number of new daily infections over the past four days. \u2018More than 90,000 health workers infected worldwide\u2019. At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally are believed to have been infected, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) says, noting that the the true figure could be as much as twice that. It says more than 260 nurses have died amid reports of continuing shortages of protective equipment, as it urges authorities to keep more accurate records. Follow the Guardian\u2019s global liveblog for more updates: A crowd-sourced tracking tool launched on Wednesday will allow Amazon workers to report and monitor the growing number of coronavirus cases in their facilities, as the company refuses to publicly release comprehensive figures. United for Respect, a worker advocacy group, has released the new system, which will rely on reports from employees to keep a more accurate count of how many workers have been diagnosed with Covid-19. The tool comes as Amazon confirmed the death of a worker in one of its New York warehouses from coronavirus this week and employees demand paid sick leave and protest lack of protection. The company still refuses to share publicly \u2013 or with its employees \u2013 the total number of sick workers at each facility. Workers say Amazon sends them an alert when someone in their workplace is diagnosed with coronavirus, but does not include the total numbers. Not knowing the scale of the pandemic has contributed to growing anxiety in the workplace where employees have become frontline workers, said Courtenay Brown, an Amazon warehouse worker in New Jersey and member of United for Respect said. Senator Richard Burr\u2019s brother-in-law, a Trump appointee, dumped tens of thousands of dollars worth of shares right before the stock market fell due to the coronavirus crisis, per a ProPublica investigation. Gerald Fauth, an appointee on the National Mediation Board, sold between $97,000 and $280,000 worth of shares. Burr, a Republican senator of North Carolina, was found to have sold off between $628,000 and $1.72m of his holdings on 13 Feb. As chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the health committee Burr may have had access to classified information about public health threats. Donald Trump has all but abandoned a public health strategy of societal restrictions to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and opted instead to push for a restart of the US economy. Experts have warned that the move is premature and risks handing a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d to many Americans. The US president has praised governors of states that have started to loosen restrictions on social distancing and business activity, even though he has admitted that people will suffer as a result. \u201cWill some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cBut we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.\u201d Public health experts have pointed out that Covid-19 infections and deaths are mounting dangerously in much of the US. New York has drawn attention as a global hotspot for the virus but has now flattened its rate of infections whereas large parts of the country are still to reach their own peak. When New York is discounted, the US is still on an upward trajectory of new infections. In response to Donald Trump\u2019s veto of a joint resolution aimed at limiting the president\u2019s authority to go to war with Iran, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, the author of the bill, went on Twitter to contrast what the president has said about great nations not fighting \u201cendless wars\u201d with his veto of legislation intended \u201cto help avoid unnecessary war in the Middle East\u201d. Kaine urged Congress to override the veto, but it is highly unlikely that a two-thirds majority would oppose the president. The resolution, passed on 11 March, was passed after the January US drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Suleimani, and a reprisal Iranian missile strike against a base in Iraq which left more than 100 US soldiers with traumatic brain injury. It invokes the War Powers Resolution of 1973 to demand that the president seek authorization from Congress before further hostilities. In vetoing the resolution, Trump said he had authority to carry out the attack on Suleimani by the 2002 Authorization of the Use of Military Force against Iraq passed by Congress in the run-up to the Iraq invasion. Trump\u2019s critics in congress say there is nothing in that authorization to give Trump the right to carry out attacks on Iran. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, initially claimed that Suleimani posed an \u201cimminent threat\u201d to four US embassies in the region, but the administration quietly dropped that argument in a formal justification of the attack to Congress in February. The White House said killing the general was justified as a response to earlier attacks and as a deterrent against future aggression. The bipartisan resolution would rein in his ability to take direct military action against Iran without congressional authorization. \u201cThis was a very insulting resolution, introduced by Democrats as part of a strategy to win an election on November 3 by dividing the Republican Party. The few Republicans who voted for it played right into their hands,\u201d the president said. It\u2019s unlikely that either legislative branch will have the two-thirds majority to override Trump\u2019s veto. Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, has defended Donald Trump\u2019s description of US citizens as \u201cwarriors\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic. When the president used the term on Tuesday, MSNBC host Chris Hayes objected: \u201cI personally don\u2019t think of the folks in say nursing homes as warriors that need to be sacrificed. But what the president seems to be saying is, you\u2019re on your own, thoughts and prayers. Sorry if you were one of those people badly affected. Think of yourself as a soldier dying for the cause.\u201d At her second White House briefing on Wednesday, McEnany denied that Trump was asking Americans to put themselves in harm\u2019s way. \u201cNot in the slightest,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually the opposite. The president\u2019s been clear that, at this moment, we\u2019re at a wartime moment where we\u2019re fighting the invisible enemy and by that I mean Covid-19. \u201cOn the contrary, the notion that the American people are warriors, they\u2019re warriors because they\u2019ve stayed home, they\u2019re warriors because they\u2019ve social distanced, they\u2019re warriors because this mitigation effort is something that could only be done by the American people coming together and making really hard sacrifices.\u201d This got the US to the point of having one of the lowest mortality rates in the world and of reopening its economy, McEnany added. But public health experts have warned that easing the lockdown restrictions too soon could result in a sharp increase in infections and deaths. She also defended the White House\u2019s decision to block infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci from testifying at a House of Representatives committee, accusing Democrats of failing to act in good faith. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time in the middle of a pandemic for publicity stunts,\u201d she said. The press secretary described America\u2019s relationship with China as \u201cone of disappointment and frustration\u201d, accusing Beijing not sharing the genetic sequence of the virus when it could and refusing access to US investigators, putting American lives at risk. Asked to name world leaders who have praised Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic, McEnany reeled off a list of state governors instead. From my vantage point in the briefing room, it struck me as another assured but truth-bending performance from the new press secretary, avoiding controversies that risk stealing the limelight from her boss. Donald Trump\u2019s push to paint the southern border wall black is projected to add at least $500m in costs, according to contracting estimates obtained by the Washington Post. Trump has long advocated for coat the steel bars of the border wall black, despite military commanders and border officials\u2019 warnings that the design change would cost too much both in the short and long term due to maintainence costs. The Post reports: During a border wall meeting at the White House last month amid the coronavirus pandemic, the president told senior adviser Jared Kushner and aides to move forward with the paint job and to seek out cost estimates, according to four administration officials with knowledge of the meeting,\u201d the Post reports. \u201cPOTUS has changed his mind and now wants the fence painted. We are modifying contracts to add,\u201d said one official involved in the construction effort who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired. Trump, during that meeting, directed aides to seek input from North Dakota-based Fisher Sand and Gravel, a company the president favors. Fisher has a $400 million contract to build a section of new barrier in Arizona, an award that is under review by the Department of Defense inspector general. The Post obtained a copy of painting estimates that federal contracting officials produced, and it shows costs ranging from $500 million for two coats of acrylic paint to more than $3 billion for a premium \u201cpowder coating\u201d on the structure\u2019s 30-foot steel bollards, the high end of the options the officials have identified. A U.S. Border Patrol agent sits near the Calexico Port of Entry, where the section of the border fence that is painted black is to the right and the unpainted border fence is to the left. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post) The White House has not yet chosen a grade of paint, but Trump has insisted for years that the barrier should be black to discourage climbers. He has favored a shade known as \u201cflat black\u201d or \u201cmatte black\u201d because of its heat-absorbent properties. Hi, there \u2014 it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast. Even as Donald Trump pivots to a focus on reopening the economy, state governors are the ones who hold much of the power to do so. A new Quinnipiac poll in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut found that voters are on board with a slow, cautious approach. New York\u2019s Andrew Cuomo had a 72 - 24 percent job approval rating, and an 81 - 17 percent approval rating for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. New Jersey\u2019s Phil Murphy had a 68 - 23 percent job approval rating, and a 78 - 18 percent approval rating for his handling of the crisis. Connecticut\u2019s Ned Lamont had a 65 - 26 percent job approval rating, and a 78 - 17 percent approval rating for his handling of the crisis. In each state, Trump\u2019s approval rating lagged at about 36% overall and for his crisis response. The majority of those polled in all three states said it would be safe to lift the stay-at-home orders and reopen businesses in the next few months or even later, rather than immediately. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump has reportedly suggested the US coronavirus death count is an exaggeration, even though experts have said the official tally is likely an undercount, considering some people died of the virus without being tested. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany denied the report at her briefing moments ago. McEnany defended Trump\u2019s decision to block Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying before the House. The press secretary described the request from the Democratic-controlled House as a \u201cpublicity stunt,\u201d even though Fauci will testify before the Senate next week. Trump said the White House coronavirus task force would \u201ccontinue on indefinitely,\u201d a reversal from his comments yesterday suggesting the group\u2019s work would be winding down. The president said today he \u201chad no idea how popular the task force is.\u201d Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump for pushing to reopen the country, as health experts warn relaxing social distancing restrictions too soon could cause a surge in coronavirus cases. \u201cDeath is not an economic motivator, stimulus, so why are we going down that path?\u201d Pelosi said. The Supreme Court declined to block Pennsylvania\u2019s shutdown order. The justices, echoing an earlier decision from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, affirmed Democratic governor Tom Wolf\u2019s right to shut down most non-essential businesses to limit the spread of the virus. Trump said Dr Rick Bright is a \u201cdisgruntled guy.\u201d Bright has said he was removed from his role overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine after he refused to promote hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has defended Donald Trump\u2019s decision to block Dr Anthony Fauci from testifying before the Democrat-led House. The president said he made the move to prevent officials taking questions from \u201ca bunch of Trump haters.\u201d In the briefing McEnany accused the House of attempting to orchestrate a \u201cpublicity stunt\u201d and said Fauci would instead testify before \u201cthe Republican-controlled Senate\u201d where he will also \u201cindeed be asked questions by Democrats.\u201d Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a key member of the government\u2019s coronavirus task force. He is expected to testify on 12 May. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was asked about her comment from February that, \u201cWe will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here. And isn\u2019t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?\u201d Asked whether she would like to retract that comment in light of the current pandemic, McEnany tried to turn it back around on the press, citing some headlines from news outlets that she said downplayed the pandemic. After rattling off a list of headlines, McEnany left the briefing room without taking any more questions. Responding to a question from the Guardian\u2019s David Smith, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany denied that the president believes the coronavirus death toll has been exaggerated. Axios reported earlier today that Trump and some of his advisers have suggested the official tally is an overcount, despite the fact that experts have said there have likely been even more coronavirus deaths because some victims were not tested before dying. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is holding a briefing, her second formal briefing since taking on the role. Taking questions from reporters, the press secretary said the White House coronavirus task force was \u201chere to stay,\u201d but she dodged questions about which official first suggested winding down the group\u2019s work. McEnany also argued that the country needed to be \u201cstrategic with our testing,\u201d specifically saying testing should be expanded in vulnerable communities like nursing homes and meat-packing plants. But she added, \u201cThe notion that everybody needs to be tested is simply nonsensical.\u201d Public health experts have said testing needs to be dramatically ramped up to safely reopen the country. Trump said Dr Rick Bright, the vaccine expert who has said he was demoted for refusing to promote hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment, is a \u201cdisgruntled guy.\u201d \u201cI never met him, I know nothing about him, but he\u2019s a disgruntled guy,\u201d the president told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think disgruntled people should be working for a certain administration.\u201d Bright filed a whistleblower complaint with the office of special counsel yesterday after he was removed from his post as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Bright claimed he was ousted from his role helping to oversee the development of a coronavirus vaccine because he expressed doubts about the hydroxychloroquine. He said he was moved to a smaller role after he \u201cmade clear that BARDA would only invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the COVID-19 pandemic in safe and scientifically vetted solutions and it would not succumb to the pressure of politics or cronyism.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: The news is out: California governor Gavin Newsom has not gotten a haircut since he issued his statewide stay-at-home order in March. His daughter offered to cut it with a pair of craft scissors, Newsom said at his noon press conference, but so far he\u2019s satisfied enough with his grow-out. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious to you that I haven\u2019t had a haircut - I\u2019m embarrassed to be having this conversation publicly,\u201d said the governor. Hair stylists and barbers are among the many Californians out of work as businesses adhere to the statewide order. Some retail businesses will be allowed to start curbside pickup services on Friday. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: California governor Gavin Newsom said the state and national economy are on the brink of \u201cDepression-era\u201d numbers that America will have to overcome on its long march toward recovery. How long it will take to rebound, nobody knows, Newsom said at his daily briefing. \u201cIt will take longer than most people think,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt\u2019s Depression-era numbers. These numbers are jaw-dropping, and it\u2019s alarming. I hope people are preparing themselves for the effort we all need to undertake to get back on our feet.\u201d Since March, a record 4.2 million Californians have applied for unemployment insurance. And many out-of-work employees are not yet fully reflected in state and national unemployment rates. As the economic impacts trickle down, local governments will face tough budget decisions. California has already distributed $10.6 billion in aide to workers \u2014 $2 billion just since Sunday, Newsom said. But some relief could be around the corner. Expected Thursday are clearer guidelines on which businesses will be allowed to open \u2014 and how they\u2019re expected to operate \u2014 as the state enters phase 2 of its plan to reopen. The next phase will see florists, book stores, retailers reopen for curbside pick up. Reopening will be guided by data, Newsom said, and health and safety guidelines will continue to be a priority. Meantime, Newsom reported 95 Californians died in the past 24 hours \u2014 numbers that have ticked up, even while hospitalizations and ICU admissions have improved modestly. \u201cI have all the confidence in the world we\u2019ll recover and be a stronger, smarter society and a more resilient state. But it will take a while. The next few years, we\u2019ll have to work through these challenges. But we have our work cut out for us,\u201d Newsom said. The Supreme Court has decided not to block Pennsylvania governor Tom Wolf\u2019s shutdown order after a group of businesses and a Republican state legislative candidate filed a lawsuit against the order. The plaintiffs argued Wolf\u2019s order, which shut down most non-essential businesses to limit the spread of coronavirus, was causing \u201cunprecedented damage to the economy.\u201d The Pennsylvania Supreme Court previously rejected their request to block the order, and the US Supreme Court has now affirmed that decision. There were no noted dissents in the decision. Trump said Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci would remain on the coronavirus task force in their current roles, while addressing reporters during an Oval Office meeting with the Iowa governor. The president said this morning that the task force would continue its work \u201cindefinitely,\u201d after the vice president confirmed yesterday the White House was looking to wind down the group\u2019s work in the coming weeks. But Trump also said the task force would \u201cadd or subtract people\u201d as necessary, which raised some concerns about whether health experts would be pushed off the team. Trump has reportedly questioned the accuracy of the coronavirus death toll, but health experts on the White House task force have already said such theories are baseless. Last month, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci were asked about Fox News host Tucker Carlson\u2019s suggestion that pneumonia deaths were being miscounted as coronavirus deaths. Other Fox commentators suggested some coronavirus patients had actually died of their preexisting conditions. \u201cThose individuals will have an underlying condition, but that underlying condition did not cause their acute death when it\u2019s related to a covid infection,\u201d Birx said in response to a question about the baseless claims. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d Fauci dismissed such claims as \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d \u201cYou will always have conspiracy theories when you have a very challenging public health crisis. They are nothing but distractions,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cLet somebody write a book about it later on. But not now.\u201d Trump pushed back against a nurse who said access to personal protective equipment had been \u201csporadic\u201d during the coronavirus crisis. Several nurses gathered in the Oval Office this afternoon to witness Trump signing a declaration in honor of National Nurses Day. During the event, Sophia Thomas, president of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, \u201cPPE has been sporadic, but it\u2019s been manageable and we do what we have to do. We are nurses and we adapt.\u201d The president responded to Thomas\u2019 uplifting message by saying, \u201cSporadic for you, but not sporadic for a lot of other people.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting a report emerged today that administration officials privately raised concerns about ongoing shortages of masks, gowns and other medical gear, even as Trump pivots to focus on reopening the economy. Congresswoman slams killing of jogger Massachusetts freshman member of the House, Ayanna Pressley, has tweeted a strong message of outrage against the killing of a jogger in Georgia by shots fired when he ran past a truck occupied by two men. A prosecutor in Georgia said he would ask a grand jury to decide if charges should be filed against a white former law enforcement officer and his son over the fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man as he ran through a small town. The shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery outside Brunswick, Georgia, in February was captured on videotape and posted on social media on Tuesday, stirring outrage over the reluctance of prosecutors to file charges against Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis. This is what Pressley had to say a little earlier. This piece went live just earlier, from the Guardian: Trump said the country may need to accept the reality of additional coronavirus deaths in order to start reopening the country, echoing comments the president made yesterday. \u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 John Roberts when asked if Americans should expect additional deaths as the country looks to reopen. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d The president added, \u201cHopefully that won\u2019t be the case ... but it could very well be the case.\u201d Trump similarly said yesterday while visiting a mask production facility in Arizona, \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d Trump and some of his advisers have reportedly suggested the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll, which surpassed 70,000 yesterday, may be an exaggeration. Axios reports: A senior administration official said he expects the president to begin publicly questioning the death toll as it closes in on his predictions for the final death count and damages him politically. ... The official said Trump has vented that the numbers seem inflated and has brought up New York\u2019s addition of more than 3,000 unconfirmed but suspected COVID-19 cases to its death toll. Some members of the president\u2019s team believe the government has created a distorting financial incentive for hospitals to identify coronavirus cases, the official also said. At the risk of stating the obvious, there is no evidence that the death toll is an exaggeration. Experts have suggested the death toll actually represents an undercount because states have largely not counted those individuals who are suspected to have died of coronavirus but were never tested. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that he did not think it was sustainable to ask Americans to continue staying home to limit the spread of coronavirus. \u201cI don\u2019t think people will stand for it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe country won\u2019t stand for it. It\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d The president later said he would like schools to reopen \u201cwherever possible,\u201d but he acknowledged older teachers would likely not be able teach for a while. Asked why he did not wear a mask yesterday while visiting a mask production facility in Arizona, Trump said, \u201cI had a mask on for a period of time.\u201d The president claimed he wore the mask while away from reporters and only for a brief period of time. Trump also said his administration would continue with legal efforts to invalidate Obamacare, despite concerns that the pending case could further destabilize the healthcare system amid a global pandemic. Trump said that the White House coronavirus task force would be adding two or three members by next week, after the president announced the group would continue working \u201cindefinitely.\u201d The president told reporters in the Oval Office, where he signed a proclamation recognizing National Nurses Day, that the task force would wind down at some point in the future. Asked why he reversed himself from yesterday, when he signaled the task force would move into a different phase, Trump said, \u201cI thought we could wind it down sooner. But I had no idea how popular the task force is until actually yesterday when I started talking about winding down ... It is appreciated by the public.\u201d Republican senator Lindsey Graham signaled he could support additional funding for state and local governments in the next coronavirus relief bill. \u201cNo doubt states have been hit pretty hard,\u201d Graham, a close ally of the president\u2019s, said at the Capitol. \u201cIf it were set up the right way, I think it makes sense.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has expressed skepticism about allocating more funding to states, and Trump said in a tweet yesterday, \u201cWell run States should not be bailing out poorly run States, using CoronaVirus as the excuse!\u201d But other Republican lawmakers have said they are open to giving states more government. Senator Mitt Romney was seen at the Capitol yesterday carrying a poster reading, \u201cBlue states aren\u2019t the only ones getting screwed.\u201d Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said the White House coronavirus task force would \u201ccontinue on indefinitely.\u201d The president\u2019s announcement came one day after the vice president confirmed the White House was looking to wind down the task force in the coming weeks. House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump for pushing to reopen the US economy, as public health experts warn it could lead to a surge in new coronavirus cases. \u201cDeath is not an economic motivator, stimulus, so why are we going down that path?\u201d Pelosi said. New York leaders are warning against other states reopening too quickly. New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York mayor Bill de Blasio both noted that the rest of the country is still seeing a steady rise in the number of coronavirus cases, even as New York and its neighbors are on the descent of their curve of infections. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Democratic speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested the House would not need to subpoena Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, to have him testify before the chamber. \u201cI would hope that Dr Fauci would say things in public that we wouldn\u2019t need him to be subpoenaed,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell. Pelosi\u2019s comments come one day after Trump confirmed Fauci would testify before the Republican-controlled Senate, but not the House, next week. The president claimed it would be unproductive for Fauci to testify in the House because it is full of \u201cTrump haters.\u201d Trump went on to accuse Democrats of wanting the government\u2019s response to coronavirus to fail, citing no evidence for the alarming claim. Pelosi said Trump\u2019s comments were \u201cso beneath the dignity of the office that he holds\u201d and \u201cso distant from the seriousness he should bring to a matter of life and death of so many people in our country.\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi harshly criticized Trump in an MSNBC interview as the president seeks to pivot to focusing on reopening the US economy. The Democratic speaker warned that Trump was jeopardizing Amercans\u2019 health and that his strategy would do nothing to ease the country\u2019s economic distress. \u201cDeath is not an economic motivator, stimulus, so why are we going down that path?\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell. The speaker emphasized that Trump should follow the scientific guidance of experts to determine when the country should start reopening, rather than \u201ccheering people on, going with guns and swastikas to the Michigan legislature and saying these are really good people.\u201d The cutting remark was clearly a reference to Trump expressing support for anti-shutdown protesters who swarmed the Michigan capitol last week, some of them carrying assault rifles as they entered the statehouse. New York leaders are warning that while the state and city are past the initial peak in the coronavirus outbreak, the number of new cases in the rest of the US is still rising. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio warned that other states may be moving too quickly to open up businesses and loosen restrictions on gatherings. \u201cThis desire to restart and open up without necessarily referencing the actual facts of what\u2019s going on is dangerous,\u201d de Blasio said on CNN this morning. At his daily briefing, state governor Andrew Cuomo said that while the number of new cases, hospitalizations and the death toll in New York were coming down, the rate of decline is \u201cpainfully slow\u201d. And he said: \u201cWe have turned the corner, but then you take New York out of the national numbers and the numbers for the rest of the nation are going up.\u201d Cuomo added, during the question and answer session with the media: \u201cYou have states opening up where the numbers are still on the incline, I think that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d New York is still recording 600 new coronavirus cases a day. That\u2019s down from around 1,000 a day during the peak in April and the state recorded 230 Covid-19 deaths on Monday, far lower than the peak of 799 a day on April 8. Cuomo said he had hoped the rates of cases and deaths would have been coming down faster but the number of deaths is \u201cstubborn and most distressing\u201d. The bulk of new cases are still in New York City, largely among the over-50s and disproportionately affecting African-Americans. But he added that most of the new cases were being discovered among those who have been staying at home, largely retired or unemployed. \u201cSo it comes down to personal behavior. What are you doing to protect yourself?\u201d he said, noting that schools, most businesses and cultural sites are shut. Meanwhile De Blasio said earlier that New Yorkers have succeeded in lowering virus infection rates by largely following social distancing orders and by covering their faces in public. \u201cMy message to the rest of the country is learn from how much effort, how much discipline it took to finally bring these numbers down and follow the same path until you\u2019re sure that it\u2019s being beaten back or else if this thing boomerangs you\u2019re putting off any kind of restart or recovery a hell of a lot longer,\u201d he said. As of today, there are 1.2 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US and there have been 71,000 deaths. In some non-coronavirus news: the education department has finalized rules on campus sexual assault allegations that bolster the rights of the accused. The AP reports: The change announced by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos reshapes the way the nation\u2019s schools respond to complaints of sexual misconduct. It is meant to replace policies from the Obama administration that DeVos previously revoked, saying they pressured schools to deny the rights of accused students. \u2018Today we release a final rule that recognizes we can continue to combat sexual misconduct without abandoning our core values of fairness, presumption of innocence and due process,\u2019 she said. \u2018This empowers survivors with more tools than ever before.\u2019 Democrats and education groups had asked DeVos to delay any changes until after the coronavirus pandemic, saying colleges don\u2019t have time to implement new federal rules while they respond to the crisis. Victims rights advocates have already vowed to challenge the new rules in court, ensuring a lengthy legal battle over DeVos\u2019 proposed rules. \u201cBetsy DeVos and the Trump administration are dead set on making schools more dangerous for everyone \u2014 even during a global pandemic,\u201d Fatima Goss Graves, the president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, told the New York Times. \u201cAnd if this rule goes into effect, survivors will be denied their civil rights and will get the message loud and clear that there is no point in reporting assault.\u201d Secretary of state Mike Pompeo was pressed today on his claim on Sunday that there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the Sars-CoV-2 virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory, a claim that was in conflict with statements from Anthony Fauci, the top US scientific voice on the outbreak, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley. The secretary of state got a little testy telling a BBC reporter who had raised the inconsistencies. \u201cYour efforts to try and find, to spend your whole life trying to drive a little wedge between senior American officials, it\u2019s just false,\u201d Pompeo said. He argued that everyone was singing from the same songsheet. \u201dEvery one of those statements is entirely consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to figure out the right answer. We\u2019re all trying to get to clarity. There are different levels of certainty assessed at different places. That\u2019s highly appropriate. People stare at datasets and come to different levels of confidence.\u201d Finally, after more questioning, he repeated his assertion that there was strong evidence of a lab accident, but not before becoming irritable again. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is about the grammar that you can\u2019t get. We don\u2019t have certainty. There is significant evidence that this came from the laboratory. Those statements can both be true.\u201d For context, General Milley has said the evidence of the origins are inconclusive, but the \u201cweight of evidence seems to indicate natural\u201d evolution. Dr Fauci said: \u201cEverything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that it evolved in nature and then jumped species.\u201d The House could reconvene \u201cas early as next week,\u201d Democratic majority leader Steny Hoyer said on a conference call with reporters. Hoyer said the House\u2019s schedule largely depended upon the timing of the next coronavirus relief bill, although Democrats and Republicans remain staunchly divided on the specifics of that package. Hoyer previously said the House would return this week, but he reversed that decision after a consultation with the attending physician of the Capitol, even though the Senate moved forward with its return this week. As House leaders discuss potential remote options for voting, some Republican members are resisting those proposals while simultaneously insisting the chamber must return to session. \u201cPhysical presence is essential to effective, accountable and transparent legislating,\u201d Republican congressman Jim Jordan wrote in a New York Post op-ed published yesterday. Giving a press conference at the state department this morning, Mike Pompeo was asked about the bizarre events in Venezuela over the weekend when opposition activists and two US army veterans staged an abortive raid, supposedly aimed at somehow toppling and even capturing President Nicolas Maduro and other top officials. Pompeo said: \u201cThere was no US government direct involvement in this operation. If we had been involved it would have gone differently.\u201d Unsurprisingly, the word \u201cdirect\u201d is getting a lot of attention from Venezuela watchers on Twitter. The secretary of state added: \u201cAs for who bankrolled it, we\u2019re not prepared to share any more information about what we know took place. We\u2019ll unpack that at the appropriate time. We\u2019ll share that information when it makes good sense.\u201d Asked what was being done to get the two Americans in Venezuelan custody back, Pompeo said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to work on this. ... We will start the process of trying to figure a way - if in fact these are Americans that are there - and that we can figure out a path forward. We want to get every American back. If the Maduro regime decides to hold them, we will use every tool that we have available to try and get them back. It\u2019s our responsibility to do so.\u201d Despite the president\u2019s assurances to the contrary, administration officials still have concerns about potential shortages of medical equipment, as the number of the country\u2019s coronavirus cases continues to steadily rise. Politico reports: [On May 1, Trump\u2019s] own health and emergency management officials were privately warning that states were still experiencing shortages of masks, gowns and other medical gear, according to a recording of an interagency meeting between FEMA and HHS officials across the country, conducted by conference call, which was obtained by POLITICO. Trump\u2019s federal \u2018Stay at Home\u2019 guidelines had quietly expired the night before, leaving states to manage the pandemic as they saw fit. The officials also expressed concern that governors moving to reopen their economies while cases were still prevalent threatened to plunge the nation into a new and potentially deadlier chapter of the outbreak. \u2018The numbers of deaths definitely will be high,\u2019 Daniel Jernigan, director of the Center for Disease Control\u2019s influenza division, said at the start of a May 1 conference call. Jernigan did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Minutes later, another official underscored the risk facing the U.S.: If all the states moved to lift their social distancing restrictions, hospitals nationwide could see a surge of new coronavirus cases, creating the potential for severe ventilator shortages within weeks. \u2018If, at the end of stay-at-home orders, you were to lift everything and go back to normal business, and not have any community mitigation, you would expect to see in the second week in May we begin to increase again in ventilator uses,\u2019 the official said. \u2018Which means cases increase, and by early June, we surpass the number of ventilators we currently have.\u2019 Trump and his allies have taken to bragging about the country\u2019s increased production of ventilators since the start of the crisis, even as many states\u2019 focus has shifted to expanding testing capacity. But the report of the call is a reminder that the country still risks a shortage of ventilators if social distancing restrictions are relaxed too quickly and the country sees a subsequent surge in new infections. Americans are nearly evenly divided over whether they believe the sexual assault allegation against Joe Biden, even as he widens his lead over Donald Trump amid criticism of the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. According to a new survey by Monmouth University, 37% say the allegation is probably true, 32% say it is probably not true, and 31% have no opinion. The poll, which was taken after Biden emphatically denied the allegation in an interview on MSNBC, found that an overwhelming majority \u2013 86% \u2013 of Americans had heard about the allegation brought by Tara Reade, who has accused him of sexually assaulting her when she worked as an aide in his Senate office in the early 1990s. Perhaps unsurprisingly, opinion on the validity of the claim breaks sharply along partisan lines. Half of Republicans say the allegation is probably true while just 17% say it is likely not true, the poll found. Meanwhile, 55% of Democrats say the claim against their party\u2019s presumptive nominee is probably not true compared with 20% who say it probably is true. Among independents voters, 43% say they feel the allegation is true, compared with 22% who say it\u2019s not and 35% who have no opinion either way. Men were slightly more likely than women to believe the allegation against Biden, 39% compared with 35%. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what impact this allegation will have in the long run. For some voters who believe the charge, it is still not enough to override their desire to oust Trump,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. \u201cThe outlook is murkier for those who don\u2019t have an opinion on it.\u201d The same poll found that those who don\u2019t believe the allegation overwhelmingly support Biden. But among voters who believe it is true, 59% support Trump while 32% still support Biden. And among voters who have no opinion on the allegation\u2019s validity, 45% support Trump and 43% support Biden. Monmouth didn\u2019t conduct a national polling asking voters whether they believed the allegation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. But an NPR poll taken after Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanugh testified found that 45% believed Ford was telling the truth compared to 33% who believed Kavanaugh. This comes as a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll released on Tuesday found that more than a third of voters believe Democrats should replace Biden as their nominee over the recent claims from the former Senate aide that date back to the early 1990s. Yet despite a spate of coverage over the allegation, Biden has grown his lead over Trump in recent months. According to the survey, Biden leads Trump 50% to 41% among registered voters, with 3% saying they would cast a ballot for the independent candidate and 5% are undecided. In April, Biden led Trump 48% to 44% which was similar to the spread in March, which showed Biden ahead by 48% to 45%. US companies lost more than 20 million jobs in April, according to the latest numbers from the ADP Research Institute. April\u2019s job losses are the worst in the history of the ADP report, which has compiled information on the country\u2019s private payrolls since 2002. The data only reflects job losses reported through the 12th of the month, so it does not capture all of the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the past month. The report precedes the release of Friday\u2019s jobs report, which is expected to show the unemployment rate climbing to 16%, up from 4.4% in the March report. More than 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks, and a third of Americans say their households have seen a job loss or wage decrease since the crisis started. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo reportedly plans to travel to Israel next week, marking the cabinet member\u2019s first international trip since coronavirus was declared a pandemic. Axios reports: Pompeo is expected to arrive next Tuesday and return to Washington the next day, Israeli officials tell me. The trip would come days before Israel\u2019s new government is slated to be sworn in, and Pompeo is expected to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, his rival-turned-coalition-partner. It\u2019s unclear why Pompeo is planning to travel in person, or how the visit could be impacted by Israel\u2019s social distancing restrictions and emergency regulations which demand that any person arriving from abroad enter 2 weeks of confinement. Speaking moments ago at a press conference, Pompeo declined to confirm the Israel trip but said an announcement would be made soon. If Pompeo does make the trip, he will almost certainly face questions about the safety and necessity of international travel at this point in time. Congress continues to adjust to the realities of social distancing, with lawmakers wearing masks and gloves and trying to maintain physical distance from colleagues. A photo from a House subcommittee hearing on the coronavirus response today showed desks spread several feet apart in order to limit the potential spread of the virus. The Senate has already returned to session, and the full House is expected to return next week. Signs have been placed around the Capitol reminding those present to observe social distancing guidelines. The White House\u2019s discussions about winding down the coronavirus task force are a reflection of how Trump is trying to shift the focus to reopening the US economy, even as the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll continues to climb. Hours after the US death toll surpassed 70,000 yesterday, the president said of the country reopening, \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.\u201d The comments raised concerns that Trump was expressing a willingness to sacrifice Americans\u2019 health for the sake of the economy. The president\u2019s announcement this morning that the White House coronavirus task force will continue indefinitely is almost certainly a reaction to those concerns. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, initially denied reports that the White House was looking to wind down its coronavirus task force. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Fauci initially said yesterday. \u201cI\u2019ve been in every task force meeting, and that\u2019s not what they are doing.\u201d When the vice president confirmed the news shortly afterwards, it seemed Fauci (and potentially other public health experts on the task force) had been left out of the loop on the conversations. Trump is now saying the task force will \u201ccontinue on indefinitely,\u201d but the president noted the group \u201cmay add or subtract people ... to it, as appropriate,\u201d raising questions about whether Fauci\u2019s role with the group will change. Fauci, who serves as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become a household name since the coronavirus crisis started, and polls show a large majority of Americans trust Fauci as a source of information on the pandemic, while the president has received low ratings on that front. The New York Times was the first to report yesterday that the White House was looking to wind down its task force in the coming weeks, sparking concerns that the Trump administration was trying to sideline public health experts as the president shifts his focus to reopening the economy. Vice President Mike Pence quickly confirmed the report, telling reporters yesterday, \u201cI think we\u2019re having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level. Pence said the administration was looking at Memorial Day or early June as a potential \u201cwindow\u201d to start winding down the group. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve already begun to talk about a transition plan with FEMA,\u201d the vice president added. When asked about Pence\u2019s comments, Trump said, \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at phase two and we\u2019re looking at other phases ... the task force has done a phenomenal job.\u201d This morning\u2019s tweet thread from the president indicates the task force\u2019s work will continue, although its members and focus may change. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Joanna Walters. Trump has just announced over Twitter that the White House coronavirus task force will \u201ccontinue on indefinitely,\u201d despite the vice president\u2019s comments yesterday that it would start to wind down in the coming weeks. In a tweet thread this morning, the president said the task force had done a \u201cfantastic job\u201d addressing the coronavirus crisis. \u201cBecause of this success, the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe may add or subtract people ... to it, as appropriate. The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics.\u201d Good morning, US live blog readers, Donald Trump is back at the White House after his trip to Arizona yesterday and there\u2019s another very full day ahead in US politics and the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Here\u2019s what we know so far: There is widespread public outrage and dismay at the news that the Trump administration plans to wind down its coronavirus taskforce. We\u2019ll bring you further details. Twitter is alight. This as a well-sourced new map from the news site Axios shows new cases of coronavirus are rising steeply in Minnesota, Nebraska and Puerto Rico and also increasing in many other states across the midwest and southwest. Numbers are stable in some and decreasing in just a handful of states. New White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany will hold her second official briefing at the WH at 4pm ET today. The Guardian will attend. The US supreme court continues hearing oral arguments remotely, by telephone, today in the case of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to undermine attempt the so-called contraceptive mandate, the element of \u201cObamacare\u201d legislation on health care that requires employer-covered health insurance to include birth control. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will participate, despite being in hospital for treatment of an infection resulting from a gallstone.",

      "bodyText": "Premiers in Australia\u2019s two most populous states have warned that social distancing restrictions will not be eased before Mother\u2019s Day, despite Queensland\u2019s decision to allow up to five members to visit a household from Sunday. The Morrison government this week has attempted to build the case for opening up the economy by pointing to the accumulating costs of the restrictions, and Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting is expected to try to land a timetable for easing the lockdowns implemented to try and flatten the curve of Covid-19 infections. But before Friday\u2019s deliberation, premiers in New South Wales and Victoria have warned that Australia risks throwing away the successful containment of the pandemic. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, expressed his reservations in stark language: \u201cWe would all like to get back to normal and we will get there faster if we follow the evidence \u2013 if we don\u2019t fritter away all the gains we\u2019ve made. \u201cI cannot be clearer, the worst possible outcome sort of this getting away from us and the New York and London scenes \u2013 the worst possible outcome is we open this up too quickly, we have more and more outbreaks, and we have to close everything down again.\u201d Andrews didn\u2019t rule out announcements after Friday\u2019s meeting but said Victoria had always been working to a timetable of reassessment after 11 May. He said Australia had to stay the course and not let frustration \u201cget the better of us\u201d. \u201cThere are parts of the world that let off restrictions very early \u2013 they thought they had beaten it, turned out they hadn\u2019t,\u201d the premier said. \u201cThey now have even stricter lockdowns in place than they ever had, before they let their frustrations get the better of them, perhaps, and changed the settings.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said it was very unlikely she would be in a position to ease current restrictions before Sunday: \u201cI doubt that NSW will be in a position to implement anything before Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d She said: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a spike in cases that exceeds what we can manage.\u201d The objective was to return to normal \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. \u201cI suspect by the end of June, life will feel much more normal than it does now and even during May, life will feel much more normal,\u201d Berejiklian said. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, meanwhile, said that from Sunday: \u201cWe will be allowing up to five members to visit a household right across Queensland.\u201d In an effort to persuade the premiers to move faster, Scott Morrison declared on Tuesday that Australia had flattened the curve of coronavirus infections, so the next challenge was flatten the curve of unemployment. The prime minister said: \u201cWe now need to get a million Australians back to work. That is the curve we need to address.\u201d Morrison said the lockdowns had bought valuable time to fortify the health system in the event there was a second wave of infections. The premiers would need to explain to residents in their jurisdictions why they were persisting with lockdowns if other states moved to ease them, he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, every premier, every chief minister has to stand in front of their state and justify the decisions that they\u2019re taking in terms of the extent of the restrictions that are in place \u2013 the trade-off that they\u2019re making between people having jobs and the impact on the containment of the coronavirus.\u201d NSW and Victoria \u2013 states with the highest number of coronavirus infections \u2013 led the lockdowns of non-essential services in March, and it has been a consistent dynamic inside the group that the two most populous states are more strongly in favour of restrictions than some of the smaller states. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told reporters on Thursday there would continue to be outbreaks of Covid-19 infections. \u201cSo we need to be prepared for this. We warned about it previously, but I\u2019ll continue to say, as we go forwards, there will be cases of outbreaks or spikes, and that\u2019s why our testing, our tracing and our public health responses and our immediate rapid response capability are so critical and are being put in place.\u201d Hunt said it was important to maintain social distancing and hand hygiene as the restrictions \u201ccautiously, gradually\u201d lifted.",

      "body": "<p>A woman who was in a dispute on a Rose Bay Facebook group has been ordered to pay the administrator of a rival Facebook group $35,000 in damages for defamation.</p> <p>The Rose Bay Community \u2013 Official Group had been running for seven years and grew to more than 5,500 members, mainly women, sharing information about events in the suburb.</p> <p>In November last year, Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/sydney-facebook-group-shut-down-defamation-threats-rose-bay\">reported the Sydney-based community group was forced to shut down</a> after receiving a concerns notice from the administrator of a rival group, Bruce Goldberg.</p> <p>Goldberg is a voice-over artist who is the administrator of the rival Rose Bay Community \u2013 Original And Official, Ad Free group - now known as the Rose Bay, Bondi, Vaucluse, Double Bay Community Group, which has more than 3,900 members.</p> <p>There had been a long running dispute over the management of the larger group, which was mostly used to discuss events in the area, lost pets and other local issues.</p> <p>Goldberg took one of the members of the group, Alice Voigt, to court over a November 2018 post in which she alleged Goldberg was \u201cintimidating, bullying and threatening\u201d women on the group.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/nov/24/australias-unworkable-defamation-laws-what-the-governments-changes-could-mean\">Australia\u2019s \u2018unworkable\u2019 defamation laws: what the government\u2019s changes could mean</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goldberg said he was shocked and speechless when he read the post, noting that he had several people point out the post to him.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t think straight. I thought my reputation to be totally damaged and my credibility\u2019s gone down the tube and there was not much I could do about it. It\u2019s too late, too many people have seen and it was just I felt a lot of hurt, a lot of hurt and I still do.\u201d</p> <p>His cousin reported hearing the matter brought up at a dinner party, among people who did not know her family relation to Goldberg.</p> <p>Voigt unsuccessfully argued she attempted to make amends, but the court found it wasn\u2019t done within 28 days of the statement of claim being presented to her. She lodged no other defence.</p> <p>Her lawyers argued the defamation was on the lower end of the spectrum due to the limited audience in the group, and that it was deleted in March last year.</p> <p>The NSW district court on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/5ea66751e4b0f66047ed8d74\">ordered Voigt</a> to pay Goldberg $35,000 in damages for the post.</p> <p>In his judgment, district court judge Richard Weinstein said it was on the lower end of damage to Goldberg\u2019s reputation.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough the imputations are serious, it is clear from the evidence that the number of people who have likely viewed the post (it having been removed on or about 7 March 2019) is limited, and very much less than had it, for example, been published on a newspaper website,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Goldberg was ordered to pay Voigt $8,000 in costs for a separate matter.</p> <p>Goldberg said he was still considering the judgement in detail.</p> <p>Voigt said she was also considering the judgment, but said defamation law needed to change.</p> <p>\u201cI think the judge was very fair. But he has to operate within an antiquated structure of the defamation laws.

      "bodyText": "A woman who was in a dispute on a Rose Bay Facebook group has been ordered to pay the administrator of a rival Facebook group $35,000 in damages for defamation. The Rose Bay Community \u2013 Official Group had been running for seven years and grew to more than 5,500 members, mainly women, sharing information about events in the suburb. In November last year, Guardian Australia reported the Sydney-based community group was forced to shut down after receiving a concerns notice from the administrator of a rival group, Bruce Goldberg. Goldberg is a voice-over artist who is the administrator of the rival Rose Bay Community \u2013 Original And Official, Ad Free group - now known as the Rose Bay, Bondi, Vaucluse, Double Bay Community Group, which has more than 3,900 members. There had been a long running dispute over the management of the larger group, which was mostly used to discuss events in the area, lost pets and other local issues. Goldberg took one of the members of the group, Alice Voigt, to court over a November 2018 post in which she alleged Goldberg was \u201cintimidating, bullying and threatening\u201d women on the group. Goldberg said he was shocked and speechless when he read the post, noting that he had several people point out the post to him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think straight. I thought my reputation to be totally damaged and my credibility\u2019s gone down the tube and there was not much I could do about it. It\u2019s too late, too many people have seen and it was just I felt a lot of hurt, a lot of hurt and I still do.\u201d His cousin reported hearing the matter brought up at a dinner party, among people who did not know her family relation to Goldberg. Voigt unsuccessfully argued she attempted to make amends, but the court found it wasn\u2019t done within 28 days of the statement of claim being presented to her. She lodged no other defence. Her lawyers argued the defamation was on the lower end of the spectrum due to the limited audience in the group, and that it was deleted in March last year. The NSW district court on Thursday ordered Voigt to pay Goldberg $35,000 in damages for the post. In his judgment, district court judge Richard Weinstein said it was on the lower end of damage to Goldberg\u2019s reputation. \u201cAlthough the imputations are serious, it is clear from the evidence that the number of people who have likely viewed the post (it having been removed on or about 7 March 2019) is limited, and very much less than had it, for example, been published on a newspaper website,\u201d he said. Goldberg was ordered to pay Voigt $8,000 in costs for a separate matter. Goldberg said he was still considering the judgement in detail. Voigt said she was also considering the judgment, but said defamation law needed to change. \u201cI think the judge was very fair. But he has to operate within an antiquated structure of the defamation laws. They were designed in the 19th century, and we live in the 21st,\u201d she said. \u201cI have learned to stay off social media, and not to get involved in community boards or disputes. My Facebook post was read by just a few people and yet the defamation laws treat it like it was on the front page of a national newspaper. \u201cSurely this needs to change. I hope now to put all this behind me, steer clear of incendiary debates on social media and look after my two beautiful children.\u201d The original Rose Bay group shut down in November last year, with administrator Bianca Havas citing a settlement reached with Goldberg to shut down the group and not start another one, after she received a concerns notice over alleged defamatory material in the group. Before the coronavirus pandemic, attorney general Christian Porter flagged an overhaul of defamation law to make it more difficult for what he called \u201cneighbourhood disputes\u201d such as these to go to court. \u201cNow, there\u2019s a balance there to be struck between people having the right to defend their reputation, but not clogging up the courts with stuff where there isn\u2019t any actual, realistic, quantifiable damage to a reputation done simply because something was said in a neighbourhood dispute which was mean-spirited amongst neighbours,\u201d he said in November last year. The changes were planned to be brought in around July this year. Guardian Australia has sought comment from Porter on the status of the reforms.",

      "bodyText": "Government authorities have detected a \u201csophisticated\u201d alleged fraud of early access to superannuation, which may have deprived up to 150 Australians of $120,000 of retirement savings. On Thursday, Treasury, the tax office and the Australian federal police fronted the Covid-19 Senate inquiry to discuss the integrity of $194bn in three tranches of stimulus. The Australian Taxation Office commissioner, Chris Jordan, confirmed \u201csome limited fraudulent activity has been identified and immediately acted upon\u201d in relation to impersonation to defraud workers of retirement savings. The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said the alleged fraud was the result of \u201can intrusion into a third party\u201d, which was not a government agency. He accepted that organised crime and offshore actors were \u201cpossibilities\u201d the AFP was investigating. Kershaw said the alleged fraud was detected by financial intelligence agency Austrac, which informed the ATO, resulting in a referral to the AFP on 1 May. Kershaw said the AFP had executed five search warrants and frozen $120,000 in bank accounts but there had been no arrests. A brief went to Morrison government ministers on 6 May, but no directions to improve the integrity of the program have been made. Jeremy Hirschhorn, the ATO\u2019s second commissioner, said ministers had \u201cexhorted us to do our best\u201d but had not suggested specific responses. The committee heard that 1.1 million Australians have applied for access to superannuation, with $9.4bn of retirement savings approved for early release. The AFP has established Taskforce Iris to investigate whether organised crime or others are seeking to defraud Covid-19 economic response measures. In his opening statement, Kershaw said that a western Sydney man had been arrested for \u201callegedly submitting claims for a range of government benefits, designed to assist members of the community affected by Covid-19 and bushfires\u201d. \u201cHe used assumed 11 identities and 53 fictitious identities to submit 68 claims for government benefits \u2026 [the] total value of claims exceeded $70,000.\u201d Kershaw said the man had been charged with \u201ca range of commonwealth offences, including obtaining a financial advantage by deception\u201d. Kershaw said the taskforce had received seven referrals, including the one that resulted in charges, three finalised matters and three currently under investigation, including one matter involving the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper payment. \u201cThe reason we\u2019ve created that taskforce is we anticipate more referrals,\u201d he said. Earlier, Jordan said \u201cwhenever cash is given out you\u2019ll get an element of criminality and attempts to access that cash\u201d. Kershaw told the committee that certain categories of crime had increased during the Covid-19 crisis, including the prevalence of child abuse material on the dark web, burglaries and family violence. However, homicides were down and drug prices had increased, a sign of decreased supply. Asked about the progress of an investigation into AFP recruits who broke social distancing rules, Kershaw revealed that 76 recruits were investigated and 53 were sanctioned, including two who were given show cause notices. \u201cThey\u2019ve had the cane well and truly, and beyond that,\u201d he said. Jenny Wilkinson, Treasury\u2019s deputy secretary of the fiscal group, told the committee that more than $15bn of stimulus has already been paid including: Jobseeker payments with the coronavirus supplement. $5.2bn in $750 payments to households. $7.5bn for cashflow boost to small businesses. $2.4bn of jobkeeper wage subsidies. Wilkinson said that 768,000 employers had registered for jobkeeper, covering up to 5 million workers. She said the \u201cdemand-driven\u201d program was broadly on track to reach Treasury\u2019s estimates of 6 million workers, and noted that the deadline to receive payments for April had been extended to 31 May. ATO officials said that its hotline for alleged jobkeeper fraud had received 1,160 tip-offs with a further 2,000 \u201ccalls of concern\u201d.",

She lives and works in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, a few blocks away from where she was raised by her father, Elian, a social worker who escaped Castro\u2019s Cuba in 1958, and her mother, Eleanor, a secretary at a Manhattan hospital who came from an African American family in Chicago.</p> <p>She took to photography young. Bed-bound with flu one winter, Simpson cut out and saved up coupons from boxes of Kleenex tissues for a promotional Polaroid camera. Her first portraits were of her beagle collie. Simpson studied photography in New York before starting out as a documentary photographer, travelling around Europe and north Africa with her boyfriend.</p> <p>\u201cWe had clothes, cameras and film, and all we did was take photographs,\u201d she says. Soon after, her then boyfriend became a member of Magnum, and Simpson met such doyens as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/24/magnum-photographer-josef-koudelka-holy-land-israel-palestine-documentary\">Josef Koudelka</a>. \u201cI got to really see the formal mechanisms of street photography,\u201d she says. \u201cI got to understand the industry of it, the kind of people that worked in it. And I found the way their work was interpreted was so different from the way they lived their lives. I felt there was more I wanted to say with photography.\u201d</p> <p>Simpson was doing graphic design for a travel company when she met <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/oct/30/carrie-mae-weems-best-photograph\">Weems</a>, who told her of a performance-based graduate art class at the University of California in San Diego. \u201cI needed a change of scene,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cIt was a cold, sleety New York evening. When Carrie started talking about the Californian beach, I was sold.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI remember getting a brochure \u2013 and that being the only impression I had of the entire place. I went on a lark.\u201d</p> <p>In San Diego, she started focusing on the portraits of black women she saw in magazines, in stories as well as adverts. She would cut them out and use them in collages, adding suggestive phrases from elsewhere in the magazines. This early work, Simpson says, came from a dawning interest in \u201chow society regulates our bodies and how we think about ourselves\u201d.</p> <p>How did these pictures go down? \u201cNo one really understood the kind of work I was making,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cIt was met with a lot of silence.\u201d But back in New York, she attracted immediate attention. \u201cThere was a huge response, it was like night and day. Suddenly I found this really engaged conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Simpson\u2019s early creations were astonishingly forthright. She remembers, while enduring temporary work in a large office, creating Five Day Forecast. In this collage, the image of a cross-armed woman in a plain dress is repeated five times, her head cropped off in each case and a day of the week \u2013 Monday to Friday \u2013 taking its place. Below runs a series of words: misinformation, misidentify, mistranslate. They are, clearly, a pun on \u201cmiss\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"920aa3f37ecc4379f571c65f3bb4c21896828350\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/920aa3f37ecc4379f571c65f3bb4c21896828350/77_86_3507_4477/783.jpg\" alt=\"Poise \u2026 Construction (detail) by Lorna Simpson.\" width=\"783\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poise \u2026 Construction (detail) by Lorna Simpson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Lorna Simpson, courtesy the artist and Hauser &amp; Wirth/James Wang</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A little later, she made Untitled (Two Necklines), in which two black female necklines are positioned on either side of a column of words: \u201cring, surround, lasso, noose, eye, areola, halo, cuffs, collar, loop\u201d. Below this is a red plaque that reads \u201cfeel the ground sliding from under you\u201d, a phrase that suggests lynching. Then came C-Rations in 1991, which juxtaposed a paper plate reading \u201cnot good enough\u201d with the body of a black woman branded with the phrase: \u201cBut good enough to serve.\u201d</p> <p>As Simpson\u2019s star rose, her art softened and took on more emotional nuance. A series from 2009 comprised images Simpson sourced from eBay. \u201cI found hundreds of original \u2018pin-ups\u2019 a woman had taken of herself in Los Angeles in 1959,\u201d she says. \u201cI was captivated by this young black woman living during the Jim Crow era who had this aspiration of being a movie star \u2013 of being photographed, of performing for the camera. I decided to extend her project.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, shortly after her father\u2019s death, Simpson remembers sorting through boxes of yellowed Ebony and Jet magazines that had once belonged to her grandmother. \u201cAs a child,\u201d she says, \u201cthey were in almost every household. I found myself looking at these older magazines, thinking about the way they spoke to a black audience, how they have become a marker of time and thought. And I just started to play with them.\u201d</p> <p>Simpson screenprinted vintage portraits from the magazines on to clay-board and fibreglass panels. \u201cAnd then I got a ton of ink together,\u201d she says with a laugh, \u201cand I decided to experiment. I just went into a whirlwind of working.\u201d</p> <p>The Nigerian curator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/22/okwui-enwezor-nigerian-curator-confronted-european-art\">Okwui Enwezor</a> included Simpson\u2019s first five paintings, which measured more than nine-feet tall, in the 2015 Venice Biennale. Shortly afterwards, he died of cancer. It drove Simpson to delve further into this new form. She allowed herself to work expressively and largely on instinct, with little sense of how each piece might turn out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"08b45c0d568ba4170847b76317a5c5075ed0459f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08b45c0d568ba4170847b76317a5c5075ed0459f/209_359_2180_1261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Working on instinct \u2026 Flames by Lorna Simpson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"578\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Working on instinct \u2026 Flames by Lorna Simpson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Lorna Simpson, courtesy the artist and Hauser &amp; Wirth/James Wang</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The results are perhaps Simpson\u2019s most accomplished to date: the pin-sharp faces of poised black women from long ago stare out beneath roiling indigo skies, glacial landscapes and churning seas. When Simpson showed them in her home city, she spoke to the New York Times about the difficulties of being seen only as a black artist: \u201cJust as the Caucasian figure in contemporary art is seen as universal,\u201d she said, \u201cthe black figure of African descent should be too.\u201d</p> <p>Is it frustrating to still have to point this out? \u201cNothing surprises me any more,\u201d she says. \u201cIn America, there are refusals to understand or acknowledge that things are far more complicated than we would like them to be. Any society, or self, constructed to always separate itself from the other is doomed.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Any society, or self, constructed to always separate itself from the other is doomed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In LA, Simpson is \u201cslowly edging back to work\u201d. She will drift downstairs in the morning to find her daughter Zora, who will soon graduate from Columbia University, plugged into her laptop. \u201cShe has much more of a schedule than me,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cBut I\u2019m spending every day trying to make something.\u201d The Covid-19 crisis has, she says, had a deep impact on her. \u201cThere are days when I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got this.\u2019 And there are days when I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s the fourth time I\u2019ve cried for an hour.\u201d</p> <p>We\u2019re speaking on the day President Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">suggested American citizens could inject themselves with bleach</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s an insanity to the US government\u2019s response,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s breathtakingly ignorant and dangerous.\u201d Simpson has already lost close friends, including the critic and art historian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/new-york-coronavirus-culture\">Maurice Berger</a>, to the virus. \u201cAll these waves of death,\u201d she says. </p> <p>Simpson began her career just as New York was at the centre of the Aids epidemic. She lost friends to the disease and saw others who had it stigmatised. \u201cThe Aids crisis was very similar to now \u2013 all the misconceptions, all the negative responses.\u201d She remembers it as a time when \u201cvictims were vilified, families would disown their children. Someone would die and half the time there wasn\u2019t a funeral. But I wouldn\u2019t say anything has prepared me for now.\u201d</p> <p>America is in a unique state of denial, Simpson believes. \u201cThere was a lot of ignorance during the 1980s. Now we\u2019re seeing the spectre of that again. The lack of compassion. People\u2019s refusal to face science. The level of governmental ignorance \u2013 of power based on ignorance \u2013 has endangered people\u2019s lives, literally.\u201d</p> <p>Can anything good come out of this? \u201cSo many things will change after coronavirus, and we will learn a lot of things scientifically,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cBut do we have the wherewithal and the strength to start thinking of everyone, rather than further disintegrate into clans and tribes?\u201d She pauses. \u201cI think we need to.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.vip-hauserwirth.com/lorna-simpson-give-me-some-moments/\">Lorna Simpson: Give Me Some Moments is at Hauser &amp; Wirth\u2019s website</a></p></li> </ul>",

Soon after, her then boyfriend became a member of Magnum, and Simpson met such doyens as Josef Koudelka. \u201cI got to really see the formal mechanisms of street photography,\u201d she says. \u201cI got to understand the industry of it, the kind of people that worked in it. And I found the way their work was interpreted was so different from the way they lived their lives. I felt there was more I wanted to say with photography.\u201d Simpson was doing graphic design for a travel company when she met Weems, who told her of a performance-based graduate art class at the University of California in San Diego. \u201cI needed a change of scene,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cIt was a cold, sleety New York evening. When Carrie started talking about the Californian beach, I was sold.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI remember getting a brochure \u2013 and that being the only impression I had of the entire place. I went on a lark.\u201d In San Diego, she started focusing on the portraits of black women she saw in magazines, in stories as well as adverts. She would cut them out and use them in collages, adding suggestive phrases from elsewhere in the magazines. This early work, Simpson says, came from a dawning interest in \u201chow society regulates our bodies and how we think about ourselves\u201d. How did these pictures go down? \u201cNo one really understood the kind of work I was making,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cIt was met with a lot of silence.\u201d But back in New York, she attracted immediate attention. \u201cThere was a huge response, it was like night and day. Suddenly I found this really engaged conversation.\u201d Simpson\u2019s early creations were astonishingly forthright. She remembers, while enduring temporary work in a large office, creating Five Day Forecast. In this collage, the image of a cross-armed woman in a plain dress is repeated five times, her head cropped off in each case and a day of the week \u2013 Monday to Friday \u2013 taking its place. Below runs a series of words: misinformation, misidentify, mistranslate. They are, clearly, a pun on \u201cmiss\u201d. A little later, she made Untitled (Two Necklines), in which two black female necklines are positioned on either side of a column of words: \u201cring, surround, lasso, noose, eye, areola, halo, cuffs, collar, loop\u201d. Below this is a red plaque that reads \u201cfeel the ground sliding from under you\u201d, a phrase that suggests lynching. Then came C-Rations in 1991, which juxtaposed a paper plate reading \u201cnot good enough\u201d with the body of a black woman branded with the phrase: \u201cBut good enough to serve.\u201d As Simpson\u2019s star rose, her art softened and took on more emotional nuance. A series from 2009 comprised images Simpson sourced from eBay. \u201cI found hundreds of original \u2018pin-ups\u2019 a woman had taken of herself in Los Angeles in 1959,\u201d she says. \u201cI was captivated by this young black woman living during the Jim Crow era who had this aspiration of being a movie star \u2013 of being photographed, of performing for the camera. I decided to extend her project.\u201d In 2010, shortly after her father\u2019s death, Simpson remembers sorting through boxes of yellowed Ebony and Jet magazines that had once belonged to her grandmother. \u201cAs a child,\u201d she says, \u201cthey were in almost every household. I found myself looking at these older magazines, thinking about the way they spoke to a black audience, how they have become a marker of time and thought. And I just started to play with them.\u201d Simpson screenprinted vintage portraits from the magazines on to clay-board and fibreglass panels. \u201cAnd then I got a ton of ink together,\u201d she says with a laugh, \u201cand I decided to experiment. I just went into a whirlwind of working.\u201d The Nigerian curator Okwui Enwezor included Simpson\u2019s first five paintings, which measured more than nine-feet tall, in the 2015 Venice Biennale. Shortly afterwards, he died of cancer. It drove Simpson to delve further into this new form. She allowed herself to work expressively and largely on instinct, with little sense of how each piece might turn out. The results are perhaps Simpson\u2019s most accomplished to date: the pin-sharp faces of poised black women from long ago stare out beneath roiling indigo skies, glacial landscapes and churning seas. When Simpson showed them in her home city, she spoke to the New York Times about the difficulties of being seen only as a black artist: \u201cJust as the Caucasian figure in contemporary art is seen as universal,\u201d she said, \u201cthe black figure of African descent should be too.\u201d Is it frustrating to still have to point this out? \u201cNothing surprises me any more,\u201d she says. \u201cIn America, there are refusals to understand or acknowledge that things are far more complicated than we would like them to be. Any society, or self, constructed to always separate itself from the other is doomed.\u201d In LA, Simpson is \u201cslowly edging back to work\u201d. She will drift downstairs in the morning to find her daughter Zora, who will soon graduate from Columbia University, plugged into her laptop. \u201cShe has much more of a schedule than me,\u201d Simpson says. \u201cBut I\u2019m spending every day trying to make something.\u201d The Covid-19 crisis has, she says, had a deep impact on her. \u201cThere are days when I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, we\u2019ve got this.\u2019 And there are days when I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s the fourth time I\u2019ve cried for an hour.\u201d We\u2019re speaking on the day President Trump suggested American citizens could inject themselves with bleach. \u201cThere\u2019s an insanity to the US government\u2019s response,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s breathtakingly ignorant and dangerous.\u201d Simpson has already lost close friends, including the critic and art historian Maurice Berger, to the virus. \u201cAll these waves of death,\u201d she says. Simpson began her career just as New York was at the centre of the Aids epidemic. She lost friends to the disease and saw others who had it stigmatised. \u201cThe Aids crisis was very similar to now \u2013 all the misconceptions, all the negative responses.\u201d She remembers it as a time when \u201cvictims were vilified, families would disown their children. Someone would die and half the time there wasn\u2019t a funeral. But I wouldn\u2019t say anything has prepared me for now.\u201d America is in a unique state of denial, Simpson believes. \u201cThere was a lot of ignorance during the 1980s. Now we\u2019re seeing the spectre of that again. The lack of compassion. People\u2019s refusal to face science. The level of governmental ignorance \u2013 of power based on ignorance \u2013 has endangered people\u2019s lives, literally.\u201d Can anything good come out of this? \u201cSo many things will change after coronavirus, and we will learn a lot of things scientifically,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cBut do we have the wherewithal and the strength to start thinking of everyone, rather than further disintegrate into clans and tribes?\u201d She pauses. \u201cI think we need to.\u201d Lorna Simpson: Give Me Some Moments is at Hauser &amp; Wirth\u2019s website",

We are talking by phone, but, alas, the reception inside her home on Long Island is, she says, \u201calways terrible\u201d. Torturous minutes pass in which I can hear only fragments of her conversation, and if anyone knows of a sweeter agony than being barely able to hear Andrews\u2019 still lovely, melodious voice, I don\u2019t want to know what it is. Eventually, I have to tell her this phone conversation isn\u2019t working.</p> <p>\u201cI can stand out in my garden, although it is a bit nippy \u2026\u201d Andrews suggests.</p> <p>Please do not go outside, I nearly shout down the line, suddenly envisioning Andrews developing pneumonia because of me.</p> <p>\u201cHonestly, it is no trouble at all! Oh dear, now my dogs are going crazy \u2026\u201d</p> <p>Andrews and I are talking today because she and her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, have launched <a href=\"https://www.julieslibraryshow.org/\">a podcast, soothingly titled Julie\u2019s Library</a>, in which the two women read children\u2019s stories. The podcast had been scheduled to launch later this year, but they decided to bring it forward when most of the world was suddenly locked inside their homes. It\u2019s fair to say the world was grateful. <a href=\"https://news.avclub.com/oh-thank-god-julie-andrews-wants-to-read-us-some-stor-1842912092\">\u201cOh thank God: Julie Andrews wants to read us some stories\u201d</a> was a typical headline in response to the news.</p> <p>Few people are more associated with feelings of comfort and safety than Andrews. \u201cNothing can be wrong in the world if Andrews is looking after us,\u201d the US journalist <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFdX4AdRdUQ\">Diane Sawyer said</a> while interviewing Andrews last year. Much of this, of course, is to do with her two most famous roles, the perfect nannies Mary/Maria in Mary Poppins (1964) and The Sound of Music (1965). The movies are more than half a century old, but Andrews has long since accepted that she will never escape their double-headed shadow and has gracefully answered questions about them ever since from besotted members of the public and journalists.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"971d258e74f41871ff604019448009a61935141e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/971d258e74f41871ff604019448009a61935141e/0_0_2196_2817/780.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Andrews with the Oscar she won for Mary Poppins in 1965.\" width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Andrews with the Oscar she won for Mary Poppins in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Andrews, 84, has always radiated a nourishing kind of goodness, although she makes an embarrassed laugh when I bring it up: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how to respond to questions about [my image], Hadley. It\u2019s just how it\u2019s always been,\u201d she says, careful to use my name in response to almost all my questions. It\u2019s a gesture that feels entirely of a piece with Andrews, something born of careful good manners and precision. In her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/oct/19/julie-andrews-second-memoir-home-work-interview\">recent second memoir, Home Work</a>, which focuses on her Hollywood years, Andrews describes being offered cocaine at a party in 1971. \u201cThe hosts began pushing me hard, curious to see how Mary Poppins would react,\u201d she wrote. Eventually, her husband, the film director Blake Edwards, came to her rescue: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need any of that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s high enough on life as it is.\u201d \u201cOh yes, I was terrified!\u201d she laughs when I mention the incident.</p> <p>And yet, Andrews\u2019 life has hardly been bland rice pudding. In her first memoir, Home, she describes her at times near gothic childhood. She was born Julia Wells in Surrey in 1935 to a gentle, adoring father, Ted Wells, and a somewhat more erratic mother, Barbara Morris, a pianist. Her parents split up when she was young and Andrews moved with her mother and new stepfather, Ted Andrews, a vaudevillian, to what she has described as a \u201cslum\u201d area of London. Her stepfather was an alcoholic and twice he tried to get into Andrews\u2019 bed, resulting in her putting a lock on her bedroom door.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother was terribly important to me, and I know how much I yearned for her in my youth. But I don\u2019t think I entirely trusted her,\u201d Andrews writes in Home. Perhaps her mother\u2019s worst betrayal came when she drunkenly informed her young daughter that Wells \u2013 the most stable adult influence in her life \u2013 wasn\u2019t her biological father. At 15, her mother yanked her out of school and put her on the stage to help support the family, and she travelled the country to perform in shows, sharing train carriages with, among others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/31/petula-clark-elvis-angled-for-a-threesome-he-was-raring-to-go\">Petula Clark</a>.</p> <p>With Andrews\u2019 extraordinary clear soprano voice, she became the family\u2019s breadwinner and worked relentlessly, keeping her drunken stepfather and miserable mother afloat. At last, she was able to escape when she was cast as the lead in the Broadway shows of The Boyfriend and My Fair Lady, and from there, it was soon a mere hop to Hollywood \u2013 although not, notoriously, into the movie of My Fair Lady, as the film\u2019s producer, Jack Warner, decided Andrews wasn\u2019t famous enough. He replaced her with Audrey Hepburn, whose singing had to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/marni-nixon-obituary\">dubbed </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/26/marni-nixon-obituary\">by Marni Nixon</a>. Initially disappointing, this turned out to be Andrews\u2019 biggest break, as it meant she was free to star in Mary Poppins. When she won the Golden Globe for Poppins, she said at the end of her speech: \u201cFinally, my thanks to a man who made a wonderful movie who made all this possible in the first place \u2026 Jack Warner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c3e600f3397134ac208f99acc09e7bd58ac20e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c3e600f3397134ac208f99acc09e7bd58ac20e1/0_0_3484_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Andrews on stage at the London Palladium in 1948 during a Royal Command Performance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Andrews on stage at the London Palladium in 1948 during a Royal Command Performance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is fire and spice beneath Andrews\u2019 creamy exterior, and certainly a helluva story. Sadly, we discuss hardly any of it: as well as Andrews\u2019 erratic phone service and excitable dogs, our allotted time is cut from 30 minutes to 15 minutes because the PR couldn\u2019t master the technology to connect us. On top of that, Hamilton is on the line to remind me repeatedly to talk about the podcast, and not, say, Mary Poppins. But Andrews is so sweetly apologetic that it\u2019s impossible to resent her for all the nonsense. \u201cOh, poor Hadley! Poor Hadley!\u201d she cries after Hamilton has reminded me again to bring it back to the podcast, and her sympathy is inescapably reminiscent of Maria\u2019s pity for the Von Trapp children, forced to march to their father\u2019s absurd whistle.</p> <p>Still, 15 minutes with Julie Andrews is better than no minutes with Julie Andrews. So I start by asking about their decision to release the podcast early. I don\u2019t want to make any clumsy comparisons between the coronavirus and the second world war, I begin stumblingly.</p> <p>\u201cOh, but you can! You can! I feel a very big similarity to the feelings one had then to the feelings one has now. Ask your question, Hadley,\u201d she says with her distinctively perfect enunciation.</p> <p>I say that I wondered if it was because of her memories of the feelings that she had as a child during the war that she wanted to reach out to children today, who are feeling pretty anxious now.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think so. Then, I was very concerned and worried and frightened and anxious, and one didn\u2019t know where the next wave would come. But one thing I did recognise as a child was the amount of bonding that happened in England because of the war, and I feel the same feelings in America here at this moment,\u201d she says.</p> <p>It is obligatory in every article about Andrews to point out that she made many films for adults that had nothing to do with nannies: Torn Curtain with Alfred Hitchcock, the jolly flapper musical Thoroughly Modern Millie and Victor/Victoria, the gender-bending comedy directed by Edwards, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/16/blake-edwards-obituary\">who died </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/dec/16/blake-edwards-obituary\">almost 10 years ago</a>. Andrews drops in her own gentle reminder of this when talking about the success of Mary/Maria: \u201cThe thing is, Hadley, Poppins and Sound of Music were so successful that they crowded out and eliminated the less child-friendly movies I did, like Hawaii and The Americanization of Emily. It\u2019s just the way things fell and I\u2019d never knock it and I\u2019m absolutely grateful for all I\u2019ve been given.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"707e18cf7bffe7415acf2c430dccd1155ae4e640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/707e18cf7bffe7415acf2c430dccd1155ae4e640/7_0_2215_2214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Victoria Grant in Victor/Victoria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As Victoria Grant in Victor/Victoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/MGM</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it is also true that Andrews has devoted significant part of her adult life to improving the lives of children. Even aside from the all-conquering musicals, which have unquestionably improved the lives of millions, she has written dozens of children\u2019s books, often with her daughter, and made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/23/julies-greenroom-andrews-henson-puppets\">Netflix series for children, Julie\u2019s Green Room</a>. On top of that, Andrews, who adopted two Vietnamese girls with Edwards, has been an advocate for the rights of children and orphans in Vietnam and Cambodia, and in particular for those with American servicemen fathers to be allowed to emigrate to the US. I ask if she thinks this desire to help was in any way connected to her own turbulent childhood.</p> <p>\u201cI think it had more to do with \u2013 well, you know, I was just a working girl in my teens, travelling around England, singing my heart out, learning my craft. But once I got to Broadway and Hollywood, the films drew me into that particular work, and I found that it was what I wanted to embrace, because it was giving me so much pleasure. Those movies led me into this concern for kids, and I think probably subliminally I was trying to give them as good a feeling as I could. I have no idea if that comes from my own childhood. It was just the way I stumbled forward in the world. Does that make sense? I hope it does!\u201d she says</p> <p>I tell her that the actor David Tomlinson once claimed the reason Dick Van Dyke\u2019s cockney accent was so terrible in Mary Poppins was because Tomlinson, who was born in Henley-on-Thames and was very much not a cockney, had helped him with it.</p> <p>\u201cOh, that was very generous of David! I think Dick asked all of us to help him, because I had the same experience, and he was very aware that he was stumbling about. He was adorable, so talented and charming anyway, so who cares, really!\u201d says Andrews.</p> <p>Andrews\u2019 daughter now pipes up to tell me to bring the chat back to the podcast. As I haven\u2019t actually heard the podcast, because it wasn\u2019t online yet at the time of our interview, I ask about the relationship between the two of them. Andrews was pregnant with Hamilton when Walt Disney offered her the role of Poppins. When Andrews informed him she was unlikely to fit into the costume in six months\u2019 time, Disney told this unknown stage actress: \u201cThat\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p> <p>It is clear from Andrews\u2019 memoirs \u2013 which she co-wrote with Hamilton \u2013 that the two women have always had an exceptionally close relationship, despite Andrews working non-stop from pretty much the minute Hamilton was born.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35c6d65e271992f1b827a800e2c6d048eceb3a1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c6d65e271992f1b827a800e2c6d048eceb3a1b/0_0_3800_2557/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Andrews with her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton in the 1960s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julie Andrews with her daughter Emma Walton Hamilton in the 1960s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were bonded from the beginning because of, well, so many reasons. Emma\u2019s dad, my first husband, and I separated, and that helped us. I knew it was really important for me to make Emma\u2019s childhood as normal as possible, even though it was incredibly abnormal in many ways. But the same team travelled together, we were together as much as possible. It wasn\u2019t easy for her, but she was a Trojan and has a very big heart,\u201d says Andrews.</p> <p>At this point, Hamilton says I have time for only one more question. I\u2019m overwhelmed by all the questions I want to ask \u2013 does she resent Christopher Plummer for slagging off The Sound of Music? Did she hate Mary Poppins Returns and is that why she refused to be in it? To my horror, I hear myself burbling out some question about whether she ever experienced sexual harassment during her years in Hollywood. And sure, a lot of actresses have experienced that. But on the list of topics I\u2019ve long dreamed of discussing with Andrews, that one would come pretty low. To her enormous credit, she doesn\u2019t balk.</p> <p>\u201cI was certainly aware, Hadley, of tales about the casting couch.

How busy I must be! How fast the time will go, I won\u2019t believe it! Initially, I\u2019m so miserable about how this interview has gone I can barely speak. But just hearing Andrews speak about my kids warms my heart, and by the end I\u2019m almost smiling. Even in 15 minutes, Andrews can still give children \u2013 and former children \u2013 a good feeling.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.julieslibraryshow.org/\">Julie\u2019s Library</a> is available now</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 May 2020 to replace a miscaptioned picture.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019ll tell you what, shall I go outside?\u201d Julie Andrews asks. We are talking by phone, but, alas, the reception inside her home on Long Island is, she says, \u201calways terrible\u201d. Torturous minutes pass in which I can hear only fragments of her conversation, and if anyone knows of a sweeter agony than being barely able to hear Andrews\u2019 still lovely, melodious voice, I don\u2019t want to know what it is. Eventually, I have to tell her this phone conversation isn\u2019t working. \u201cI can stand out in my garden, although it is a bit nippy \u2026\u201d Andrews suggests. Please do not go outside, I nearly shout down the line, suddenly envisioning Andrews developing pneumonia because of me. \u201cHonestly, it is no trouble at all! Oh dear, now my dogs are going crazy \u2026\u201d Andrews and I are talking today because she and her daughter, Emma Walton Hamilton, have launched a podcast, soothingly titled Julie\u2019s Library, in which the two women read children\u2019s stories. The podcast had been scheduled to launch later this year, but they decided to bring it forward when most of the world was suddenly locked inside their homes. It\u2019s fair to say the world was grateful. \u201cOh thank God: Julie Andrews wants to read us some stories\u201d was a typical headline in response to the news. Few people are more associated with feelings of comfort and safety than Andrews. \u201cNothing can be wrong in the world if Andrews is looking after us,\u201d the US journalist Diane Sawyer said while interviewing Andrews last year. Much of this, of course, is to do with her two most famous roles, the perfect nannies Mary/Maria in Mary Poppins (1964) and The Sound of Music (1965). The movies are more than half a century old, but Andrews has long since accepted that she will never escape their double-headed shadow and has gracefully answered questions about them ever since from besotted members of the public and journalists. Andrews, 84, has always radiated a nourishing kind of goodness, although she makes an embarrassed laugh when I bring it up: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how to respond to questions about [my image], Hadley. It\u2019s just how it\u2019s always been,\u201d she says, careful to use my name in response to almost all my questions. It\u2019s a gesture that feels entirely of a piece with Andrews, something born of careful good manners and precision. In her recent second memoir, Home Work, which focuses on her Hollywood years, Andrews describes being offered cocaine at a party in 1971. \u201cThe hosts began pushing me hard, curious to see how Mary Poppins would react,\u201d she wrote. Eventually, her husband, the film director Blake Edwards, came to her rescue: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need any of that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s high enough on life as it is.\u201d \u201cOh yes, I was terrified!\u201d she laughs when I mention the incident. And yet, Andrews\u2019 life has hardly been bland rice pudding. In her first memoir, Home, she describes her at times near gothic childhood. She was born Julia Wells in Surrey in 1935 to a gentle, adoring father, Ted Wells, and a somewhat more erratic mother, Barbara Morris, a pianist. Her parents split up when she was young and Andrews moved with her mother and new stepfather, Ted Andrews, a vaudevillian, to what she has described as a \u201cslum\u201d area of London. Her stepfather was an alcoholic and twice he tried to get into Andrews\u2019 bed, resulting in her putting a lock on her bedroom door. \u201cMy mother was terribly important to me, and I know how much I yearned for her in my youth. But I don\u2019t think I entirely trusted her,\u201d Andrews writes in Home. Perhaps her mother\u2019s worst betrayal came when she drunkenly informed her young daughter that Wells \u2013 the most stable adult influence in her life \u2013 wasn\u2019t her biological father.

      "body": "<p>When lockdown started, I was confused by bodies on television. Why weren\u2019t they socially distancing? Didn\u2019t they know not to be so close? The injunction to be separate was unfamiliar and irregular, and for me, self-isolating alone, following this government directive was peculiar. It made watching dramas and programmes produced under normal filming conditions feel jarring.</p> <p>Seven weeks in, the disjuncture has passed. I, like all of us, am accommodating to multiple corporeal realities: bodies alone, bodies distant, bodies in the park to be avoided, bodies of disobedient youths hanging out in groups, bodies in lines outside shops, bodies and voices flattened on screens and above all, bodies of dead health workers and carers. Black bodies, brown bodies. Working-class bodies. Bodies not normally praised, now being celebrated.</p> <p>We are learning a whole new etiquette of bodies. We swerve around each other, hop into the near-empty street, calculate distances at entrances to parks, avoid body contact, even eye contact, and keep a look out for those obliviously glued to their phones, whose lack of attention threatens to breach the two-metre rule. It\u2019s odd and disconcerting and isn\u2019t quite second nature.</p> <p>Until the pandemic arrived, many of us were finding texting, email and Whatsapp more suitable to our speeded-up lives. But now we are coming to reuse the telephone, and to enjoy the sounds in our ears and the rhythm of conversation, instead of feeling rushed and interrupted. A few of my sessions as a psychoanalyst are now conducted on the phone but, for the most part, I am spending my time looking into a screen, and seeing faces rather than whole bodies. Until I learned to turn off the view of myself, I, like others, was disconcerted by the oddness of catching sight of myself \u2013 a view I don\u2019t think we are meant to see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ee3ce8ae73dc3e0c4a544cc42f6030d59f87154f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee3ce8ae73dc3e0c4a544cc42f6030d59f87154f/0_0_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neighbours social distancing in Syracuse, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neighbours social distancing in Syracuse, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maranie Staab/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conversations in therapy defy many of the customs of social intercourse. There are silences, repetitions, reframings, links across time, reminiscences of fragments, rushes of emotion, shards of dreams, things told and then disavowed. There can be fidgeting or absolute stillness. These form the idiosyncratic and personal ambience between each therapeutic couple. As a therapist, I am also alert to how the dilemmas that beset the person or the couple I am seeing are brought to our relationship.</p> <p>The conundrums that brought the person to seek therapy in the first place can be replayed right here. For example, a person fearful of intimacy can experience the therapy relationship or the therapist as too close. Someone else who worries they are too needy may be reluctant to show their longings directly to the therapist, although well able to talk about how things go wrong for them in other relationships. The therapy relationship and the sessions are our petri dish. The field of study is the human subject (and her, his or their ways of being able to develop and change).</p> <p>The therapist works to understand an individual\u2019s personal psychological grammar \u2013 to help the person take the risk of unlearning and then learning anew, finding ways to not be in so much hurt. So too with the body. Those with troubled bodies bring them to the session. They may sit too close, for example, or seem to be concave, or dress incongruously, as though presenting a different persona in each session. In the course of therapy, such an abject body experience can be addressed, and, in unlearning and then learning anew, the person finds a more comfortable way to sit in their body.</p> <p>How is the dematerialisation of bodies affecting us and going to affect us? Me, my patients, you \u2013 all of us? For some of my patients, their screen or home is a prison. Their experience is full of woe and worry. Therapy keeps them just about on the border of sane, but it\u2019s a sanity that hurts: isolation can maraud all of us as we miss the interactions, intimate or casual, that confirm our sense of our value, our place in our community, our work and the world.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Some of my clinical preoccupations centre on how we acquire a physical, corporeal sense of self. Although psychoanalysis is a theory of mind and body, its main emphasis has drifted to the development of the mind and its structures: what we call defences, and the relationship patterns we have absorbed. Bodies have been very much the bit player to the main drama of the mind, even when mental processes or disturbance have resulted in bodily symptoms such as eczema or a non-biologically induced paralysis. As therapists, we traditionally read back into the mind the troubles visited on the body, seeing them as the result of mental conflicts. And of course, they often are, but I have long been keen to understand body troubles and body difficulties in their own terms, and to build a theory about the development of the body.</p> <p>Bodies have always been bound and marked by social rules. Different societies make different sense out of similar bodily actions or gestures. The variety of body adornment and transformations around the world, from rings around the neck to the recent upsurge in labial reductions and penis enlargements, has made it ever more apparent that the body is not simply the product of DNA. The body we inhabit develops within relationships to other bodies. Usually it is within the maternal orbit where, to take an obvious example, we first apprehend gender-based forms of comportment. When I grew up, being told to sit like a girl and not to climb trees were some of the ways we were treated differently to boys. Research across many cultures show that baby girls are weaned and potty-trained earlier, fed less at each feed, and held less, than boys. There may be no biological basis to this, but rather a social, unconscious basis that then informs how we personally experience our particular embodiment.</p> <p>We have very few verified reports of humans growing up outside of human culture but the feral child Victor of Aveyron, who was discovered living wild in the woods of southern France in 1800, did not have body movements that were recognisably human. The body-to-body relationship that was foundational for him was with the bodies of the wolves he apparently grew up among. He seemingly mimicked their gait and moves, their posture and their vocalisations. Of course, we know this more familiarly, and less dramatically, from when youngsters develop their group identities by adopting the mannerisms of film actors or musicians.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"147b2555952e97f1b55a6ddbb4ed6162dcd0d1f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/147b2555952e97f1b55a6ddbb4ed6162dcd0d1f3/540_836_4605_2594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Social distancing during the opening of the Dragon\u2019s Heart hospital in Cardiff last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Social distancing during the opening of the Dragon\u2019s Heart hospital in Cardiff last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Horwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Through screens, billboards and photoshopped images, we reduce the wide variety of bodily expression. It\u2019s as though we are losing body diversity just as we are losing languages. The digitised, westernised body image predominates, and in the last two decades has spawned a cosmetic surgery industry worldwide \u2013 from leg-lengthening surgery using steel rods in China (now banned), to rhinoplasty in Iran (which has the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/mar/01/beauty-obsession-iran-cosmetic-surgery?CMP=twt_gu\" title=\"\">highest rate</a> of nose surgery per capita in the world) to double-eyelid surgery and jawbone reduction in South Korea. In the west, surgeons resculpt cheekbones, breasts and calves, and offer day procedures for facial \u2018thread lifts\u2019. Cosmetic surgery tourism hubs in Hungary, South Korea and Singapore were thriving until the lockdown.</p> <p>One Chinese smartphone app allows the selfie-taker to adjust their portrait to bring it closer to a very specific standard of beauty known as <em>wang hon lian,</em> or \u201cinternet celebrity face\u201d. It\u2019s very popular: billions of wang hon lian images are uploaded every month.</p> <p>The richest Europeans are not in tech, but in the business of beautifying bodies \u2013 the owners of fashion, luxury and cosmetics brands such as LVMH, L\u2019Oreal and Zara. Increasing automation has led us to move from using our bodies to make things to turning our bodies the site and the product of our labour, through diet and exercise regimes, clothing and cosmetics. The surface body is meant to be on display.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the sweating, smelling, holding, stroking body of the other becomes, for those socially distancing, too distant \u2013 while for others, such as those sharing a house with teenage boys, it\u2019s all too present. All is on show for families and housemates, while all is hidden for those living alone during lockdown.</p> <p>The experience of the body on FaceTime or Zoom contrasts with the pulsing, breathing, weeping, sighing, tired, achy or indeed springy and enthusiastic bodies we inhabit. We no longer have social communion in the flesh, the handshake or the hug, the pleasure of eating in a restaurant with a friend or lover while seated near strangers. Afraid of infection, for our protection, we collapse our social space.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>During the second world war, the psychiatrist Ren\u00e9 Spitz studied orphan babies in care. He discovered that those closest to the nurses\u2019 station thrived, while those at the end of the ward did not do so well. The difference was touch: the nurses would casually touch and interact with those closest to them, and this gave those infants the essential food for physical and psychological development. They absorbed the will to live. A decade later \u2013 in research now considered controversial for the way in which he removed baby monkeys from their mothers \u2013 the American psychologist <a href=\"https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/harlows-classic-studies-revealed-the-importance-of-maternal-contact.html\" title=\"\">Harry Harlow discovered</a> that baby monkeys given ersatz mothers in the form of basic cloth puppets would find some crucial security and comfort even in this simulation of maternal touch; those baby monkeys deprived of any kind of maternal touch at all became highly disturbed, and many died.</p> <p>Touch, feel and proximity are central to survival. Consider the genius of premature infants\u2019 capacity to regulate their own and, extraordinarily, their parent\u2019s body temperature, if they are <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/12578-kangaroo-care\" title=\"\">held skin-to-skin in a pouch</a>. The gaze \u2013 the search to be seen, to recognise and to influence the other \u2013 is also crucial to human subjectivity. In <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/ed-tronick-and-the-8220-still-face-experiment-8221/\" title=\"\">a fascinating video</a> made by the developmental psychologist Edward Tronick, he instructs a mother playing with her baby to keep a still face and refrain from interacting with her infant for a minute or two. We observe as the infant girl seeks to engage the mother. When she is unable to, the baby collapses psychologically and physically until contact is restored. What is so shocking is how fast the collapse is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been thinking of how impossibly difficult and challenging our quasi-dematerialised life through the Zoom screen is, whether chatting with friends or being in a meeting. Conflict and harmony become cartoonish as subtle gestures collapse and the conversations we have with our eyes are shut down.</p> <p>Reading each other well enough is a new skill in the therapy room, too, for both people. By now we are used to the screens and the telephone, and the occasional technical blips. We are seeing a physical interior \u2013 a study, bedroom, shed or kitchen, and being surprised by an occasional child that floats in. We hear the suddenly hushed voice of someone not wanting their partner to get a drift of the conversation we are having. It illuminates aspects we didn\u2019t see before. Is it better? No. Is it worse? Marginally. I miss noticing how people enter the therapy room \u2013 the subtle difference from the session before, or the way they may hold their face and body; above all, the animate body in the room. I suspect that I am more animated to make up for the loss of that precious physicality.</p> <p>Former hostages Terry Waite, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan have all written and spoken eloquently about solitary confinement and their struggles to find a way through and back \u2013 or should I say forward \u2013 to familial and social life. It was tough. And although many of us are not self-isolating alone, unless one is able to do interesting or valued work during this period, or have enough people to hang out with, we can expect considerable psychological difficulties to follow as we come out of lockdown. How will we re-establish social interaction with other bodies? What kind of rhythms will we want and be able to have going forward?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5f7f6e5510591fc2fed7372dbecabfaf0b09a152\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f7f6e5510591fc2fed7372dbecabfaf0b09a152/0_0_4860_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seating regulations inside a courtroom in Belgium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seating regulations inside a courtroom in Belgium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many have been ultra-busy with home schooling, working from home, managing three generations and so on. Time has bent and contracted in perplexing ways. Busyness has increased for some, while others, for whom slowing down is a foreign concept, have had idleness forced on them. Empty time feels alien \u2013 or at least did at the beginning. For many it has been an unexpected pleasure. No need to rush to social occasions. No need to dress. No need to get everything done and more. Being wanted, being needed, being in demand have been psychological supports that have melted away. Finding new ways to nourish one\u2019s needs in this new reality \u2013 especially in the absence of touch and gaze, which we unknowingly rely upon to recognise ourselves \u2013 can be tricky.</p> <p>Today, there is a frightened, wary, social body. A body that is tense, in which avoidance is the watchword. The covered face, whether by a hoodie or a veil, which formerly some found challenging, now offers reassurance. Indeed, many public places \u2013 from Eurostar trains to the streets of New York, Prague, Dubai, Havana and many more \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/countries-wearing-face-masks-compulsory-200423094510867.html\" title=\"\">now demand it</a>. Meanwhile, much of society is now paying attention to bodies that had been scandalously overlooked. The bodies of working women, the carers who go in and out of the houses and homes of the people they look after. The faces of vast numbers of black, Asian and minority-ethnic bodies, particularly in the health service, who are finally being recognised for their value, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">shockingly disproportionate</a> number of their losses. </p> <p>Before Covid-19, the ruling party were happy to slash social and health funding, to put money into management in the NHS, and not into professional carers, doctors and nurses. Now society is waking up to the value of care and medical expertise that comes from the hospital floor \u2013 that is to say, from the doctors and nurses who are reorganising what occurs there. The people keeping society going in every sector \u2013 transport workers, small shopkeepers, workers in food production and delivery \u2013 are often first-generation immigrants. More people are seeing a more nuanced social landscape. The opportunity is here for reframing how we represent the social body. It is of necessity differently hued, and that needs acknowledging, as does the shame of our previous marginalising. Covid-19 is cleaning the lens, so we can see more clearly.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>From the individual to the social body, and how it is being challenged by the pandemic, we turn to the corporate body \u2013 the body of state \u2013 and what we have been learning about how it has functioned. On 17 April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthony-costello\" title=\"\">Prof </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/anthony-costello\" title=\"\">Anthony Costello</a>, a former director of the Institute for Global Health at UCL, told the select committee on health and social care that he feared Britain might have the highest number of deaths in Europe, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\" title=\"\">now been confirmed</a>. Costello had estimated 40,000 deaths; on 5 May the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\" title=\"\">official UK death toll</a> was just over 32,000, but the Financial Times reported the same day that the true figure had likely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e32ddbf7-0826-4cf7-9a73-18611eb29c23\" title=\"\">already surpassed</a> Costello\u2019s estimate. London and the north-west of England are showing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/north-west-overtakes-london-for-number-of-covid-19-hospital-cases-coronavirus\" title=\"\">higher rates</a> of death than other regions, while according to the ONS, people in the most deprived areas of England and Wales are dying at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales\" title=\"\">twice the rate</a> of the most affluent areas.</p> <p>Costello argued for this figure because we were slow off the mark to take precautionary moves early on. He spoke to the chair of the committee, Jeremy Hunt, who has spent this period appearing to stress about the lack of testing, ventilators and PPE equipment. This is the same Hunt who, as the longest serving health secretary in British history, also had social care in his portfolio, and the pay of doctors, nurses and social care workers. Even more damningly, he was the minister in charge during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/28/matt-hancock-urged-to-publish-secret-review-of-pandemic-plans\" title=\"\">Exercise Cygnus</a>, the UK government\u2019s drill to test our preparedness for a pandemic, carried out in 2016.</p> <p>The full review of Exercise Cygnus has never been officially published, but leaks have revealed that it showed the UK\u2019s health system and local authorities were woefully unprepared for such an eventuality. The <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/28/exercise-cygnus-uncovered-pandemic-warnings-buried-government/\" title=\"\">exercise showed</a> hospitals and mortuaries being quickly overwhelmed, and shortages of critical care beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for hospital staff. </p> <p>Cygnus, and other such exercises, are meant to show the government what they need to do to be prepared \u2013 which was not, as Hunt was doing, cutting beds. On 28 March of this year, when the Cygnus debacle came to light, we were told that the projections were not remedied because of worries that beds, ventilators and PPE would become outmoded or obsolete and that the government had worked on securing reliable supply chains.

Our government chose to source new ideas rather build to the existing plan under licence. Why, one must ask? Could it be Brexit hubris?</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to contrast the UK\u2019s response with that of the EU, because the latter has not always <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\" title=\"\">covered itself in glory</a> during the pandemic. The ethics of cooperation in Europe and the ethics of transparency and honesty have been mightily tested in the past months. Perhaps now though we can be encouraged by the joint project of the European Investment Banks and WHO to bolster global healthcare systems. Will the UK state be contributing? I think not. So much depends on the actions of citizens now to move things forward. In this light, it is encouraging to see the formation of a new independent panel of experts \u2013 a \u201crival\u201d to Sage \u2013 led by the former UK government chief scientific adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/davidking\" title=\"\">David King</a>, whose deliberations are on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Isnl93fvReY\" title=\"\">YouTube for us to watch</a>.</p> <p>I am not sure how we characterise the following failure of the state, because it is in part the expression of public good: of the 750,000 people who signed up to volunteer to help the NHS, invited by the government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/nhs-coronavirus-crisis-volunteers-frustrated-at-lack-of-tasks\" title=\"\">fewer than 100,000</a> have been deployed. As citizens, we want to contribute. This squandering of people\u2019s generosity is disturbing. Fortunately, people such as Capt Tom Moore or the many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/the-volunteers-making-ppe-on-the-homefront-for-uk-healthworkers-coronavirus\" title=\"\">making masks</a> and contributing 3D printers keep on going. And the programme <a href=\"https://www.feednhs.com/\" title=\"\">Feed NHS</a>, in which the restaurant chain Leon and other chefs are prepping to feed patients, doctors, nurses, hospital porters and ambulance workers, is now in train. This voluntary work, in which groups of people self-organise, is outstanding, and yet it is in contrast to the inability of our state to mobilise those who wanted to help.</p> <p>The Gates Foundation\u2019s contributions to seven different vaccine programmes, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s donation of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/twitter-chief-to-donate-quarter-of-his-fortune-to-coronavirus-fight\" title=\"\">$1bn</a>, are impressive. Will hedge funds in the UK such as Ruffer investment, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/hedge-funds-raking-in-billions-during-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">pocketed</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/hedge-funds-raking-in-billions-during-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">\u00a32.4bn in March</a>, or Somerset Capital (the fund Jacob Rees Mogg used to run) who see Covid-19 as a \u201conce or twice in a generation\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/05/rees-mogg-firm-accused-of-cashing-in-on-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">opportunity</a> for investment, make a contribution, too?</p> <p>There are several dozen UK-based hedge funds managing assets worth \u00a31bn or more. Could the mood of the country be such that hedge fund investors and managers might be persuaded to donate some of their obscene profits to the coronavirus response or to sponsor migrants from beyond Europe (who work here as cleaners, carers, drivers), who do not earn the \u00a330,000 currently demandedfor a work permit?</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Covid is a sad story. It is also a story of resilience. The body of state has failed us. We need to grow up and recognise that. Covid-19 has exposed unforgivable systemic failure. In the years leading up to this, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the status of civil servants and a downgrading of health workers. We have seen teachers, doctors and academics hidebound in a managerial economy. At least it seems that micromanagement has been temporarily overturned in hospitals, thank goodness, because right now doctors and nurses need to be running the show.</p> <p>And to return to our bodies \u2013 the live ones, so many devoid of touch and gaze, facing a long period of isolation, and frightened. How can I conclude?</p> <p>In a way, I can\u2019t. We are far from the other side of this crisis. Psychological therapies are going to have a huge part to play in the remaking of body and soul. I don\u2019t much like the word trauma, because it has become so overused, but we are a society that is in trauma. A societal trauma gives opportunities for people to go through things together, rather than suffer alone, as long as we don\u2019t bury or make light of what we have experienced and continue to experience. We will have to find new ways to live with our fears and discomforts, to overcome Covid-minted social phobias, with what we project on to other people\u2019s bodies and the fears we have about our own vulnerabilities. We will need all the help we can get in reshaping our relationship to our own and each other\u2019s bodies, to find a way to build bonds of attachment and respect.</p> <p>What started with the dematerialisation of the individual body has now morphed into the dematerialisation of the body of state. The economist Joseph Stiglitz reminds us that, with the stripping back of the state under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, we lost capacity. This needs to be addressed. </p> <p>There is a lively debate from a range of economists on how to get to a more equitable economy. Moneyweek editor-in-chief Merryn Somerset Webb\u2019s call for a <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">sovereign</a> <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">wealth</a> <a href=\"https://moneyweek.com/economy/uk-economy/601261/turn-the-covid-19-bailout-into-a-sovereign-wealth-fund\" title=\"\">fund</a>, with the government owning shares in bailed-out companies, is interesting, as is political economist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-promise-of-an-oxford-vaccine-reveals-how-a-new-britain-could-thrive\" title=\"\">Will Hutton\u2019s idea</a> of expanding the British Business Bank and the Future Fund.

We will have to do that again. Principally, we will need to recognise the contributions and the losses of the UK\u2019s minority and working-class people, above all. Our governments have shamed themselves through creating divisions in society, particularly since austerity was imposed under David Cameron\u2019s government. Now we have an unexpected chance to redress the divisive fallout of Brexit.</p> <p>The impact of remote working and the need to balance domestic and work life, allied with dire warnings on mass unemployment, gives us an opportunity to write a social contract in which we divide work more fairly. At both ends of the pay scale, people overwork. The evidence for a more balanced relationship between work and home is compelling.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, the outpourings of artists, musicians, programmers, cultural and scientific workers at all levels has been outstanding. The talent, the will, the desire is there to remake our world. The urgency is not in question. Globalism can\u2019t simply be a celebration of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d deliveries. It will need to be recast as mutuality \u2013 local and global mutuality \u2013 so that we learn from each other, including those who\u2019ve been in lockdown in war zones.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/therapy-during-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-psychoanalysis-freud\">Therapy under lockdown: 'I\u2019m just as terrified as my patients are'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Our institutions will need to be rebuilt with transparency, with heart and by learning from the people who have been staffing them, not just the managers and owners. Doctors, nurses, carers and delivery people have things to say about how their institutions could be better run. The body politic and the politics of the bodies that make up our world must be reconfigured, and we need to start thinking about that now.</p> <p>I conclude with Freud: \u201cThe aim of psychoanalysis is to turn hysteria into ordinary human unhappiness.\u201d That is an accomplishment for an individual and for a society. We cannot escape unhappiness. It is constitutive of being human, just as are creativity, courage, ambition, attachment and love.

      "bodyText": "When lockdown started, I was confused by bodies on television. Why weren\u2019t they socially distancing? Didn\u2019t they know not to be so close? The injunction to be separate was unfamiliar and irregular, and for me, self-isolating alone, following this government directive was peculiar. It made watching dramas and programmes produced under normal filming conditions feel jarring. Seven weeks in, the disjuncture has passed. I, like all of us, am accommodating to multiple corporeal realities: bodies alone, bodies distant, bodies in the park to be avoided, bodies of disobedient youths hanging out in groups, bodies in lines outside shops, bodies and voices flattened on screens and above all, bodies of dead health workers and carers. Black bodies, brown bodies. Working-class bodies. Bodies not normally praised, now being celebrated. We are learning a whole new etiquette of bodies. We swerve around each other, hop into the near-empty street, calculate distances at entrances to parks, avoid body contact, even eye contact, and keep a look out for those obliviously glued to their phones, whose lack of attention threatens to breach the two-metre rule. It\u2019s odd and disconcerting and isn\u2019t quite second nature. Until the pandemic arrived, many of us were finding texting, email and Whatsapp more suitable to our speeded-up lives. But now we are coming to reuse the telephone, and to enjoy the sounds in our ears and the rhythm of conversation, instead of feeling rushed and interrupted. A few of my sessions as a psychoanalyst are now conducted on the phone but, for the most part, I am spending my time looking into a screen, and seeing faces rather than whole bodies. Until I learned to turn off the view of myself, I, like others, was disconcerted by the oddness of catching sight of myself \u2013 a view I don\u2019t think we are meant to see. Conversations in therapy defy many of the customs of social intercourse. There are silences, repetitions, reframings, links across time, reminiscences of fragments, rushes of emotion, shards of dreams, things told and then disavowed. There can be fidgeting or absolute stillness. These form the idiosyncratic and personal ambience between each therapeutic couple. As a therapist, I am also alert to how the dilemmas that beset the person or the couple I am seeing are brought to our relationship. The conundrums that brought the person to seek therapy in the first place can be replayed right here. For example, a person fearful of intimacy can experience the therapy relationship or the therapist as too close. Someone else who worries they are too needy may be reluctant to show their longings directly to the therapist, although well able to talk about how things go wrong for them in other relationships. The therapy relationship and the sessions are our petri dish. The field of study is the human subject (and her, his or their ways of being able to develop and change). The therapist works to understand an individual\u2019s personal psychological grammar \u2013 to help the person take the risk of unlearning and then learning anew, finding ways to not be in so much hurt. So too with the body. Those with troubled bodies bring them to the session. They may sit too close, for example, or seem to be concave, or dress incongruously, as though presenting a different persona in each session. In the course of therapy, such an abject body experience can be addressed, and, in unlearning and then learning anew, the person finds a more comfortable way to sit in their body. How is the dematerialisation of bodies affecting us and going to affect us? Me, my patients, you \u2013 all of us? For some of my patients, their screen or home is a prison. Their experience is full of woe and worry. Therapy keeps them just about on the border of sane, but it\u2019s a sanity that hurts: isolation can maraud all of us as we miss the interactions, intimate or casual, that confirm our sense of our value, our place in our community, our work and the world. * * * Some of my clinical preoccupations centre on how we acquire a physical, corporeal sense of self. Although psychoanalysis is a theory of mind and body, its main emphasis has drifted to the development of the mind and its structures: what we call defences, and the relationship patterns we have absorbed. Bodies have been very much the bit player to the main drama of the mind, even when mental processes or disturbance have resulted in bodily symptoms such as eczema or a non-biologically induced paralysis. As therapists, we traditionally read back into the mind the troubles visited on the body, seeing them as the result of mental conflicts. And of course, they often are, but I have long been keen to understand body troubles and body difficulties in their own terms, and to build a theory about the development of the body. Bodies have always been bound and marked by social rules. Different societies make different sense out of similar bodily actions or gestures. The variety of body adornment and transformations around the world, from rings around the neck to the recent upsurge in labial reductions and penis enlargements, has made it ever more apparent that the body is not simply the product of DNA. The body we inhabit develops within relationships to other bodies. Usually it is within the maternal orbit where, to take an obvious example, we first apprehend gender-based forms of comportment. When I grew up, being told to sit like a girl and not to climb trees were some of the ways we were treated differently to boys. Research across many cultures show that baby girls are weaned and potty-trained earlier, fed less at each feed, and held less, than boys. There may be no biological basis to this, but rather a social, unconscious basis that then informs how we personally experience our particular embodiment. We have very few verified reports of humans growing up outside of human culture but the feral child Victor of Aveyron, who was discovered living wild in the woods of southern France in 1800, did not have body movements that were recognisably human. The body-to-body relationship that was foundational for him was with the bodies of the wolves he apparently grew up among. He seemingly mimicked their gait and moves, their posture and their vocalisations. Of course, we know this more familiarly, and less dramatically, from when youngsters develop their group identities by adopting the mannerisms of film actors or musicians. Through screens, billboards and photoshopped images, we reduce the wide variety of bodily expression. It\u2019s as though we are losing body diversity just as we are losing languages. The digitised, westernised body image predominates, and in the last two decades has spawned a cosmetic surgery industry worldwide \u2013 from leg-lengthening surgery using steel rods in China (now banned), to rhinoplasty in Iran (which has the highest rate of nose surgery per capita in the world) to double-eyelid surgery and jawbone reduction in South Korea. In the west, surgeons resculpt cheekbones, breasts and calves, and offer day procedures for facial \u2018thread lifts\u2019. Cosmetic surgery tourism hubs in Hungary, South Korea and Singapore were thriving until the lockdown. One Chinese smartphone app allows the selfie-taker to adjust their portrait to bring it closer to a very specific standard of beauty known as wang hon lian, or \u201cinternet celebrity face\u201d. It\u2019s very popular: billions of wang hon lian images are uploaded every month. The richest Europeans are not in tech, but in the business of beautifying bodies \u2013 the owners of fashion, luxury and cosmetics brands such as LVMH, L\u2019Oreal and Zara. Increasing automation has led us to move from using our bodies to make things to turning our bodies the site and the product of our labour, through diet and exercise regimes, clothing and cosmetics. The surface body is meant to be on display. Paradoxically, the sweating, smelling, holding, stroking body of the other becomes, for those socially distancing, too distant \u2013 while for others, such as those sharing a house with teenage boys, it\u2019s all too present. All is on show for families and housemates, while all is hidden for those living alone during lockdown. The experience of the body on FaceTime or Zoom contrasts with the pulsing, breathing, weeping, sighing, tired, achy or indeed springy and enthusiastic bodies we inhabit. We no longer have social communion in the flesh, the handshake or the hug, the pleasure of eating in a restaurant with a friend or lover while seated near strangers. Afraid of infection, for our protection, we collapse our social space. * * * During the second world war, the psychiatrist Ren\u00e9 Spitz studied orphan babies in care. He discovered that those closest to the nurses\u2019 station thrived, while those at the end of the ward did not do so well. The difference was touch: the nurses would casually touch and interact with those closest to them, and this gave those infants the essential food for physical and psychological development. They absorbed the will to live. A decade later \u2013 in research now considered controversial for the way in which he removed baby monkeys from their mothers \u2013 the American psychologist Harry Harlow discovered that baby monkeys given ersatz mothers in the form of basic cloth puppets would find some crucial security and comfort even in this simulation of maternal touch; those baby monkeys deprived of any kind of maternal touch at all became highly disturbed, and many died. Touch, feel and proximity are central to survival. Consider the genius of premature infants\u2019 capacity to regulate their own and, extraordinarily, their parent\u2019s body temperature, if they are held skin-to-skin in a pouch. The gaze \u2013 the search to be seen, to recognise and to influence the other \u2013 is also crucial to human subjectivity. In a fascinating video made by the developmental psychologist Edward Tronick, he instructs a mother playing with her baby to keep a still face and refrain from interacting with her infant for a minute or two. We observe as the infant girl seeks to engage the mother. When she is unable to, the baby collapses psychologically and physically until contact is restored. What is so shocking is how fast the collapse is. I\u2019ve been thinking of how impossibly difficult and challenging our quasi-dematerialised life through the Zoom screen is, whether chatting with friends or being in a meeting. Conflict and harmony become cartoonish as subtle gestures collapse and the conversations we have with our eyes are shut down. Reading each other well enough is a new skill in the therapy room, too, for both people. By now we are used to the screens and the telephone, and the occasional technical blips. We are seeing a physical interior \u2013 a study, bedroom, shed or kitchen, and being surprised by an occasional child that floats in. We hear the suddenly hushed voice of someone not wanting their partner to get a drift of the conversation we are having. It illuminates aspects we didn\u2019t see before. Is it better? No. Is it worse? Marginally. I miss noticing how people enter the therapy room \u2013 the subtle difference from the session before, or the way they may hold their face and body; above all, the animate body in the room. I suspect that I am more animated to make up for the loss of that precious physicality. Former hostages Terry Waite, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan have all written and spoken eloquently about solitary confinement and their struggles to find a way through and back \u2013 or should I say forward \u2013 to familial and social life. It was tough. And although many of us are not self-isolating alone, unless one is able to do interesting or valued work during this period, or have enough people to hang out with, we can expect considerable psychological difficulties to follow as we come out of lockdown. How will we re-establish social interaction with other bodies? What kind of rhythms will we want and be able to have going forward? Many have been ultra-busy with home schooling, working from home, managing three generations and so on. Time has bent and contracted in perplexing ways. Busyness has increased for some, while others, for whom slowing down is a foreign concept, have had idleness forced on them. Empty time feels alien \u2013 or at least did at the beginning. For many it has been an unexpected pleasure. No need to rush to social occasions. No need to dress. No need to get everything done and more. Being wanted, being needed, being in demand have been psychological supports that have melted away. Finding new ways to nourish one\u2019s needs in this new reality \u2013 especially in the absence of touch and gaze, which we unknowingly rely upon to recognise ourselves \u2013 can be tricky. Today, there is a frightened, wary, social body. A body that is tense, in which avoidance is the watchword. The covered face, whether by a hoodie or a veil, which formerly some found challenging, now offers reassurance. Indeed, many public places \u2013 from Eurostar trains to the streets of New York, Prague, Dubai, Havana and many more \u2013 now demand it. Meanwhile, much of society is now paying attention to bodies that had been scandalously overlooked. The bodies of working women, the carers who go in and out of the houses and homes of the people they look after. The faces of vast numbers of black, Asian and minority-ethnic bodies, particularly in the health service, who are finally being recognised for their value, and the shockingly disproportionate number of their losses. Before Covid-19, the ruling party were happy to slash social and health funding, to put money into management in the NHS, and not into professional carers, doctors and nurses. Now society is waking up to the value of care and medical expertise that comes from the hospital floor \u2013 that is to say, from the doctors and nurses who are reorganising what occurs there. The people keeping society going in every sector \u2013 transport workers, small shopkeepers, workers in food production and delivery \u2013 are often first-generation immigrants. More people are seeing a more nuanced social landscape. The opportunity is here for reframing how we represent the social body. It is of necessity differently hued, and that needs acknowledging, as does the shame of our previous marginalising. Covid-19 is cleaning the lens, so we can see more clearly. * * * From the individual to the social body, and how it is being challenged by the pandemic, we turn to the corporate body \u2013 the body of state \u2013 and what we have been learning about how it has functioned. On 17 April, Prof Anthony Costello, a former director of the Institute for Global Health at UCL, told the select committee on health and social care that he feared Britain might have the highest number of deaths in Europe, which has now been confirmed. Costello had estimated 40,000 deaths; on 5 May the official UK death toll was just over 32,000, but the Financial Times reported the same day that the true figure had likely already surpassed Costello\u2019s estimate. London and the north-west of England are showing higher rates of death than other regions, while according to the ONS, people in the most deprived areas of England and Wales are dying at twice the rate of the most affluent areas. Costello argued for this figure because we were slow off the mark to take precautionary moves early on. He spoke to the chair of the committee, Jeremy Hunt, who has spent this period appearing to stress about the lack of testing, ventilators and PPE equipment. This is the same Hunt who, as the longest serving health secretary in British history, also had social care in his portfolio, and the pay of doctors, nurses and social care workers. Even more damningly, he was the minister in charge during Exercise Cygnus, the UK government\u2019s drill to test our preparedness for a pandemic, carried out in 2016. The full review of Exercise Cygnus has never been officially published, but leaks have revealed that it showed the UK\u2019s health system and local authorities were woefully unprepared for such an eventuality. The exercise showed hospitals and mortuaries being quickly overwhelmed, and shortages of critical care beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for hospital staff. Cygnus, and other such exercises, are meant to show the government what they need to do to be prepared \u2013 which was not, as Hunt was doing, cutting beds. On 28 March of this year, when the Cygnus debacle came to light, we were told that the projections were not remedied because of worries that beds, ventilators and PPE would become outmoded or obsolete and that the government had worked on securing reliable supply chains. (As we have seen, in a pandemic, reliable supply chains become very quickly overwhelmed.) A 2018 Red Cross conference report on Cygnus and infectious diseases stated: \u201cThe financial and human cost of an outbreak can be staggering and early response reduces the cost.\u201d Our government chose not to act. The Fund for Peace, the Washington-based NGO that publishes the annual Fragile States Index, lists criteria for a failed state. I think we have come dangerously close to fulfilling two of their criteria: the inability to provide public services for the poor, and the inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community. As these last months\u2019 farcical developments show \u2013 the question about the independence of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the alleged missing communications with the EU on PPE, the political decision not to cooperate with the EU, the posting out of tests without return envelopes, and the expired dates on PPE equipment \u2013 the government is in Fawlty Towers territory. Plans for British companies to design new ventilator machines, detailed by the Financial Times, went belly up. Our government chose to source new ideas rather build to the existing plan under licence. Why, one must ask? Could it be Brexit hubris? I don\u2019t want to contrast the UK\u2019s response with that of the EU, because the latter has not always covered itself in glory during the pandemic. The ethics of cooperation in Europe and the ethics of transparency and honesty have been mightily tested in the past months. Perhaps now though we can be encouraged by the joint project of the European Investment Banks and WHO to bolster global healthcare systems. Will the UK state be contributing? I think not. So much depends on the actions of citizens now to move things forward. In this light, it is encouraging to see the formation of a new independent panel of experts \u2013 a \u201crival\u201d to Sage \u2013 led by the former UK government chief scientific adviser David King, whose deliberations are on YouTube for us to watch. I am not sure how we characterise the following failure of the state, because it is in part the expression of public good: of the 750,000 people who signed up to volunteer to help the NHS, invited by the government, fewer than 100,000 have been deployed. As citizens, we want to contribute. This squandering of people\u2019s generosity is disturbing. Fortunately, people such as Capt Tom Moore or the many making masks and contributing 3D printers keep on going. And the programme Feed NHS, in which the restaurant chain Leon and other chefs are prepping to feed patients, doctors, nurses, hospital porters and ambulance workers, is now in train. This voluntary work, in which groups of people self-organise, is outstanding, and yet it is in contrast to the inability of our state to mobilise those who wanted to help. The Gates Foundation\u2019s contributions to seven different vaccine programmes, and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey\u2019s donation of $1bn, are impressive. Will hedge funds in the UK such as Ruffer investment, which pocketed \u00a32.4bn in March, or Somerset Capital (the fund Jacob Rees Mogg used to run) who see Covid-19 as a \u201conce or twice in a generation\u201d opportunity for investment, make a contribution, too? There are several dozen UK-based hedge funds managing assets worth \u00a31bn or more. Could the mood of the country be such that hedge fund investors and managers might be persuaded to donate some of their obscene profits to the coronavirus response or to sponsor migrants from beyond Europe (who work here as cleaners, carers, drivers), who do not earn the \u00a330,000 currently demandedfor a work permit? * * * Covid is a sad story. It is also a story of resilience. The body of state has failed us. We need to grow up and recognise that. Covid-19 has exposed unforgivable systemic failure. In the years leading up to this, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the status of civil servants and a downgrading of health workers. We have seen teachers, doctors and academics hidebound in a managerial economy. At least it seems that micromanagement has been temporarily overturned in hospitals, thank goodness, because right now doctors and nurses need to be running the show. And to return to our bodies \u2013 the live ones, so many devoid of touch and gaze, facing a long period of isolation, and frightened. How can I conclude? In a way, I can\u2019t. We are far from the other side of this crisis. Psychological therapies are going to have a huge part to play in the remaking of body and soul. I don\u2019t much like the word trauma, because it has become so overused, but we are a society that is in trauma. A societal trauma gives opportunities for people to go through things together, rather than suffer alone, as long as we don\u2019t bury or make light of what we have experienced and continue to experience. We will have to find new ways to live with our fears and discomforts, to overcome Covid-minted social phobias, with what we project on to other people\u2019s bodies and the fears we have about our own vulnerabilities. We will need all the help we can get in reshaping our relationship to our own and each other\u2019s bodies, to find a way to build bonds of attachment and respect. What started with the dematerialisation of the individual body has now morphed into the dematerialisation of the body of state. The economist Joseph Stiglitz reminds us that, with the stripping back of the state under Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, we lost capacity. This needs to be addressed. There is a lively debate from a range of economists on how to get to a more equitable economy. Moneyweek editor-in-chief Merryn Somerset Webb\u2019s call for a sovereign wealth fund, with the government owning shares in bailed-out companies, is interesting, as is political economist Will Hutton\u2019s idea of expanding the British Business Bank and the Future Fund. UCL economics professor Mariana Mazzucato insists that the state must invest in innovation. We began trying to make a different kind of society after the second world war. We will have to do that again. Principally, we will need to recognise the contributions and the losses of the UK\u2019s minority and working-class people, above all. Our governments have shamed themselves through creating divisions in society, particularly since austerity was imposed under David Cameron\u2019s government. Now we have an unexpected chance to redress the divisive fallout of Brexit. The impact of remote working and the need to balance domestic and work life, allied with dire warnings on mass unemployment, gives us an opportunity to write a social contract in which we divide work more fairly. At both ends of the pay scale, people overwork. The evidence for a more balanced relationship between work and home is compelling. Since the crisis began, the outpourings of artists, musicians, programmers, cultural and scientific workers at all levels has been outstanding. The talent, the will, the desire is there to remake our world. The urgency is not in question. Globalism can\u2019t simply be a celebration of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d deliveries. It will need to be recast as mutuality \u2013 local and global mutuality \u2013 so that we learn from each other, including those who\u2019ve been in lockdown in war zones. Our institutions will need to be rebuilt with transparency, with heart and by learning from the people who have been staffing them, not just the managers and owners. Doctors, nurses, carers and delivery people have things to say about how their institutions could be better run. The body politic and the politics of the bodies that make up our world must be reconfigured, and we need to start thinking about that now. I conclude with Freud: \u201cThe aim of psychoanalysis is to turn hysteria into ordinary human unhappiness.\u201d That is an accomplishment for an individual and for a society. We cannot escape unhappiness. It is constitutive of being human, just as are creativity, courage, ambition, attachment and love. Let\u2019s embrace the complexity of what it means to be human in this time of sorrow as we think and feel our way to come out of this, wiser, humbler and more connected.

      "bodyText": "Health authorities have fined a Queensland company run by a convicted rapist $63,000 for making false claims that its coronavirus test kits had been approved or endorsed by Australian and US authorities. Promedical Equipment Pty Ltd has been linked to a series of collapsed deals to supply large quantities of its rapid Covid-19 test kits \u2013 including to the governments of Australia and Puerto Rico. Guardian Australia has previously revealed the company obtained approvals as a supplier of a Chinese-made Covid-19 antibody test, but no others. When that deal collapsed, the Brisbane company, which has no diagnostic experience, said it began manufacturing its own test kits, which were unsanctioned and unproven. It then continued to falsely claim in marketing material that its tests had approvals from the Therapeutic Goods Administration and the US Food and Drug Administration. The TGA on Thursday announced it had issued five fines totalling $63,000 for advertising breaches. \u201cIt is alleged that the company claimed or implied on its website and via social media that the TGA and the FDA had endorsed or approved a Covid-19 rapid test kit,\u201d a statement by the TGA said. \u201cAdvertisements for therapeutic goods must not make any statement that implies the goods have been recommended or approved by government, except in very limited circumstances.

Promedical\u2019s two shares were purchased for $2 by De Silva\u2019s partner. Before the pandemic it sold cryogenic, massage therapy and erectile dysfunction machines. In March, the company made headlines when it claimed to be able to supply hospitals and clinics with five million tests each week. It entered into a contract, which was never fulfilled, to sell 500,000 test kits to the Australian government. It had been involved in negotiations with \u2013 and sent invoices to \u2013 a US logistics company and intermediaries working for the government of Puerto Rico for deals involving the supply of a large number of devices. Both deals collapsed and no money or devices ever changed hands. In Puerto Rico, which has the lowest testing rate of any US state or territory, the deal to buy rapid antibody tests was a key component of its coronavirus response, at a critical point. The TGA said: \u201cIn light of the pandemic, Covid-19 advertising that is incorrect and misleading is of significant concern to the TGA.

Where appropriate this may include criminal or civil court proceedings, which can result in substantial penalties, fines or imprisonment. \u201cAny person, including businesses, must comply with the requirements for advertising.\u201d Promedical confirmed it had received fines \u201cas a result of advertising rules the company had breached\u201d. \u201cPromedical has made the necessary changes to follow the advertising rules set out by the TGA,\u201d a company spokeswoman said. \u201cPromedical continues to work closely with the TGA to prevent this happening in the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has again suggested the US may need to accept the reality of more deaths in order to start reopening the economy, as governments around the world continued to ease out of lockdown restrictions.

Worldwide there were more than 3.75 million cases and 263,831 people had died from the disease, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. But there were more signs of light at the end of the tunnel for people around the world still constrained by lockdown rules. New Zealanders have been celebrating the potential widespread relaxation of restrictions and a return to normal life next week after the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she could allow bars, offices and hairdressers to reopen. Her cabinet will meet on Monday to decide whether to ease restrictions, which could also see gatherings of up to 100 people allowed for the first since March and the resumption of professional sport, albeit behind closed doors. The easing would go much further than relaxations in countries such as Germany and Spain where large gatherings are still prohibited. Ardern said the country, which on Thursday had one new case of Covid-19, two people in hospital and no new deaths, was \u201chalfway down Everest\u201d in its bid to exit what has been one of the world\u2019s toughest lockdown regimes. But she warned: \u201cThere is a much higher level of individual responsibly required at level two to prevent the spread of the virus. Even though the economy will be significantly opened up we still need everyone to remain vigilant and continue to act like you and those around you have the virus.\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, is widely expected to announce similar relaxations after a scheduled meeting of the national cabinet on Friday. In the UK, Boris Johnson has also signalled that some restrictions could be lifted from Monday allowing people to go sunbathing and to have picnics as long as they stay a safe distance from people not in their household. Despite recording more than 6,000 new cases on Tuesday, the government was preparing to push a new message \u2013 \u201cStay Safe, Save Lives\u201d \u2013 compared with the \u201cStay Home, Save Lives\u201d slogan used during the lockdown so far. However a picture of the continuing threat of the disease emerged from China. President Xi Jinping reportedly told a meeting of the ruling standing committee that the virus was still spreading overseas and the battle against Covid-19 was continuing, especially in Hubei province where the disease is believed to have originated. Announcing improved healthcare structures, reform of disease prevention and control systems, increased epidemic monitoring and early warning capabilities, Xi called for \u201cunrelenting epidemic containment measures in Hubei province even as it has switched to epidemic control and prevention efforts on a regular basis\u201d. In other developments around the world: Trump said on Wednesday he would be able to report in about a week or two whether China was fulfilling its obligations under a phase-one trade deal signed in January before coronavirus spread globally. The two nations are embroiled in a war of words about the origins of the virus, with Trump warning that China\u2019s alleged failure to warn the world could jeopardise their trade. All 400,000 protective gowns shipped to Britain from Turkey failed to meet NHS standards, it has emerged. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed on Wednesday evening that the items were being held in a facility near Heathrow airport and would likely be sent back. Share markets in Asia were subdued on Thursday after warnings that the eurozone could see its worst ever recession. The FTSE100 is expected to open flat in London while Wall Street was set for bigger gains. Officials in Washington state have condemned a rise in so-called \u201cCovid\u201d parties where people gather in numbers with the idea of contracting the disease and gaining immunity.",

On the second day we awoke at 2am to hike up Seruni Point, which is directly opposite Mount Bromo. After around an hour of hiking we found a spot to settle down, eat breakfast and wait for sunrise. Although we knew we had picked a good spot, it wasn\u2019t until later that we really appreciated how lucky we were. This was the view that welcomed us when the sun came up.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Testing still falling short of target</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray leading you on a quick ramble through the news.</p> \n<p>Picnics, sunbathing and unlimited rambling are thought to be among the first activities set to be allowed when the lockdown loosens starting on Monday. Stringent restrictions are due to be reviewed today with details to be announced on Sunday. Boris Johnson is expected to change the rules so that people would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/picnics-and-sunbathing-on-cards-as-pm-expected-to-allow-more-time-outside\">able to leave the house repeatedly in a single day</a> while still having to keep a safe distance from anyone not of their household.</p> \n<p>The health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s claim to have triumphed in meeting his goal of 100,000 tests a day appears in serious doubt after the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/boris-johnson-misses-coronavirus-testing-target-for-fourth-day-in-a-row\">failed for the fourth time in a row to hit the target</a>. The prime minister has set out a new target of capacity for 200,000 tests a day by the end of May. But on Wednesday just 69,463 tests<strong> </strong>were carried out or posted, and because some were done twice only 57,006 people were actually tested. The results of hundreds of thousands of tests done at drive-through centres in England have not yet been shared with GPs or local authorities, who complain they have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/we-have-had-zero-information-gps-in-the-dark-over-covid-19-tests\">\u201cno idea\u201d where local disease clusters are</a>. The government has said it is still \u201cworking on a technical solution\u201d to get Covid-19 test results into individual GP records.</p> \n<p>Half of parents with young children are struggling to make ends meet during the coronavirus pandemic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/coronavirus-half-of-uk-parents-with-young-children-face-money-woes-survey\">almost as many say they have nearly run out of money</a>, according to a survey involving the London School of Economics, Queen Mary University and major women\u2019s policy groups. Sam Smethers from the Fawcett Society said: \u201cA significant increase in child benefit of \u00a350 per week per child and setting pay for all key workers at real living wage levels would make a real difference. Government could do this now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hairdressers, bars and competitive sport could be back on the agenda for New Zealanders from next week as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the country was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/global-report-deaths-are-price-of-reopening-says-trump-as-china-warns-risks-remain\">\u201chalf-way down Everest\u201d in its fight against Covid-19</a>. In the US, Donald Trump has reversed course to say his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/trump-coronavirus-white-house-taskforce-covid-19\">coronavirus taskforce will \u201ccontinue on indefinitely\u201d</a> \u2013 while causing revulsion with his suggestion the country will just have to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/trump-economy-reopen-us-experts-warning\">accept more people dying as the cost of reopening the economy</a>. At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/06/coronavirus-update-cases-uk-live-news-us-task-force-trump-covid-19-usa-world-europe-deaths-brazil-brasil-israel?page=with:block-5eb2b6018f0898654cef9919#block-5eb2b6018f0898654cef9919\">are believed to have been infected</a>, the International Council of Nurses says, noting that the true figure could be twice that. The EU is to propose a mechanism to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/eu-to-propose-process-for-how-who-can-learn-from-covid-19-outbreak\">learn from the coronavirus pandemic</a> at the next meeting of the WHO \u2013 but will stop short of calls from the US and Australia for a full international inquiry.</p> \n<p>More developments <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/07/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-covid-19-task-force-to-continue-indefinitely-as-us-china-rift-widens\">at our live blog</a> and here is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">summary of the main points</a>.</p> \n<p><em>There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Deadly gas leak in India \u2013&nbsp;</strong>In breaking news this morning a gas leak at chemical factory in southern India has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/gas-leak-at-chemical-factory-in-india-kills-hospitalises-lg-polymers\">killed at least six people and led to more than 120 people being admitted to hospital</a> and the evacuation of three nearby villages. Styrene leaked from the Korean-owned LG Polymers plant during the early hours while people slept, said a local official in Andra Pradesh state. \u201cHundreds of people have inhaled it and either fell unconscious or having breathing issues,\u201d said Srijana Gummalla. More than 120 villagers were taken to hospitals and at least three surrounding villages were being evacuated, an official said. South Korean battery maker LG Chemical Ltd, the owner of the facility and part of the LG conglomerate, was not immediately available for comment.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Maduro fiasco soldier speaks \u2013 </strong>An American mercenary captured in Venezuela has said in a stage-managed TV appearance that he was on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/venezuela-maduro-abduction-plot-luke-denman-americans-captured\">Trump-sanctioned mission to abduct its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro</a>. Luke Denman is one of two US citizens seized by Venezuelan security forces this week. He said he worked for Silvercorp, a Florida private security firm run by Jordan Goudreau, a former US soldier who has claimed the raid was intended to \u201cliberate Venezuela\u201d. Maduro, brandishing a contract allegedly showing the mission was commissioned by his opposition rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, said: \u201cDonald Trump is behind all of this.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the US would \u201cuse every tool\u201d to get the captured Americans back, while stoking intrigue by saying there was no \u201cdirect\u201d US government involvement in the raid.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bibi and Benny team up \u2013 </strong>Israel\u2019s supreme court has approved a coalition agreement between the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Benny Gantz, paving the way for the formation next week of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/israel-netanyahu-and-gantz-get-supreme-court-nod-for-coalition\">unity government in which they will alternate as prime minister</a>. The supreme court said it \u201cwas not seeking to diminish the severity\u201d of charges against Netanyahu whose corruption trial is due to start on 24 May. But it concluded those could be handled without blocking the new government. It will be Israel\u2019s first government since December 2018 when the Knesset was dissolved. No one gained a majority in successive elections. Meanwhile in Iraq a new prime minister has taken charge after months of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/iraq-appoints-new-prime-minister-after-months-of-protests-and-jockeying\">protests and political jockeying</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Barclay rift blown open \u2013 </strong>Sir Frederick Barclay\u2019s nephews sold the Ritz for \u201chalf the market price\u201d after bugging conversations with a Saudi investor who offered \u00a31.3bn for the London hotel, the high court has heard. Barclay, 85, and his daughter, Amanda, are suing three of his twin brother Sir David Barclay\u2019s sons \u2013 Alistair, Aidan and Howard \u2013 and Aidan\u2019s son, Andrew, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/06/frederick-barclays-nephews-taped-1000-of-his-conversations\">over 1,000 conversations allegedly tapped using an \u201celaborate system of covert recording\u201d</a>.<strong> </strong>The claimants state discussions were eavesdropped about an offer for the Ritz from Saudi-based Sidra Capital. The 114-year-old hotel was sold by David\u2019s side of the family in March for significantly less to Abdulhadi Mana al-Hajri, a Qatari businessman. Hefin Rees QC, representing Frederick and Amanda, said in a written submission that the defendants \u201cderived significant financial and commercial advantage from the unlawful use of the recordings\u201d. The case continues.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>\u201cIt must be painful to be racist right now. Knowing that if you become sick, a black or brown person is highly likely to be involved in the hard, dangerous service of trying to save you. If you need transport to work, a black or brown person is disproportionately likely to be involved in getting you there \u2026 I don\u2019t believe Britain is a country of racists.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Testing still falling short of target Hello, Warren Murray leading you on a quick ramble through the news. Picnics, sunbathing and unlimited rambling are thought to be among the first activities set to be allowed when the lockdown loosens starting on Monday. Stringent restrictions are due to be reviewed today with details to be announced on Sunday. Boris Johnson is expected to change the rules so that people would be able to leave the house repeatedly in a single day while still having to keep a safe distance from anyone not of their household. The health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s claim to have triumphed in meeting his goal of 100,000 tests a day appears in serious doubt after the government failed for the fourth time in a row to hit the target. The prime minister has set out a new target of capacity for 200,000 tests a day by the end of May. But on Wednesday just 69,463 tests were carried out or posted, and because some were done twice only 57,006 people were actually tested. The results of hundreds of thousands of tests done at drive-through centres in England have not yet been shared with GPs or local authorities, who complain they have \u201cno idea\u201d where local disease clusters are. The government has said it is still \u201cworking on a technical solution\u201d to get Covid-19 test results into individual GP records. Half of parents with young children are struggling to make ends meet during the coronavirus pandemic and almost as many say they have nearly run out of money, according to a survey involving the London School of Economics, Queen Mary University and major women\u2019s policy groups. Sam Smethers from the Fawcett Society said: \u201cA significant increase in child benefit of \u00a350 per week per child and setting pay for all key workers at real living wage levels would make a real difference. Government could do this now.\u201d Hairdressers, bars and competitive sport could be back on the agenda for New Zealanders from next week as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the country was \u201chalf-way down Everest\u201d in its fight against Covid-19. In the US, Donald Trump has reversed course to say his coronavirus taskforce will \u201ccontinue on indefinitely\u201d \u2013 while causing revulsion with his suggestion the country will just have to accept more people dying as the cost of reopening the economy. At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally are believed to have been infected, the International Council of Nurses says, noting that the true figure could be twice that. The EU is to propose a mechanism to learn from the coronavirus pandemic at the next meeting of the WHO \u2013 but will stop short of calls from the US and Australia for a full international inquiry. More developments at our live blog and here is a summary of the main points. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Deadly gas leak in India \u2013 In breaking news this morning a gas leak at chemical factory in southern India has killed at least six people and led to more than 120 people being admitted to hospital and the evacuation of three nearby villages. Styrene leaked from the Korean-owned LG Polymers plant during the early hours while people slept, said a local official in Andra Pradesh state. \u201cHundreds of people have inhaled it and either fell unconscious or having breathing issues,\u201d said Srijana Gummalla. More than 120 villagers were taken to hospitals and at least three surrounding villages were being evacuated, an official said. South Korean battery maker LG Chemical Ltd, the owner of the facility and part of the LG conglomerate, was not immediately available for comment. * * * Maduro fiasco soldier speaks \u2013 An American mercenary captured in Venezuela has said in a stage-managed TV appearance that he was on a Trump-sanctioned mission to abduct its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Luke Denman is one of two US citizens seized by Venezuelan security forces this week. He said he worked for Silvercorp, a Florida private security firm run by Jordan Goudreau, a former US soldier who has claimed the raid was intended to \u201cliberate Venezuela\u201d. Maduro, brandishing a contract allegedly showing the mission was commissioned by his opposition rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, said: \u201cDonald Trump is behind all of this.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said the US would \u201cuse every tool\u201d to get the captured Americans back, while stoking intrigue by saying there was no \u201cdirect\u201d US government involvement in the raid. * * * Bibi and Benny team up \u2013 Israel\u2019s supreme court has approved a coalition agreement between the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Benny Gantz, paving the way for the formation next week of a unity government in which they will alternate as prime minister. The supreme court said it \u201cwas not seeking to diminish the severity\u201d of charges against Netanyahu whose corruption trial is due to start on 24 May. But it concluded those could be handled without blocking the new government. It will be Israel\u2019s first government since December 2018 when the Knesset was dissolved. No one gained a majority in successive elections. Meanwhile in Iraq a new prime minister has taken charge after months of protests and political jockeying. * * * Barclay rift blown open \u2013 Sir Frederick Barclay\u2019s nephews sold the Ritz for \u201chalf the market price\u201d after bugging conversations with a Saudi investor who offered \u00a31.3bn for the London hotel, the high court has heard. Barclay, 85, and his daughter, Amanda, are suing three of his twin brother Sir David Barclay\u2019s sons \u2013 Alistair, Aidan and Howard \u2013 and Aidan\u2019s son, Andrew, over 1,000 conversations allegedly tapped using an \u201celaborate system of covert recording\u201d. The claimants state discussions were eavesdropped about an offer for the Ritz from Saudi-based Sidra Capital. The 114-year-old hotel was sold by David\u2019s side of the family in March for significantly less to Abdulhadi Mana al-Hajri, a Qatari businessman. Hefin Rees QC, representing Frederick and Amanda, said in a written submission that the defendants \u201cderived significant financial and commercial advantage from the unlawful use of the recordings\u201d. The case continues. Coronavirus Extra \u201cIt must be painful to be racist right now. Knowing that if you become sick, a black or brown person is highly likely to be involved in the hard, dangerous service of trying to save you. If you need transport to work, a black or brown person is disproportionately likely to be involved in getting you there \u2026 I don\u2019t believe Britain is a country of racists. But we have been conditioned to erase the contribution of ethnic minorities to our national identity.\u201d Afua Hirsch on why, after coronavirus, BAME people must be kept at the heart of Britain\u2019s story. Memories of beaches \u2013 in the UK or further afield \u2013 as well as village bars, sunrise views and days out with tea and cake are sustaining readers during lockdown. Read their best tips. \u201cI miss math the most \u2026\u201d Photographer Matt Eich talked to his youngest daughter, Meira, about being quarantined in Charlottesville, Virginia. This is what she told him. Today in Focus podcast: Lifting lockdown in poorest US state Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops. Oliver Laughland went to the resort of Biloxi to see how residents were responding. Lunchtime read: Patterns of pain We can expect psychological difficulties to follow as we come out of lockdown. But we have an opportunity to remake our relationship with our bodies, and the social body we belong to, writes Susie Orbach. Sport England\u2019s Test cricketers have been told to expect daily temperature checks, regular Covid-19 swabs and possibly nine weeks away from their families under ambitious plans to get the series against West Indies and Pakistan played. The England women\u2019s team could in effect be sacrificed this summer as the England and Wales Cricket Board seeks to mitigate a potential \u00a3380m loss caused by the pandemic. England expect Joe Marler to be available for selection when international rugby resumes amid suggestions the loosehead prop was considering walking away from the sport. Organised sport will resume in the Netherlands from 1 September, but recreational golf and tennis will be allowed from Monday. NBA teams are expected to get the go-ahead to reopen practice facilities for limited use as early as Friday, less than two months after the coronavirus outbreak forced the suspension of the season. And in Australia the rugby league player Bryce Cartwright says he will not be bullied into getting a flu shot after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, called for the league to adopt a \u201cno jab, no play\u201d approach. Business Share markets in Asia have been subdued after warnings that the eurozone could see its worst ever recession. The FTSE100 is expected to open flat in London later in the day while Wall Street is set for bigger gains. The pound is buying $1.232 and \u20ac1.141. The papers The Guardian leads with \u201cLandmark test target that keeps being missed\u201d \u2013 the Metro focuses on that too \u2013 with our paper giving downpage billing for \u201cPicnics and rambles set to be allowed next week\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of excitement about the latter prospect: \u201cHurrah! Lockdown freedom beckons\u201d enthuses the Mail. The Express joins the chorus: \u201cFirst steps to freedom from Monday\u201d and the Sun calls it \u201cHappy Monday\u201d. There are \u201cFive steps to end of lockdown\u201d says the Mirror, setting out a calendar for easing restrictions that stretches into October. \u201cStay home advice to be scrapped\u201d says the Telegraph, whereas the FT goes a bit deeper in its headline: \u201cJohnson looks to border checks as price of lockdown relaxation\u201d \u2013 it reports on the possibility of 14 days\u2019 quarantine for all arrivals into the UK, including locals.

Bats also need to pass the disease on to humans. There is no evidence of this being done directly for coronaviruses. Until now there has been an intermediary \u2013 either a domesticated animal or a wild animal which humans came into contact with for food, trade, pets or medicine. In the 2003 Sars outbreak in China, it was a civet cat. In the Mers outbreak in the Middle East in 2012, it was a camel.

Most are harmless to humans, but two very closely related sarbecoviruses found in east Asia were responsible for Sars and Covid-19. The paper says future sarbecovirus emergence will certainly take place in east Asia, but epidemics of other new diseases could be triggered elsewhere.</p> \n<p>South America is a key area of concern due to the rapid clearance of the Amazon and other forests. Scientists in Brazil have found viral prevalence was 9.3% among bats near deforested sites, compared to 3.7% in pristine woodland. \u201cWith deforestation and land-use change, you open a door,\u201d said Alessandra Nava, of the Manaus-based Biobank research centre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5051874133066b8a1e2898f5231c456d8233c3fd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5051874133066b8a1e2898f5231c456d8233c3fd/7_0_1639_2048/800.jpg\" alt=\"Civet cat in a cage\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The virus that caused the 2003 Sars outbreak in China came from bats via a civet cat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Hilton/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She said diseases were naturally diluted in the wild, but this broke down when humans rapidly disrupted the ecological balance.

Right now we deal with them far too promiscuously.\u201d</p> \n<p>Her conclusions were echoed by Tierra Smiley Evans, an epidemiologist at the University of California who studies virus distributions in the rapidly degrading forests of Myanmar. She has found that endangered or threatened species are more likely to have viruses than animals at lower risk of habitat loss and hunting. She said the connection between environmental stress and human health had been made more apparent by Covid-19 pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that one of the most positive things to come out of horrible tragedy will be the realisation that there is a link between how we treat the forest and our wellbeing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really impacts our health.

Although this would be expensive, they said it would more economically efficient than waiting for an outbreak to become a pandemic, which forces the world into lockdown.</p> \n<p>They also emphasised that bat culls and bans on wet markets were likely to be ineffective and could prove counterproductive because bats play an important role in insect control and plant pollination. \u201cLiving safely with bats is what we should be focusing on, not eliminating them,\u201d Evans said.</p> \n<p>Conservation groups have also urged greater protection of existing habitats. A recent Greenpeace <a href=\"https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/04/24/deforestation-amazon-next-pandemic-covid-coronavirus/\">report </a>warned the Amazon could see the next spillover of zoonotic viruses because the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, is putting a higher priority on opening up the forest than protecting people\u2019s health.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable. His appetite for destruction is fuelling the current health crisis and will make future crises we face even worse,\u201d Daniela Montalto, Greenpeace forests campaigner, said. \u201cHe must be stopped and forest protection prioritised.

That allows virus mutations to jump to other species,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to think about how we treat wild animals and nature. Right now we deal with them far too promiscuously.\u201d Her conclusions were echoed by Tierra Smiley Evans, an epidemiologist at the University of California who studies virus distributions in the rapidly degrading forests of Myanmar. She has found that endangered or threatened species are more likely to have viruses than animals at lower risk of habitat loss and hunting. She said the connection between environmental stress and human health had been made more apparent by Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that one of the most positive things to come out of horrible tragedy will be the realisation that there is a link between how we treat the forest and our wellbeing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really impacts our health. It is not just a wildlife issue or an environmental issue.\u201d To prevent future pandemics, the academics said international cooperation was needed to encourage monitoring and education at a local level so that virus outbreaks could be detected and contained at an early stage. Although this would be expensive, they said it would more economically efficient than waiting for an outbreak to become a pandemic, which forces the world into lockdown. They also emphasised that bat culls and bans on wet markets were likely to be ineffective and could prove counterproductive because bats play an important role in insect control and plant pollination. \u201cLiving safely with bats is what we should be focusing on, not eliminating them,\u201d Evans said. Conservation groups have also urged greater protection of existing habitats. A recent Greenpeace report warned the Amazon could see the next spillover of zoonotic viruses because the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, is putting a higher priority on opening up the forest than protecting people\u2019s health. \u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable. His appetite for destruction is fuelling the current health crisis and will make future crises we face even worse,\u201d Daniela Montalto, Greenpeace forests campaigner, said. \u201cHe must be stopped and forest protection prioritised. Without it, we will all pay the price.\u201d",

With some doubles, those tests were provided to a total of 57,006 people.</p> \n<p>The government has acknowledged that large-scale testing and contact tracing will be vital to end the lockdown, but experts warned that the UK\u2019s low levels and patchy availability for NHS sites and care homes meant that would not be possible yet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/daily_testing-zip/giv-3902QNTwB5pTZszR/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/daily_testing-zip/giv-3902QNTwB5pTZszR/\">Graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>When Hancock announced on Friday that he had been successful in reaching his goal by hitting more than 122,000 tests on the day, he described the landmark as an \u201cincredible achievement\u201d and said that testing was \u201ccrucial to suppress the virus\u201d and would \u201chelp us to unlock the lockdown\u201d.</p> \n<p>But after hitting the target again on Saturday, the figure has remained below 100,000 ever since, amid fresh shortages of chemical reagent in some areas \u2013 with ministers also accused of fiddling the figures by including tests posted out but not yet completed.</p> \n<p>A Department of Health and Social Care source argued the target had always been about showing it was possible to hit 100,000 if the demand was there and claimed it had been lower because the number of people with symptoms was falling. \u201cWe used the language originally that we wanted to show we could reach 100,000 a day by the end of the month but we were not necessarily expecting to hit 100,000 every day,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>When he announced his pledge on 2 April, Hancock said: \u201cI\u2019m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I\u2019m determined to get there.\u201d</p> \n<p>The latest figures came as government data showed that new infections had topped 6,000 again \u2013 the highest level for five days \u2013 calling into question the idea that demand for tests would be falling. After the UK\u2019s death toll became the worst in Europe on Tuesday, a further 649 deaths were announced on Wednesday, taking the total to 30,076.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b768d0a9-0396-458b-be59-8c1f042adefe\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>On 18 May, Matt Hancock announced coronavirus testing is being extended in the UK to anyone over the age of five with symptoms.</p>\n    <p>Before then,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\">eligibility had been limited</a>&nbsp;to a series of groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups.</p>\n    <p>Those with symptoms can now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\">use the gov.uk website to book</a> home test kits or appointments at drive-through centres across the country.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While some have questioned whether the 100,000 target was arbitrary, experts say that to exit the lockdown testing will have to be widely available to members of the community again, so that new outbreaks can be stamped out.</p> \n<p>Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital leaders, warned there were still \u201ctoo many health and care staff and patients with Covid-19 symptoms who can\u2019t get access to rapid turnaround tests when they need them\u201d, blaming laboratory capacity constraints or testing facilities not being local enough. He said some were now having to wait five days for test results to come back, which was not quick enough.</p> \n<p>He also raised concerns that testing will need to be carried out on all NHS patients and staff as well as care home workers and staff \u201con a frequent and regular basis\u201d if it is to be safe for more services to resume business as normal any time soon.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government\u2019s initial plan of 4 April is now well out of date and desperately needs updating for this next phase,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association council, also said the current levels of testing were not enough.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese latest figures indicate we still have a long way to go to deliver widespread community testing and contact tracing, to be able to properly identify, contain and prevent spread of the virus. Even 100,000 tests a day isn\u2019t enough and anything less shows we really are not prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about sheer numbers either \u2013 these tests need to be targeted effectively.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe government must not distract by the use of arbitrary targets. What we should have is a testing strategy that is effective, with a focus on testing those who need it the most, alongside contact tracing. Only in this way will we have any chance of getting a grip on this pandemic and having some surety in easing the lockdown.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the government needed to up its game if it was serious about a mass testing and contract tracing strategy.</p> \n<p>\u201cFirst Boris Johnson promised us 250,000 tests a day, then 100,000 tests a day.

      "bodyText": "Matt Hancock\u2019s claim to have triumphed in meeting his goal of 100,000 tests a day appears in serious doubt after the government failed for the fourth time in a row to hit the target they believe is crucial for exiting the lockdown. The government\u2019s announcement of the latest figure came after Boris Johnson set out a new target of capacity for 200,000 tests a day by the end of May \u2013 a goal immediately dismissed by medics and opposition figures as a stunt to distract from Wednesday\u2019s shortfall, with just 69,463 tests carried out or posted to recipients. With some doubles, those tests were provided to a total of 57,006 people. The government has acknowledged that large-scale testing and contact tracing will be vital to end the lockdown, but experts warned that the UK\u2019s low levels and patchy availability for NHS sites and care homes meant that would not be possible yet. When Hancock announced on Friday that he had been successful in reaching his goal by hitting more than 122,000 tests on the day, he described the landmark as an \u201cincredible achievement\u201d and said that testing was \u201ccrucial to suppress the virus\u201d and would \u201chelp us to unlock the lockdown\u201d. But after hitting the target again on Saturday, the figure has remained below 100,000 ever since, amid fresh shortages of chemical reagent in some areas \u2013 with ministers also accused of fiddling the figures by including tests posted out but not yet completed. A Department of Health and Social Care source argued the target had always been about showing it was possible to hit 100,000 if the demand was there and claimed it had been lower because the number of people with symptoms was falling. \u201cWe used the language originally that we wanted to show we could reach 100,000 a day by the end of the month but we were not necessarily expecting to hit 100,000 every day,\u201d they said. When he announced his pledge on 2 April, Hancock said: \u201cI\u2019m now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month. That is the goal and I\u2019m determined to get there.\u201d The latest figures came as government data showed that new infections had topped 6,000 again \u2013 the highest level for five days \u2013 calling into question the idea that demand for tests would be falling. After the UK\u2019s death toll became the worst in Europe on Tuesday, a further 649 deaths were announced on Wednesday, taking the total to 30,076. While some have questioned whether the 100,000 target was arbitrary, experts say that to exit the lockdown testing will have to be widely available to members of the community again, so that new outbreaks can be stamped out. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital leaders, warned there were still \u201ctoo many health and care staff and patients with Covid-19 symptoms who can\u2019t get access to rapid turnaround tests when they need them\u201d, blaming laboratory capacity constraints or testing facilities not being local enough. He said some were now having to wait five days for test results to come back, which was not quick enough. He also raised concerns that testing will need to be carried out on all NHS patients and staff as well as care home workers and staff \u201con a frequent and regular basis\u201d if it is to be safe for more services to resume business as normal any time soon. \u201cThe government\u2019s initial plan of 4 April is now well out of date and desperately needs updating for this next phase,\u201d he said. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association council, also said the current levels of testing were not enough. \u201cThese latest figures indicate we still have a long way to go to deliver widespread community testing and contact tracing, to be able to properly identify, contain and prevent spread of the virus. Even 100,000 tests a day isn\u2019t enough and anything less shows we really are not prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about sheer numbers either \u2013 these tests need to be targeted effectively.\u201d He added: \u201cThe government must not distract by the use of arbitrary targets. What we should have is a testing strategy that is effective, with a focus on testing those who need it the most, alongside contact tracing. Only in this way will we have any chance of getting a grip on this pandemic and having some surety in easing the lockdown.\u201d Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the government needed to up its game if it was serious about a mass testing and contract tracing strategy. \u201cFirst Boris Johnson promised us 250,000 tests a day, then 100,000 tests a day. He\u2019s now telling us he\u2019ll deliver us capacity of 200,000 a day while actual testing has dropped below 100,000 four days in a row. Testing, tracing and isolation is crucial to tackling this virus, and ministers needs to grip of this testing strategy urgently.\u201d The health department source also said the number may have been affected by problems with processing at one laboratory. At prime minister\u2019s questions, Johnson told Keir Starmer, the Labour leader: \u201cThe ambition clearly is to get up to 200,000 a day by the end of this month and then to go even higher. A testing regime is going to be critical to our long-term economic recovery.\u201d His spokesman later clarified that he had been talking about testing capacity, rather than actual tests carried out. Following the exchanges in the Commons, Starmer\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe will hold him to that commitment and ask that the prime minister sets out a previous commitment to 250,000 tests a day.\u201d The Liberal Democrats also warned against the 200,000 target being a gimmick to chase headlines. \u201cEven on their dubious accounting, the government has not made the target on a single day since 30 April. The prime minister\u2019s new commitment to 200,000 tests by the end of May must be accompanied by a proper strategy and must not be a headline chasing PR stunt,\u201d Munira Wilson, the Lib Dem spokeswoman on health. \u201cRather than setting another arbitrary target, we need a clear plan that sets out how widespread community testing will be scaled up and easily accessible to all who need it. A large-scale testing programme is an essential part of the plan to test, trace and isolate to keep people safe and save lives, as we ease the country out of lockdown.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Last month, amid dire warnings of shortages of personal protective equipment for health workers, ministers publicised the imminent arrival from Turkey of a fleet of RAF cargo planes bringing in a \u201cvery significant\u201d shipment of PPE for the NHS. More than a fortnight later, it has emerged that every one of the 400,000 protective gowns that eventually arrived has been impounded after being found not to conform to UK standards. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed on Wednesday evening that the items were being held in a facility near Heathrow airport. It is understood that they are due to be sent back and that the DHSC intends to seek a refund, as it has done in similar situations in the past. The announcement of the shipment by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, on 18 April came as unions and professional bodies warned that NHS staff may refuse to work without PPE. Jenrick told the daily Downing Street press briefing that healthcare workers should be \u201cassured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue\u201d, saying they would have the equipment they \u201cneed and deserve\u201d. Sources later told the Guardian that the DHSC had advised No 10 not to allow Jenrick to publicise the shipment in case it backfired, but was overruled. The necessary clearances, it turned out, had not been sought. When the consignment did not arrive on time as promised, the delay prompted hospital leaders to directly attack the government for the first time during the pandemic. Ministers responded by saying they thought it may only a one-day delay. Two days later, with the shipment only then beginning to clear Turkish customs checks, they were only able to give an estimate of arrival \u201cin the next few days\u201d. The first planeload of gowns eventually arrived on 22 April, but the next day it was reported that \u201cless than a 10th\u201d of the order had arrived. Now all are expected to be returned. The saga, first reported by the Telegraph, is one of a series of highly publicised government coronavirus initiatives that have failed to deliver the promised results. Its much-trumpeted \u201cventilator challenge\u201d asked companies such as Rolls-Royce and Dyson to begin producing the machines, but none have reached the final stages of testing and the majority have proved surplus to requirements. And ministers are facing questions over their testing strategy after it emerged on Wednesday that despite briefly passing the 100,000 per day target set for the end of April, using a tally inflated by including tests that had been sent out but not completed, the government had since fallen short of the mark for a fourth day running. In the last few days, a British Medical Association survey has revealed that almost half of England\u2019s doctors have sourced their own PPE or relied on a donation when none was available through normal NHS channels. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \u201cThis is a global pandemic with many countries procuring PPE, leading to shortages around the world, not just the UK. \u201cWe are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically, and brought together the NHS, industry and the armed forces to create a comprehensive PPE distribution network to deliver critical supplies to the frontline. \u201cAll deliveries of PPE are checked to ensure the equipment meets the safety and quality standards our frontline staff need. If equipment does not meet our specifications or pass our quality assurance processes, it is not distributed to the front line.\u201d \u2022 An update on this story was published on 8 May 2020.",

However, the inquiry descended into name-calling when Borsak asked Hazzard whether he would appear before the special commission of inquiry into the Ruby Princess, overseen by Bret Walker SC. On Tuesday, a NSW Health senior epidemiologist, Kelly-Anne Ressler, gave evidence before the commission and became tearful under questioning by Walker. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said Walker was \u201ca bit out of line\u201d and too aggressive.

Hazzard and Chant were also asked about Guardian Australia\u2019s exclusive report that two private medical staff who worked on the Ruby Princess were sent into the Newmarch House aged care facility. Chant said that the company, Aspen Medical, did not tell NSW Health that those nurses had worked on the Ruby Princess. Labor\u2019s Penny Sharpe asked why staff from Aspen Medical were \u201callowed to walk into Newmarch\u201d and what testing they were given. Hazzard told Sharpe her question \u201cshows a profound lack of understanding of the NSW health system\u201d and that \u201cNSW Health has no control over those matters.\u201d Chant said: \u201cThere is no barrier to healthcare staff who worked with Covid-positive patients attending other places providing there is no breach in their PPE.\u201d The parliamentary inquiry will return next week.",

Separately, they have also asked a court in the US to stop creditors taking action against Virgin there or seizing its aircraft. The administrators are trying for a quick sale of the airline, which had debts of about $6.8bn when it collapsed. Virgin Australia\u2019s directors decided to call in administrators on the afternoon of 20 April, after the federal government rejected its bid for a $200m bailout. The airline had earlier requested a $1.4bn loan, but reduced its request in negotiations with the government.

Khan, who is vice-chair of the C40 group, said he was determined to \u201cbuild a better future\u201d in the aftermath of the pandemic. \u201cCovid-19 has exposed the inequality in our society and deep flaws in our economy, which fail people from deprived communities more than anyone else,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to come out of this embracing a new normal and with a renewed drive to address the climate emergency.\u201d In Greater Manchester, council leaders have unveiled plans to give more space for people walking and cycling across the region. With \u00a35m of funding from the mayor, local authorities are planning a range of measures from extending pavements to creating one-way streets, removing through-traffic from residential neighbourhoods and building extra cycle lanes. Last week, mayors from cities in Europe, the US and Africa held talks as part of a newly formed C40 economic task force. They agreed to coordinate efforts to map out plans to support a low-carbon, sustainable recovery from the crisis. Mark Watts, the chief executive of C40, said mayors had a lot of power to protect their citizens and shape the direction of the recovery. \u201cThere is now a hell of a lot of collaboration among very powerful politicians who do think a green economic recovery is absolutely essential,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about collectively creating funds that they all put money into, which would then support electric vehicles, support rollout of cycle lanes, support retrofitting of buildings \u2026 C40 cities using the hundreds of millions of dollars in their pension funds for this and getting very good long-term returns.\u201d The statement of principles has so far been signed by mayors representing 33 world cities from Los Angeles to Lisbon, S\u00e3o Paulo to Seoul, Melbourne to Mexico City. The statement warns that the recovery from Covid-19 \u201cshould not be a return to \u2018business as usual\u2019 \u2013 because that is a world on track for 3C or more of overheating.\u201d It also states that immediate action on the climate will \u201caccelerate economic recovery and enhance social equity, through the use of new technologies and the creation of new industries and new jobs\u201d. Mike Bloomberg, the C40 board president and a former mayor of New York City, said: \u201cThis taskforce is committed to helping city leaders as they work on economic recovery in ways that lead us forward into the future, not back into the past. The principles we\u2019ve outlined will guide our efforts to develop a new normal \u2013 one that is greener, healthier, and more prosperous for everyone.\u201d",

Designed by architect Christopher Hatton Turnor, it was created as a \u2018simple and rural type of building\u2019. This Grade II-listed building included a hostel for the young pottery workers of Compton Pottery, an initiative started largely by Mary Watts and supported by her husband. Image: Watts Gallery, courtesy of the Watts Gallery \u2013 Artists\u2019 Village, 2:C - This painting, completed in 1868, began as a design for the famous Dalziel brothers\u2019 illustrated Bible. It depicts brothers Jacob and Esau, the twin sons of Isaac and Rebekah. Esau was the original hipster, who gave up his birth right to Jacob for the perfect lentil stew. What would Esau have given up for pasta? Was Jacob a stockpiler? Here they are at their reconciliation years later. Image: Jacob and Esau, 1878, George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), Watts Gallery \u2013 Artists\u2019 Village, 3:C - Painted in 1878, Genius of Greek Poetry was said to be inspired by William Wordsworth\u2019s The World is Too Much With Us (1807). Watts\u2019s landscapes show the influence of his travels to Greece in 1856-57, and Wordsworth was also a personal favourite. Mary Watts writes of reading Wordsworth together when Watts was unwell. All \u2018the rush of mountain air that brings to one\u2019, as Mary put it, proved a great tonic. Image: Genius of Greek Poetry, 1878, George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), Watts Gallery \u2013 Artists\u2019 Village, 4:B - As a strong advocate for animal rights, Watts is believed to have taken offence at the ostrich feather Langtry (1853-1929) was wearing in her bonnet, arguing that animals should not be used as embellishment or decoration in women\u2019s clothing. Other works that demonstrate his love of birds and his stance against their thoughtless killing include A Wounded Heron (1837) and A Dedication (1898-99). Image: Mrs Lillie Langtry, 1880, George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), Watts Gallery \u2013 Artists\u2019 Village, 5:C - Mary Watts began work on the interior of the chapel in 1898. The relief designs were created using a combination of materials including chicken wire, sacking hemp, rope, plaster, hatting felt, sewing tape and gesso. Inspired by the Celtic revival and art nouveau movements, the symbolism of the chapel is entirely unique to Mary\u2019s vision. Image: Mary Watts and assistants decorating the interior panels for Watts Chapel, courtesy of the Watts Gallery \u2013 Artists\u2019 Village, 6:B - Painted when Watts was 17, prior to training at the Royal Academy schools, this was probably a private study. The thin layers of rapid brushwork show Watts\u2019s experimental painting techniques. Here the artist could be mistaken for a Byronesque Romantic poet. Watts painted self-portraits throughout his lifetime. He would later explain: \u2018I paint myself constantly, that is to say whenever I want to make an experiment in method or colour.\u2019 Image: Self Portrait, Aged 17, 1834, George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), Watts Gallery \u2013 Artists\u2019 Village, 7:B - Watts repeatedly returned to the tragic tale of Orpheus and Eurydice, in pencil, paint and plaster. Here Watts conveys the moment of high drama in which Orpheus turned to gaze at his wife, who has been banished to Hades. The stream between the figures emphasises the boundary between the earthly realm and underworld, between the living and the dead. Image: Orpheus and Euridice, 1900-03, George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), Watts Gallery \u2013 Artists\u2019 Village, 8:C - Pines grow well in the sandy soils of south-west Surrey, and helped to give the district a late-Victorian reputation for healthfulness. Although the tree that Watts painted has long gone, you will still see pines from its windows when you are able to visit Limnerslease again.

      "bodyText": "In a way, Britain should have been the country best prepared for the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the economy, because throughout 2019 barely a day went past without someone popping up to warn of the dangers of a cliff-edge Brexit. But there are cliff edges and then there\u2019s falling off the cliff, and not even the most pessimistic remainer would have been willing to predict what has happened since the UK went into lockdown at the end of March. While most of the attention has been focused \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 on the medical emergency, the economy has collapsed. This week, figures released by HM Revenue and Customs showed that more than six million jobs had been furloughed under the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme, getting on for a quarter of all British employees. In April 2019, there were 67,873 sales of cars to private buyers; last month there were 871, a drop of 99% to a level last seen in 1946. The Bank of England expects the economy to contract by 14% this year and you have to go back more than 300 years to top that. Almost every part of the economy \u2013 outside food and drink and the public sector \u2013 has been affected.

      "bodyText": "The US will delay its report on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy until after the Chinese government\u2019s major annual meeting later this month, in anticipation of what actions Beijing \u201cmay be contemplating\u201d to further undermine the independence of the semi-autonomous territory. It comes after Beijing\u2019s highest office in Hong Kong referred to the city\u2019s protesters as a \u201cvirus\u201d, which must be eradicated. On Wednesday the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told reporters the department was delaying its first report to Congress assessing Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy to \u201callow us to account for any additional actions that Beijing may be contemplating in the run-up to the National People\u2019s Congress that would further undermine the people of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy as promised by China when they entered the agreement with the people of Hong Kong\u201d. The Chinese Communist party (CCP) had delayed its meetings due to the coronavirus pandemic, but will now go ahead on 22 May. The report is mandated under a US law requiring Washington to assess Hong Kong\u2019s political freedom and relationship with China, and to impose sanctions over any human rights abuses it uncovers. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act was first introduced in 2014 but eventually passed with bipartisan support last November after months of pro-democracy protests and alleged police brutality in Hong Kong. Pompeo was not asked about the delay by reporters in attendance, but observers have speculated it may be related to renewed pushes by Beijing to have Hong Kong enact national security legislation. Last month the head of Beijing\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong said the legislation \u2013 shelved since its introduction in 2003 sparked mass protests \u2013 must be reintroduced to combat radical violence, foreign interference and pro-independence forces in the region. It came amid accusations of interference and overreach by his office and the China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) over a series of public statements about Hong Kong. Beijing has been accused of taking advantage of the world\u2019s focus on the pandemic to make provocative strategic moves, including crackdowns on the Hong Kong protests. More than 7,000 protesters have been arrested over the demonstrations, including more than a dozen high profile pro-democracy figures in February and March. On Wednesday the HKMAO released a statement calling protesters a \u201cvirus\u201d who wanted to \u201cdrag Hong Kong off a cliff\u201d. It said the \u201crecklessly demented force\u201d must be eliminated from the city, and warned that the more sympathy protesters had from Hong Kong residents, the greater price the city would pay. Human Rights Watch said the rhetoric was \u201cchilling and disturbing\u201d and indicated the CCP intended \u201cto assume greater direct control over Hong Kong\u201d. Several protesters told the Guardian they found it alarming but not unexpected, and said they did not think it would deter the protest movement, which had reduced to smaller skirmishes and flash protests in the weeks prior to the pandemic. One said they felt the statement was an attempt to \u201cdehumanise\u201d protesters to allow authorities to use greater force against them. The operator of a social media account associated with the movement said the statement served as \u201can alarming signal for protesters, reminding us to get prepared ASAP to push back even harder against China\u2019s erosion of Hong Kong\u2019s almost-diminished autonomy\u201d. \u201cThere is certainly fear of even more brutal crackdowns on protesters, but there are more and more small local gatherings in neighbourhood malls as the Covid pandemic has eased in Hong Kong, showing us that Hong Kongers have not forgotten our demands,\u201d they said. On Thursday the Hong Kong government supported the HKMAO\u2019s statement, saying the office was authorised by China\u2019s central government to handle Hong Kong affairs and thus had the authority and responsibility to comment on major issues, RTHK News reported.",

And so, Uhlfelder took heed of his enemies\u2019 advice and swapped out the $20 Walmart costume he originally intended to wear and called a friend to see if she might have something better. \u201cShe was like, \u2018I\u2019ve got an idea \u2013 let\u2019s make [the costume] out of linen.\u2019 I had a bathing suit on underneath and flip-flops, so I felt great,\u201d he says. Needless to say, the experience was not entirely pleasant. Uhlfelder says he was heckled on the beach: people took photos of him, called him a jerk and some other, more unpleasant names too. Still, Uhlfelder says the comments don\u2019t bother him \u2013 in fact, he\u2019s not even particularly mad at the beachgoers. Uhlfelder empathizes with people who want the economy to reopen and life to go back to normal \u2013 particularly when the president doesn\u2019t take shutdown seriously. \u201cWe have beautiful beaches, I\u2019d love to go to the beach \u2013 that\u2019s why people come to Florida. We don\u2019t have anything else,\u201d he jokes. But he asks why the US has made the offer of staying at home so unappealing for ordinary Americans. \u201cWe are the wealthiest country on the planet. Why can\u2019t we have people taken care of for two, three, four months, instead of being put in these situations? They are perfectly comfortable starving out or killing people,\u201d he says. Most people have reacted positively to the stunt \u2013 and Uhlfelder says he is happy that his dry sense of humor has cut through in landscape when some of the loudest voices have been anti-shutdown protesters carrying guns. He just hopes his protest empowers others to do the same. \u201cIf people don\u2019t agree with what the government is doing, and [are able], you have to do something about it. People died for that right,\u201d he says. \u201cSomeone has to stand up to these people \u2013 that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I want others to do it too. It gets tiring being the only one.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Councils using emergency coronavirus powers to cut services for older and disabled people could be breaking the law, disability and civil liberties campaigners have warned. At least seven councils have taken advantage of rights under the Coronavirus Act not to carry out detailed assessments of people\u2019s care needs and to delay or reduce care provision, as they find themselves under pressure to divert resources to support the NHS by discharging patients. The civil rights campaign group Liberty has written to the councils requesting the full justifications for invoking the \u201ceasements\u201d of their care duties which it says are required by law. Warwickshire county council invoked the easements last month and warned care receivers that the care and support they received at the time \u201cmay not be provided in the future or may be provided in a different way\u201d. It said the changes may have \u201ca negative impact on some customers\u201d, but stressed it had not yet cut any services. Derbyshire county council said it had \u201csuspended, reduced or changed some non-essential home care services\u201d, while Solihull borough council has asked care recipients if their family or volunteers could help them instead. Sam Grant, Liberty\u2019s policy and campaigns manager, said: \u201cCouncils\u2019 actions not only risk being unlawful.

Coventry city council has done the same and said it may also have to cut some services if staff numbers are further depleted and demand for other Covid-19 support rises. Councils stressed they were acting proportionately and only changing care provision and arrangements for assessing citizens\u2019 needs where absolutely necessary. Warwickshire said a quarter of its staff had been sick or in self-isolation and that its resources had been stretched by the demand to help the NHS discharge people from hospitals. It said: \u201cIncreased levels of demand combined with the reduction in staff capacity available mean it is not possible to continue to meet the needs of all existing and new customers in line with normal practice under the Care Act.\u201d Birmingham city council said it has been reducing choice for service users \u2013 for example, of which care home to move into \u2013 but said this was because of \u201cthe level of pressure on the care provider sector at the moment, combined with the need to free up capacity in acute hospitals\u201d.

Now I\u2019m sleeping properly, eating properly, bathing properly,\u201d she says.

Now she is enjoying spending the time in her room, watching television in bed \u2013 something she hasn\u2019t been able to do for years \u2013 catching up on films she has never seen, enjoying Jurassic Park. In the morning, a newspaper is delivered to her room with breakfast; cleaners deliver fresh sheets once a week and come in to clean the room for her; laundry services are available. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Sutcliffe is one of more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales currently being <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/communities-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-2-may-2020--2\">housed in hotels</a> at the government\u2019s expense. It is part of an unprecedented emergency operation to get <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">all rough sleepers off the streets</a>, to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

In 20 years spent working in homelessness organisations, she says she has never seen the sector coming together in the way it has over the past two months. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s not possible to end rough sleeping, but we\u2019ve always maintained that it is, with the right attitude and money. But it is a gargantuan challenge.\u201d</p> \n<p>At lunchtime at an IHG hotel (which the Guardian has been asked not to name), the reception area looks much as it would do during more normal times. There are friendly, uniformed staff, politely helping guests who have lost their room keys, but there are also a few signs that the hotel is not operating quite as usual. The spare plastic key cards are floating in a plastic container, filled with transparent anti-bacterial liquid; the bar area is closed, and the beer taps have been wrapped up in cellophane to stop them being used. Security at the entrance has been stepped up to stop drug dealers moving in, and one guest is asking insistently whether staff have made any progress in finding him a pair of trousers that fit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bb083545e06dd7f966d781c934f94fe6c946bb5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb083545e06dd7f966d781c934f94fe6c946bb5/0_300_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bethan Epps, of St Mungo\u2019s\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bethan Epps, of St Mungo\u2019s, manages the hotel for the duration of the project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The hotel kitchens are closed, but Red Radish, a catering company that usually provides food to film sets, delivers hot meals, complete with vegan and halal options. St Mungo\u2019s has recruited volunteers, from the lists of people who usually sign up for Crisis at Christmas shifts, and small teams, wearing masks and gloves, make their way around the 150-bedroom, six-floor hotel, knocking at doors and handing out meals in brown paper bags. They have a quick, friendly exchange, checking on residents\u2019 moods, before moving on.</p> \n<p>On the third floor is Sarah, 59, an Australian former chef who has lived in the UK for decades and has been street homeless for a number of years. She has come out of her room to talk to her next-room neighbour, 37-year-old Chelsea, to make arrangements for an evening walk together during their hour of approved exercise outside. Both women (who asked for their real names not to be printed) were brought here from a women\u2019s hostel, where 12 women slept on camp beds in the same room.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is much more luxurious.

But she, like everyone here, is watching the news anxiously, wondering what will happen once the lockdown ends and the hotels return to normal use. Will they be \u201cdumping people wherever?\u201d she asks. \u201cYou can only hope for the best.\u201d</p> \n<p>Along the corridor, Daniella, 27 (who only wanted her first name to be used), had been living for a month in cardboard boxes under a canal bridge in north London since losing her bar job and the collapse of an abusive relationship. She has found the long hours of enforced isolation in her room hard. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be positive,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s lonely, I guess.\u201d</p> \n<p>Downstairs is Ganiyu Bello Ishola, 40, a former civil servant in the Nigerian ministry for local government. Until recently, he was mainly sleeping in a 24-hour branch of McDonald\u2019s since becoming homeless because of complications with his immigration status. He is impressed by the government\u2019s drive to bring homeless people inside. \u201cI might have died if they hadn\u2019t made a budget to rescue people from the streets,\u201d he says. But, like everyone else, he is increasingly concerned about what will happen when the government ends the lockdown. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going next,\u201d he admits. \u201cThat does depress me sometimes.\u201d</p> \n<p>During our visit on Monday, the hotel seems remarkably calm. \u201cThe levels of behaviour have been what you would expect in a hotel, not a hostel,\u201d says Samantha Dorney-Smith, a nurse with the <a href=\"https://www.pathway.org.uk/\">Pathway</a> charity, which lobbies for better healthcare for rough sleepers. She has been registering residents with GPs (often for the first time) and getting them help with drug, alcohol and mental health services. She describes the exercise as \u201ca very interesting social experiment\u201d. \u201cIf you give people what they want, they tend to take the sensible decisions. The whole focus has been on keeping people quiet and happy \u2013 and maybe we should continue like that, because, funnily enough, it works.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d20ccddb75113cc7c5c05d947ff0d4a0bdcb4c18\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d20ccddb75113cc7c5c05d947ff0d4a0bdcb4c18/0_173_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ganiyu Bello Ishola in his room\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going next\u2019: Ganiyu Bello Ishola in his room.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been problems along the way, however. About 60 people have been asked to leave the hotels St Mungos is managing because they have done things such as removing fire alarms from their bedrooms. Some hotels were already providing emergency accommodation for local authorities, and were accustomed to challenging guests. Others have found it more difficult to know how to respond when people have had too much to drink and fallen down the stairs, or when new residents with undiagnosed mental health problems have had psychotic episodes and started shouting at staff. Or when drug dealers have managed somehow to make their way in. But the hotel workers have been amazing, St Mungo\u2019s staff say, absolutely determined to help.</p> \n<p>What there has not been much of is Covid-19. After a slightly chaotic start, arrivals were divided up and those with possible symptoms put in one hotel, those who had tested positive in another, and those with no virus concerns in the rest. People with really serious drug and alcohol issues have been housed separately. Only a handful of rough sleepers in London have had to go to hospital with coronavirus, and no one put into the hotel scheme has died. Given the vulnerability of people who have been rough sleeping for a while, this is a significant achievement, Dorney-Smith says.</p> \n<p>But homelessness workers and hotel residents are equally worried about the dwindling amount of time before this period ends. Bethan Epps, the St Mungo\u2019s worker who is managing this hotel, says: \u201cIt does make me anxious. We really, really don\u2019t want people to go back on the streets after this.\u201d She would like to have another two months, but is realistic about the prospect of finding homes for everyone. At least a quarter have no recourse to public funds, an immigration status that means, in non-pandemic times, they cannot receive any state support. If they are unable to get their jobs back, they will remain homeless. About 30 people in this hotel were living in Heathrow airport before lockdown, many of them with unresolved immigration issues; none would normally be eligible for any help from the either the government or homelessness charities.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db9924751ff853457f86e8b8b397707f997b80a1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db9924751ff853457f86e8b8b397707f997b80a1/0_55_5848_3507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Dorney-Smith\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Dorney-Smith sees the low rates of Covid-19 among the hotel\u2019s homeless people as a significant achievement.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The main problem is that the exceptional funding granted by the government (two tranches of \u00a31.6bn given to local authorities to fund their Covid-19 response) has already been used. There are no more hotel beds for those homeless now, and no new long-term accommodation to put people in. St Mungo\u2019s own research shows that government cuts have resulted in <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/news/homelessness-thousands-knocked-back-from-life-saving-treatment/\">funding for drug and alcohol services being reduced</a> by more than a quarter since 2015-16. It also revealed that there were <a href=\"https://www.mungos.org/news/9000-spaces-cut/\">8,755 fewer places</a> in accommodation for homeless people in 2019 than there were in 2010, and that funding for homelessness services has been cut by \u00a31bn a year since 2008/9. The number of people dying while homeless has increased by 51% since 2013.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re faced with a once in a lifetime opportunity of getting it right, and making sure that not one single person who is currently accommodated should go back on to the streets,\u201d says Salva. \u201cA few weeks ago, I thought this was a silver lining in a national tragedy \u2013 that this could be the prize, that we could actually get everyone off the streets. But that\u2019s not going to be the case \u2013 London is going to be a challenge.\u201d She is particularly worried by people falling into sleeping rough during the lockdown because their work has dried up and they have been asked to leave the accommodation that comes with their jobs.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile conditions for those still on the streets have deteriorated rapidly during lockdown. In the first three weeks following the national lockdown orders, there was an 81% rise in alerts to <a href=\"https://www.streetlink.org.uk/\">StreetLink</a>, the charity that connects rough sleepers with services. In London, hungry-looking people have taken to begging at car windows at traffic lights, something more usually seen in Delhi, a measure of desperation at a time of lockdown. An economic crisis will see new people on the streets.</p> \n<p>\u201cVery soon, we\u2019re going to be in a situation where these amazing businesses that have opened up their hotels are going to want their businesses back,\u201d says Salva. \u201cIt is not going to be an easy and quick fix to stop people from going back to the streets.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sutcliffe worries as she watches the news in her bedroom. \u201cOnce they say there\u2019s no more lockdown, what does that mean? Pack your stuff, off you go?\u201d she asks. \u201cIf there\u2019s no accommodation sorted for me, then I\u2019d be back out on the streets, simple as that. I\u2019m hoping and praying that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",

She has been registering residents with GPs (often for the first time) and getting them help with drug, alcohol and mental health services. She describes the exercise as \u201ca very interesting social experiment\u201d. \u201cIf you give people what they want, they tend to take the sensible decisions. The whole focus has been on keeping people quiet and happy \u2013 and maybe we should continue like that, because, funnily enough, it works.\u201d There have been problems along the way, however. About 60 people have been asked to leave the hotels St Mungos is managing because they have done things such as removing fire alarms from their bedrooms. Some hotels were already providing emergency accommodation for local authorities, and were accustomed to challenging guests. Others have found it more difficult to know how to respond when people have had too much to drink and fallen down the stairs, or when new residents with undiagnosed mental health problems have had psychotic episodes and started shouting at staff. Or when drug dealers have managed somehow to make their way in. But the hotel workers have been amazing, St Mungo\u2019s staff say, absolutely determined to help. What there has not been much of is Covid-19. After a slightly chaotic start, arrivals were divided up and those with possible symptoms put in one hotel, those who had tested positive in another, and those with no virus concerns in the rest. People with really serious drug and alcohol issues have been housed separately. Only a handful of rough sleepers in London have had to go to hospital with coronavirus, and no one put into the hotel scheme has died. Given the vulnerability of people who have been rough sleeping for a while, this is a significant achievement, Dorney-Smith says. But homelessness workers and hotel residents are equally worried about the dwindling amount of time before this period ends. Bethan Epps, the St Mungo\u2019s worker who is managing this hotel, says: \u201cIt does make me anxious. We really, really don\u2019t want people to go back on the streets after this.\u201d She would like to have another two months, but is realistic about the prospect of finding homes for everyone. At least a quarter have no recourse to public funds, an immigration status that means, in non-pandemic times, they cannot receive any state support. If they are unable to get their jobs back, they will remain homeless. About 30 people in this hotel were living in Heathrow airport before lockdown, many of them with unresolved immigration issues; none would normally be eligible for any help from the either the government or homelessness charities. The main problem is that the exceptional funding granted by the government (two tranches of \u00a31.6bn given to local authorities to fund their Covid-19 response) has already been used. There are no more hotel beds for those homeless now, and no new long-term accommodation to put people in. St Mungo\u2019s own research shows that government cuts have resulted in funding for drug and alcohol services being reduced by more than a quarter since 2015-16. It also revealed that there were 8,755 fewer places in accommodation for homeless people in 2019 than there were in 2010, and that funding for homelessness services has been cut by \u00a31bn a year since 2008/9. The number of people dying while homeless has increased by 51% since 2013. \u201cWe\u2019re faced with a once in a lifetime opportunity of getting it right, and making sure that not one single person who is currently accommodated should go back on to the streets,\u201d says Salva. \u201cA few weeks ago, I thought this was a silver lining in a national tragedy \u2013 that this could be the prize, that we could actually get everyone off the streets. But that\u2019s not going to be the case \u2013 London is going to be a challenge.\u201d She is particularly worried by people falling into sleeping rough during the lockdown because their work has dried up and they have been asked to leave the accommodation that comes with their jobs. Meanwhile conditions for those still on the streets have deteriorated rapidly during lockdown. In the first three weeks following the national lockdown orders, there was an 81% rise in alerts to StreetLink, the charity that connects rough sleepers with services. In London, hungry-looking people have taken to begging at car windows at traffic lights, something more usually seen in Delhi, a measure of desperation at a time of lockdown. An economic crisis will see new people on the streets. \u201cVery soon, we\u2019re going to be in a situation where these amazing businesses that have opened up their hotels are going to want their businesses back,\u201d says Salva. \u201cIt is not going to be an easy and quick fix to stop people from going back to the streets.\u201d Sutcliffe worries as she watches the news in her bedroom. \u201cOnce they say there\u2019s no more lockdown, what does that mean? Pack your stuff, off you go?\u201d she asks. \u201cIf there\u2019s no accommodation sorted for me, then I\u2019d be back out on the streets, simple as that. I\u2019m hoping and praying that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",

Workers accrue roughly 80 hours of unpaid time off over the course of a year, and they can now also apply for an unpaid personal leave of absence due to Covid concerns.

      "bodyText": "Amazon workers in southern California\u2019s industrial heartland say the company\u2019s policies are forcing sick employees to work and that warehouses are refusing to comply with a state paid sick leave law meant to prevent Covid-19 outbreaks. In the Inland Empire region outside Los Angeles, Amazon workers told the Guardian they fear losing their jobs if they are ill and stay home. At least four Amazon warehouses in the region have recorded Covid-19 cases. On 1 May, Amazon ended a policy allowing unlimited unpaid time off, a measure adopted at the start of the coronavirus crisis that allowed workers to take time off for any reason. They would forgo wages, but if they were concerned about their safety or had new childcare responsibilities due to lockdowns, they could stay home without losing their jobs. Without the policy, workers say they could now be fired if they miss shifts. They worry the reversal will result in sick and vulnerable people showing up for shifts because they can\u2019t risk termination. The health concerns are particularly serious in the Inland Empire, which has some of the worst air quality in the US and disproportionately high rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Employees also shared emails showing that Amazon has dismissed some paid sick leave requests by claiming a California law intended to provide supplemental sick leave during the pandemic does not apply to the warehouses. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to come to work, but I don\u2019t have a choice,\u201d said Eddie, a 48-year-old San Bernardino worker with diabetes, who asked to go by his middle name and works in one of the facilities that had an outbreak. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be there. We\u2019re risking our safety for the company \u2026 The more I think about it, the more stressed I get.\u201d \u201cWe are a vector of this disease,\u201d said one worker at a warehouse in San Bernardino. The 27-year-old, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation, recovered from pneumonia last year and is at high risk of serious complications if they contract Covid. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t even be a debate about this. It\u2019s incredibly nerve-racking.\u201d The Inland Empire, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, was once home to the west coast\u2019s largest steel plant, a major air force base and an agricultural economy. Today, the historically rural area is a hub for distribution centers and the logistics industry, with huge warehouses for Amazon, UPS, Walmart and other retailers. The sector has added more than 50,000 jobs over the last decade as e-commerce has boomed, but a majority of families in the region don\u2019t earn enough to make ends meet. On 16 April, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, passed an executive order providing food sector workers two weeks of supplemental paid sick leave if they have to isolate due to Covid-19 concerns. The law covers \u201cworkers at warehouses where food is stored\u201d and is aimed at protecting consumers from the virus and offering additional support to essential workers whose jobs involve the food supply. Amazon warehouses in the industrial neighborhoods of San Bernardino and Riverside counties handle a wide range of packages, including food items. But employees say that when they have asked about Newsom\u2019s order in recent weeks, the human resources department has ignored their questions or responded that the facilities are not considered part of the food sector. The 27-year-old worker with a history of pneumonia works at a sort center and has been responsible for helping package a range of pantry food items. When they asked HR about the paid sick leave law for food workers, the company directed them to steps they could take to request unpaid time off. A labor spokesperson for the state, however, told the Guardian that the law does apply to warehouses such as Amazon\u2019s centers, noting that the order has a broad definition of \u201cfood facility\u201d, which includes any operations that store or package food for human consumption. Eileen Hards, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to answer specific questions about Newsom\u2019s order or whether the company has provided this form of paid sick leave, saying in an email: \u201cAmazon has complied with all requirements given by the State.\u201d The company says in addition to the time off it provided before the coronavirus pandemic, it now gives two weeks of paid time off for infected employees and those presumed to have Covid-19.

NSW and Victoria held firm on lockdown restrictions, for now, as Qld announced a relaxation of the rules ahead of national cabinet tomorrow. Newmarch House operator Anglicare appointed a special advisor to guide its response to a deadly Covid-19 outbreak at the facility. SA recorded its first case in two weeks. The NRL said players who objected to vaccines could apply for an exemption to train during the pandemic. Let\u2019s briefly go to NSW parliament, where my colleague Naaman Zhou has been watching the video stream of an inquiry into the state\u2019s Covid-19 response. If you were under the impression that the bizarre behaviour from NSW politicians over the past few days was now over, I regret to inform you that were incorrect. As Naaman reports, the inquiry today descended into name-calling and accusations that MPs were \u201cwinking\u201d at each other during the video conference. Yes, really. Read Naaman\u2019s full story below. The NRL has issued a statement on the brewing stoush over vaccinations. The league had indicated that players would be required to get a flu shot in order to train during the Covid-19, sparking anger among some players who claim to conscientiously object to vaccines. In a statement today, the league said players could sign a waiver that would grant them an exemption from the vaccination requirement. The statement said: The National Rugby League (NRL) has developed stringent biosecurity protocols that adhere to higher standards than public health orders. These protocols were submitted to governments prior to the return of players to training. These protocols have been reaffirmed to clubs and players today, including the requirement for flu vaccinations for all players and staff. The protocols allow for exemptions to vaccinations under compelling circumstances, including requiring players to sign a release. Until an NRL-approved release is acknowledged and signed by players, they will not be permitted to train. The NRL said 97% of players and applicable staff have been vaccinated. Clubs have also been advised that biosecurity restrictions would not be eased to accommodate players making or receiving visits on Mother\u2019s Day. Guardian Australia\u2019s senior business reporter Ben Butler has some news on what\u2019s happening with Virgin. As Ben reports, the airline\u2019s administrators have stopped issuing refunds and flight credits to customers who cancel their trips. More details in Ben\u2019s full report below. My colleagues Ben Smee and Christopher Knaus has been investigating a company called Promedical and their activities during the pandemic. In their latest story, they report: Health authorities have fined a Queensland company run by a convicted rapist $63,000 for making false claims that its coronavirus test kits had been approved or endorsed by Australian and US authorities. You can read their story here. Sorry to non-sports fans for the repeated sports content, I can\u2019t help that both major codes have gone a bit nuts. Under AFL rules during the pandemic, players are only allowed to train in pairs. But the Age, which first reported this story, says a witness told the paper a \u201cgroup of Crows players were staying at the Novotel Barossa Valley Resort, which is closed to the public, and that players had been running and training in groups\u201d. Newmarch House operator Anglicare says it has appointed an external advisor in line with a directive from the aged care regulator. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission yesterday threatened to revoke\u2019s the operators license amid the outbreak at the nursing home in Sydney\u2019s west. Anglicare said in a statement: Anglicare Sydney today announced that the adviser appointed to Newmarch House is Andrew Kinkade. This is in response to the Notice issued yesterday by the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. Andrew Kinkade has extensive experience in aged care in Australia and the UK and has been contributing to sector-wide preparations and responses to Covid-19. He has a track record of managing complex situations and delivering high quality care. It is this background that gives him an understanding of the support that is needed at Newmarch House. Kinkade was appointed for three months. Preliminary modelling from the Brain and Mind Centre predicts at least a 25% rise in suicides, with 30% of those being Australians aged 15 to 25. \u201cThe impacts of unemployment will be greatest among the young,\u201d centre co-director Ian Hickie said, according to AAP. Professor Hickie said Australia could be facing between an extra 750 to 1,500 suicides per year on top of the more than 3,000 annually. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. My colleagues Elias Visontay and Naaman Zhou have an update on the situation at Newmarch House. They report: The federal government will pay Aspen Medical \u2013 the company contracted to contain Covid-19 outbreaks at Newmarch House and on the Ruby Princess \u2013 more than $57m for Covid-19 outbreak response services. Read their full story below. Amid the debate about the re-opening of schools, the ACT\u2019s Liberal opposition leader has made some notable comments on Canberra radio. Responding to news the ACT government planned for a staggered return to face-to-face classes, Alistair Coe appeared to say the coronavirus pandemic was over. \u201cI\u2019m surprised that the government was not prepared for this, and that the government is surprised that the pandemic has ended,\u201d Coe said on ABC Radio. \u201cWe\u2019re surprised that they need three weeks to get kids back into the classroom.\u201d The Canberra Times reported that Coe had backed away from the comments by the afternoon. He said he was speaking in the context of restrictions being eased. There is some more bad news from Newmarch House, the stricken nursing home in Sydney\u2019s west. In a statement, Anglicare says three staff members have tested positive to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. They are now self-isolating. The positive test results were discovered during our rigorous testing regime applied to all staff working at Newmarch House, which is now being conducted every second day. Anglicare continues to be advised and guided by an infection control specialist and other clinicians, generously provided by government and we are appreciative of their expertise and ongoing support. We continue to work diligently to contain this virus which has had a devastating effect on residents, families and staff at Newmarch House. An update to my colleague Anne Davies\u2019 story this morning about NSW deputy premier John Barilaro travelling from his home in the suburbs of Queanbeyan/Canberra to his farm during the lockdown. NSW police have cleared the Nationals leader of undertaking travel in contravention of the state\u2019s public health orders. You can read Anne\u2019s full report below. The WA government is hardening its language on the AFL restart in a sign the state is unlikely to hold matches. The health minister Roger Cook said today: The health advice is crystal clear. There is no confidence the AFL can maintain infection control and prevent infection spread among players and staff under the current proposed model. There is a risk it could contribute to the further spread of the virus. WA\u2019s preference is for West Coast and Fremantle to participate in a \u201chub\u201d outside the state. Thanks to Josh for his efforts today. I\u2019ll be with you for next few hours. If you want to get in touch, I\u2019m on luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter @lukehgomes. I am going to hand over to my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes to take you through the evening. On the new case, the man only developed mild symptoms of loss of taste and smell on 24 March after he came to Australia, he wasn\u2019t infectious on the flight home. He didn\u2019t get tested because it wasn\u2019t within the guidelines to get tested at that time. He still quarantined himself as per the rules. He\u2019s a new arrival to Australia and has only had five close contacts who have all been contacted and are now isolating. None of them have any symptoms. Why so long? SA\u2019s chief health officer Nicola Spurrier said it can happen, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a living virus and risk to the community is low. This is something we certainly know can happen with Covid-19. For whatever reason the virus can still be shared that long time later. But it\u2019s not active or necessarily what we call viable or living virus. South Australia has reported one new confirmed case of coronavirus, ending the state\u2019s over two-week streak of no new cases. The case is a man in his 70s who arrived back from the UK seven weeks ago on 20 March. There are no reported incidents of Kawasaki disease in children in Australia similar to New York, McMillan says. We have heard some reports from overseas about a condition known to occur in children as a consequence of coronavirus and it is called Kawasaki disease. It has also been reported in the UK but there is no reporting in Australia and as we know the number of children actually contracting Covid-19 has been extremely low. That doesn\u2019t mean to say we won\u2019t continue to monitor this situation as the information becomes available, but at this time there is no evidence of that in Australia. On the NRL players refusing to get flu shots, McMillan said it\u2019s a matter for their employer if they play or not: We do know that vaccination is an important part of prevention of disease transmission in this country and there has been a strong platform in our public health program for a long time but they will leave that commentary to them. The chief nursing and midwifery officer Alison McMillan is providing an update. She said health officials need to keep their mental health in check too, off the back of the government\u2019s announcement of support for mental health of health workers: These are unprecedented times and for all of us, our lives have changed so much in recent weeks that it is absolutely normal to feel some sense of anxiety or concern at this time, and that is really normal. No one is immune to that. I have been a nurse all my life and I am not immune to that, and I to have had at times that sense of, what the future will bring and this uncertainty for us all. Here\u2019s a report on the alleged superannuation access fraud from my colleague Paul Karp. NSW Police say NSW deputy premier John Barilaro\u2019s visit to his farm in Nerriga last weekend was not in breach of the Public Health Act. \u201cSubsequent inquiries by police from Southern Region revealed that he travelled to the property on Saturday (2 May 2020) and spent the weekend with his family,\u201d NSW Police said. \u201cHe also conducted various maintenance tasks at the property.\u201d The travel and the stay did not breach the current ministerial directions, NSW Police said. 7News is reporting NSW deputy premier John Barilaro will not be fined for going to his farm. Cook said he\u2019s not confident with the AFL\u2019s current approach to restarting the season. \u201cThere is no confidence the AFL can maintain infection control and prevent infection spread among players and staff under the current proposed model. There is a risk it could contribute to the further spread of the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cLike all footy fans out there, I would love to be able to sit back and watch a game. But WA\u2019s hard border will not and should not be compromised to allow the AFL to resume a home and away season because, from a health perspective, it is just not the safest model.\u201d He says AFL footy players and their families should see a potential WA hub as an opportunity. Some interesting meetings between nations successfully combatting coronavirus taking place at the moment. Western Australian health minister Roger Cook says the state has recorded its eighth straight day of no new confirmed cases of coronavirus. There are currently 11 active cases in the state, of which 8 are West Australians. He\u2019s reiterated that the gains can\u2019t be lost, social distancing needs to be in place, people need to keep washing their hands, and all those associated measures. It\u2019s not just Covid-19, he says, we are in influenza season. So far only 20 cases of flu were recorded in the state last month (the lowest on record), compared with 548 the previous April. According to Pedestrian, most MPs and senators have downloaded and installed the Covidsafe app. Greens and One Nation appear to be somewhat united in expressing scepticism about the app, but the Greens are more open to using it in the future, according to the report. I do find it somewhat concerning that many MPs keep the \u201cSent from my iPhone\u201d in their signature. Regional media outlets can now apply for the federal government\u2019s $50 million Public Interest News Gathering (PING) program. The money can be spent on wages, training, or technology and website upgrades, communications minister Paul Fletcher says. To be eligible the business will need to not be insolvent, be regional, and demonstrate it is providing public interest journalism to the local community it serves. The media company can\u2019t be affiliated with a political party, union, financial institution, non-government organisation or policy lobby group. The grant information can be found here. Gunner says he won\u2019t open the border on the NT any sooner than the last easing of restrictions because SA can\u2019t guarantee its border with Victoria, and Queensland can\u2019t guarantee its border with NSW. He also says WA had an oubreak in the Kimberley. NT still has a hard border, which is why it is easier for the NT to ease restrictions. Gunner says the testing and tracking is also in place, which gives him the confidence to ease restrictions. He says the national cabinet\u2019s three stages will likely be quite similar to the three-stage process the NT has undertaken in easing restrictions. NT chief minister Michael Gunner is providing an update. \u201cA beer and a parmy, that\u2019s the order,\u201d he says. Pubs in the territory will be open from next week, and Gunner is urging territorians to go local and buy local. \u201cWe have got to get out and we have got to support those businesses that did the right thing.\u201d He said NT is the test case for many other parts of Australia and the rest of the world in easing restrictions. \u201cI do genuinely believe we can provide a roadmap out.\u201d Two weeks after departing Port Kembla, the ill-fated Ruby Princess cruise ship has arrived in the Philippines. South Australian Police issued 16 $1,060 fines to a group of people who were found intoxicated in a home in Port Augusta on Tuesday, in breach of the Covid-19 directions. Then at 10pm on Tuesday, police in the state\u2019s south-east found four customers at a licensed premises drinking alcohol. The four adults were each fined $1,060, and the business owner was fined $5,060. A 26-year-old woman was charged with failing to comply with a direction to self-quarantine three times after leaving her home multiple times. She will appear in the Adelaide magistrates court on 30 October. The Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association has called for all Covid-positive residents to be transferred out of Newmarch House to hospital: \u201cIt seems this would be a highly effective way, from the residents\u2019 point of view, of dealing with the Newmarch House crisis,\u201d the organisation said. Victoria is facing pressure to lift restrictions before Monday, but Daniel Andrews so far has not relented. We will know more after Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting. From today, Victoria will finally begin reporting active coronavirus cases by local government area. \u201cIt is important to understand these cases are recorded according to the address provided at the time of testing and may not reflect where the case currently resides or where they were infected,\u201d the state\u2019s health department said. ACT reports no new cases today: There have been no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 107. A total of 103 cases have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. The ACT has recorded three (3) deaths. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 10,371. Visitor restrictions remain in place for all Canberra Health Services campuses, including Canberra hospital and University of Canberra Hospital and Community Health Centres, as well as Calvary Public and Private hospitals, and National Capital hospital. In that press conference a little earlier, Greg Hunt was asked about the antibody testing kits Australia had purchased to screen for Covid-19. There are two broad types of testing conducted for Covid-19. The primary test relied upon by most nations, including Australia, is PCR testing, which is conducted in pathology laboratories and examines RNA. Antibody tests check a person\u2019s blood for the antibodies thought to be deployed in response to the virus. Antibody tests return results quickly and experts such as Peter Collignon, of the ANU, say that proven, accurate antibody tests have a role in the overall pandemic response, but should be used to supplement, rather than replace, PCR testing. Antibody tests have been the subject of a scandal in the United Kingdom, where the government purchased 17.5m tests, before Oxford University researchers found they weren\u2019t accurate enough for use. The government is now attempting to get a refund. Hunt revealed Australia has purchased 1.5m antibody tests and is still conducting \u201ctesting and analysis\u201d to ensure they are suitable for use. He described that approach as cautious and said the government had only purchased a \u201cpreliminary sample\u201d of the devices. When asked if Australia could find itself in a situation similar to the UK, Hunt said: \u201cNo. And that\u2019s because we\u2019ve been very cautious and took a preliminary sample. The Australian government went on validated, trusted, high-quality suppliers, but even then, there is a global assessment of antibody testing and our medical authorities have said they want to do more work and on this. Above all else, our message as a government to our medical advisers is safety trumps everything and we\u2019ll continue to follow your advice.\u201d One of the \u201creliable\u201d suppliers Australia asked for 500,000 antibody kits was a small, unknown company named Promedical. The Guardian has published a series of revelations about Promedical in recent weeks, including that it is headed by a convicted rapist, has no prior experience in medical diagnostics, and attempted to manufacture its own unapproved testing devices when a deal to resell products from a more reputable Chinese manufacturer fell through. None of those 500,000 testing kits has arrived in Australia. Jenny Wilkinson, treasury deputy secretary of the fiscal group, has revealed that more than $15bn of stimulus has already been paid including: $5.2bn in $750 payments to households $7.5bn for cashflow boost to small businesses; and $2.4bn of jobkeeper wage subsidies that have been claimed, of which at least $1bn has already been paid and the rest is being processed. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt suggests that given that $9bn of superannuation has been withdrawn, households have got more from their private retirement savings than the government. Wilkinson replies that is \u201cnot accurate\u201d when you consider jobseeker payments with the coronavirus supplement. But she has no exact no figures on that, which will be tabled by the department of social services. The insults are really flying in the NSW parliament inquiry into the state\u2019s response to Covid-19. Robert Borsak, from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, asks the health minister, Brad Hazzard, whether he will appear before the special inquiry into the Ruby Princess. On Tuesday, a NSW Health senior epidemiologist, Kelly-Anne Ressler, gave evidence. Ressler became tearful under questioning by commissioner Bret Walker SC, with Scott Morrison later saying that Walker was \u201ca bit out of line\u201d and too aggressive. Borsak asks Hazzard just now: \u201cWhy were you happy to send Kelly-Anne Ressler in to the inquiry to answer for your mistakes?\u201d Hazzard replies: \u201cYou really have a problem.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t send Dr Ressler,\u201d Hazzard says. \u201cClearly you aren\u2019t the slightest bit interested in treating her with any respect. To raise her in this context is entirely inappropriate ... I one hundred percent back all the health staff in the front line\u201d. He then tells Borsak \u201cyour colleagues are good people ... you need to take some lessons from your colleagues\u201d. Borsak replies: \u201cI do like the fact that I get under your skin. You really do deserve it.\u201d Hazzard tells him: \u201cYou are a numpty\u201d. The chair, Greens MP David Shoebridge, has to intervene and says \u201cthis isn\u2019t doing anyone credit\u201d. Hazzard then clarifies that he has not been called up to the Ruby Princess special commission of inquiry. Here are the level 2 alert restrictions for New Zealand, down from level 3: Businesses can restart for staff and customers Bubbles can cease Domestic travel recommences Schools and early learning centres can open Gatherings both indoors and outdoors are limited to 100 people Public places reopen Sport and recreation comes back on-stream, including professional sports competitions Home gatherings must be kept small Hospitality must follow the three S\u2019s \u2013 seated, separated, single-server NZ PM Jacinda Ardern says a decision on whether to bring in level 2 will be made on Monday 11 May, and it could be a phased approach. In a nutshell, level 2 is a safer normal, designed to get as many people back to work as possible and the economy back up and running in a safe way, made possible only by our collective actions at levels 4 and 3 to beat the virus and break the chain of transmission. Strong public health measures such as physical distancing, good hygiene and contact tracing will be essential to making level 2 work. There is a much higher level of individual responsibly required at level 2 to prevent the spread of the virus. Even though the economy will be significantly opened up we still need everyone to remain vigilant and continue to act like you and those around you have the virus. Although nobody has been arrested or charged in relation to alleged theft of superannuation, Kershaw has given details of one charge relating to defrauding Covid-19 programs: \u201cWe have established our internal Taskforce IRIS \u2013 to target people and organised crime entities who seek to defraud the government\u2019s COVID-19 economic response measures. A Western Sydney man was arrested for allegedly submitting claims for a range of government benefits, designed to assist members of the community affected by Covid-19 and bushfires. He used assumed 11 identities and 53 fictitious identities to submit 68 claims for government benefits. Total value of claims exceeded $70,000. The arrest resulted in the man being charged with a range of Commonwealth offences, including obtaining a financial advantage by deception (section 134.2 (1) of the Criminal Code)\u201c The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, tells the Covid-19 Senate committee that three staff contracted coronavirus overseas and were isolated before they came back into the workforce. The AFP has no active cases. Asked about the progress of an investigation into AFP recruits who broke social distancing rules, Kershaw reveals that 76 recruits were investigated and 53 were sanctioned, including two who were given show cause notices: They\u2019ve had the cane well and truly and beyond that. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, and the chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, have answered questions about Guardian Australia\u2019s exclusive yesterday that two private medical staff who worked on the Ruby Princess were sent into the Newmarch House aged care facility. Chant says the company, Aspen Medical, did not tell NSW Health that those nurses had worked on the Ruby Princess. The questioning in the NSW parliament inquiry into Covid-19 is becoming increasingly fractious as MPs talk over each other, made worse by the technical delays of video conferencing. Labor\u2019s Penny Sharpe asks why staff from Aspen Medical were \u201callowed to walk into Newmarch\u201d and what testing they were given. Hazzard says: \u201cThe question shows a profound lack of understanding of the NSW health system ... NSW Health has no control over those matters.\u201d Chant says: \u201cAspen would have employed those nurses and would have been requested to provide those nurses. There is no barrier to healthcare staff who worked with Covid-positive patients attending other places providing there is no breach in their PPE.\u201d She adds that Aspen employed 30 staff to check if other staff were wearing PPE. Chant also told the inquiry: \u201cWe would not have been told where those nursing staff [for Newmarch] would have been sourced from.\u201d \u201cThe assertion you are making that they somehow introduced the virus into the facility, I am happy to follow that up,\u201d she says. \u201cAspen would have been responsible for their staff wearing PPE, and they would have been deployed in accordance with the need.\u201d Sharpe raises that one Aspen employee \u201cwas stood down for not wearing PPE\u201d. Hazzard tells her: \u201cLets not go blaming staff.\u201d Sharpe says she isn\u2019t blaming staff. The inquiry continues. On whether Victoria should ease restrictions in line with other states so Victorians can see people, or take part in outdoor sports, Greg Hunt said each state would have its own response but the national cabinet would set the rules in its meeting tomorrow: What we hope comes out of national cabinet tomorrow, and what I expect, is a clear roadmap out, with clear stages, and then each state will be able to judge and we\u2019ll support each of the states as they make their judgments of their own circumstances and readiness to go to easing restrictions. Hunt says from today the Black Dog Institute\u2019s online e-health mental health hub is available to health workers. He also says 3,000 scholarships have been awarded through the Australian College of Nursing, and 2,500 have completed training to return to the workforce. There have also been 20,000 enrolments for nurses to upgrade their ICU skills; more than 27% have completed this training. More than 624,000 health workers have completed infection-control modules. Hunt announces many more masks: In terms of the health support, 40m masks from the national medical stockpile will be made available now on top of the over 34m masks to date, which have been made available. That will include 35m masks between now and the end of May for our hospitals. It will include 1.5m additional masks for our aged care workers, and 3.5m masks for our primary healthcare workers, including 2m for general practices with a specific focus, obviously, on the doctors and the nurses, but we\u2019ll also include 220,000 for respiratory clinics, 660,000 for pharmacy, 500,000 for allied health workers and 120,000 for Indigenous health workers. Australia\u2019s call for an independent international inquiry into the origins of the Covid-19 is continuing to earn it the ire of the Chinese government. Scott Morrison has this week written to all G20 leaders seeking support for an inquiry. The state-owned Global Times does not hold back here: Australia maintains a political prejudice against China and other Asia-Pacific countries due to its long-term \u201cidentity crisis.\u201d It has chosen to play the blame game alongside the US amid the pandemic and spread a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d which will only narrow its economic recovery path after the outbreak. Australia is a typical dual character country which tends to seek interest and commit disturbance simultaneously. With massive trade and economic ties with Asia-Pacific countries, it, however, often has a hostile attitude toward some South Pacific countries. China, as the world\u2019s second largest economy, has been the largest trade partner for Australia. Although it has been harvesting profits from its trade with China, Australia still constantly chooses to sabotage the bilateral relationship. Good morning everyone, Josh Taylor here, taking over the blog for the next little while. Greg Hunt is giving a press conference. The Victorian meatworks outbreak, the health minister says, it is a reminder that spikes and outbreaks will happen going forward and it\u2019s important we test and contact trace and have a rapid public health response. More from the indefatigable Paul Karp: Treasury officials have told the Covid-19 Senate inquiry that as of Wednesday 768,000 employers are enrolled in the jobkeeper wage subsidy program, covering up to 5 million workers. Some 900,000 businesses expressed interest \u2013 so obviously some have opted not to take part, largely due to cashflow problems. The $130bn program delivers $1,500 fortnightly payments to up to 6 million workers. Officials have stressed the program is \u201cdemand-driven\u201d and they did their best to estimate how many would be eligible. The deadline to receive payments for April has been extended to 31 May, and officials note businesses can join at any time in the six-month timeframe. The ATO has said it has been flexible on the 30% turnover decline, to account for startups and companies that underwent a restructure or acquisitions that would make the comparison between 1 March 2019 and 2020 inappropriate. NSW has updated its Covid-19 figures. Just three new confirmed cases in the 24 hours to 8pm last night. The state has had 3,044 confirmed cases, which has led to 46 deaths, while 2,643 patients have recovered. And more than 271,000 have been tested across the state. There are now 121 Covid-19 cases being treated by NSW Health. This includes 10 people in intensive care units, with eight of those requiring ventilators, and 80% in non-acute, out-of-hospital care. Of the three new cases, two have come from staff at Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House aged care facility. There is now a total of 68 cases, in 31 staff and 37 residents linked to that facility. Sixteen residents have died. NSW Health is urging people with symptoms, including mild symptoms to be tested to ensure as many cases of Covid-19 in the community are identified as quickly as possible. This is particularly important in several new areas following a locally acquired case. These include Blacktown, Canada Bay, Cumberland, Inner West, Liverpool, Parramatta and Penrith Local Government Areas. All areas of concern for community transmission in NSW are publicly available and listed here. The locations of Covid-19 clinics are available here. Today the NSW parliament is holding an inquiry in the state government\u2019s response to Covid-19. To start, the health minister, Brad Hazzard, is asked about the deputy premier, John Barilaro, who admitted yesterday to travelling 125km to a second property at the weekend. Labor\u2019s Walt Secord asked Hazzard whether Barilaro was being \u201chypocritical\u201d, especially after he criticised the former arts minister Don Harwin, who resigned after travelling between his Central Coast beach house and his Sydney residence. Secord also said the NSW deputy police commissioner had confirmed today that Barilaro would be investigated. \u201cHe [Barilaro] said he drove 125km to build a cubby house,\u201d Secord told the inquiry. \u201cThat was his reason. I don\u2019t see how a cubby house is essential work ... don\u2019t you think he should be brought to account?\u201d Hazzard said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a response\u201d: I am here to answer questions on public health. I will not be drawn on that as it is under investigation by the police, as you just told me ... We are here to answer questions on keeping the public safe and you are only interested in playing politics. Reece Kershaw, the Australian federal police commissioner, has given further details about the superannuation fraud investigation: The matter was referred to the AFP on 1 May There are an estimated 150 victims Police have executed five search warrants Police have frozen $120,000 of funds in some bank accounts There have been no arrests Earlier, Kershaw gave an opening statement in which he said the AFP has detected an increase in communication in child abuse forums, including a doubling of child abuse material on the dark web in February and March compared with last year. The Australian Taxation Office is up before the Senate Covid-19 committee, and the commissioner, Chris Jordan, has confirmed this ABC report that \u201csome limited fraudulent activity has been identified and immediately acted upon\u201d by the ATO in relation to early access to superannuation. The government has allowed people struggling with financial responsibilities during Covid-19 to access $10,000 this financial year and the same amount next year. Jordan says the fraudulent activity is \u201cnow an operational matter with colleagues at the AFP\u201d and does not give further details in his opening statement. He said early super withdrawals had now reached $9bn, with been \u201cno serious problems\u201d but the ATO \u201cwon\u2019t be dropping our guard\u201d. Peak superannuation bodies wrote to the assistant minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, calling for more protections against fraud including verification of bank account details between MyGov against member account details held by the financial institution. Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, is speaking to the media in Melbourne. The state has 14 new cases of Covid-19, 13 of which are confirmed to be linked to the Cedar Meats abattoir (seven workers, and six close contacts of workers). The origin of the 14th case is still being investigated. Victoria now has 1,454 confirmed cases. Eight people remain in hospital, six of those are in intensive care. Andrews has stressed the importance of the testing regime and warned against lifting restrictions \u2013 Victoria\u2019s are the now the strictest in the country \u2013 too early: I want to thank every single Victorian who has presented to get tested. I can confirm we\u2019ve done 106,000 tests in the last week and a half. With ramping up over the first few days, pretty much in the last week that we\u2019ve had 106,000 swabs taken. That\u2019s 1,806 extra tests yesterday. Victorians across the board, we are so proud, we\u2019ve asked you to come forward to get tested and we encourage you to keep coming forward to be tested even with the mildest symptoms. Those tests will give us the confidence that there is not more of this virus out in the community than we perhaps think. That surveillance work, that checking is really, very, very important. Andrews said he understood public frustration with continuing restrictions, and said no one in government was happy at having to impose them to protect public health: The last thing we want to do is to ease off any of those restrictions without a sense of confidence that we are truly on top of this and that our case numbers aren\u2019t just a function of low levels of testing, but they are in fact the function of a really big testing program. There are parts of the world that let off restrictions very early \u2013 they thought they had beaten it, turned out they hadn\u2019t. They now have even stricter lockdowns in place than they ever had, before they let their frustrations get the better of them, perhaps, and changed the settings. Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that, but it is ... important to stay the course on this, not just to do what we want to do, but to do what is ... in the interests of every single Victorian family, every single Victorian business. The federal government has welcome the ACT\u2019s announcement of a plan for a return to school for all students in the territory. The ACT deputy chief minister, Yvette Berry, announced a phased return for students to classrooms over the next four weeks, beginning with preschoolers, kindergarteners, and years 1,2,7, 11 and 12 students. The federal minister for education, Dan Tehan, has applauded this: Students get the best education in the classroom, learning from their teacher, so today\u2019s announcement by the ACT government is welcome news for students, parents, teachers and principals. Learning outcomes for vulnerable, poor, remote and Indigenous students suffer the most from remote learning, so the move back to classroom teaching will be most welcome for them. Our government has taken a consistent position to follow the expert medical advice and the expert medical advice has been consistent that schools are safe for students and teachers with the right protocols in place. Tasmania\u2019s premier, Peter Gutwein, has reported that one new case of Covid-19 was detected in that state late last night. It was the only new case in Tasmania in the past 24 hours. The state now has has 224 cases, 41 of which remain active. Gutwein said that after the national cabinet meeting Friday he would announce Tasmania\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d for the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, with a particular focus on which businesses might be able to resume operations and in what modified form. Tomorrow, after national cabinet, I\u2019ll be outlining Tasmania\u2019s way forward, and the roadmap that we\u2019ll be taking. One thing that I do want to make clear, though, is that we have to expect that we will see, with increased testing, positive cases bubble up. And we need to remain ever vigilant and maintain our discipline. In Tasmania, as I said, we will continue to march to the beat of our own drum. Anglicare Sydney, the operator of the Newmarch House aged care home in Sydney where 16 people have died from Covid-19, will appoint an external adviser to oversee the home\u2019s response to its ongoing outbreak. Newmarch House had been given until 5pm to appoint the adviser or it risked losing its licence to operate. In a statement, the organisation said: Anglicare Sydney has received a Notice from the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission requiring us to appoint an external adviser to support Anglicare management to meet its regulatory obligations, during the Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House. Anglicare will be making this appointment today. The new adviser will be appointed by Anglicare for a period of three months. The adviser\u2019s role does not extend to any other Anglicare residential aged care facility or any other Anglicare government funded program. Anglicare Sydney is confident with the support of the adviser and the Commission issues at Newmarch House will be resolved expeditiously. Residents and families can be assured that this will mean we will have additional expertise to support us during this extremely difficult time. The impact of the Covid-19 on Newmarch House has been unprecedented for residents, families and staff. All our energy and focus is dedicated to containing the spread and the impact of this devastating virus. More on Queensland. The relaxation of restrictions (just in time for Mother\u2019s Day) is designed to allow one household to visit another. And this can happen multiple times a day, with different households visiting. The press conference focuses on the nuts and bolts of how this might work. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, gave the example of a family visiting grandparents in the morning, and another family group visiting in the afternoon. That will be allowed. There is a limit of five visitors going to a household, but no limit on the number of people living at the visited household. It\u2019s about five people \u2013maximum \u2013 of one family group, one household group, going to another household group. One household going to another household. You can split it up. So, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot of mums out there who\u2019d love to see one household in the morning and another in the afternoon and another in the evening. That could happen. But they can\u2019t all go at the same time. So it\u2019s about one household with another household. Some further updates on Queensland\u2019s active cases from the health minister, Dr Steven Miles: There are just eight patients in hospital right now. Three of them are in ... intensive care. All of them are receiving ventilation. Those low numbers are what allows us to continue to ease those restrictions and I\u2019m sure mums right across the state will celebrate the fact that on Mother\u2019s Day they\u2019ll be able to welcome their families in single-household groups to visit them. Annastacia Palaszczuk has an update on her state. Only two new cases of Covid-19 have been detected overnight. Both are on the Gold Coast: That takes our total cases to 1,045. We only now have 50 active cases in Queensland. So that number keeps coming down. Once again, over 125,000 tests have been conducted. And there\u2019s a Mothers\u2019 Day reward for Queenslanders! Now, of course, this Sunday is Mothers\u2019 Day. And because Queensland has been doing such a great job, from Sunday, we will be allowing up to five members to visit a household right across Queensland. So that is great news for families. The five visitors must be from the same household. The rationale behind it is allowing family groups to visit. And multiple groups can visit a house over the course of a day. By the way, just a quick update on the political stoush unfolding in NSW over the Eden-Monaro byelection. The two frontrunners for the Liberal seat have now quit, with infighting in the party dominating headlines. The federal president of the National party, Larry Anthony, told ABC radio this morning that candidates need to \u201cpull their head\u2019s in\u201d as their responsibility is to the nation. Look, politics is is a rough game, and people are ambitious, that\u2019s just the reality ... A lot of these private conversations, they should not be in the public. And as I say, a day is a long time in politics and weeks almost a lifetime and we\u2019ve seen it now, with two very good candidates putting their hand up in the NSW government, and who chose not to. You can read what Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, thinks of the Nationals\u2019 conduct at the moment, here: The NSW deputy premier spent last weekend \u201con the farm\u201d despite telling the public not to travel. John Barilaro said travelling to his second property 125km away did not breach lockdown rules. Anne Davies has the full story: Two of those three new Covid-19 cases in NSW in the past 24 hours are from Newmarch House aged care home in western Sydney. They were identified as part of the daily testings all staff must undergo when entering the facility. More news from NSW\u2019s daily press conference: Gladys Berejiklian says it\u2019s unlikely there will be any extra easing of lockdown laws in NSW by Mother\u2019s Day. I want to manage expectations and say if national cabinet does suggest easing of restrictions, they won\u2019t be able to be made in time for Mother\u2019s Day. We will be able to visit them. Two adults and children at any one time and of course that can happen multiple times a day as long as everybody is careful. Another thing to look out for today, the Newmarch House aged care home has been given until 5pm to appoint an independent adviser to ensure the safety and wellbeing of residents, or it risks having its licence revoked. Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House has been hit hard by Covid-19, 16 residents have now died and 29 staff and 37 residents have been infected. Here is the response of the Anglicare chief executive, Grant Millard: We acknowledge the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission have, [yesterday] afternoon, taken regulatory action, including appointing an independent adviser to provide additional support to Newmarch House. Since the outbreak, we have had generous support of providers in the aged care sector, including commonwealth and NSW governments, and various agencies. While the outbreak at Newmarch House has proved very challenging for all involved, the situation has substantially improved. We will continue to collaborate with key stakeholders as we work through the continuing challenges in the coming weeks. Our primary concern remains the health, wellbeing and safety of our residents, their families, and our staff. You can read yesterday\u2019s Guardian Australia story here: Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed NSW has only had three additional Covid-19 cases overnight. The premier said all three were close contacts of known cases. There wasn\u2019t any community-to-community transmission in those three cases. That\u2019s a great result. If you compare that to a month ago, NSW was conducting a third of the number of tests with over 50 cases a day on average. It is a wonderful improvement and I want to say thank you to everybody. The ACT deputy chief minister, Yvette Berry, has announced a plan to return children to classrooms over the next four weeks. Here is the breakdown: From Monday 18 May, week 4 of term 2 All preschool, kindergarten, year 1, 2 and 7 students will return to their usual school for on-campus learning. Year 11 and 12 students will attend a combination of on-campus and remote learning. To support teachers to return to schools, children of teachers may also attend their usual school. From Monday 25 May, week 5 of term 2 All year 3, 4 and 10 students will return to their usual schools. From Tuesday 2 June, week 6 of term 2 All students in years 5, 6, 8 and 9 will return to their usual schools, meaning all year groups will have returned to on-campus learning. Remote learning will remain available for students with chronic health conditions or compromised immune systems. Still on Cedar Meats, Sally McManus said achieving safe physical distancing in some industries will require government regulation. With meatworks, they are competing against each other. If one of them implements social distancing and slow downs, it costs money \u2013 they\u2019ve all got to do it. You\u2019ve got to take away the reasons for employers not to put in physical distancing ... Most employers will do the right thing, but we can\u2019t leave it up to individual choice and the randomness of that. It has got to be enforced and it has got to be strongly backed in law. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, has once again called for paid pandemic leave after the outbreak at the Melbourne abattoir Cedar Meats: One of the big problems is that we have got workers, low-paid workers and they are casuals, labour hire workers \u2013 they depend on that money and they say, \u201cI\u2019ve got a scratchy throat,\u201d they are more likely to just soldier on rather than go get tested than to be positive and out of the workplace for two weeks. That\u2019s why we think there should be paid pandemic leave for all workers for this period of time while we\u2019ve got this pandemic. It is the only way to make sure that people aren\u2019t suffering an economic disincentive to put their hand to say. Today it\u2019s looking as though the talk of the town will be the great reopening. Lockdown laws are slowly easing and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has suggested he wants large sections of the economy back up and running in July. But if more of us are heading back to the office, what exactly does it take to have a Covid-19 safe workplace? My colleague Justine Landis-Hanley tries to answer just that in this report: We start the morning with a bit of a throwback. The former prime minister Kevin Rudd is chatting to ABC News Breakfast. Rudd says an inquiry into the origins of the virus and how the WHO handled the crisis is necessary but says Australia has gone about it the wrong way: If you\u2019re serious about a proposal like this, the first law of diplomacy is you bring a whole lot of other countries around with you to co-sponsor the proposal. I notice from events of the last several days, it was only after the statements by Mr Morrison and foreign minister Payne that they decided to correspond with the G20 governments in order to try and pull together some support. So, if you\u2019re serious about these things. The first lesson is you build up the diplomatic coalition in support of it and then you announce it, not the reverse way. Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic in Australia. You have me, Matilda Boseley, with you for this morning. We have woken up to some good news and bad news. First up, in potentially good news for universities, the head of a committee advising the federal government on overcoming the coronavirus crisis says Australian universities could organise charter flights to bring in foreign students to help prop up the country\u2019s higher education system. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity here for the universities to work with government to provide safe processes to get those students either in a holding pattern overseas, but then to expedite those visas, get those international students back here as quickly as we can,\u201d Nev Power, who heads up the government\u2019s Covid-19 coordination committee, told the Australian Financial Review. The businessman suggested the students would undergo coronavirus tests before departing and on arrival and be put in quarantine for two weeks in Australia. In not-so good news, research from the Australian National University shows Australians have suffered a $102bn blow to household income and one-quarter of people believe they will probably lose their jobs in the next year. You can read more on that from my colleague Paul Karp here. In overnight developments around the world: Spain has extended its state of emergency, with the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, saying that abruptly ending nearly eight weeks of lockdown would be \u201cunforgivable\u201d. The UK will consider easing its lockdown from Sunday, while its complacent attitude to the pandemic draws criticism from around the world. Cases in Iran are again rising, topping 100,000, after restrictions on movement were eased. China has said it will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging. Sweden has recorded almost 3,000 deaths from Covid-19, a figure the state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell called \u201ca horrifyingling large number\u201d. At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally are believed to have been infected, the International Council of Nursessays, noting that the the true figure could be as much as twice that. OK, let\u2019s get started.",

Finland\u2019s two-year scheme, which ran in 2017 and 2018 and attracted widespread international interest, paid 2,000 randomly selected unemployed people across the country a regular monthly income of \u20ac560 (\u00a3490), with no obligation to seek a job and no reduction in their payment if they accepted one. Aimed primarily at seeing whether a guaranteed income might encourage people to take up often low-paid or temporary work without fear of losing benefits, the scheme was not strictly speaking a universal basic income trial because the recipients came from a restricted group and the payments were not enough to live on. But it was watched closely by other governments who see a basic income not only as a way to get more people into some form of work, but also as a route to reducing dependence on the state and cutting welfare costs.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government has pushed back at US claims the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan lab and has determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document. It is understood the Morrison government sees the promotion of the theory the virus leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan, China, as counterproductive to Australia\u2019s push to gain broad international support for an independent inquiry into the origins and overall handling of the pandemic. But the government appears to be walking a diplomatic tightrope, declining to back up the claim while also not wishing to antagonise its US allies \u2013 given that Donald Trump and the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have claimed there is enormous evidence for the theory. Speculation about the possible involvement of the US embassy in distributing the dossier to News Corp has raised the diplomatic temperature. The embassy in Canberra declined to comment on a report in the Nine newspapers on Thursday of suspicions within senior ranks of the government and the intelligence community about a staffer\u2019s possible role. The deputy chair of the Australian parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee, Anthony Byrne, has been angered by the reported dossier, fearing the episode was reminiscent of the saga surrounding intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in 2003. Guardian Australia understands Byrne, a Labor MP, has been in regular contact with the intelligence community and senior members of the government to support them in pushing back against US government claims. In those conversations, he has argued that the dossier publicised in a weekend newspaper report was a crude attempt to influence Australia to act against its national interest on the basis of intelligence that didn\u2019t exist. The tensions flow from a report in News Corp\u2019s Daily Telegraph last Saturday that the 15-page \u201cdossier prepared by concerned Western governments\u201d included a raft of criticisms of China\u2019s \u201cassault on international transparency\u2019\u2019 and concerns about practices at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The dossier cited a research team\u2019s work discovering samples of coronavirus from a cave with genetic similarity to Covid-19, along with the synthesising of a bat-derived coronavirus that could not be treated, the Telegraph reported. The same article reported agencies within the Five Eyes intelligence alliance \u2013 the US, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK \u2013 were investigating the matter. However, Guardian Australia has learnt that Australia has determined the report is not a Five Eyes intelligence document. It is not believed to include original intelligence from human sources or electronic intercepts. Instead, the document appears to be a compilation of open-source material \u2013 reports and studies that were publicly available. The identity of the author remains unclear. It is further understood that Australian intelligence agencies are not backing up the line promoted by Trump and Pompeo, who said on Sunday there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus began in the lab. Pompeo appeared to soften his comments on Wednesday when he conceded that \u201cwe don\u2019t have certainty about whether it began in the lab or whether it began someplace else\u201d. Concerns the pandemic may have been triggered by a possible lab accident in Wuhan have been present in Australian policy discussion since the outset of the crisis, but there has never been enough evidence to support the contention. Scott Morrison has carefully declined to buy into the lab origin theory over the past week, saying he had \u201cnot seen anything that suggests that conclusively\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s been no change to the Australian position on this \u2026 which was to say that we can\u2019t rule out any of these arrangements \u2026 but the most likely has been in a wildlife wet market,\u201d the prime minister told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. \u201cWhat\u2019s really important is that we have a proper review, an independent review, which looks into the sources of these things in a transparent way so we can learn the lessons to ensure that were there to be a virus of pandemic potential that would originate anywhere else in the world, we can learn the lessons from that.\u201d With that focus, Morrison has written to G20 countries \u2013 including China and the US \u2013 to try to build support for an independent review \u201cat the right time\u201d. The review would look at the outbreak\u2019s emergence, development into a pandemic, the WHO\u2019s and broader international response, and ways to strengthen the world\u2019s collective ability to respond to pandemics. The Australian government wants the changes to include strengthened inspection powers for the WHO. At the World Health Assembly on 18 May, Australia plans to support an EU-sponsored draft resolution that includes a call for an independent evaluation to review lessons learned. Allan Behm, the head of the international and security affairs program at the Australia Institute and a former senior defence official, said those pushing the Wuhan labs story without solid supporting intelligence or evidence were not helping Australia\u2019s call for a properly conducted international review. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t help Australia in pushing that, any more than fake intelligence on WMD helped the credibility of John Howard in 2003, and I suspect that\u2019s why the government is treading very carefully this time,\u201d Behm said. Other experts backed up the need for the dossier to be treated with caution. \u201cThe origins of the document are opaque, and the reliability of the sources are not fully corroborated,\u201d John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University, said. \u201cAnd there are some political overtones which means you have to suspend judgment on its veracity, reliability and accuracy.\u201d Dr Hume Field, science and policy advisor for China and Southeast Asia with EcoHealth Alliance and an international authority on emerging zoonoses associated with bats, said an investigation into the origin of Covid-19 \u201cshould be driven by science, not politics\u201d. Field, an epidemiologist who worked on the multi-national investigation into the origin of Sars which included scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said the the molecular biological evidence demonstrated no evidence that SARS-Cov-2 was created or manipulated in a laboratory. \u201cIt\u2019s puzzling to me, there is a perfectly natural or scientific explanation staring you in the face. But there seems to be a need from some people to say \u2018that\u2019s too simple, there must be a conspiracy here\u2019.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Sister Ester keeps several small plastic bags of colourful methamphetamine \u2013 or meth \u2013 tablets beside her bed, along with a pistol and a plastic box of bullets. \u201cAll of these items were seized by our group in raids on houses selling drugs over the past few weeks,\u201d she says. A Christian ethnic Kachin nurse in her 60s, she says she has nowhere else to keep the haul. \u201cThe safest way is to keep them with us until we can destroy them,\u201d she says. Ester says she is ready to sacrifice her life to eradicate the crisis destroying lives in her remote town in Myanmar\u2019s north-eastern Shan state, on the border with China. A senior nurse providing healthcare to the people of Mone Paw village in Muse township, Ester also leads an anti-drug movement called Hkam Sha Hpung, which translates from the Kachin language as \u201cthose who can\u2019t stand the situation\u201d. The group calls itself \u201cgroup of mothers\u201d in Burmese. Her village is in an area that was partially controlled by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) until 2011, when a 17-year ceasefire between the group and Myanmar\u2019s military broke down. Fighting between a patchwork of militias broke out across Shan state, and the area has since become the centre of the global methamphetamine trade. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that meth made in labs in south-east Asia could be worth more than $60bn (\u00a348bn) a year, and that much of it originates in Shan state. The area around Mone Paw village is controlled partly by government troops, partly by the KIA, and partly by an ethnic Palaung armed group called the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army. The local economy is traditionally based on farming, including maize and rice crops which are sold to Chinese brokers. But with fighting intensifying in recent years, agricultural trade has been eclipsed by meth production. \u201cThe drug problem is growing very fast,\u201d says Ester. According to the UNODC Myanmar is also the world\u2019s second-largest producer of opium, with poppy cultivation centred in Shan. But opium cultivation is declining as regional demand for heroin is overtaken by a booming market for synthetic drugs. Back in 2012, Ester estimates that most of the men in Mone Paw village \u2013 which has a population of almost 3,000 \u2013 used drugs. Her husband was among them. \u201cI tried very hard to help him. I even locked him in a room for several days. Unfortunately, I failed to help,\u201d she says. The couple divorced in 2012. Soon afterwards, Ester formed the anti-drug group, initiating an informal movement in cooperation with other village women. Some of the men in the village had joined armed groups, while others were away working in China. With the police, the military and rebel armed groups among local authorities involved in the drugs industry to some extent, the women felt they needed to fill the gap. Lashi Htan, the group\u2019s vice-chair, was one of the first to join. Two of her three sons were drug users at the time. \u201cWe were heartbroken to see the ones we love become drug addicts. It brought us together,\u201d she says. Initially, the group helped only their families. \u201cWe chained them up and locked them in a room for weeks, sometimes up to a month. We provided them with healthcare and faith healing,\u201d Htan says, referring to their method of treatment, which involves surrounding recovering users with prayer and religious songs . \u201cThank God, my sons are not in hell, but are working in China now,\u201d she says. Nearly a decade after it was formed, the group now covers 22 villages. It conducts surprise checks on vehicles passing through the area, and raids dealers\u2019 houses. The women issue fines and the money funds the group\u2019s operations. \u201cIf they refuse to pay the fine, we destroy their property,\u201d Htan says, explaining that they set it on fire. Sometimes the group sells seized goods at the local market. \u201cAt first, we were not so effective, but we became the last straw for drowning people to grasp,\u201d she said. Armed groups in the area provide the women with security and information about drug production in areas controlled by rivals. The Myanmar military, for example, feeds them information about drug production in areas controlled by the KIA, and vice versa. The women say that to some extent they are being exploited, but that the arrangement helps them on their mission to eradicate drugs. \u201cHalf a loaf is better than none,\u201d says Ester. \u201cWe need to have good relations with armed groups for our safety.\u201d Even so, the women often receive threats. A bomb was left outside the front door of Ester\u2019s home in 2014. It was defused and handed to the Mone Paw Militia, who are aligned with Myanmar\u2019s military. \u201cThe father of the drug addict responsible for the bomb came and apologised to me [and said] that this would never happen again,\u201d says Ester. .

Iquitos faces an added obstacle in efforts to contain the disease: as the largest city in the world which cannot be reached by road, it depends on intermittent air deliveries for essential supplies of medicine, personal protective equipment and oxygen. \u201cWe are living in a catastrophe,\u201d said Graciela Meza, executive director of the regional health office in Loreto, the vast Amazon region which surrounds the city of half a million inhabitants.

Her tone switched to anger as she said: \u201cWe only have our dreadful authorities to blame for their corruption and decades of chronic under-investment in healthcare.\u201d The comments reflected growing outrage at the slow response of the regional government amid allegations that private companies were profiteering from a monopoly on oxygen tanks. The local prosecutor\u2019s office in Iquitos has announced an investigation into reports that the Loreto regional government was paying inflated prices for oxygen cylinders \u2013 including alleged purchases from a company owned by the daughter of a councillor.

      "bodyText": "JD Sports Fashion has criticised the competition watchdog for paving the way for potential job losses after the retailer was blocked from merging with a struggling rival, Footasylum. Peter Cowgill, the executive chairman of the UK\u2019s largest sports retailer, said the company \u201cfundamentally disagreed\u201d with the Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s decision, which was \u201cabsurd\u201d in the light of the high street\u2019s struggles. JD, which owns a string of sports and outdoor-wear chains including Blacks, Go Outdoors, Millets and Spain\u2019s Sprinter, as well as JD Sports, said it was considering whether to appeal against the ruling, which will require it to sell off Footasylum just over a year after acquiring the chain for \u00a390m. JD said Footasylum may have disappeared from the high street without its financial backing, and any new owner would probably cut jobs at the struggling chain. Cowgill said: \u201cWe fundamentally disagree with the CMA\u2019s decision, which continues to rely on an inaccurate and outdated analysis of the UK sports retail competitive landscape, and is underpinned by outdated and flawed customer surveys.\u201d In a veiled reference to Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, he added: \u201cIncredibly, the CMA has been taken in by the self-serving testimony of one notoriously vocal competitor, who has made numerous public announcements.\u201d He said that competitor had \u201cblatantly participated in the process for their own commercial interests rather than for the benefit of consumers\u201d. The CMA said it was blocking the merger as it would lead to a \u201csubstantial lessening of competition in sports-inspired casual footwear and apparel products sold both in stores and online. As a result, shoppers would be worse off.\u201d It said JD should sell Footasylum and that the coronavirus lockdown, which has forced both companies temporarily to close all their outlets, should not make any difference to its decision. But the regulator left some room for manoeuvre should high street closures bring about further changes in the market. \u201cThere is flexibility in our remedies implementation process, which means we can respond to any relevant developments throughout the sale process,\u201d the CMA said. Cowgill said the CMA\u2019s year-long investigation had failed to take into account significant changes in the market, with the coronavirus outbreak forcing trading to move exclusively online, and intensified competition.

Some days, the number hits 1,000.</p> <p>For the Sikh community that \u2013 in normal times \u2013 worships at the Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara in Gravesend, Kent, this is simply an adaptation of <em>langar</em>, the communal kitchen that provides free food to the needy day in and day out.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has extended the definition of those in need beyond the poor, homeless and lonely to frontline workers fighting the disease in long, exhausting shifts in hospitals and care homes.

Then, eight meals were prepared and distributed. Now, demand is so great that the community has been forced to direct some requests to other gurdwaras.</p> <p>All through the day, volunteers deliver donations of ingredients from local companies, supermarkets and individuals to the padlocked gates of the imposing temple, built on an 3 hectare (8 acre) site that includes sports grounds and a day care centre for the elderly. The gurdwara\u2019s walls and interior are decorated with marble inlaid with precious stones from Rajasthan, mosaics, and intricately carved wood from Punjab.</p> <p>Its three huge halls for worship and weddings are currently empty, but the kitchens house efficient production lines for preparing and packaging food. In one kitchen, eight women rolled balls of chapati dough into more than 400 discs before flipping them on a hot stove and rubbing them with butter. Others stirred vats of soya curry to hasten the cooling process and chopped peppers for the next day\u2019s dish.</p> <p>In a second kitchen, volunteers portioned rice and kala chana into recyclable plastic containers, and rolled chapatis in tin foil.

Now the older ones are stuck at home, and the younger ones have the time to help.\u201d</p> <p>It is very painful for older members of the community not to be able to visit the gurdwara to pray or to help with outreach work, he added.

      "bodyText": "They start at 4am, chopping vegetables, mixing spices, soaking legumes, kneading chapati dough. Scores of volunteers are split into five teams working in shifts: cooking, packing, delivering, cleaning and answering the phones. By the end of the day, at least 850 meals have been delivered to staff at five nearby hospitals, care homes and vulnerable individuals. Some days, the number hits 1,000. For the Sikh community that \u2013 in normal times \u2013 worships at the Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara in Gravesend, Kent, this is simply an adaptation of langar, the communal kitchen that provides free food to the needy day in and day out. The coronavirus crisis has extended the definition of those in need beyond the poor, homeless and lonely to frontline workers fighting the disease in long, exhausting shifts in hospitals and care homes. The gurdwara\u2019s deliveries remove the need to bring food from home or grab a snack from a vending machine. The work of the Gravesend gurdwara is just one example of a marathon, nationwide effort to feed the NHS over recent weeks. Restaurants and cafes forced to close to the public by the lockdown have created and delivered meals. Fast food chains have joined the effort, bakers have contributed sweet treats, and Deliveroo has pledged to make half a million meals available free to NHS workers in hospitals. Churches, mosques, synagogues and other faith organisations are stepping up to support the NHS and other frontline workers. A church in Bath, St Michael\u2019s Without, has turned over its space for a PPE production line. Exeter Cathedral\u2019s Company of Tapisers has set aside their delicate stitching of vestments and kneelers to run up hospital scrubs. Christ Church in Anfield has teamed up with Liverpool football club to offer free meals to vulnerable and elderly people. Mosques all over the country are taking Ramadan iftar meals to Muslims on the frontline and to people isolated at home. The United Synagogue is delivering \u201cShabbat in a box\u201d to Jews in isolation or in need. The Guru Nanak Darbar gurdwara started its NHS meal delivery service on 23 March , the daythe lockdown was announced. Then, eight meals were prepared and distributed. Now, demand is so great that the community has been forced to direct some requests to other gurdwaras. All through the day, volunteers deliver donations of ingredients from local companies, supermarkets and individuals to the padlocked gates of the imposing temple, built on an 3 hectare (8 acre) site that includes sports grounds and a day care centre for the elderly. The gurdwara\u2019s walls and interior are decorated with marble inlaid with precious stones from Rajasthan, mosaics, and intricately carved wood from Punjab. Its three huge halls for worship and weddings are currently empty, but the kitchens house efficient production lines for preparing and packaging food. In one kitchen, eight women rolled balls of chapati dough into more than 400 discs before flipping them on a hot stove and rubbing them with butter. Others stirred vats of soya curry to hasten the cooling process and chopped peppers for the next day\u2019s dish. In a second kitchen, volunteers portioned rice and kala chana into recyclable plastic containers, and rolled chapatis in tin foil. All the food is refrigerated before delivery. According to Manpreet Singh Dhaliwal, 30, who was elected as the gurdwara\u2019s president in January, the past few weeks have manifested a generational shift. \u201cNormally it is the older generation who volunteer [for langar], while their children and grandchildren are at work. Now the older ones are stuck at home, and the younger ones have the time to help.\u201d It is very painful for older members of the community not to be able to visit the gurdwara to pray or to help with outreach work, he added. Sikhs are taught from an early age the importance of service to the community. Seven miles away, at Darent Valley hospital, Leslieann Osborn, who is normally the director of strategy and planning, now focused on operational matters, was ready for the late morning delivery of food from the gurdwara. \u201cWe\u2019ve been absolutely blown away by the generosity of the community and the temple,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single day they\u2019ve brought lunch and dinner for staff. At the peak of this crisis, staff in critical care and respiratory wards simply didn\u2019t have time to get food. This has kept them nourished.\u201d The hospital had passed a peak in Covid-19 admissions, she said. \u201cThe intensive care unit is back to normal full capacity. At the peak, it tripled. After two months of working at very high adrenaline levels, we need to reflect and learn the lessons that will prepare us for a second peak.\u201d During the darkest days, the frontline workers had been sustained emotionally by \u201cthe love of the community\u201d and physically by the food it had brought to the hospital doors. \u201cAnd it\u2019s delicious. I could live off these lunches forever.\u201d",

Judged by this&nbsp;yardstick, the UK was last in recession in 2008-09, when there were&nbsp;six consecutive quarters of negative growth.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Some economists believe this definition of recession is flawed, since an economy would not be in recession if it contracted by 5% in the first quarter, expanded by 0.1% in each of the following two quarters and then contracted again by 5% in the fourth quarter. It would, however, be deemed to be in recession if it grew by 5% in each of the first and fourth quarters but contracted by 0.1% in each of the second and third quarters.</p>\n    <p>An alternative \u2013 and tougher definition \u2013 is a full calendar year of negative output. Given the UK economy has grown on average by 2.5% over many decades, it is rare for gross domestic product (GDP) to fall on an annual basis. There have been only five such years since the end of the second world war: 1974, 1975, 1980, 1981 and 1991.</p>\n    <p>The United States has its own method of assessing recession, with the National Bureau of Economic Research's business cycle-dating committee making a judgment.</p>\n    <p>The NBER defines recession as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales\".</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>That said, the Bank is still working on the assumption that there is a V-shaped pattern to the economy, albeit with the downward part of the V taking six months and the upward part taking 18 months. Some voluntary physical distancing will continue even after formal government curbs have been removed, it suspects.</p> \n<p>The Bank was at pains to point out that it has produced an illustrative scenario rather than a forecast, and that\u2019s a reasonable point. Forecasting is tough at the best of times: in the current circumstances \u2013 where there is uncertainty about how fast restrictions will be lifted, how consumers will behave, and whether there will be a second wave of infection \u2013 it is all but impossible.</p> \n<p>All that can really be said is that the risks to the Bank\u2019s scenario are skewed heavily to the downside.

Assuming they are reassured that playing cricket again does not risk their health, will they be in a fit state to perform in a Test match? Without wishing to enhance any reputation as a curmudgeon the answer is: \u201cDo me a favour. Of course they will.\u201d</p> <p>It was suggested a month ago by the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, that England\u2019s players would need four weeks to be ready for a Test. Well, they may want four weeks, but they don\u2019t <em>need</em> it.</p> <p>If the West Indies series really can begin on 8 July<sup>,</sup> both sides will struggle to prepare but it would be wildly inappropriate for them to complain. The level of the players\u2019 fitness and form would be a pinprick compared to other considerations and in any case \u201cthe same for both sides\u201d mantra applies. We are in extreme circumstances.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b0977b59586d506e3cb4df300d338747ce5b33be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0977b59586d506e3cb4df300d338747ce5b33be/336_17_2070_2584/801.jpg\" alt=\"Wally Hammond batting for England during the 1945 Victory Test series against Australia\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wally Hammond batting for England during the 1945 Victory Test series against Australia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Did Wally Hammond and Lindsay Hassett insist upon a delay to the start of the Victory Test series in 1945 to allow both sides to complete their physical and mental preparations? I don\u2019t think so.</p> <p>The crowds flocked to those matches as a visible sign of national relief and an expression of hope that life was returning to normal. That will not be possible in 2020 and there is no victory to celebrate, but there is an appetite for some live sport even if all the seats at the grounds (presumably Old Trafford and the Ageas Bowl) are empty.</p> <p>With safeguards satisfied and permission granted, the players are obliged to put on a show but the matches will be hard-pressed to emulate the joyous, fraternal contests between England and the Australian Services of 75 years ago (bear in mind Don Bradman was in Australia at the time).</p> <p>In fact the idea that the only way to prepare for an international is by playing several matches beforehand is now outmoded. Admittedly Sir Geoffrey Boycott has always been keen to point out the imperative of playing proper cricket before any Test, and before him Fred Trueman would not take much prompting to point out that he bowled 1,200 first-class overs every season. Playing cricket probably <em>is</em> the best way to prepare for an international match, but this has rarely been the way over the past couple of decades.</p> <p>Modern players are not spooked by a lack of match practice. Prince among these is surely England\u2019s white-ball captain, Eoin Morgan of Middlesex \u2013 notionally. In 2019 he played two Championship matches for his county, which was two more than he managed in 2018, 2017 and 2016.</p> <p>Morgan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/16/eoin-morgan-england-captain-future-chris-woakes-cricket\">is a national treasure after</a> last summer\u2019s World Cup triumph but one should also admire how he has cracked the system. He has proven that it is possible to flourish playing the odd game around the globe \u2013 his latest non-international venture was for the Delhi Bulls in the T10 Super League in Abu Dhabi \u2013 in between captaining England. He still manages to deliver at regular intervals as a batsman on the international stage. That is neat.</p> <p>Before the virus took hold two more unlikely characters demonstrated how it was possible to excel after being pitchforked into a Test without playing beforehand. Mark Wood played no Championship cricket for Durham last summer when he only appeared in ODI cricket for England until the World Cup final.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet when selected for two Test matches in South Africa in January he prospered, such was the diligence and determination of his preparations. Dom Bess did not have to deal with the constant threat of injury like Wood yet when he suddenly appeared in South Africa, a novice in Test cricket, he had not played a match since the previous September. Yet he also performed remarkably well.</p> <p>It is easier for bowlers to survive without match practice. They can enhance their fitness and tune the appropriate muscles by bowling in the nets or on the square, which can be a solitary, lonely pursuit. With dedication and a carefully planned routine it is clearly possible to prepare effectively for a Test match in this way. Wood keeps proving that. It is even possible to do so and keep within the physical-distancing guidelines.</p> <p>It is tougher for batsmen; it is more difficult for them to ease back into form in the middle of a Test. One mistake and they can be back in the pavilion. More than bowlers they need the rhythm of batting in a match. The magic touch has to return. But let\u2019s not be too precious about this. The logistical challenge of playing a Test in the time of coronavirus is a massive undertaking; by comparison remembering how to bat, bowl and field is a doddle.</p>",

Of course they will.\u201d It was suggested a month ago by the director of cricket, Ashley Giles, that England\u2019s players would need four weeks to be ready for a Test. Well, they may want four weeks, but they don\u2019t need it. If the West Indies series really can begin on 8 July, both sides will struggle to prepare but it would be wildly inappropriate for them to complain. The level of the players\u2019 fitness and form would be a pinprick compared to other considerations and in any case \u201cthe same for both sides\u201d mantra applies. We are in extreme circumstances. Did Wally Hammond and Lindsay Hassett insist upon a delay to the start of the Victory Test series in 1945 to allow both sides to complete their physical and mental preparations? I don\u2019t think so. The crowds flocked to those matches as a visible sign of national relief and an expression of hope that life was returning to normal. That will not be possible in 2020 and there is no victory to celebrate, but there is an appetite for some live sport even if all the seats at the grounds (presumably Old Trafford and the Ageas Bowl) are empty. With safeguards satisfied and permission granted, the players are obliged to put on a show but the matches will be hard-pressed to emulate the joyous, fraternal contests between England and the Australian Services of 75 years ago (bear in mind Don Bradman was in Australia at the time). In fact the idea that the only way to prepare for an international is by playing several matches beforehand is now outmoded. Admittedly Sir Geoffrey Boycott has always been keen to point out the imperative of playing proper cricket before any Test, and before him Fred Trueman would not take much prompting to point out that he bowled 1,200 first-class overs every season. Playing cricket probably is the best way to prepare for an international match, but this has rarely been the way over the past couple of decades. Modern players are not spooked by a lack of match practice. Prince among these is surely England\u2019s white-ball captain, Eoin Morgan of Middlesex \u2013 notionally. In 2019 he played two Championship matches for his county, which was two more than he managed in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Morgan is a national treasure after last summer\u2019s World Cup triumph but one should also admire how he has cracked the system. He has proven that it is possible to flourish playing the odd game around the globe \u2013 his latest non-international venture was for the Delhi Bulls in the T10 Super League in Abu Dhabi \u2013 in between captaining England. He still manages to deliver at regular intervals as a batsman on the international stage. That is neat. Before the virus took hold two more unlikely characters demonstrated how it was possible to excel after being pitchforked into a Test without playing beforehand. Mark Wood played no Championship cricket for Durham last summer when he only appeared in ODI cricket for England until the World Cup final. Yet when selected for two Test matches in South Africa in January he prospered, such was the diligence and determination of his preparations. Dom Bess did not have to deal with the constant threat of injury like Wood yet when he suddenly appeared in South Africa, a novice in Test cricket, he had not played a match since the previous September. Yet he also performed remarkably well. It is easier for bowlers to survive without match practice. They can enhance their fitness and tune the appropriate muscles by bowling in the nets or on the square, which can be a solitary, lonely pursuit. With dedication and a carefully planned routine it is clearly possible to prepare effectively for a Test match in this way. Wood keeps proving that. It is even possible to do so and keep within the physical-distancing guidelines. It is tougher for batsmen; it is more difficult for them to ease back into form in the middle of a Test. One mistake and they can be back in the pavilion. More than bowlers they need the rhythm of batting in a match. The magic touch has to return. But let\u2019s not be too precious about this. The logistical challenge of playing a Test in the time of coronavirus is a massive undertaking; by comparison remembering how to bat, bowl and field is a doddle.",

It was carried out in 2016 and involved 950 officials from central and local government, as well as emergency response planners, responding to an imaginary outbreak of \u201cswan flu\u201d. A report of the exercise was compiled the following year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taking place over three days in October, participants were asked to imagine a fictitious \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d flu pandemic, affecting up to 50% of the population and causing up to 400,000 excess deaths.</p>\n    <p>Officials were told to assume they were managing week 7 of the government\u2019s response. The objective of such simulations is to test how existing plans would hold up under strain, while acclimatising ministers and officials to the kind of decisions they would be forced to make.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it find?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The report warned that the government\u2019s flu plans, at least in 2016, were \u201ccurrently not sufficient\u201d to tackle a severe flu pandemic. Some organisations\u2019 plans were out of date and referred to cooperation with other bodies that no longer existed.</p>\n    <p>In other instances plans were in place, but were found to be lacking or required elaborating. Warnings were made about the inability of the social care sector to struggle with the serious pressure that a pandemic would cause.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it recommend?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Cygnus makes 26 recommendations to the department of health and other bodies. Among them were the suggestion that further modelling be done to understand the capacity of the care sector, the creation of a joint-level tactical plan to ensure different organisations could interact more effectively, and that more work needed to be done to understand how the public would respond to interventions by the government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What does the government say?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The government has claimed to have implemented the recommendations of the Cygnus report in full. In an interview with LBC the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that after media reports of the simulation emerged, health officials assured him that its recommendations were followed. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the UK was among the countries of the world best prepared for a flu pandemic, and that the government tested its flu plans regularly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt beggars belief,\u201d Green told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a report that made some really clear recommendations that haven\u2019t been implemented.

They might have done this planning behind the scenes, but they haven\u2019t involved the care providers.\u201d</p> \n<p>The report states that the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, whose members commission care services, should be involved in developing a way to assess surge capacity in social care during a pandemic.

      "bodyText": "A secret government report that said the UK was not prepared for a pandemic and forewarned of the Covid-19 crisis in care homes is being published by the Guardian. The report is based on the findings of a government simulation of an influenza pandemic, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. It concluded starkly that Britain was not adequately prepared for a flu-like pandemic\u2019s \u201cextreme demands\u201d. The 2017 report is likely to raise questions over whether ministers ever implemented key recommendations pertaining to the care home sector. It contained 26 key recommendations, including boosting the capacity of care homes and the numbers of staff available to work in them. It also warned of the challenge facing homes asked to take in patients from hospitals. Asked recently about the report on Exercise Cygnus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he had been assured by officials at the Department of Health that \u201ceverything that was recommended was done\u201d. However, Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England, which represents the largest independent care home providers, said concerns raised by the exercise about the social care system\u2019s ability to handle patients discharged from hospitals and the need for the largest private care providers to increase capacity were not raised by government agencies with his members. \u201cIt beggars belief,\u201d Green told the Guardian. \u201cThis is a report that made some really clear recommendations that haven\u2019t been implemented. If they had put in place a response to every one, we would have been in a much better place at the start of this pandemic.\u201d Covid-19 has swept through the UK\u2019s care homes, killing 6,686 people up to 1 May in England and Wales, in some cases claiming dozens of lives in a single facility. Operators have been beset by shortages of essential personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect staff and limit the spread of the virus among residents who are by definition the most vulnerable to the disease. With a third of all Covid-19 deaths so far being recorded in care homes, Boris Johnson told parliament on Wednesday: \u201cThere is an epidemic going on in care homes, which is something I bitterly regret.\u201d The government has kept the Exercise Cygnus report secret since it was first circulated in Whitehall three years ago, and has resisted growing calls for more transparency, which culminated in the announcement of a legal case to force ministers to release the findings. However a copy was leaked to the Guardian, which is publishing the document in the public interest. The report, marked \u201cOfficial \u2013 Sensitive\u201d, is being published in full, although names and email addresses of government officials have been redacted. Public Health England ran the Cygnus exercise in October 2016, coordinating more than 950 people, from Department of Health ministers to teams of local emergency planners and prison officers, to test the UK\u2019s response to a new global pandemic, envisaged to be influenza. The exercise included four dummy meetings of Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency response system, over three days, as ministers and officials were tasked with imagining the UK was facing the peak of infections. A report on Exercise Cygnus was produced in July 2017 and sent to all major government departments, NHS England, and the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It stated as its \u201ckey learning\u201d that \u201cthe UK\u2019s preparedness and response, in terms of its plans, policies and capability, is currently not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic that will have a nationwide impact across all sectors\u201d. The report recommended that a comprehensive \u201cpandemic concept of operations\u201d be created and that NHS England should conduct further work to prepare \u201csurge capacity\u201d in the health service. It explicitly recommended that the social care system needed to be able to expand if it were to cope with a \u201cworst-case scenario pandemic\u201d, and that money should be ringfenced to provide extra capacity and support to the NHS. It also said the Department of Health should consider bringing back \u201crecently retired nurses and care workers to deal with the extra strain on the system\u201d. Such staff could be involved in \u201cvital tasks\u201d, it said, including \u201copening up more distribution points for personal protective equipment (PPE) and working on essential communications to the public\u201d. Concerns were raised about the ability of the social care system to \u201cprovide the level of support needed if the NHS implemented its proposed reverse triage plans, which would entail the movement of patients from hospitals into social care facilities\u201d. During the coronavirus crisis, care homes have been asked to take recovering Covid-19 patients, leading to concerns that they may spread the infection if not properly isolated and treated, which is not always possible in care settings. When Hancock was asked about Exercise Cygnus on 28 April, on LBC radio, he replied: \u201cI asked my officials to go back when this first came up in the press a few weeks ago and check that everything that was recommended was done and that\u2019s the assurance that I got.\u201d However, senior figures in the care sector are raising questions about whether the recommendations pertaining to the care sector have been implemented in full. Vic Rayner, the chief executive of the National Care Forum, said: \u201cThe sort of plan you might anticipate coming from these recommendations has not been evident in terms of a national or local government approach. They might have done this planning behind the scenes, but they haven\u2019t involved the care providers.\u201d The report states that the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services, whose members commission care services, should be involved in developing a way to assess surge capacity in social care during a pandemic. However, the Guardian understands the association was not asked to do so. Care England\u2019s Green said the recommendations for expanding capacity and staff levels were not discussed with providers following the 2017 report. \u201cNobody has ever had that conversation with us,\u201d he said. \u201cCare England has been talking about providing extra capacity for years. We have been telling them that we have capacity and people don\u2019t need to be in hospital. But we have got nowhere.\u201d In response to a freedom of information request by the Guardian last month, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) refused to publish the report on Exercise Cygnus, claiming that it would \u201cprohibitively impact the ability of ministers to meet with officials and external stakeholders to discuss ongoing policy development\u201d. The report on at least one similar previous exercise, Winter Willow, has been published without controversy. Last month solicitors at Leigh Day announced that an NHS doctor had instructed them to pursue legal action against the DHSC to try to force the release of the report. Moosa Qureshi, whose case is being crowdfunded, argued there was an \u201cexceptionally strong public interest in the publication of the report given the lessons and recommendations are directly relevant to the system and procedures that have been developed\u201d. A government spokesperson said that lessons from Exercise Cygnus had been learned and continued to be considered. \u201cThe UK is one of the most prepared countries in the world and, as the public would expect, we regularly test our plans. What we learned from previous exercises helped us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented global crisis,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cWe have followed a science-led action plan designed at all times to save lives and support our NHS. \u201cOur planning helped prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and means we are now moving past the peak of the virus.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus pandemic has revealed a lot about British society \u2013 the fragility of the economy, the insecure situation so many workers find themselves in \u2013 but it has also shone a light on the state itself. Many comparisons have been made between the current mobilisation of state resources and the second world war. But while that crisis involved a ramping up of public sector capacity, this one is being managed by a state that believes itself to be utterly dependent on the private sector.</p> <p>First, there are the outsourcing giants, shadowy corporations who have been handed numerous contracts over the past 20 years. Matt Hancock has put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/uk-government-using-crisis-to-transfer-nhs-duties-to-private-sector\">Serco</a> in charge of the phonelines for contact tracing, a vital part of the government\u2019s public health strategy. This is a company that mismanaged data <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/20/serco-nhs-false-data-gps\">at a GP surgery</a>, and failed to train staff properly for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/04/breast-cancer-screening-hotline-staffed-by-people-with-only-an-hours-training\">breast cancer hotline service</a>. Along with G4S, it claimed money from the government for tracking prisoners who were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/03/serco-fined-229m-over-electronic-tagging-scandal\">later found to be dead</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/uk-government-using-crisis-to-transfer-nhs-duties-to-private-sector\">UK government 'using pandemic to transfer NHS duties to private sector'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You might also remember G4S \u2013 which is helping out with the new testing centres as well as security for Nightingale hospitals \u2013 for its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/24/london-2012-olympics-g4s-military\">failure to provide security</a> for the 2012 Olympics. Meanwhile Capita has a contract to help the NHS recruit returning nurses and doctors. This is the same Capita that caused headaches for doctors everywhere by <a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/gp-practices/primary-care-support-services/pcse-primary-care-support-england-service-failures\">wrongly archiving</a> 148,000 patient medical records. </p> <p>Then there are the management consultants and accountants. Matt Hancock has chosen Deloitte, one of the \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy giants, to advise on PPE nationally, as well as manage logistics for testing centres and new laboratories for processing samples. This is one of the consultancies that has <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-cuts-crisis-government-consultancies-millions-paid-a7640176.html\">advised the NHS</a> on how to cut and privatise itself for years. Research clearly shows that private sector management consultants not only <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/21/hospitals-waste-money-hiring-management-consultants/\">fail to improve efficiency</a> in our NHS, they actually make things worse. </p> <p>Finally, in the realm of tech, the US data mining group Palantir, headed by a Silicon Valley billionaire, is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-palantir-peter-thiel/\">gathering information</a> from NHS trusts on PPE; and Amazon is delivering testing kits, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/04/amazon-tim-bray-resigns-working-conditions-coronavirus\">despite being criticised</a> by its own workers for its response to Covid-19. </p> <p>In handing out lucrative new contracts to these private companies \u2013 the value of which the government has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d45d8540-7bc0-4faa-aeda-a1ed73ed82f7\">refused to reveal</a> \u2013 ministers have used special powers that allow them to award contracts by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/uk-government-using-crisis-to-transfer-nhs-duties-to-private-sector\">bypassing</a> the usual tendering process. Although such a mechanism appears logical in an emergency, its existence is a testament both to the way the British state has depleted its own ability to manage affairs and its automatic presumption in favour of outsourcing.</p> <p>The public sector could and should use its existing knowledge and in-house expertise to get the job done, employing and training staff as needed to deal with this crisis directly. This is exactly what happened, for example, when the Department for Transport <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/feature/flying-colours-how-dft-rescued-140000-holidaymakers-stranded-thomas-cook%E2%80%99s-collapse\">rescued 140,000 holidaymakers</a> left stranded after the collapse of Thomas Cook last year. The NHS locally could plan the delivery of vital responses like tracking and testing, using its existing knowledge and expertise and involving local communities.</p> <p>And while outsourcing has been justified over the years through the language of \u201ccost-saving\u201d, the truth is that this is about ideology.</p> <p>Take the NHS, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/25/margaret-thatcher-pushed-for-breakup-of-welfare-state-despite-nhs-pledge\">outsourcing</a> has been one of the main ways governments have <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-privatise-nhs-tories-privatising-private-insurance-market-replacement-direct-democracy-a6865306.html\">achieved privatisation</a> by stealth. How did this happen? In the 1980s, the government started to privatise laundry, catering and cleaning in the health service \u2013 outsourcing staff on worse terms and conditions to save money. And the impact this had on outcomes was clear, as private cleaning companies consistently cut corners. Outsourcing \u2013 whether it\u2019s cleaning, facilities management, GP \u201cout-of-hours\u201d services, treatment centres, clinical services or IT \u2013 has often <a href=\"http://gala.gre.ac.uk/8084/\">damaged the quality</a> of patient care. </p> <p>In 2006, the Blair government privatised the NHS supply chain, now responsible for delivering PPE.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic has revealed a lot about British society \u2013 the fragility of the economy, the insecure situation so many workers find themselves in \u2013 but it has also shone a light on the state itself. Many comparisons have been made between the current mobilisation of state resources and the second world war. But while that crisis involved a ramping up of public sector capacity, this one is being managed by a state that believes itself to be utterly dependent on the private sector. First, there are the outsourcing giants, shadowy corporations who have been handed numerous contracts over the past 20 years. Matt Hancock has put Serco in charge of the phonelines for contact tracing, a vital part of the government\u2019s public health strategy. This is a company that mismanaged data at a GP surgery, and failed to train staff properly for a breast cancer hotline service. Along with G4S, it claimed money from the government for tracking prisoners who were later found to be dead. You might also remember G4S \u2013 which is helping out with the new testing centres as well as security for Nightingale hospitals \u2013 for its failure to provide security for the 2012 Olympics. Meanwhile Capita has a contract to help the NHS recruit returning nurses and doctors. This is the same Capita that caused headaches for doctors everywhere by wrongly archiving 148,000 patient medical records. Then there are the management consultants and accountants. Matt Hancock has chosen Deloitte, one of the \u201cbig four\u201d accountancy giants, to advise on PPE nationally, as well as manage logistics for testing centres and new laboratories for processing samples. This is one of the consultancies that has advised the NHS on how to cut and privatise itself for years. Research clearly shows that private sector management consultants not only fail to improve efficiency in our NHS, they actually make things worse. Finally, in the realm of tech, the US data mining group Palantir, headed by a Silicon Valley billionaire, is gathering information from NHS trusts on PPE; and Amazon is delivering testing kits, despite being criticised by its own workers for its response to Covid-19. In handing out lucrative new contracts to these private companies \u2013 the value of which the government has refused to reveal \u2013 ministers have used special powers that allow them to award contracts by bypassing the usual tendering process. Although such a mechanism appears logical in an emergency, its existence is a testament both to the way the British state has depleted its own ability to manage affairs and its automatic presumption in favour of outsourcing. The public sector could and should use its existing knowledge and in-house expertise to get the job done, employing and training staff as needed to deal with this crisis directly. This is exactly what happened, for example, when the Department for Transport rescued 140,000 holidaymakers left stranded after the collapse of Thomas Cook last year. The NHS locally could plan the delivery of vital responses like tracking and testing, using its existing knowledge and expertise and involving local communities. And while outsourcing has been justified over the years through the language of \u201ccost-saving\u201d, the truth is that this is about ideology. Take the NHS, where outsourcing has been one of the main ways governments have achieved privatisation by stealth. How did this happen? In the 1980s, the government started to privatise laundry, catering and cleaning in the health service \u2013 outsourcing staff on worse terms and conditions to save money. And the impact this had on outcomes was clear, as private cleaning companies consistently cut corners. Outsourcing \u2013 whether it\u2019s cleaning, facilities management, GP \u201cout-of-hours\u201d services, treatment centres, clinical services or IT \u2013 has often damaged the quality of patient care. In 2006, the Blair government privatised the NHS supply chain, now responsible for delivering PPE. And in 2012, David Cameron\u2019s government introduced the Health and Social Care Act, allowing NHS services to be contracted out to \u201cany qualified provider\u201d. Private firms, often operating under the NHS logo, were given a staggering \u00a39.2bn in NHS contracts in 2018. The chief executive at Epsom hospital has asked to take over the management of the flagship testing centre at Chessington, after Deloitte\u2019s failings led to NHS staff test results being mixed up and lost. What the hospital managers recognised is what the research has been telling us for years: the evidence does not support the lazy assumption that outsourcing or privatisation is inherently more efficient. This government has a deep distrust of the state. But in trying and failing to outsource this crisis to the private sector, it should start to recognise the urgent need to rebuild state capacity so that vital services can be delivered in house \u2013 both as an emergency measure and as a sensible long-term policy. \u2022 Cat Hobbs is the founder of We Own It, an organisation that campaigns for public ownership of public services",

The world was facing, she declared, a \u201ccrisis like no other\u201d. For the first time since records began, the entire world economy is contracting, rich and poor countries alike.</p> <p>But it is not just the immediate impact that makes this economic crisis unprecedented. It is its genesis. This isn\u2019t 2008, which was triggered by a meltdown of North Atlantic banking. And it isn\u2019t the 1930s; an earthquake that originated in the fault lines left by the first world war. The Covid-19 economic emergency of 2020 is the result of a massive global effort to contain an unknown and lethal disease. It is both a surprising demonstration of our collective power to stop the economy and a shocking reminder that our control of nature, on which modern life rests, is more fragile than we like to think. What we are living through is the first economic crisis of the Anthropocene.</p> <p>This is the era in which humanity\u2019s impact on nature has begun to blow back on us in unpredictable and disastrous ways. The great acceleration that defined the Anthropocene may have begun in 1945, but in 2020 we are facing the first crisis in which the blowback destabilises our entire economy. It is a reminder of how encompassing and immediate that challenge is. While the timeline of the climate emergency tends to be measured in years, Covid-19 circled the globe in a matter of weeks. And the shock goes deep. By calling into question our mastery over life and death the disease shakes the psychological basis of our social and economic order. It poses fundamental questions about priorities; it upends the terms of debate. Neither in the 1930s nor after 2008 was there any question that getting people back to work was the right thing to do.</p> <p>Stressing the unprecedented nature of the Covid-19 shock is not to say that the problems exposed by the financial crisis of 2008 are not still with us today. As the pandemic surged in March 2020, the fragility of financial markets was only too apparent. If the lockdowns are followed by a prolonged recession, as is more than likely, the banks will suffer severe damage. Nor does a stress on the uniqueness of the Covid shock imply that geopolitical tensions between China and the US do not matter. They do. The Sino-American conflict puts the future of the world economy in question and this is all the more alarming as tensions over the politics of the virus mount every day.</p> <p>But the crucial point is that financial stability and geopolitics are now entwined with a challenge, which, as the French president Emmanuel Macron has put it, is anthropological: what is at stake is the trade-off between economic activity and death. A chance mutation in the environmental pressure cooker of central China has put in jeopardy all our ability to go about our daily business. It is a malign version of the butterfly effect. Call it the bat effect.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c71956f3ccc8e021a58b0a26affc4cfddeed2fc5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c71956f3ccc8e021a58b0a26affc4cfddeed2fc5/0_0_3572_2144/1000.jpg\" alt=\"healthcare workers protesting in the Piedmont region of Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Despair \u2026 healthcare workers protesting in the Piedmont region of Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alberto Ramella/AGF/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it has circulated around the world, Covid-19 has scrambled the timeline of progress. Sophisticated hospitals in China, Italy and the US have been reduced to chaotic, impotent despair. Nurses in New York resorted to swaddling themselves in rubbish bags. Face masks were hand-fabricated on sewing machines. We stack the dead in refrigerator trucks.</p> <p>We have to face the possibility that we have been living in a charmed interval. In the century since the Spanish flu of 1918-19, the intertwined rise of globalisation and national welfare states took place against the background of relatively benign disease conditions. Thanks to improved nutrition, sanitation and housing, public health, pharmacology and high-tech medicine we have seen remarkable progress in human life expectancy. The conquest of smallpox in 1977 was emblematic. The sense that infectious diseases were a thing of the past underwrote a promise of protection. With Covid-19 the cost of that protection has gone way up. In a horrific mind-warp, advanced economies suddenly find themselves facing the kinds of dilemma habitually faced by poor countries. We don\u2019t have the tools. In the poor world, the everyday result is that children are stunted and families are impoverished. Millions die for lack of treatment. Covid-19 has delivered a taste of that to the rich world.</p> <p>We cannot say we were not warned. Since the famous<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/19/why-limits-to-growths-forecasts-are-still-relevant-today\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/19/why-limits-to-growths-forecasts-are-still-relevant-today\">Limits to Growth </a></em>report by the Club of Rome thinktank in 1972, experts have been highlighting the natural forces that could interrupt the triumphant path of economic growth. In the wake of the oil shocks of the 1970s, resource depletion was a big concern. In the 1980s the climate crisis took over. But at the same moment, the shock of HIV/Aids sparked awareness of a different type of blowback from nature: the threat of \u201cemerging infectious diseases\u201d and specifically those generated by zoonotic mutation.</p> <p>Starting from a famous conference at Rockefeller University in 1989, it has been argued again and again that this is no coincidence. It is the result of humanity\u2019s relentless incorporation of animal life into our food chain. HIV/Aids, Sars, avian flu, swine flu and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\">Mers</a> could all be attributed to that dangerous appetite. Like the climate crisis, epidemics are not merely accidents of nature. They have anthropogenic drivers.</p> <p>The implications of this analysis are radical. But the doctors and epidemiologists who make it are not revolutionaries. What they have insistently called for is a global public health infrastructure commensurate with the risks that globalisation entails. If we are going to keep huge stocks of domesticated animals and intrude ever more deeply into the last remaining reservoirs of wildlife; if we are going to concentrate in giant cities and travel in ever larger numbers, this comes with viral risks. If we wish to avoid disasters we should invest in research, in monitoring, in basic public health, in the production and stockpiling of vaccines and essential equipment for our hospitals. Of course, that would require considerable political coordination and some investment. But it has always been clear that the payoff would be huge. The flu pandemic of 1918 which is thought to have killed 50 million people sets a high bar. If a pandemic erupted and had to be contained by quarantine it was always obvious that the costs would run into the trillions of dollars.</p> <p>With the climate crisis we know what stands in the way of an adequate reaction. Fossil fuels are essential to our way of life. Powerful business interests have a huge stake in climate denial. The strategic interests of the US, Saudi Arabia and Russia are all invested in oil. Decarbonising is expensive, technically complicated and the benefits are diffuse and longterm.</p> <p>In regard to global health policy there are bureaucratic rivalries between different national and global agencies. There are differences in approach between hawkish experts in global health security and biomedical humanitarians. The pharmaceutical industry will not invest in drugs unless it sees a profit. Cost-conscious hospitals want to minimise spending on beds. But all this seems small beer compared to the risks involved. Whereas one can reasonably say that giant structures such as capitalism and geopolitics stand in the way of addressing the climate crisis, the same is not true of Covid-19. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd28d79f-8a0a-44c6-ac74-1abb17344c5b\">cost of vaccinating the entire world</a> is estimated at around $20bn. That is the equivalent of roughly two hours of global GDP, a tiny fraction of the trillions that the crisis is costing. The fact that this virus was allowed to become a global crisis is not explicable in terms of massive opposed interests. It is first and foremost a failure of government.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>It turns out that we can pause the world economy. But we now face the awesome responsibility of reopening it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because they are relatively cheap and the scale of the risk is huge, all major countries in fact had pandemic preparations in place. None were as ample as we might now wish. But in places including South Korea, Taiwan and Germany they have worked. Making good plans, following through on them and doing the basic things right turns out to matter. Addressing the climate crisis poses the daunting challenge of slowing the entire system down. What Covid-19 teaches is that it is not just the big picture that matters. So tightly knit is our global system that small failures of governance in a few crucial nodes can affect everyone on the planet.</p> <p>The remarkable thing about Covid-19 is that it brings the risks of the Anthropocene home to each and every one one of us individually. The lockdowns have not simply been a top-down government measure. It has been people themselves who have en masse decided on their own response to the threat, often ahead of their governments. That was most dramatically reflected in the financial markets, which began a global run to safety. It was that which triggered first the central banks and then parliaments and governments into action. It turns out that we are capable of pausing the world economy. But we now face the awesome responsibility of reopening. If Georgieva is right that this is a crisis like no other, so too is the problem of the restart. The stakes could hardly be higher. On the one hand are the huge medical risks; on the other is a disastrous economic crisis. How can we make the trade-off? It is tempting to reject the choice as impossible or false. Not only is that not true, it also denies the fact that, under normal circumstances, we routinely engage in life and death trade-offs. Even in the most affluent societies, financially motivated decisions are made every day that decide the chances of death due to workplace accidents, pollution, car crashes, hospital funding, drug procurement and health insurance.</p> <p>But never before has the question been put in such direct terms for entire nations. The result is predictably divisive. The US is currently embarked on a crash test, with southern Republican states such as Georgia ploughing ahead despite inadequate testing or medical backup. Incited by the president himself, armed militia occupied the Michigan state capitol demanding \u201cliberation\u201d from the lockdown. Meanwhile in Germany Angela Merkel reprised her role in the eurozone crisis by trying to stifle any discussion. This was not a moment for \u201corgies of debate about reopening\u201d, she insisted. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d was, once again, the order of the day.</p> <p>The magic bullet would be a medical solution \u2013 antibody tests, effective treatments, a vaccine. It took five years to develop a vaccine for Ebola, though vastly greater resources are being thrown at this problem. But what we are counting on should not be confused with business as usual. We have never successfully developed a corona vaccine. We are betting not on normal science, but on a modern wonder, a \u201cscientific miracle\u201d. And, even in the best case, if a vaccine is rolled out in 2021, we cannot escape the logic of risk society. We now know what this kind of threat can do. We know we lost a big chunk of 2020. How do we move on from here?</p> <p>The obvious solution is to make the investments in global public health that experts have been calling for since the 1990s. There will be political and commercial obstacles to overcome. China and the US are at odds and seem determined to politicise the pandemic. On top of that the vast financial cost of the crisis will hang over us. Huge debts are likely to encourage talk of austerity. Since the 1990s, market-focused politics of economy in the public sector have weakened health systems around the world. Ultimately politics will be decisive, and the last six months have brought crushing defeats for the left on both sides of the Atlantic. The prevailing political tenor of the crisis, so far, has been conservative and nationalist.</p> <p>Faced with the crisis, Jair Bolsonaro and Donald Trump have cut ludicrous figures. But they express a deep desire to deny the significance of the shock. Who would not rather think that this was simply the flu? Given this temptation, what we should guard against is not open displays of denial but the soft alternative. Covid-19, like the unprecedented hurricanes and devastating fires of 2019, will be dismissed as a freak of nature. That is comforting. It will be good for business in the short run. But it sets us up for another crisis. If it is right that Covid-19 is a crisis like no other, what is to be feared is that there will be more like it to come \u2022</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government wants to emerge from Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting with a timetable for reopening parts of the economy in several stages, with intervals between easing the restrictions of up to four weeks to establish whether Covid-19 infections have flared, and manage any outbreaks. While the premiers from the two most populous states warned on Thursday that easing restrictions too quickly could trigger a second wave of infections, undoing the progress in flattening the curve, Canberra remains concerned about the mounting fiscal and economic costs of the restrictions. One of the pressing concerns is the banks are stretched because they are carrying loan repayment deferrals in the order of $160bn to try to help households and businesses ride out the economic shock of the pandemic. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has told the government the total number of loans subject to repayment deferrals is currently 6% of mortgages and 13% of loans to small and medium businesses. Guardian Australia understands the plan for Friday\u2019s deliberation about easing restrictions has been worked up in consultation with the chief medical advisers and it has been circulated to the states. It is likely Friday\u2019s meeting will set an aspirational target rather than a concrete commitment for when the lockdowns will end. Morrison has told the states there are five steps associated with managing the risks of the coronavirus, starting with delivering relief and supports to the community during the lockdowns, gradually reopening the economy, then providing confidence to ensure Australians feel safe participating in the economy and society again, then resetting policy on the other side to ensure economic growth comes back during the recovery phase. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, intends to provide a more comprehensive stocktake of the cost of the interventions and the impact of the pandemic on key economic indicators in a ministerial statement to parliament on Tuesday. Morrison will also participate on Thursday night in a hookup between nations that have dubbed themselves \u201cthe first movers\u201d \u2013 countries that have been successful at flattening the curve of infections. The leaders of Austria, Greece, Israel, Denmark, Singapore, New Zealand and the Czech Republic will compare notes about the strategies they have used. Some of the smaller states in Australia are already moving towards a reopening of some services and an easing of the social distancing restrictions, but New South Wales and Victoria have expressed public reluctance to go hard too quickly. Earlier on Thursday, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said if the restrictions were unwound too quickly Australia could end up with a second outbreak. Andrews said Australia had to stay the course and not let frustration \u201cget the better of us\u201d. \u201cThere are parts of the world that let off restrictions very early \u2013 they thought they had beaten it, turned out they hadn\u2019t,\u201d the premier said. \u201cThey now have even stricter lockdowns in place than they ever had, before they let their frustrations get the better of them, perhaps, and changed the settings.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said the objective was to return to normal as soon as possible but \u201cwe don\u2019t want to have a spike in cases that exceeds what we can manage\u201d. NSW and Victoria \u2013 the states with the highest number of coronavirus infections \u2013 led the lockdowns of non-essential services in March, and it has been a consistent dynamic inside the national cabinet that the two most populous states are more strongly in favour of restrictions than some of the smaller states. Morrison has already telegraphed his expectation that different states will relax restrictions at different times after any agreement on Friday, but he has also argued it will be up to the premiers to explain those differences to their constituents. All governments are expecting an increase in the number of Covid-19 infections when the restrictions come off, but officials argue the health system is better prepared to deal with the caseload than it was at the start of the pandemic.",

      "body": "<p>The jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce has confirmed it is preparing to make large-scale job cuts in the expectation of several years of lower commercial aviation demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The company is considering making as many as 8,000 of its 52,000 global workforce redundant, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has severely affected Rolls-Royce\u2019s business, because aircraft <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/airbus-reduces-jet-production-coronavirus-crisis\">manufacturers have cut production rates </a>and air traffic has plummeted, dealing a huge blow to its units servicing jet engines.</p> <p>About 4,000 UK workers have been furloughed, the company said on Thursday before its virtual annual meeting, meaning the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/27/ftse-100-firms-using-furlough-scheme-pay-ceos-average-of-36m\">government was paying 80% of the wages </a>of about a quarter of the company\u2019s UK workforce. Some of its workers were involved in the national effort to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/we-made-right-choice-in-ventilator-race-says-uk-consortium-head\">build more ventilators for the NHS</a>.</p> <p>With lower aerospace volumes expected for some time, however, Rolls-Royce would have to shrink permanently, its chief executive, Warren East, said.</p> <p>The company had to \u201ctake the difficult but necessary decisions to ensure the group emerges from this period with the appropriate cost base for what will be a smaller commercial aerospace market which may take several years to recover\u201d, he said.</p> <p>The company expects to deliver only 250 engines this year, just over half its previous expectation of 450. Its engines are used on Airbus\u2019 A330, A340, A350 and A380 planes, and the Boeing 777 and 787 Dreamliner.</p> <p>Many of the airlines who operate such aircraft have already revealed swingeing job cuts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/british-airways-plans-to-make-up-to-12000-staff-redundant\">British Airways is making 12,000 workers </a>redundant, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/01/ryanair-cut-jobs-coronavirus-grounds-flights-restructuring\">Ryanair </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/virgin-atlantic-to-close-gatwick-operations-and-lose-3000-workers\">Virgin Atlantic are each cutting 3,000 jobs</a>.</p> <p>Rolls-Royce said the flying hours clocked up by its engines around the world were about 40% below previous expectations during the first four months of the year. Hours fell by 90% in April, resulting in a \u201csignificant reduction in the volume of service visits\u201d.</p> <p>East also said that the company was making \u201cstronger than expected progress\u201d in cutting costs, allowing it to save \u00a31bn this year.</p> <p>The firm has also made some progress in returning the troubled Trent 1000 engine to full working order. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/rolls-royce-says-extra-plane-engine-checks-will-drive-up-costs\">The engine has been plagued </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/13/rolls-royce-says-extra-plane-engine-checks-will-drive-up-costs\">with problems </a>for more than two years, and none of the workers on the programme have been furloughed as it tries to solve issues with the durability of parts in its compressor.</p> <p>Rolls-Royce said it had resolved eight of the nine issues it had with the engine. The engineering fixes and grounding of planes have already cost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/28/rolls-royce-makes-29bn-loss-as-engine-fault-costs-790m\">billions of pounds</a>.</p> <p>The company said its significant defence business has cushioned the blow dealt by the slump in commercial aviation, although physical distancing rules had caused disruption. Demand from its energy customers has fallen, however, because of the crisis in the oil and gas sector caused by low oil prices.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce has confirmed it is preparing to make large-scale job cuts in the expectation of several years of lower commercial aviation demand as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The company is considering making as many as 8,000 of its 52,000 global workforce redundant, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. The coronavirus crisis has severely affected Rolls-Royce\u2019s business, because aircraft manufacturers have cut production rates and air traffic has plummeted, dealing a huge blow to its units servicing jet engines. About 4,000 UK workers have been furloughed, the company said on Thursday before its virtual annual meeting, meaning the government was paying 80% of the wages of about a quarter of the company\u2019s UK workforce. Some of its workers were involved in the national effort to build more ventilators for the NHS. With lower aerospace volumes expected for some time, however, Rolls-Royce would have to shrink permanently, its chief executive, Warren East, said. The company had to \u201ctake the difficult but necessary decisions to ensure the group emerges from this period with the appropriate cost base for what will be a smaller commercial aerospace market which may take several years to recover\u201d, he said. The company expects to deliver only 250 engines this year, just over half its previous expectation of 450. Its engines are used on Airbus\u2019 A330, A340, A350 and A380 planes, and the Boeing 777 and 787 Dreamliner. Many of the airlines who operate such aircraft have already revealed swingeing job cuts. British Airways is making 12,000 workers redundant, and Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic are each cutting 3,000 jobs. Rolls-Royce said the flying hours clocked up by its engines around the world were about 40% below previous expectations during the first four months of the year. Hours fell by 90% in April, resulting in a \u201csignificant reduction in the volume of service visits\u201d. East also said that the company was making \u201cstronger than expected progress\u201d in cutting costs, allowing it to save \u00a31bn this year. The firm has also made some progress in returning the troubled Trent 1000 engine to full working order. The engine has been plagued with problems for more than two years, and none of the workers on the programme have been furloughed as it tries to solve issues with the durability of parts in its compressor. Rolls-Royce said it had resolved eight of the nine issues it had with the engine. The engineering fixes and grounding of planes have already cost billions of pounds. The company said its significant defence business has cushioned the blow dealt by the slump in commercial aviation, although physical distancing rules had caused disruption. Demand from its energy customers has fallen, however, because of the crisis in the oil and gas sector caused by low oil prices.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England has warned the British economy could shrink by 14% this year and unemployment more than double by spring as the coronavirus causes the deepest recession in modern history. Leaving interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.1% as the economic crisis unfolds, the central bank said economic activity across the country had fallen sharply since the onset of the global health emergency and the lockdown measures to contain its spread. In a warning over the mounting damage to the economy, the Bank said gross domestic product (GDP) could plunge by 25% in the second quarter. For 2020 as a whole, the economy could shrink by 14%, marking the deepest recession for more than three centuries. Historical Bank estimates for GDP dating back to the 18th century show the economy only shrank more in 1706, by 15%, a year before the treaty of union between England and Scotland and only a dozen years since the Bank\u2019s foundation in 1694. As Boris Johnson prepares to announce the government\u2019s plan to gradually ease lockdown measures after more than a month of sweeping controls on social and business life, Threadneedle Street said it would take a year for the economy to return to normal and there were heightened risks of long-term damage. Andrew Bailey, who replaced Mark Carney as the Bank\u2019s governor as the Covid-19 outbreak worsened in March, said the country appeared to be entering the start of the next phase of the nation\u2019s pandemic response. He said: \u201cThe scale of the shock and the measures necessary to protect public health mean a significant loss of economic output has been inevitable in the near term.\u201d But striking a positive note, he said growth could rapidly recover next year, with Britain bouncing back faster than from the 2008 global financial crisis.

However, the scenario assumed no second wave of infections after the easing of lockdown measures over a four-month period from early June. Bailey said that if a second wave of infections did occur, the Bank would have to respond. \u201cIt is our job to meet the needs of the people and we all have our sleeves rolled up to do it.\u201d Although time is running out for ministers to hold talks with Brussels, the Bank\u2019s latest assessment of the economic outlook also included an orderly transition to a comprehensive EU free trade deal next year. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cThe Bank\u2019s scenario points to a fairly rapid recovery.

However, in a reflection of the scale of the economic shock, the rate-setting panel was split over increasing the Bank\u2019s \u00a3645bn quantitative easing stimulus package, with two members \u2013 Jonathan Haskel and Michael Saunders \u2013 voting for an immediate \u00a3100bn increase. Bailey said the Bank stood ready to \u201ctake further action as necessary\u201d as the coronavirus pandemic develops. In its first quarterly monetary policy report since the onset of the pandemic, the central bank said debit and credit card spending data pointed to a 30% plunge in consumer spending, while housing market activity had practically ceased. In the \u201cplausible illustrative economic scenario\u201d for UK growth and jobs in the report, it said GDP could fall by 25% in the second quarter and unemployment more than double to around 9%. While the Bank concluded that joblessness would have increased by much more without the government\u2019s coronavirus furlough scheme, such an increase would surpass the damage caused by the financial crisis.

Applying pressure on banks to continue lending, it warned failure to lend to businesses would exacerbate the economic collapse and would prove to be self-defeating as banks would face bigger losses as more companies failed. Bailey said that the message to UK banks that they would be better off lending than not lending had been \u201cwell communicated\u201d.

      "body": "<p>A cabinet minister has confirmed that 400,000 gowns from Turkey to protect medics from coronavirus have been impounded because they were poor quality, but he insisted \u201cstrong supplies\u201d were now coming through to the frontline.</p> \n<p>The personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey was heralded by ministers several weeks ago as \u201ca very significant\u201d shipment that would ease a shortage of gowns in the NHS, but the delivery turned into a shambles after it was repeatedly delayed.</p> \n<p>In a final blow to the government, Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, acknowledged on Thursday that the gowns had in fact been useless for medical purposes.</p> \n<p>Downing Street said the NHS was now in negotiations to get new gowns sent, or it would ask for a refund from the supplier. It would not give any details on the cost of sending an RAF plane to fetch the items.</p> \n<p>Lewis said: \u201cThere was a view that it was good enough PPE. It is only when it has got here that teams have looked at it again and taken a view that it is not up to the right standard and they\u2019ve decided not to use it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it is right that if we have got particular standards for what we want our frontline staff to be able to have access to, we make sure we stick to that.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf something isn\u2019t right, if we\u2019re not even sure about it then I think it is better to be safe and not use that product and stick with products we are confident are the right products and the right standards.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking on Sky News, he attempted to downplay the significance of the Turkish shipment, saying it was just one delivery.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some really strong supplies now coming through but we\u2019re always looking to ensure they are good enough,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>However, he was unable to say whether the Department of Health and Social Care would be able to get its money back, and why samples of the equipment were not checked before the transaction happened.</p> \n<p>The items are being held in a facility near Heathrow airport and sources said the DHSC intended to seek a refund, as it has done in similar situations in the past.</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cAll deliveries of PPE are checked to ensure the equipment meets the safety and quality standards our frontline staff need. If equipment does not meet our specifications or pass the assurances processes, it is not issued to the frontline.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked why the gowns were not checked before the RAF was sent to collect it, he said: \u201cAll items are checked when they get to the UK and before they are sent on to the NHS and I think that\u2019s the right approach to ensure that on the ground in the UK, proper checks are carried out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Turkish sources told the Guardian they were urgently trying to clarify the situation \u2013 but added that nobody had approached the country\u2019s embassy in London or appeared to have tried to claim replacements or a refund from the supplier, Selegna.</p> \n<p>They pointed out that the company had issued a statement to the BBC\u2019s Turkish service saying that nobody from the NHS had mentioned a problem when they were in contact earlier in the week and it stood ready to deal with any problems as needed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe fabric of the aprons is certified.

      "bodyText": "A cabinet minister has confirmed that 400,000 gowns from Turkey to protect medics from coronavirus have been impounded because they were poor quality, but he insisted \u201cstrong supplies\u201d were now coming through to the frontline. The personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey was heralded by ministers several weeks ago as \u201ca very significant\u201d shipment that would ease a shortage of gowns in the NHS, but the delivery turned into a shambles after it was repeatedly delayed. In a final blow to the government, Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, acknowledged on Thursday that the gowns had in fact been useless for medical purposes. Downing Street said the NHS was now in negotiations to get new gowns sent, or it would ask for a refund from the supplier. It would not give any details on the cost of sending an RAF plane to fetch the items. Lewis said: \u201cThere was a view that it was good enough PPE. It is only when it has got here that teams have looked at it again and taken a view that it is not up to the right standard and they\u2019ve decided not to use it. \u201cI think it is right that if we have got particular standards for what we want our frontline staff to be able to have access to, we make sure we stick to that. \u201cIf something isn\u2019t right, if we\u2019re not even sure about it then I think it is better to be safe and not use that product and stick with products we are confident are the right products and the right standards.\u201d Speaking on Sky News, he attempted to downplay the significance of the Turkish shipment, saying it was just one delivery. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some really strong supplies now coming through but we\u2019re always looking to ensure they are good enough,\u201d he said. However, he was unable to say whether the Department of Health and Social Care would be able to get its money back, and why samples of the equipment were not checked before the transaction happened. The items are being held in a facility near Heathrow airport and sources said the DHSC intended to seek a refund, as it has done in similar situations in the past. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cAll deliveries of PPE are checked to ensure the equipment meets the safety and quality standards our frontline staff need. If equipment does not meet our specifications or pass the assurances processes, it is not issued to the frontline.\u201d Asked why the gowns were not checked before the RAF was sent to collect it, he said: \u201cAll items are checked when they get to the UK and before they are sent on to the NHS and I think that\u2019s the right approach to ensure that on the ground in the UK, proper checks are carried out.\u201d Turkish sources told the Guardian they were urgently trying to clarify the situation \u2013 but added that nobody had approached the country\u2019s embassy in London or appeared to have tried to claim replacements or a refund from the supplier, Selegna. They pointed out that the company had issued a statement to the BBC\u2019s Turkish service saying that nobody from the NHS had mentioned a problem when they were in contact earlier in the week and it stood ready to deal with any problems as needed. \u201cThe fabric of the aprons is certified. All products are certified. If there was a problem, they could do research and let us know,\u201d said Mehmet D\u00fczen for Selegna. The announcement of the shipment by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, on 18 April came at a time when unions and professional bodies were warning that NHS staff may refuse to work without PPE. Jenrick told the daily Downing Street press briefing that healthcare workers should be \u201cassured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue\u201d, saying they would have the equipment they \u201cneed and deserve\u201d. Sources later told the Guardian that the DHSC had advised No 10 not to allow Jenrick to publicise the shipment in case it backfired, but was overruled. The necessary clearances, it turned out, had not been sought. When the consignment did not arrive on time as promised, the delay prompted hospital leaders to directly attack the government for the first time during the pandemic. Ministers responded by saying they thought it may only be a one-day delay. Two days later, with the shipment only then beginning to clear Turkish customs checks, they were only able to give an estimate of arrival \u201cin the next few days\u201d. The first planeload of gowns eventually arrived on 22 April, but the next day it was reported that \u201cless than a 10th\u201d of the order had arrived. Now all are expected to be returned. The saga, first reported by the Telegraph, is one of a series of highly publicised government coronavirus initiatives that have failed to deliver the promised results. Its much-trumpeted \u201cventilator challenge\u201d asked companies such as Rolls-Royce and Dyson to begin producing the machines, but none have reached the final stages of testing and the majority have proved surplus to requirements.

Appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, De Niro expressed his admiration for Cuomo, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s doing what a president should do.\u201d He added: \u201cI could see [a President Cuomo]. I am for Biden, and want everything to go well for Biden, but at least we have a person who is very capable, a very capable backup, if you will \u2026 he\u2019s doing a great job, he\u2019s doing what any president should do.\u201d Referring to Trump as \u201cthe idiot\u201d, De Niro went on to say: \u201cWe of course could have survived this [pandemic] much better if the idiot had done the right thing, listened and heeded all the warnings, there were many, many warnings, and we are all paying for it now. It would have been bad in some ways, but never like this.\u201d Describing the government response to the pandemic as \u201cappalling\u201d, De Niro said: \u201cEverybody knows what [Trump\u2019s] game is, it\u2019s all about him getting re-elected.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s crazy, I have no words for it any more \u2026 and what\u2019s scarier about it all is that the Republicans and his enablers around him are not doing anything. They are around a crazy person and they don\u2019t do anything. They are not standing up to him. As an actor, I say this is like Shakespeare. No one has the balls to stand up to this guy. They all have a platform \u2026 they\u2019re just not doing anything. What could be worth it for them, to sacrifice their souls to make this deal with the devil to work with this guy? It\u2019s crazy.\u201d De Niro has been one of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics since before the presidential election, describing him at various times as \u201ctotally nuts\u201d, a \u201cbullshit artist\u201d, a \u201cwannabe gangster\u201d and a \u201creal racist\u201d. In 2019, De Niro told the Guardian: \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see him in jail. I don\u2019t want him to die, I want him to go to jail.\u201d Cuomo said he approved of the idea during an appearance on the Late Show the following day, telling Colbert: \u201cOh, boy, that\u2019d be a treat. I\u2019m a big De Niro fan. He\u2019s a genius.\u201d",

The risk of Covid-19 death for people from Chinese and mixed ethnic groups was found to be similar to that for white people. \u201cThese results show that the difference between ethnic groups in Covid-19 mortality is partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained,\u201d the ONS said.

Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), said its airlines, which also include Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus and Spain\u2019s Iberia and Vueling, intended to operate about 1,000 flights a day between July and September. That represents half of the schedule the airline had expected to fly before the crisis forced it to ground almost all of its flights. The group hopes to run about 70% of its previously planned schedule by the final three months of the year, but Walsh said demand was unlikely to recover to 2019 levels before 2023 at the earliest.

Heathrow has won permission from the UK\u2019s supreme court to appeal against a ruling that blocks its plans on the grounds that they did not take into account airlines\u2019 role in worsening the climate crisis. IAG made a \u20ac1.7bn (\u00a31.5bn) loss after tax during the first quarter, compared with a profit of \u20ac70m in 2019. The loss included a \u20ac1.3bn charge as fuel and currency hedges became worthless, and will be followed by \u201csignificantly worse\u201d during the current quarter, IAG said in a statement to the stock market. The group has halted 94% of its flights in response to travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, causing it to bleed cash.British Airways set out plans last week to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant. Walsh said there would be further job cuts at IAG\u2019s other airlines, but he suggested they might be less affected than British Airways, which is more reliant on lucrative business customers. Leisure travel was expected to bounce back more quickly than business travel, Walsh said, but he rejected the view that the pandemic would prompt a permanent shift by businesses to video-conferencing.

He also said there would be no recovery in air traffic if the government introduced a 14-day quarantine on new arrivals, as required in some countries. Walsh also said he backed Gatwick to survive the crisis, despite many of the British Airways job cuts falling at the airport. Gatwick\u2019s future has been cast into doubt after Virgin Atlantic said it would shut its operation at the airport. Norwegian Air Shuttle, another large Gatwick carrier, has only narrowly secured its survival. IAG has not yet revealed the scale of job cuts planned by Aer Lingus and Vueling at Gatwick, but Walsh said he was confident in the airport\u2019s management.

Eleven people are confirmed to have died in Visakhapatnam \u2013 but with hundreds hospitalised and thousands affected, there are fears the toll will rise. In Bhopal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/04/bhopal-25-years-indra-sinha\"> 4,000 people died within days</a> of the toxic gas leak from a pesticide plant in the central Indian city, and thousands more in the following years.</p> <p>But there are also startling parallels. The leak in Visakhapatnam, an industrial port city in Andhra Pradesh state on India\u2019s east coast, was from two 5,000-tonne tanks of liquid chemicals. According to a local police officer, it occurred as the plant was being restarted as coronavirus restrictions imposed in late March were eased.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/india-gasleakmap/giv-3902j4zy6FuTpYT4\" data-alt=\"India gas leak map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/india-gasleakmap/giv-3902j4zy6FuTpYT4\">India gas leak map</a> </figure>  <p>In Bhopal, a much bigger leak occurred, also from a tank full of chemical liquid \u2013 extremely hazardous methyl isocyanate \u2013 as parts of the complex were reactivated after a shutdown.</p> <p>In both cases, the leak occurred at night, releasing gas into the crowded homes of workers and their families living around the factories. And both plants had overseas owners: South Korea\u2019s biggest petrochemical maker, LG Chem, in the case of Visakhapatnam, and US-based Union Carbide the majority owner in the case of Bhopal.</p> <p>Both incidents are only the most high-profile of thousands, big and small, that happen every year in India.</p> <p>Quite how many industrial accidents occur in India annually is unknown, as many go unreported.

      "bodyText": "The gas leak at a chemical factory in Visakhapatnam will immediately remind many in India and beyond of the 1984 Bhopal disaster, widely considered the world\u2019s worst industrial disaster. So far, the scale of the tragedies are very different. Eleven people are confirmed to have died in Visakhapatnam \u2013 but with hundreds hospitalised and thousands affected, there are fears the toll will rise. In Bhopal, 4,000 people died within days of the toxic gas leak from a pesticide plant in the central Indian city, and thousands more in the following years. But there are also startling parallels. The leak in Visakhapatnam, an industrial port city in Andhra Pradesh state on India\u2019s east coast, was from two 5,000-tonne tanks of liquid chemicals. According to a local police officer, it occurred as the plant was being restarted as coronavirus restrictions imposed in late March were eased. In Bhopal, a much bigger leak occurred, also from a tank full of chemical liquid \u2013 extremely hazardous methyl isocyanate \u2013 as parts of the complex were reactivated after a shutdown. In both cases, the leak occurred at night, releasing gas into the crowded homes of workers and their families living around the factories. And both plants had overseas owners: South Korea\u2019s biggest petrochemical maker, LG Chem, in the case of Visakhapatnam, and US-based Union Carbide the majority owner in the case of Bhopal. Both incidents are only the most high-profile of thousands, big and small, that happen every year in India. Quite how many industrial accidents occur in India annually is unknown, as many go unreported. Government statistics \u2013 which show 54,000 killed or injured in factory accidents between 2014 and 2016 \u2013 are thought to only represent a fraction of all casualties. Campaigners claim the true figure is up to 15 times greater. One problem is that few workers or their relatives are aware of their rights or have the resources to seek legal redress. Many are migrant workers from distant rural communities, a higher proportion are women, a significant number come from the most disadvantaged communities, and so are vulnerable to physical or other threats.

But the measures have been underwhelming and the virus\u2019s long horizon has meant Putin takes a back seat while local officials \u2013 such as Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin \u2013 lead the fight against the virus.</p> <p>\u201cPutin wants to become a ladder out of the crisis: Sobyanin makes rules and Putin will cancel them; that\u2019s a positive role,\u201d noted Pavlovsky. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way out of this crisis, this pandemic, yet. Things are still getting worse and more dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>The Kremlin\u2019s desire to carry out its political programme has appeared at odds with its response to the epidemic. Putin held off on cancelling the symbolic vote until late March and the Victory Day parade until mid-April, with thousands of soldiers being sent into quarantine as a preventive measure.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears the Kremlin was too focused on the constitutional and political reforms and not the epidemic,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe epidemic came later to Russia and it was possible to be better prepared.\u201d</p> <p>One thing is clear: this is not the time to hold a public vote that could backfire over the Kremlin\u2019s response to the epidemic. Analysts have suggested that it could be cancelled entirely, or delayed until the autumn when political conditions are more favourable.</p> <p>State television serves as a window on what could have been. On Sunday the <a href=\"https://www.1tv.ru/news/2020-05-03/385157-7_maya_ispolnitsya_20_let_so_dnya_pervoy_inauguratsii_vladimira_putina_na_post_prezidenta\">lead segment</a> on Channel One\u2019s flagship news programme, Vremya, was not an update on the country\u2019s battle with the virus but a 13-minute report marking 20 years since Putin\u2019s first inauguration on 7 May 2000. It felt like a time capsule from before the epidemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe very existence of the country was under threat,\u201d read Yekaterina Andreyeva, the well-known anchor. \u201cOver two decades, Russia has once again become a strong country that is once again reckoned with in the world and which is able to solve the hardest problems and overcome any obstacles.\u201d</p> <p>The political risk to the Kremlin is limited. Putin\u2019s approval ratings remain high, at 59%, and he has no true political rivals to present an alternative. The regional officials taking the lead in the fight against coronavirus owe their positions to him.</p> <p>But the Kremlin does closely follow its polling numbers, which have shown two years of sliding approval for Putin, mainly due to the economy. And the loss of this spring\u2019s political calendar has robbed the Kremlin of a chance to recharge his image as he begins a third decade in power.</p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t so scared of coronavirus as its economic consequences, salaries, redundancies,\u201d said Denis Volkov, the deputy director of the Levada Centre. \u201cAnd secondly, it is exhaustion with Putin himself \u2026 there are no expectations of anything new from him.\u201d</p> <p>The next stage of the crisis will take place as the scale of the epidemic becomes clear in Russia\u2019s regions, indicating whether Russia may be looking at an extended health crisis and how much longer the economy will remain shuttered. Already, a number of coronavirus hotspots have appeared at far-flung oil and gas fields and at regional hospitals.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole management system looks inefficient,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe regions are far less prepared in general to face the crisis than Moscow \u2026 I am afraid that they will suffer more.\u201d</p>",

As his health minister discussed regional payouts on Wednesday, the president distractedly rolled a pen back and forth across his desk, lost in a moment of reverie broadcast nationwide. \u201cPutin not only doesn\u2019t control the situation but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,\u201d said Nikolay Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British thinktank Chatham House. \u201cHe cannot adjust \u2026 I think partly Putin\u2019s lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position.\u201d He has sought to regain the initiative by holding televised briefings and promising economic stimulus to Russians hit by the economic downturn, while soliciting timetables for business to reopen. But the measures have been underwhelming and the virus\u2019s long horizon has meant Putin takes a back seat while local officials \u2013 such as Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin \u2013 lead the fight against the virus. \u201cPutin wants to become a ladder out of the crisis: Sobyanin makes rules and Putin will cancel them; that\u2019s a positive role,\u201d noted Pavlovsky. \u201cBut there\u2019s no way out of this crisis, this pandemic, yet. Things are still getting worse and more dangerous.\u201d The Kremlin\u2019s desire to carry out its political programme has appeared at odds with its response to the epidemic. Putin held off on cancelling the symbolic vote until late March and the Victory Day parade until mid-April, with thousands of soldiers being sent into quarantine as a preventive measure. \u201cIt appears the Kremlin was too focused on the constitutional and political reforms and not the epidemic,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe epidemic came later to Russia and it was possible to be better prepared.\u201d One thing is clear: this is not the time to hold a public vote that could backfire over the Kremlin\u2019s response to the epidemic. Analysts have suggested that it could be cancelled entirely, or delayed until the autumn when political conditions are more favourable. State television serves as a window on what could have been. On Sunday the lead segment on Channel One\u2019s flagship news programme, Vremya, was not an update on the country\u2019s battle with the virus but a 13-minute report marking 20 years since Putin\u2019s first inauguration on 7 May 2000. It felt like a time capsule from before the epidemic. \u201cThe very existence of the country was under threat,\u201d read Yekaterina Andreyeva, the well-known anchor. \u201cOver two decades, Russia has once again become a strong country that is once again reckoned with in the world and which is able to solve the hardest problems and overcome any obstacles.\u201d The political risk to the Kremlin is limited. Putin\u2019s approval ratings remain high, at 59%, and he has no true political rivals to present an alternative. The regional officials taking the lead in the fight against coronavirus owe their positions to him. But the Kremlin does closely follow its polling numbers, which have shown two years of sliding approval for Putin, mainly due to the economy. And the loss of this spring\u2019s political calendar has robbed the Kremlin of a chance to recharge his image as he begins a third decade in power. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t so scared of coronavirus as its economic consequences, salaries, redundancies,\u201d said Denis Volkov, the deputy director of the Levada Centre. \u201cAnd secondly, it is exhaustion with Putin himself \u2026 there are no expectations of anything new from him.\u201d The next stage of the crisis will take place as the scale of the epidemic becomes clear in Russia\u2019s regions, indicating whether Russia may be looking at an extended health crisis and how much longer the economy will remain shuttered. Already, a number of coronavirus hotspots have appeared at far-flung oil and gas fields and at regional hospitals. \u201cThe whole management system looks inefficient,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe regions are far less prepared in general to face the crisis than Moscow \u2026 I am afraid that they will suffer more.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It has been said that people in glass houses should not throw stones. But that didn\u2019t stop Steve Mnuchin, the US treasury secretary, from shooting straight at Axl Rose yesterday. The Guns N\u2019 Roses frontman (real name William Bruce Rose Jr) has recently aired his frustrations on Twitter about the Trump administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus. But this time, Rose engaged in a simple bit of name-calling. To be fair to Mnuchin, the name-calling seemed pretty uncalled for. It\u2019s been at least three days since Mnuchin did something stupid (like encourage US citizens to start traveling domestically during a pandemic); and at least a decade since he practically caused the financial crash. Mnuchin responded by asking Rose: \u201cWhat have you done for this country lately?\u201d Which would have been ironic enough on its own \u2013 seeing as Mnuchin is one of the people at the helm of an administration that has seen almost a quarter of the global deaths come from the US during this pandemic. But to make matters worse, Mnuchin accidentally ended his tweet with a Liberian flag emoji instead of the American flag. Mnuchin quickly amended his tweet to show the American flag, but not fast enough to duck another Rose attack. \u201cMy bad, I didn\u2019t get [that] we\u2019re hoping 2 emulate Liberia\u2019s economic model,\u201d said Rose. Liberia has one of the lowest GDP ranks in the world. Now, the Trump administration has been having a hard time recently \u2013 just yesterday, Trump walked around a mask-manufacturing plant without a mask on, while Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 cover of Wings\u2019 Live and Let Die blared out in the background. And the US and Liberian flags are easy to mistake \u2013 the only difference between the two is that the Liberian flag has one star in the box on its left corner, instead of 50. So you almost feel sorry for the guy. Then again, it is also the millionaire Mnuchin who thought Americans could live on $120 a week, because of, uh, bridge liquidity. It was also reportedly Mnuchin\u2019s idea to delay stimulus checks to millions of Americans because he wanted to get Trump\u2019s signature sprawled on all them before they were sent out.

I saw so many people \u2013 generally older than younger, overweight rather than underweight, and in poor health as opposed to being in great health \u2013 die a lonely death without being allowed to have any visitors.</p> <p>We did as much as we could, but now the situation is getting much better and there is a feeling it is under control. Lots of results for patients\u2019 coronavirus tests came through earlier and they were negative. You need several tests to be certain, but it seems like the virus has passed here. Instead of pumping on people\u2019s chests I\u2019m helping physiotherapists get people back on their feet. One patient has been in intensive care for 43 days and, amazingly, just stood up for the first time.</p> <h2>Junior doctor, east Midlands</h2> <p>We have fewer Covid patients than before, but we\u2019re still admitting new people and some coronavirus patients have been with us for a long time. It\u2019s still very difficult, when you have extremely sick patients and they sadly can\u2019t survive, but that uncertainty isn\u2019t there as much anymore. We understand more what we need to do to help them and ourselves, but we remain concerned that doctors and nurses are not getting enough PPE and colleagues have died in the east Midlands.</p> <p>We have had to weigh up not bringing people into hospital for cancer treatments against making sure we have enough beds for Covid patients. I don\u2019t envy the people having to make those decisions. What we really need to see is a sensible approach to coming out of the lockdown, because we\u2019re afraid of a second wave. It could be more fatal than the first if we bring everyone out too quickly and it would risk a second wave among the more vulnerable. That could overwhelm us and cause severe devastation.</p> <h2>A&amp;E consultant, south-west</h2> <p>We\u2019re still seeing Covid-19 patients and dozens have died during the past six weeks, but it\u2019s manageable now and we\u2019re now planning to open up the hospital. We\u2019re definitely seeing that some people are too scared to come to us, while others do not want to put any pressure on the NHS and are staying away until they have advanced symptoms. Staff here are frustrated, many still don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ve tested positive or not. We\u2019re definitely getting some false negatives. People we know have it are only testing positive by the second or third test. Still, there\u2019s definitely evidence that if we had been able to test our colleagues, it would have helped stop the spread of it in hospitals.</p> <p>We have a sense of deep loss for our colleagues who have tragically died. It could have been any one of us. It\u2019s unforgivable that we saw what happened in China, Italy and Spain, and knew it was coming. We knew that they had lost healthcare workers, but did not adequately prepare. We\u2019re going to be in this for the long haul until we get a vaccine. Covid-19 isn\u2019t going away. Its prevalence is lower in the community but it will remain with us.</p> <h2><strong>GP, rural south-west</strong></h2> <p>We\u2019re in isolation again. One of my kids has a temperature. If she did get it, the only person she could have got it from was me. But I can\u2019t get tested because I don\u2019t have symptoms, even though one in four of those with coronavirus may be an asymptomatic carrier. My boss just said it would be better for me to isolate for two weeks anyway, even if I got tested, as we just don\u2019t have confidence in them.

      "bodyText": "More people have died of coronavirus in the UK than in any other country in Europe, and details about the true scale of the pandemic continue to emerge as the extreme pressure on the NHS begins to ease. We have been speaking to frontline workers since the crisis began about how they are coping. They have told us how they were resigned to contracting Covid-19 because of shortages of protective equipment and a lack of testing as hospitals were inundated with coronavirus patients. Here, they recall the pandemic reaching its peak and begin to make plans for where the health service will go from here.

      "body": "<p>The Home Office chartered a private plane to deport dozens of EU nationals during lockdown, despite government stay-at-home <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-uk-transport-and-travel-advice#air-travel\">instructions</a> stating that people should not fly unless it was essential.</p> <p>The private jet, understood to be from Titan Airways, took off from Stansted last Thursday, 30 April. The flight to Poland was chartered at a time when air travel had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/flights-are-grounded-is-this-the-moment-we-give-up-our-addiction-to-flying\">fallen</a> by 95%.</p> <p>A woman on the flight said there were about 35 passengers, accompanied by around 40 to 50 Home Office escorts and plane crew.</p> <p>The woman, who was placed into quarantine on her arrival in Poland, questioned whether it could be defined as \u201cessential travel\u201d and said it was impossible to adhere to physical distancing rules during the flight.</p> <p>\u201cWe were given masks but some people took them off. It was impossible to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule on the plane. People were walking up and down the aisles brushing against each other all the time. One member of staff said to me after the flight landed in Poland: \u2018If one of us doesn\u2019t get Covid after this flight it will be a miracle.\u2019 It was all a bit scary.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said distancing rules were adhered to on the flight.</p> <p>The plane was chartered at a time when <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/coronavirus-covid19-social-distancing-on-planes-neither-necessary-nor-viable/\">no consensus had been reached</a> by airlines about how to safely restart flying for the public.</p> <p>The woman said she had lived in the UK for a decade, working in a restaurant, and had served six months in jail for a minor offence. </p> <p>\u201cI suffer from depression and PTSD and have had to leave my brilliant 11-year-old son behind. Although this flight was a voluntary return, I did not want to go.\u201d</p> <p>She said none of the passengers were tested for Covid-19 before boarding the plane.</p> <p>On Thursday <a href=\"https://www.mitie.com/bio/colin-dobell/\">Colin Dobell,</a> the managing director and founder of Mitie Care &amp; Custody, the largest provider of immigration detention services to the Home Office, told the home affairs select committee that he had recently contacted the Home Office to ask for routine Covid-19 testing for immigration detainees.</p> <p>A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere was no formal request for routine testing, and as people would expect testing has been prioritised for the sick and frontline workers. Immigration removal centres follow all Public Health England advice and if a detainee presents as symptomatic they have access to tests and appropriate medical care.\u201d</p> <p>People in immigration detention have access to solicitors, although mostly by phone rather than face-to-face visits during the lockdown. The woman deported to Poland said she had not been able to contact her solicitor, so felt she had no choice but to board the flight.</p> <p>James Wilson, the deputy director of <a href=\"https://detentionaction.org.uk/\">Detention Action</a>, which supports people held in immigration detention, said: \u201cAt a time when the official government advice is that we don\u2019t fly, it is staggering that the Home Office thought it appropriate to charter a private plane removing people to Poland.</p> <p>\u201cWith no tests carried out and insufficient social distancing in place, all those on that plane, including escorts, have been put in harm\u2019s way. We call for a stop on all removals from the UK during the pandemic, and believe no one should be in immigration detention at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>The Home Office said: \u201cWe are committed to removing foreign-national offenders wherever possible and followed Public Health England guidance, including social distancing measures, on the flight. Those on the flight also had access to the legal representation they needed.\u201d</p> <p>The spokesperson said the \u201csafe systems of work\u201d process was in place to ensure physical distancing on the flight, and passengers were seen by a healthcare professional before their departure.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Home Office chartered a private plane to deport dozens of EU nationals during lockdown, despite government stay-at-home instructions stating that people should not fly unless it was essential. The private jet, understood to be from Titan Airways, took off from Stansted last Thursday, 30 April. The flight to Poland was chartered at a time when air travel had fallen by 95%. A woman on the flight said there were about 35 passengers, accompanied by around 40 to 50 Home Office escorts and plane crew. The woman, who was placed into quarantine on her arrival in Poland, questioned whether it could be defined as \u201cessential travel\u201d and said it was impossible to adhere to physical distancing rules during the flight. \u201cWe were given masks but some people took them off. It was impossible to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule on the plane. People were walking up and down the aisles brushing against each other all the time. One member of staff said to me after the flight landed in Poland: \u2018If one of us doesn\u2019t get Covid after this flight it will be a miracle.\u2019 It was all a bit scary.\u201d The Home Office said distancing rules were adhered to on the flight. The plane was chartered at a time when no consensus had been reached by airlines about how to safely restart flying for the public. The woman said she had lived in the UK for a decade, working in a restaurant, and had served six months in jail for a minor offence. \u201cI suffer from depression and PTSD and have had to leave my brilliant 11-year-old son behind. Although this flight was a voluntary return, I did not want to go.\u201d She said none of the passengers were tested for Covid-19 before boarding the plane. On Thursday Colin Dobell, the managing director and founder of Mitie Care &amp; Custody, the largest provider of immigration detention services to the Home Office, told the home affairs select committee that he had recently contacted the Home Office to ask for routine Covid-19 testing for immigration detainees. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere was no formal request for routine testing, and as people would expect testing has been prioritised for the sick and frontline workers. Immigration removal centres follow all Public Health England advice and if a detainee presents as symptomatic they have access to tests and appropriate medical care.\u201d People in immigration detention have access to solicitors, although mostly by phone rather than face-to-face visits during the lockdown. The woman deported to Poland said she had not been able to contact her solicitor, so felt she had no choice but to board the flight. James Wilson, the deputy director of Detention Action, which supports people held in immigration detention, said: \u201cAt a time when the official government advice is that we don\u2019t fly, it is staggering that the Home Office thought it appropriate to charter a private plane removing people to Poland. \u201cWith no tests carried out and insufficient social distancing in place, all those on that plane, including escorts, have been put in harm\u2019s way. We call for a stop on all removals from the UK during the pandemic, and believe no one should be in immigration detention at the moment.\u201d The Home Office said: \u201cWe are committed to removing foreign-national offenders wherever possible and followed Public Health England guidance, including social distancing measures, on the flight. Those on the flight also had access to the legal representation they needed.\u201d The spokesperson said the \u201csafe systems of work\u201d process was in place to ensure physical distancing on the flight, and passengers were seen by a healthcare professional before their departure.",

The company laid off 80 employees, or 13% of its staff, in April due to the pandemic\u2019s impact on the business. \u201cAlmost overnight, our company went from being on the eve of accomplishing an unprecedented milestone, the first next-generation micromobility company to reach profitability, to one where we had to pause operations in 99% of our markets worldwide to support cities\u2019 efforts at social distancing,\u201d wrote Lime\u2019s chief executive, Brad Bao. Bao will become chairman of Lime. Lime\u2019s new chief executive, Wayne Ting, predicted that bike and scooter rentals would become integral to city transportation as the world recovers from the pandemic. \u201cMicromobility will be vital to the new world affected by Covid-19 and we are already seeing this as cities begin to move again. With our new financing and expanded offerings, we are strongly positioned to meet the needs of riders in a safe and reliable way,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Time to recap Britain is facing its worst recession in 300 years, according to the latest scenario from the Bank of England. The BoE estimates that GDP will plunge by 25% this quarter, with unemployment hitting 9%, due to the abrupt halt to activity under the Covid-19 lockdowns. The BoE\u2019s scenario shows the economy shrinking by 14% during 2020 as a whole, followed by a recovery of 15% in 2021. BoE governor Andrew Bailey said the slump was unprecedented, but he hopes GDP will bounce back once the pandemic is over. Economists cautioned that the economy may not recover as strongly as the Bank hopes, due to the damage caused by the virus. The Office for National Statistics has reported that two-thirds of firms have tapped the UK Job Retention scheme and furloughed some workers. It also estimates that roughly a quarter of companies are currently closed, particularly in the hospitality sector. In America, another 3.1 million people have lost their jobs last week, lifting the total to around 33 million. But stock markets have jumped in Europe and in New York, on hopes that lockdown measures will soon be eased successfully. Hugh Grieves, US equities investment manager at Premier Miton, explains: US Initial Jobless Claims fell to 3.2m, down from the previous week\u2019s figure of 3.8m and half the peak recorded 5 weeks ago, but roughly in line with economists\u2019 forecasts. These figures support estimates of the April unemployment figure, to be released tomorrow, to reach a shocking 16%. \u201cMarkets, however, are now looking beyond the employment data and forward to the potential recovery. With some US states now beginning to reopen for business, investors will be watching closely to see how quickly employees return to work and how rapidly economic activity bounces back. Goodnight. GW A late rally has lifted the UK stock market to its highest level in a week. The FTSE 100 has just closed 82 points higher at 5935, a gain of 1.4%. That\u2019s its highest level since April 30th, last Thursday. Mining group Anglo American led the risers, up 7%, followed by UK retailer JD Sports. But BT had a grim day - falling 8% to just 106p, which I think is its lowest closing level since 2009. Investors aren\u2019t happy that the telco has suspended its dividend to fund next-generation broadband networks. The International Monetary Fund says it has approved requests for emergency pandemic aid totalling $18bn, from 50 of its 189 members, and is working through another 50 requests. Reuters has more details; The IMF\u2019s executive board was working through requests at record speed and would consider a request from Egypt for both emergency financing and a stand-by lending arrangement on May 11, spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters in an online briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s an IMF moving at an unprecedented speed in an unprecedented way to meet this unprecedented challenge which we\u2019re all facing,\u201d he said, noting the Fund had also temporarily suspended payments on IMF debts for 25 of the poorest countries. The gloom in the luxury goods sector is deepening even though some countries have started to relax their coronavirus lockdowns. Global sales of luxury handbags, clothes, watches and cosmetics are set to slump by 50% to 60% between April and June, compared with an estimated 25% decline in the first three months of the year, the consultancy Bain says in its spring report. For 2020 as a whole, Bain is predicting that luxury sales will fall by 20% to 35%, and it will take two to three years to return to last year\u2019s sales of $303bn. Shops in China have started to reopen and Chinese consumers are expected to account for nearly half the market by 2025. Bain partner and report co-author Federico Levato says: \u201cAs consumers slowly emerge from lockdowns, the way they see the world will have changed and luxury brands will need to adapt. Safety in store will be mandatory, paired with the magic of the luxury experience: creative ways to attract customers to store, or to get the product to the customer, will make the difference.\u201d Luxury accessories such as handbags have fared a bit better while watch sales declined the most, because of a lack of online sales platforms. Ronald Temple, Head of US equity at Lazard Asset Management, doesn\u2019t share the exuberance in the markets today. \u201cThe US labor market is in the worst position since the Great Depression and is unlikely to improve sustainably anytime soon. Until widespread testing, an effective therapy, and a vaccine are in place, any improvement in employment is likely to be temporary. Premature efforts to reopen economies undermine our progress in controlling the pandemic and risk extending the duration of the downturn.\u201d The Nasdaq has shrugged off Covid-19 fears because investors are rushing into \u201cgiant tech names that are considered more resilient in this crisis\u201d, explained Marios Hadjikyriacos of XM. That includes Amazon (up 27% this year) and Microsoft (up 16%). And here\u2019s the result: Remarkably, the US Nasdaq index has now caught up all this year\u2019s losses. The tech-focused share index is now flat for 2020, thanks to strong recoveries in major technology companies such as Apple, Amazon and Microsoft. As expected, the US stock market has indeed jumped in early trading. Dow: up 263 points or 1.1% at 23,928 S&amp;P 500: up 38 points or 1.3% at 2886 Nasdaq: up 118 points or 1.3% at 8,973 Investors may be taking some comfort that at least the pace of US jobless claims is slowing (but still terribly high). European stock markets are holding onto their earlier gains, despite the latest grim US jobs data. Wall Street is expected to open higher too, with the Dow up around 1% in pre-market trading. The spectre of unemployment is haunting America - but in some states more than others: Before the Covid-19 crisis began, America had never lost a million jobs in a single week before. It has now suffered seven consecutive weeks of massive job losses, as firms have slashed staff under the coronavirus lockdown. Our US business editor Dominic Rushe says some US states are really struggling to cope with the unprecedented surge in unemployment. He writes: The pace of layoffs has overwhelmed state unemployment systems across the country. Over a million people in North Carolina have now made unemployment insurance benefit claims, equivalent to 20% of the state\u2019s workforce. Some 4 million have applied in California and the state\u2019s jobless benefits fund is \u201cvery close\u201d to running out, governor Gavin Newsom said this week. Here\u2019s Dom\u2019s story on the initial claims figures: Some instant reaction to the latest US jobless report: Newsflash: Another 3.1 million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, as the US jobless crisis rages. That\u2019s down from 3.8m in the previous week, but still another awful number. It lifts the total number of new \u2018initial claims\u2019 for welfare since the crisis began to around 33 million people. The US Labor Department also reports that 22.6 million people filed \u2018continued claims\u2019 (meaning they\u2019ve been receiving help for more than one week). Stocks are continuing to rise in London, seemingly lifted by hopes that some UK lockdown restrictions will be eased soon. The FTSE 100 is now up 63 points or 1.1% at 5917, after the government confirmed that Boris Johnson will reveal his strategy on Sunday evening: Connor Campbell of SpreadEx says: With oil, mining and banking stocks all in the green, the FTSE added another 0.9% as the session went on, sticking its nose across 5900 for the first time in a week. This would suggest that investors have swallowed the bitter 14% contraction in 2020 pill offered up by the BoE, thanks to the spoonful of sugar that is the expectation of a 15% rebound in 2021. Elsewhere the markets were just as perky, investors continuing to express their relief at the various ongoing and soon-to-be unveiled lockdown-easing measures around the globe. The DAX passed 10700 as it climbed 0.8%, while the CAC struck 4470 following a 50 point increase. Our economic editor Larry Elliott says the BoE is pinning its hopes on a V-shaped recovery to GDP - and pushing banks to do their bit. One of the key messages from the Bank to the high street lenders was that they stand to lose more by not lending than they will by lending freely, because there will be more long-term scarring of the economy, more companies going bust and more losses for them to swallow. At his press conference, the Bank\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, said he was ramming home this point to lenders at at every opportunity. But is this forecast too optimistic? Quite possibly, Larry adds: Forecasting is tough at the best of times: in the current circumstances \u2013 where there is uncertainty about how fast restrictions will be lifted, how consumers will behave, and whether there will be a second wave of infection \u2013 it is all but impossible. All that can really be said is that the risks to the Bank\u2019s scenario are skewed heavily to the downside. Threadneedle Street decided against providing more stimulus at this week\u2019s meeting, but it is only a question of time. In the event that the pandemic does return, Bailey said the Bank would find new tools from somewhere. That might sound a bit like Mr Micawber saying \u201csomething will turn up\u201d but broadly sums up current thinking: this is bad, but somehow or other we will get through it. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has told Sky News that the slump in the UK economy this year is \u201cunique, certainly in modern times\u201d. But he\u2019s also optimistic that activity is likely to recover \u201cmuch more quickly\u201d than after a normal recession: It\u2019s been a busy morning for telecoms news too. Cable operator Virgin Media and mobile network O2 are merging, to create a \u00a331bn \u201cnational champion\u201d to challenge BT and Sky in the UK. BT has also been busy - taking a \u00a395m charge due to Covid-19 losses, and suspending its dividend to fund super-high speed broadband networks and 5G mobile. Here\u2019s Anna Stewart of CNN on the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts: London\u2019s Evening Standard points out that the Covid-19 slump will be three times as severe as after the financial crisis of 2008. Hopefully, though, the rebound will be much faster. Especially if we avoid any growth-weakening austerity, something the Standard\u2019s editor knows a lot about... Covid-19 lockdowns has already pushed British Airway\u2019s parent company into the red. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: British Airways owner International Airlines Group made a \u00a31.5bn loss in the first three months of the year, as chief executive Willie Walsh said it would take three years for passenger demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels. IAG has halted 94% of its flights in response to travel restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, causing it to bleed cash. Last week, British Airways set out plans to make up to 12,000 of its staff redundant because of the global collapse in air travel. Walsh will stay on as chief executive of IAG until 24 September, the airlines group announced, having previously agreed to delay his retirement to help steer it through the Covid-19 crisis. He had been due to retire in March. Losses after tax at IAG surged to \u20ac1.68bn (\u00a31.47bn) during the first quarter, compared with a profit of \u20ac70m in 2019, it told the stock market on Thursday. That loss included a \u20ac1.3bn charge as fuel and currency hedges became worthless. Despite the Bank of England\u2019s gloomy prognosis for this year, stocks and the pound are a little higher this morning. That\u2019s partly because the BoE expects the economy to grow by 15% in 2021, after a 14% contraction this year [although arithmetically that still leaves the economy smaller] China has also cheered the markets, by reporting exports rose 3.5% in April on a year earlier. Economists had expected a fall of around 15%. So, sterling is up 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.2366, while the FTSE 100 index is 48 points higher at 5902. The Bank of England\u2019s new governor, Andrew Bailey, has hinted that the BoE could expand its stimulus programme at its next meeting in June. Bloomberg\u2019s Jill Ward has the details: Two of the BOE\u2019s nine policy makers wanted to immediately increase bond purchases -- the main policy tool now that the key interest rate is near zero -- by 100 billion pounds ($124 billion) in a decision announced early Thursday. The rest agreed downside risks \u201cmight necessitate further monetary policy action.\u201d Bailey, who earlier pledged \u201ctotal and unwavering commitment\u201d to safeguard the economy during the coronavirus crisis, told reporters that the fact no action was taken this time doesn\u2019t rule out a response soon. \u201cIt\u2019s about what is the appropriate response and what information, news, we think we\u2019re going to get in the quite near future,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be slightly overstating it to say that there\u2019s a bunch of us will never do any more and a couple of people who will.\u201d Trade unions are urging the UK government not to make the economic downturn worse by turning off its furlough scheme too quickly. The TUC says that today\u2019s statistics showing that two-thirds of firms have tapped the Jobs Retention scheme shows it is vital. UK banks have approved an additional 8,550 government-backed business loans worth \u00a31.4bn within the past week, but are still struggling to increase the pace of approvals amid rising demand. The original coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) has now lent around \u00a35.5bn to 33,812 small and medium sized businesses since the programme was launched on 23 March. However, that is around 53% of the 62,674 formal applications that have been lodged with lenders so far. That is slightly higher than the 48% of applications that they approved a week earlier. The figures, released by bank lobby group UK Finance, still do not provide any insight on the proportion of applications that have been rejected, versus those that are still just being processed. Stephen Jones, chief executive UK Finance, stressed that bank staff are working around the clock to get money out to customers as fast as possible: \u201cBank staff have worked tirelessly over the past week to provide businesses with the finance they need, delivering another \u00a31.4 billion of lending under the CBIL scheme, on top of over \u00a32 billion in Bounce Back Loans targeted at smaller firms and sole traders.\u201d Hat-tip to Ben Chu of the Independent, for showing just how grim the Bank of England\u2019s forecasts are: The Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride has ordered Barclays to explain why customers are still having trouble accessing bounce back loans - which are meant to protect UK businesses from this year\u2019s slump. The 100% government-guaranteed bounce back loan scheme is meant to get cash to struggling businesses far more quickly than other programmes. Any impediments put those firms at risk, Stride said: \u201cIssues that hamper this are very frustrating to customers and may in some cases threaten business survival. \u201cI raised the problems that some people were having in accessing the Barclays online system with their CEO during our public committee hearing on Monday and was assured then that the system was able to cope well. \u201cAs Barclays customers still seem to be facing issues and new ones may have arisen, I have asked Barclays to explain what is happening, and what it is doing to fix any issues that have arisen.\u201d A number of business owners have complained that they have not been able to submit forms on the Barclays site. The bank insists the vast majority have been able to apply but some needed to provide extra information or additional signatures first. Stride has asked Barclays to clarify over how many applications this applies to and whether this relates to anti-money laundering or so-called know your customer requirements. He has also asked for how much extra time this is taking. Barclays is one of the only banks that has embedded the application in its secure bank site ( so it appears after a customer logs into their account). Just in: nearly a quarter of UK firms have temporarily closed due to the pandemic, and two-thirds are furloughing some staff. That\u2019s according to the Office for National Statistics. It just reported that 23% of businesses who responded to its latest survey said they had \u201ctemporarily closed or paused trading\u201d last month. It adds: Of businesses that responded to our fortnightly survey for the period 6 April to 19 April 2020, the main sectors reporting they had temporarily ceased trading were accommodation and food service activities (81%) and arts, entertainment and recreation (80%). 67% of responding businesses had applied for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS), with 28% of the workforce in these businesses being furloughed. One word of caution --only 35% of the 17,623 businesses contacted by the ONS responded, but the picture is still pretty clear: The Bank of England has also shown how its scenario compare to City economists\u2019 forecasts -- where the range is rather, er, broad: The key message from the Bank of England today is that activity in the UK has fallen sharply, and is going to continue to plunge during this quarter. Explaining why it thinks the UK will shrink 14% this year, it says: Official data are sparse at this stage, but high\u2011frequency indicators suggest that consumer spending has fallen steeply since March. In large part, that reflects the impact of both enforced and voluntary social distancing, with some additional drag from lower incomes and confidence about the outlook. In those areas most affected, such as tourism and eating out, indicators including aircraft departures and data on the number of seated diners at restaurants suggest that spending has all but come to a halt. The closure of businesses and widespread moves to working from home have reduced the number of journeys by car and public transport substantially. In addition, spending on many durables is likely to have been delayed. One area that has proved stronger is spending on food, as households substitute spending at supermarkets for eating out. Nevertheless, consumer spending in aggregate has fallen very significantly. In 2020 Q2, it is expected to be almost 30% lower than in 2019 Q4. These three charts from today\u2019s Monetary Policy Report shows how the UK economy has already weakened: There are also signs that UK house prices are starting to slide, amid the lockdown. Halifax has reported that prices fell by 0.6% in April, on top of a 0.3% dip in March: The Covid-19 crisis has prompted Norway\u2019s central bank to slash its interest rates to zero. In a surprise move, the Norges Banks just lowered its key borrowing rate from 0.25% to 0.0%, a record low. It also slashed its economic forecasts, although not as sharply as the Bank of England. Reuters has the details: Norges Bank now predicts the mainland economy, which excludes oil and gas output, will contract by 5.2% in 2020, down from a March 13 forecast of 0.4% growth. It expects growth of 3.0% in 2021, up from 1.3% seen earlier. My colleague Richard Partington writes that the Bank of England has sounded the alarm about the slump in the UK economy this year: The Bank of England has warned the British economy could shrink by 25% this spring and unemployment more than double as the coronavirus pandemic brings the country to an effective standstill. Leaving interest rates on hold as the economic crisis unfolds, the central bank said economic activity across the country had fallen sharply since the onset of the global health emergency and the lockdown measures used to contain its spread. Sounding the alarm over the mounting damage to the economy during the coronavirus outbreak, the Bank said GDP could shrink by 14% for 2020 as a whole. Threadneedle Street\u2019s nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.1%, the lowest level in the bank\u2019s 325-year history, after using two emergency cuts in March at the onset of the Covid emergency in Britain. However, in a reflection of the scale of the economic shock, the rate-setting panel was split over increasing the Bank\u2019s \u00a3645bn quantitative easing stimulus package, with two members voting for an immediate \u00a3100bn increase. Here\u2019s his full story: The Resolution Foundation think tank is concerned that the Bank of England predicts such a sharp jump in unemployment, and only a slow recovery in the labour market: That 14 per cent hit to the economy is equivalent to around \u00a3300 billion, or \u00a39,000 for every family in Britain, and shows why the Bank and Government are right to have protected households as much as possible with policies such as the Job Retention Scheme. While the Bank\u2019s scenario implies the UK economy will return towards its pre-pandemic growth path in 2021, it projects unemployment to remain above its pre-pandemic path until at least 2023 \u2013 after reaching a 25-year high of 9 per cent this year. The Foundation says this shows that even if the economy recovers rapidly, Britain will be living with high unemployment for some time, and that policy makers will need to take a more active approach towards supporting people back in to work. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, fears the UK economy could shrink even more sharply than the Bank of England has forecast. The Brexit cliff-edge at the end of the year, when the UK-EU withdrawal agreement ends, creates added uncertainty, she writes: \u201cDespite the stark numbers issued by the Bank of England today, additional pressure on the economy is likely. Some social distancing measures are likely to remain in place until we have a vaccine or an effective treatment for the virus, with people also remaining reluctant to socialise and spend. That means recovery is unlikely to start in earnest before sometime next year. \u201cLooking at the medium term, beyond the impact of reduced investment, other forces could to be in play dampening future productivity. Supply chains are likely to be reconfigured in light of this crisis, potentially increasing geographical diversification and reducing efficiency in order to increase resilience. \u2018Just in time\u2019 operations are also likely to be a thing of the past, further eroding productivity. On the other hand, we could see significant consolidation among SMEs, lifting productivity among the long tail of underperforming businesses. \u201cBrexit is another significant downside risk for this year\u2019s outlook, with the probability of a smooth transition to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU in January relatively small, adding further uncertainty to businesses and the prospect of increased trade frictions next year.\u201d Adrian Lowcock, head of personal finance at investment platform, Willis Owen, says the Bank of England\u2019s forecast of a 14% slump in GDP this year is \u2018the stuff of nightmares\u2019 The only good news today is that the Bank expects this economic bombshell to be short-lived, and for the economy to bounce back rapidly. However, the MPC itself concedes it is flying blind to a large extent, warning that a pandemic like this is \u201cespecially difficult to quantify\u201d. Oliver Blackbourn, multi-asset portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, predicts the BoE will boost its stimulus package soon (reminder: two MPC members wanted to increase its QE programme) \u201cWhile the Bank of England did not change its monetary policy stance at today\u2019s meeting, it is surely only a matter of time before they decide to. The 7-2 split on whether to increase asset purchases indicates a continued dovish bias from certain voting members. With the Bank hoovering up gilts equivalent to those issued since the additional \u00a3200 billion in quantitative easing was announced, it will run out of firepower to support government spending within in months. Therefore, expectations will be high for an increase in the purchase target at the next meeting in mid-June. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the Bank of England to delay its much-anticipated bank climate stress tests. The central bank has concluded that UK banks have enough to deal with, without calculating how they are positioned to handle the climate emergency (a key concern for former governor Mark Carney). \u201cRecognizing current pressures on firms, and in light of the responses to the December 2019 Discussion Paper on the Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario, the PRC and FPC have agreed to postpone the launch of the exercise until at least mid-2021. This delay reflects a desire to maintain the ambitious scope of the exercise, whilst giving firms enough time to invest sufficiently in their capabilities to allow them to deliver to a high standard.\u201d It has also decided to pause insurance stress tests. The Bank of England will not publish the results of last year\u2019s exercise and is postponing the next insurance stress test to 2022. The Bank\u2019s new Financial Stability Report says UK households have entered the lockdown in a stronger position than before the 2008 financial crisis, thanks in part to substantial support including payment holidays on mortgages and credit cards. However, the Bank warned that the sharp economic downturn would put pressure on personal finances and that it would have to keep a close eye on potential risks that may emerge once those payment holidays expire. That could include a fresh wave of customers attempting to refinance their debt. There is some good news.... the Bank of England is confident that Britain\u2019s banks can ride out the Covid-19 pandemic, and handle a 14% plunge in GDP this year. It says the banking sector is sufficiently capitalised to cover losses during the outbreak, especially as the BoE is providing more support to the sector. The BoE explains: Businesses and households will need to borrow to get through this period. We want banks and building societies to expand lending. We have tested the major UK banks. They are strong enough to keep lending, which will support the economy and limit losses to themselves. We are offering more long-term funding to banks that increase their lending. In particular, we will give extra funding to banks that offer more lending to small and medium-sized companies. These firms often need more support in times like these. But while UK banks are equipped to keep lending throughout the downturn, the crisis is likely to wipe out half of their key capital buffers and result in impairment charges worth around \u00a380bn. However, the BoE said that was less than the \u00a3100bn estimated as part of its last set of annual stress tests. Here\u2019s a table outlining the Bank of England\u2019s new Covid-19 scenario. As you can see, it shows UK GDP shrinking 14% this year, business investment crumbling by 26%, household spending down 14%, and average earnings down 2%: The Bank of England has produced a 20-minute video, explaining today\u2019s monetary policy decisions and its new scenario for how the UK economy will shrink this year: You can also ready more about the Covid-19 scenario in the Bank\u2019s new Monetary Policy Report, online here. The Financial Stability Report can be seen here. Reuters points out that the Bank of England is predicting the worst economic slump in centuries this year -- and a very strong recovery in 2021: The Bank of England held off further stimulus measures but said it was ready to take fresh action to counter the coronavirus hammering which could cause the country\u2019s biggest economic slump in over 300 years in 2020 before a bounceback in 2021. The BoE said its Monetary Policy Committee kept Bank Rate at its all-time low of 0.1% and left its target for bond-buying, most of it British government debt, at \u00a3645bn. However, two of its nine policymakers - Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel - voted for \u00a3100bn-worth of more bond-buying firepower. In what it called an illustrative scenario, the BoE said it saw a plunge of 14% in Britain\u2019s economy in 2020 followed by 15% bounce-back in 2021. Such a scenario would require very significant monetary and fiscal stimulus, it said. Many economists expect the BoE to increase its asset purchase programme next month, before the extra 200 billion pounds it gave itself in March is exhausted by the furious pace of its buying of British government debt. \u201cHowever the economic outlook evolves, the Bank will act as necessary to deliver the monetary and financial stability that are essential for long-term prosperity and meet the needs of the people of this country,\u201d Governor Andrew Bailey said. \u201cThis is our total and unwavering commitment.\u201d In another startling forecast, the Bank of England predicts that the global economy could contract by 20% this quarter. It warns that the coronavirus pandemic, and the lockdown measures introduced to slow it, are hitting economic activity extremely hard: The spread of the virus and the measures taken to protect public health have caused a substantial reduction in activity around the world. Survey indicators such as the output components of PMIs have fallen to record\u2011low levels since the start of the year, and suggest that many countries have experienced extremely sharp falls in activity. Bank staff estimate that UK\u2011weighted world GDP declined by around 4% in Q1 and could fall by over 20% in Q2. World trade has also declined significantly, and is expected to contract by around twice as much as global GDP in 2020. While many major countries have introduced wage subsidy schemes to reduce job losses, unemployment has increased markedly around the world and many more employees are working less than usual. Here are those PMI surveys (based on interviews with purchasing managers around the world): Despite the government\u2019s efforts, the Bank of England predicts that unemployment will rise sharply in the next few months. Its new Covid-19 scenario suggests the UK jobless rate could soon spike to 9% - up from 4% at present - even though the government is encouraging firms to furlough staff. The BoE\u2019s explains: As activity has fallen, the number of people in work has dropped sharply. It is likely that the Government\u2019s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) has materially reduced the number of redundancies. Early data suggest that applications for furlough have been received from 800,000 companies covering over six million jobs. The number of people furloughed might be a little lower, though, as some could have more than one furloughed job. While the CJRS has significantly limited job losses, the flow of new Universal Credit benefit claims and early indicators of redundancies suggest that unemployment has risen sharply over the past couple of months. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 9% in Q2. The Bank of England has forecast that the UK economy could shrink by 14% this year. It has drawn up a new scenario, showing how the Covid-19 pandemic will hurt growth. The spread of Covid-19 and the measures to contain it are having a significant impact on the United Kingdom and many countries around the world. Activity has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and unemployment has risen markedly. It predicts that GDP will contract by 25% in the current quarter -- a really serious slump -- before recovering later in the year. The BoE explains: The illustrative scenario incorporates a very sharp fall in UK GDP in 2020 H1 and a substantial increase in unemployment in addition to those workers who are furloughed currently. Given the assumed path for the relaxation of social distancing measures, the fall in GDP should be temporary and activity should pick up relatively rapidly. Nonetheless, because a degree of precautionary behaviour by households and businesses is assumed to persist, the economy takes some time to recover towards its previous path. CPI inflation is expected to fall further below the 2% target during the second half of this year, largely reflecting the weakness of demand. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Some early breaking news: The Bank of England has voted to leave UK interest rates at their record lows, at its policy meeting today. The BoE\u2019s monetary policy committee voted 9-0 to hold borrowing cost at just 0.1%, where they were slashed back in March as the Covid-19 pandemic struck. It is also maintaining its plan of buying another \u00a3200bn of government bonds to sooth the economy, although two committee members wanted to boost this quantitative easing stimulus package by another \u00a3100bn, The BoE has also warned that the UK economy has taken a serious jolt since the pandemic struck, with sales falling sharply and employment rising. The minutes of the meeting says: The timeliest indicators of UK demand have generally stabilised at very low levels in recent weeks, after unprecedented falls during late March and early April. Payments data point to a reduction in the level of household consumption of around 30%. Consumer confidence has declined markedly and housing market activity has practically ceased. According to the Bank\u2019s Decision Maker Panel, companies\u2019 sales are expected to be around 45% lower than normal in 2020 Q2 and business investment 50% lower. There has been widespread take-up of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Nevertheless, sharp increases in benefit claims are consistent with a pronounced rise in the unemployment rate. More to follow.... (it\u2019s an unusually early start - we normally get these minutes at noon, but the BoE have brought them forward due to the lockdown). Also coming up today Halifax bank will publish their latest UK house price index, although the plunge in transactions since the lock-down might undermine the data. New US unemployment figures are expected to show that another three million Americans filed new claims for unemployment benefit last week, on top of the 30 million already filed. The agenda 7am BST: Bank of England\u2019s interest rate decision and Monetary Policy report released 8.30am BST: Halifax UK house price index for April 1.30pm BST: US initial jobless claims for last week",

Pupils have been attending in tiny numbers, with the bulk of learning taking place at home and online.</p> \n<p>With parent surveys suggesting widespread nervousness about sending children back, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) warned that parents should not be compelled to do so and schools should not be asked to fine parents for their child\u2019s non-attendance.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT general secretary. \u201cI would not like to see a situation where schools are instructed to issue fines for families who do not feel able to send their children to school even if the government gives them the all clear.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.parentkind.org.uk/News/Major-new-Parentkind-research---over-a-quarter-of-a-million-parents-have-a-say-on-school-closures-and-coronavirus-fears\">A </a><a href=\"https://www.parentkind.org.uk/News/Major-new-Parentkind-research---over-a-quarter-of-a-million-parents-have-a-say-on-school-closures-and-coronavirus-fears\">survey</a> of over 250,000 parents has found that 90% of those who took part did not want to see their children return to school immediately after the government ends lockdown. One in 10 who responded to the Parentkind online survey said they would be happy to wait until staff and pupils have been vaccinated, even if this takes up to 18 months.</p> \n<p>When asked when they would be happy for their child to return to school, a quarter of parents said they would be happy with a September return date, but that they would like this to be confirmed now; 23% and 18% respectively said they would be happy only when government or school leaders say it is safe to do so, and only 10% said they would be happy with a return to school as soon as lockdown ends.</p> \n<p>Whiteman said: \u201cIf we open schools and no one arrives, it seems a bit of a pointless exercise.

You have my guarantee that we will give everyone time to plan ahead of a next phase starting.\u201d In a letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, seen by the Guardian, Roach warned that any change to the current restrictions on the opening of schools would be \u201chighly premature and extremely damaging\u201d, given the public health emergency. \u201cWith the highest Covid-19 mortality rates in Europe, it is clear that the government must continue to adopt an extremely cautious approach which does not contribute to further deaths and a further intensive wave of spread of the virus in the UK,\u201d he said. \u201cIn view of the continued and pressing public health challenges and the considerable task that will be required to ensure that every school is ready to admit increased numbers of children and adults into safe learning and working environments, the NASUWT urges the government to end speculation on the reopening of schools beyond the current restrictions prior to September 2020.\u201d Schools in England have been closed since 20 March to all but the children of critical workers and those classed as vulnerable. Pupils have been attending in tiny numbers, with the bulk of learning taking place at home and online. With parent surveys suggesting widespread nervousness about sending children back, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) warned that parents should not be compelled to do so and schools should not be asked to fine parents for their child\u2019s non-attendance. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT general secretary. \u201cI would not like to see a situation where schools are instructed to issue fines for families who do not feel able to send their children to school even if the government gives them the all clear.\u201d A survey of over 250,000 parents has found that 90% of those who took part did not want to see their children return to school immediately after the government ends lockdown. One in 10 who responded to the Parentkind online survey said they would be happy to wait until staff and pupils have been vaccinated, even if this takes up to 18 months. When asked when they would be happy for their child to return to school, a quarter of parents said they would be happy with a September return date, but that they would like this to be confirmed now; 23% and 18% respectively said they would be happy only when government or school leaders say it is safe to do so, and only 10% said they would be happy with a return to school as soon as lockdown ends. Whiteman said: \u201cIf we open schools and no one arrives, it seems a bit of a pointless exercise. Children are precious to parents. They won\u2019t want to be taking any risks with their health and future. Their level of confidence in [coming back to school] is a very serious matter.\u201d Meanwhile, a petition by the National Education Union demanding schools reopen only when it is safe to do so has now attracted 350,000 signatures from parents, teachers, heads, support staff, doctors and health workers. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cGavin Williamson has been clear that schools will not reopen until the scientific advice indicates that it is safe to do so and the five tests set out by government to beat this virus have been met. \u201cParents of pupils not currently in school due to closures will not be fined, and there are no immediate plans for this to change when schools begin to reopen.\u201d",

Death toll rises by 539 in UK The UK coronavirus death toll has reached 30,615 after a further 539 people died, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, revealed at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. In the 24 hours up to 9am on 7 May there were 86,583 tests for coronavirus in the UK \u2013 the fifth day running that testing was below the government\u2019s 100,000 target. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said testing numbers had dropped due to a \u201ctechnical hitch over the weekend\u201d but were now rising again. UK minister warns against abandoning social distancing rules Raab said that if people \u201cabandon the social distancing rules\u201d the virus \u201cwill grow again at an exponential rate\u201d. He said the prime minister, Boris Johnson, would set out the roadmap for the next phase of lockdown on Sunday, along with the conditions for each milestone in the easing of restrictions. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that any changes [to the lockdown] in the short term will be modest, small, incremental.\u201d Trump tests negative for coronavirus after report valet was infected Donald Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, have tested negative for coronavirus after finding out that a member of the US military who worked on the White House campus had become infected, a White House spokesman said. The military official was identified by CNN as personal valet to the US president. US unemployment claims hit 33.3 million A further 3.2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from coronavirus continued to mount. The new applications brought the total number of jobless claims since mid-March to 33.3 million, which is 20% of the US workforce. However, the number of new claims reported each week by the Department of Labor has subsided since hitting a peak of 6.9 million in March. Russia overtakes Germany and France after record rise in cases Russia overtook France and Germany for coronavirus cases on Thursday, giving it the fifth highest total in the world at 177,160. More than half of all cases and deaths have been in Moscow, which on Thursday reported a record overnight tally of 6,703 new cases, bringing its official total to 92,676. Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said research showed the real number of cases in the Russian capital was about 300,000, or more than triple the official figure. Donald Trump, offered to send medical aid to Moscow during a phone call with Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said. France to keep borders closed until at least mid-June France\u2019s borders will remain closed until further notice following the lifting of the coronavirus lockdown on Monday, said the interior minister, Christophe Castaner. He said the restrictions would remain in place until at least 15 June. The country\u2019s health minister, Olivier Veran, said France would be able carry out 700,000 tests a week for the virus from Monday. Australia hits back at US claim linking coronavirus to Wuhan lab The Australian government has pushed back at US claims the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan lab and has determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document. It is understood Scott Morrison\u2019s government sees the promotion of the theory that the virus leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan as counterproductive to Australia\u2019s push to gain broad international support for an independent inquiry into the origins and overall handling of the pandemic. The US embassy in Canberra declined to comment on a report in the Nine newspaper on Thursday of suspicions within senior ranks of the government and the intelligence community about a staffer\u2019s possible role. Guardian Australia understands Anthony Byrne, a Labor MP, has been in regular contact with the intelligence community and senior members of the government to support them in pushing back against US government claims. Virus exposes shortages across Africa\u2019s healthcare systems African nations are facing a surge of Covid-19 cases with fewer than one intensive care bed and one ventilator per 100,000 people, a Reuters survey found. Even in a best-case scenario, the continent could need at least 10 times the numbers it has now as the outbreak peaks, an analysis of researchers\u2019 projections showed. The shortages across Africa\u2019s national health systems are among the starkest elements to emerge from the survey, which polled 54 countries and received responses from health officials or independent experts in 48 of them. The World Health Organization has warned that Africa, home to 1.3 billion people, could become the next centre of the pandemic.",

It involved 950 officials from central and local government, NHS organisations, prisons and local emergency response planners. A report on the exercise was compiled the following year and distributed among its participants. The simulation took place over three days in October 2016 and asked participants to imagine they were fighting a fictitious \u201cworst-case-scenario\u201d flu pandemic affecting up to 50% of the population and causing up to 400,000 excess deaths. What did it involve? The scenario imagined that a new virus had emerged in Thailand in June, later identified as a strain of H2N2. Within a month the World Health Organization had declared a public emergency, triggering the UK\u2019s response plans as the world mobilised to tackle an outbreak of \u201cswan flu\u201d. For the three days of the exercise, officials were told to imagine they were managing the seventh week of the pandemic, facing a peak in demand for hospital and social care. The purpose of such simulations is generally not only to test how emergency plans would hold up under strain but also to acclimatise ministers and officials to the sorts of decisions they would be forced to make. Mock Cobra meetings were held where ministers and officials were presented with situation reports from the ground, while reporters from a fictitious news organisation called WNN published news articles, and government social media campaigns were released on \u201cTwister\u201d. What were its findings? The Cygnus report was frank about the state of the UK\u2019s readiness. \u201cThe UK\u2019s preparedness and response, in terms of its plans, policies and capability, is currently not sufficient to cope with the extreme demands of a severe pandemic that will have a nationwide impact across all sectors,\u201d it found. One problem was that while each government body participating in the exercise had its own bespoke plans, enabling a flexible and decentralised response, nobody in the centre had oversight over everyone else. In the absence of any \u201coverview of pandemic response plans and procedures\u201d, participants found it much harder to shift resources between one another so as react to unexpected rises and falls in demand for services such social care beds. In the language of the report: \u201cThe lack of joint tactical level plans was evidenced when the scenario demand for services outstripped the capacity of local responders, in the areas of excess deaths, social care and the NHS.\u201d Some organisations\u2019 plans were severely out of date and sometimes referred to coordinating their response with bodies that no longer existed. Others were relying on an institutional memory of fighting the 2009 swine flu pandemic that was slowly fading. What about social care? Social care appears to have been of particular concern. Participants discovered it was extremely difficult to locate capacity in the care homes sector, partly because care homes are almost entirely privately run, making it difficult to clear hospital beds by moving patients into care homes. \u201cLocal responders also raised concerns about the expectation that the social care system would be able to provide the level of support needed if the NHS implemented its proposed reverse triage plans, which would entail the movement of patients from hospitals into social care facilities,\u201d the report said. Cygnus found that the social care sector was \u201ccurrently under significant pressure during business as usual,\u201d and that in the event of a pandemic staff absenteeism through illness combined with widespread infection of the vulnerable \u201ccould be very challenging\u201d. What did Cygnus recommend? The report listed four areas of \u201ckey learning\u201d and 22 further \u201clessons identified\u201d from the exercise, couched as recommendations to government. While some, such as those concerning the distribution of antivirals, are not relevant to a coronavirus pandemic, others are. The recommendations included further modelling to understand the capacity of the care sector, further work to understand how the public would react to the crisis, and the creation of a \u201cjoint-level tactical plan\u201d to help different organisations cooperate more effectively. Some of the Cygnus recommendations, such as preparing legislation to relax certain laws and regulations, can be clearly seen in the government\u2019s handling of Covid-19. A Department of Health spokesperson also mentioned excess deaths as an area where additional planning had been carried out. There are questions as to whether other recommendations were followed in full. Care sector executives told the Guardian that they were unaware of having been asked to contribute to any methodology for assessing care home capacity. Why hasn\u2019t the report been published before now? Though discussed at an NHS board meeting and mentioned in a speech by the former chief medical officer, the report on Cygnus has never been published, for reasons that are not entirely clear. The health secretary at the time of the exercise, Jeremy Hunt, has said he would be relaxed about the report being published. In a response to a freedom of information request, the Department of Health claimed that the report needed to be kept secret so as to inform policy development. However, the current health secretary, Matt Hancock, said in an interview with LBC last month that he had been told that all of its recommendations had already been implemented, suggesting its role in informing policy was complete.",

      "bodyText": "The findings of a report into the federal government\u2019s cashless debit card, which was quietly published a day after the controversial scheme was extended, have added weight to claims the card is causing welfare recipients significant stigma and stress. The government-commissioned report of the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay trial site, conducted by University of Adelaide researchers, finds a mixed reaction to the program, which has forced welfare recipients to be paid 80% of their benefits via a card since January last year. Based on qualitative interviews with 74 organisations and 66 potential or current cardholders, the researchers acknowledged it only captured a brief snapshot of the card in Bundaberg and Hervey Bay and was primarily aimed at \u201cunderstanding of the conditions within the region just before the introduction of the CDC\u201d. But it noted that about half of cardholders who were interviewed opposed the trial, while one fifth said they supported it. Cardholders interviewed by the researchers complained about stigma, technical problems, and that income management meant they were not left with enough cash, issues which have long been raised by critics of the policy. \u201c[M]any CDC participants reported that they were reluctant to use their card as they feared being looked down upon or the target of negative comments by retail and hospitality staff, and also their fellow customers,\u201d the report said. \u201cIndeed, some CDC participants said that they did not want to use the card at all and were planning on giving the card to another family member to use on their behalf to avoid this perceived shame.\u201d Others raised concerns about what the researchers described as \u201csystematic delays in the payment of transactions under the CDC were experienced by participants\u201d. About one fifth of participants who were interviewed said they supported the trial, listing potential benefits such as \u201creducing drug and alcohol use, and improving the well-being of families\u201d . \u201cOthers welcomed the card as they felt that it may assist them personally with managing their money better,\u201d the report said. The report was quietly published on the Department of Social Services website on Wednesday, a day after the government announced an extension of all cashless debit card trial sites for a further six months. It also announced plans to introduce tap and go technology and a 1% interest rate for account holders. It says the policy, which quarantines up to 80% of a person\u2019s welfare payment on a card that cannot be spent on alcohol or gambling, will reduce social harms. The government has faced pressure over the evidence base for the card, following a 2018 auditor general\u2019s report that said a previous evaluation of the policy was so flawed it could not be used to determine whether the policy reduced social harms. Labor\u2019s social services spokeswoman, Linda Burney, told the Guardian the new report \u201csheds no further light on \u2013 and the government remains unable to demonstrate \u2013 the efficacy of the cashless debit card\u201d. \u201cWe are worried that the government is going to force this card on more and more people, who are struggling to pay the bills and get back to work at this time,\u201d she said. Noting that the researchers had interviewed more \u201cstakeholders\u201d than participants, the Greens senator Rachel Siewert, a long-time critic of the card, said it was \u201cincredibly frustrating\u201d the study canvassed people\u2019s \u201cperceptions\u201d. \u201cWe need social policy based on outcomes, not perceptions,\u201d she told the Guardian. The researchers noted the report \u201cmainly captures perceptions around what the anticipated impact of the [cashless debit card] would be of stakeholder representatives and also people who had either very recently become CDC participants or were waiting to be placed on the card\u201d. A spokeswoman for the social services minister, Anne Ruston, said the report included data that would help work out how effective the card was. \u201cA number of those interviewed perceived the Cashless Debit Card as a useful tool to help with financial management, that it could enhance individual and family well-being and deliver positive impacts such as addressing alcohol and drug misuse and improved child welfare and wellbeing,\u201d she said. She said the card had been redesigned to remove the Indue logo and \u201clooks and works similar to any other bank card\u201d. \u201cThe decision to extend the existing trials for six months was made in the context of the Coronavirus pandemic,\u201d the spokeswoman said. A separate study by researchers from four universities, who interviewed 114 participants in cashless debit card trial sites, found the \u201cempirical case for continuing with the current policy settings on [compulsory income management] is weak\u201d. The cashless debit card trial began in Ceduna, SA and East Kimberley, WA in 2016, but income management through the similar Basics card was rolled out in remote Indigenous communities during the NT Intervention. It is also operating in the Goldfields, WA. Ruston ordered last month that new welfare recipients would not be placed on the card during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

      "bodyText": "At Rugby Australia the more things change the more they stay the same. In 2012 RA, then known as the Australian Rugby Union, adopted a so-called new independent governance model based on the recommendations of a report by the former Labor politician Mark Arbib. But given the backroom dramas of the current RA board, it seems not much has changed over the last eight years. Instead of a brand-new governance structure to match the likes of the AFL, rugby has really just seen more of the same. The RA board descended into chaos this week as it attempted to attract new leadership to guide the game through the coronavirus crisis and beyond following the recent resignation of the chief executive Raelene Castle. At a meeting on Monday the relatively new RA director Peter Wiggs was expected to be appointed chairman of the board, replacing the interim chairman Paul McLean, who had taken over from Cameron Clyne. Wiggs, a private equity investor and chairman of V8 Supercars, was regarded as the ideal business leader to renegotiate RA\u2019s broadcast deal and organise the resumption of play when coronavirus restrictions are lifted. There appeared to be a push for him to assume a powerful executive chairman role to become rugby union\u2019s answer to the NRL chairman Peter V\u2019landys, but it is understood Wiggs was either not inclined or did not have the time for it. Instead, he only wanted to become chairman and appoint the former RA deputy chief-executive Matt Carroll, currently the Australian Olympic Committee CEO, as RA\u2019s new chief executive. If Carroll was appointed, the two-times RA chief executive John O\u2019Neill may have been prevailed upon to return as a board member, providing further experience and expertise in running the game. The board refused to accept Wiggs\u2019s call and appoint Carroll as full-time CEO, preferring to conduct a three- to six-month search to find a new chief executive, a decision which did not go down well with all the game\u2019s major stakeholders. As a result Wiggs, the man hailed as the saviour of the game, resigned from the board after only 37 days as a director. Maybe the board felt due process had to be followed. Perhaps it was uncomfortable with Wiggs\u2019s call on Carroll. Whatever the reason, RA has denied itself an enormous amount of combined business, administrative and rugby acumen at a time when the code has never been more vulnerable. RA announced on Wednesday night that the former RA chief operating officer Rob Clarke would act as interim CEO. Clarke worked under the former RA chiefs Gary Flowers and Bill Pulver, who both succeeded O\u2019Neill after his two separate terms in the role, and also served as the CEO of the Melbourne Rebels Super Rugby franchise. In the interim, Clarke will shoulder a lot of responsibility as the game struggles to survive as a major sporting code in this country. RA must oversee the resumption of play whether that is a Trans-Tasman Super Rugby competition, a domestic provincial competition or beefed-up Sydney and Brisbane club competitions. Whatever competition is organised, RA will have to sell it to the current broadcaster Fox Sports in the hope of deriving much needed revenue. On top of that RA must renegotiate its broadcast deal for 2021 to 2025. When Castle resigned, relations between RA and Fox Sports were strained over the former CEO\u2019s decision to take the broadcast rights to market. It is also possible that RA will begin talks with the Rugby Union Players\u2019 Association before the end of the year about renegotiating the collective bargaining agreement, and player salaries are bound to be a hot topic. If it takes RA six months to find a new CEO, most of the major challenges facing the game will be resolved by the time of the appointment, which supported the argument for a full-time CEO to be installed immediately. Who would want the job? We know Carroll wanted it, but would he submit himself to a formal application process? It may not be all that easy to find someone else of his proven ability.

      "body": "<p>In some ways, life for Mem Fox under coronavirus is not terribly different from life before the pandemic. It\u2019s largely \u201csame, same\u201d, the children\u2019s author says. \u201cBut there is one difference, and that\u2019s terror.\u201d</p> <p>She was sick last year, in hospital for eight days with paraflu. She was too weak to read. She couldn\u2019t hold a book. Hospital staff would be kitted out in PPE when treating her, and visitors needed to keep their distance. If she took a phone call from a friend, she would need three hours to recover. She just couldn\u2019t breathe.</p> <p>She did recover. But as coronavirus casts a pall over all things, she is aware she is in the highest level of the danger zone. Recently ill, 74 years old and a severe asthmatic. She feels the terror in her body \u2013 something like cold sweats and slight panic attacks. She wonders sometimes whether she will survive the coming winter.</p> <p>But within that terror \u2013 and boredom, as she lay in her hospital bed unable even to queue up podcasts \u2013 she began to write a story in her head.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/job-losses-cancelled-tours-delayed-releases-the-australian-books-industry-grapples-with-huge-shock\">Job losses, cancelled tours, delayed releases: the Australian books industry grapples with 'huge shock'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDay after day I would write it, rethink certain phases then rewrite,\u201d Fox tells Guardian Australia. As she got better, she asked her husband tobuy a pad of yellow paper, a rubber, a sharpener and six 4B pencils. \u201cThe lead is so soft, it\u2019s lovely to write with.\u201d</p> <p>One day, a specialist came into her room to find Fox on a bed covered with yellow pages of drafting, the right sleeve of her nightie dirty from rubber crumbs. She was appalled to see Fox working but the author replied that, actually, she was in a state of zen. The forced stillness had brought her to another planet.</p> <p>She worked through to draft 10, putting the story down before the end of the year. And then she thought: \u201cOh my God, what if I die with that story unfinished?\u201d So she militantly set aside time to work on it further. \u201cAnd because I had the terror and the tension, I was able to be creative again. I finished it.\u201d</p> <p>The book has been accepted but it is unlikely to be published until 2023. Fox had two thoughts: one, that it may be posthumous but at least it got done. The second was that 2023 would mark the 40th anniversary of her first book, Possum Magic \u2013 one of the best-loved in Australian children\u2019s literature.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Five years later you\u2019re still writing a book of 250 words ... every single word has to be in the right place</p> <footer> <cite>Mem Fox</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fox\u2019s mother would disapprove of her \u201cskiting\u201d but the author has been wondering why it is she has been so successful. Not every book has been a bestseller, but enough of them have found places in the homes and languages of children in Australia and beyond. The difference, she has decided, is a sense of rhythm. \u201cI can\u2019t bring it down to anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Children\u2019s books are for reading aloud. Not a single word, not a beat, can be off-kilter. Koala Lou took two years and 49 drafts to complete. Her latest book, The Tiny Star, took five years.</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is that you get the idea, you know the story, maybe you\u2019ve got the characters. Putting those things together in a first draft, that\u2019s simple,\u201d she says. \u201cBut five years later you\u2019re still writing a book of 250 words or something. Because, in [The Tiny Star] in particular, every single word had to be in the right place. You couldn\u2019t have a syllable in the wrong place.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d617035c98e44f15cc624c9877efecc3cec537ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d617035c98e44f15cc624c9877efecc3cec537ef/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mem Fox\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mem Fox: \u2018They are super human beings, little kids\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied: PRH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is another component, she thinks, that has rendered her stories so popular.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s also understanding that children are intelligent, and that they\u2019ve got a sense of humour, and they have deeply felt emotions, even at a young age,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are super human beings, little kids.\u201d</p> <p>And as someone who has been talking to children for generations, what does Fox think of childhood under coronavirus?</p> <p>\u201cThe positive side of it is massive,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing.\u201d</p> <p>While the physical side of restrictions can be hard for young children, Fox finds cause for much hope \u2013 even enjoyment \u2013 in the upheaval. Families spending entire days together, with fathers, particularly, spending much more time at home. No scuttling, pinball-like, between scheduled activities. In some ways, for the lucky families, it\u2019s a gift.</p> <p>\u201cI think that children must have been able to find a sense of calm,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything\u2019s cancelled.

Fox defends teachers but is no fan of contemporary literacy teaching.

      "bodyText": "In some ways, life for Mem Fox under coronavirus is not terribly different from life before the pandemic. It\u2019s largely \u201csame, same\u201d, the children\u2019s author says. \u201cBut there is one difference, and that\u2019s terror.\u201d She was sick last year, in hospital for eight days with paraflu. She was too weak to read. She couldn\u2019t hold a book. Hospital staff would be kitted out in PPE when treating her, and visitors needed to keep their distance. If she took a phone call from a friend, she would need three hours to recover. She just couldn\u2019t breathe. She did recover. But as coronavirus casts a pall over all things, she is aware she is in the highest level of the danger zone. Recently ill, 74 years old and a severe asthmatic. She feels the terror in her body \u2013 something like cold sweats and slight panic attacks. She wonders sometimes whether she will survive the coming winter. But within that terror \u2013 and boredom, as she lay in her hospital bed unable even to queue up podcasts \u2013 she began to write a story in her head. \u201cDay after day I would write it, rethink certain phases then rewrite,\u201d Fox tells Guardian Australia. As she got better, she asked her husband tobuy a pad of yellow paper, a rubber, a sharpener and six 4B pencils. \u201cThe lead is so soft, it\u2019s lovely to write with.\u201d One day, a specialist came into her room to find Fox on a bed covered with yellow pages of drafting, the right sleeve of her nightie dirty from rubber crumbs. She was appalled to see Fox working but the author replied that, actually, she was in a state of zen. The forced stillness had brought her to another planet. She worked through to draft 10, putting the story down before the end of the year. And then she thought: \u201cOh my God, what if I die with that story unfinished?\u201d So she militantly set aside time to work on it further. \u201cAnd because I had the terror and the tension, I was able to be creative again. I finished it.\u201d The book has been accepted but it is unlikely to be published until 2023. Fox had two thoughts: one, that it may be posthumous but at least it got done. The second was that 2023 would mark the 40th anniversary of her first book, Possum Magic \u2013 one of the best-loved in Australian children\u2019s literature. Fox\u2019s mother would disapprove of her \u201cskiting\u201d but the author has been wondering why it is she has been so successful. Not every book has been a bestseller, but enough of them have found places in the homes and languages of children in Australia and beyond. The difference, she has decided, is a sense of rhythm. \u201cI can\u2019t bring it down to anything else.\u201d Children\u2019s books are for reading aloud. Not a single word, not a beat, can be off-kilter. Koala Lou took two years and 49 drafts to complete. Her latest book, The Tiny Star, took five years. \u201cThe problem is that you get the idea, you know the story, maybe you\u2019ve got the characters. Putting those things together in a first draft, that\u2019s simple,\u201d she says. \u201cBut five years later you\u2019re still writing a book of 250 words or something. Because, in [The Tiny Star] in particular, every single word had to be in the right place. You couldn\u2019t have a syllable in the wrong place.\u201d There is another component, she thinks, that has rendered her stories so popular. \u201cIt\u2019s also understanding that children are intelligent, and that they\u2019ve got a sense of humour, and they have deeply felt emotions, even at a young age,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are super human beings, little kids.\u201d And as someone who has been talking to children for generations, what does Fox think of childhood under coronavirus? \u201cThe positive side of it is massive,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the weirdest thing.\u201d While the physical side of restrictions can be hard for young children, Fox finds cause for much hope \u2013 even enjoyment \u2013 in the upheaval. Families spending entire days together, with fathers, particularly, spending much more time at home. No scuttling, pinball-like, between scheduled activities. In some ways, for the lucky families, it\u2019s a gift. \u201cI think that children must have been able to find a sense of calm,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything\u2019s cancelled. There\u2019s no sport. There\u2019s no outside school activity. There\u2019s no urgency any more. It must be wonderful for them.\u201d The lockdown, says the former associate professor of literary studies, is a huge opportunity for literacy. Fox defends teachers but is no fan of contemporary literacy teaching. And while not all children are or will be read to, for those who are, she says, this lockdown could mean they read with their loved ones far more than in the past. \u201cThis is an inoculation against illiteracy!\u201d And then there\u2019s the magic. At the end of the day, after whatever calm or chaos has preceded it, something happens, she says, when an adult sits down with a child to read. \u201cYou almost see the changing shape of the child when those familiar words begin.\u201d And not just for the child: \u201cThe balloon of tension in a parent just goes away. It just goes down to nothing. It\u2019s magical.\u201d And if coronavirus means there are more moments like that, in more households, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s not all been bad.\u201d",

By and large the people who can work from home worked in offices and did most of their work on a computer ... and not exclusively but largely, they are professionals, managers and other specialist white-collar occupations who were already earning above average income to start with.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems doubly unfair that the people who had the most secure starting point are the ones who are able to keep their jobs and their income during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe people who can\u2019t work from home have faced a devil\u2019s choice \u2013 do their jobs despite the risk of infection [and spreading it to others] or they have to leave their jobs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83841723363acb92672e1fb3156dfeb9a4a2e5af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83841723363acb92672e1fb3156dfeb9a4a2e5af/0_0_1638_1092/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Stanford speaking at a summit in 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jim Stanford speaking at a summit in 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Those who can\u2019t work from home include, among others, more highly paid and educated health professionals and first responders \u2013 people admired and respected during, as before, the pandemic. But there are also also hundreds of thousands of low-wage, poorly educated and often casually employed people \u2013 cleaners and delivery drivers, supermarket workers and those on factory lines producing essential items like toilet paper and hand sanitiser \u2013 whose work has been afforded little social capital and whose very presence and contributions had often gone unnoticed.</p> <p>Stanford says: \u201cWhat\u2019s striking is the shift in attitudes about some of the so-called menial, low-wage often casualised jobs, who, it turns out, are also changing our lives and allowing us to get through this pandemic ... occupations that have been treated like crap for decades and we assumed that they were menial, low-skilled, easily replaceable positions and we allowed the economy and businesses to cheapen and degrade and outsource that work into almost oblivion.</p> <p>\u201cRecognising the importance of those so-called menial jobs and the risks associated with doing them and putting in place adequate protections and supports for them I think is a very urgent priority.\u201d</p> <h2>Non-risky business</h2> <p>For many whose businesses are now in hibernation, the post-pandemic future looks bleak. Rebooting without government support (many are ineligible for jobkeeper or jobseeker benefits) and with only remote prospects of attaining pre-pandemic turnover, will be too daunting. Some will cut losses and take their skills elsewhere. Some will retire. Others will become permanently unemployed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://hwp.com.au/\">Hilary Wardhaugh</a> has run a successful commercial photography business in Canberra for 25 years. She was very busy over summer. But business slowed towards the end of February as the viral threat captivated the world.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s when I lost all my work ... I\u2019ve done only three headshots since then,\u201d says Wardhaugh, 56, a single parent who, with her 16-year-old son, had moved in with her elderly mother before the pandemic so she might pay down the mortgage on her own house. Her tenants are now unable to meet the rent.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in Canberra for a long time and the business is well-established. I think when this [isolation] is over the work will come back in dribs and drabs.

But now I\u2019m thinking seriously about whether to invest in the business with new gear, if I want to retire at 60 or 65. I\u2019m not sure I want to take that risk. I\u2019m actually thinking about trying to get a full-time permanent job \u2013 of working for someone else instead of reinvesting in my own business with new gear.\u201d</p> <p>Reflecting Wardhaugh\u2019s caution about her future, Steve Koukoulas, managing director of Market Economics and an economic adviser to the former prime minister Julia Gillard, says the pandemic aftermath could see \u201ca crushing of entrepreneurship and economic risk-taking\u201d because \u201copportunity for gains has been swamped by an illustration of how bad things can get personally when things so wrong\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMany small business owners and sole traders have had financial catastrophe thrust on them,\u201d Koukoulas says. \u201cIn hospitalities in particular, revenue has fallen to near zero which feeds into their own salary in the first instance, and then into unmanageable problems with servicing debt. The fallout in many instances means that in future many may shun debt or overdraft on their business \u2013 the exposure to a shock is not worth it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Unless people need it to live, you\u2019re going to struggle to sell it</p> <footer> <cite>Dylan Nichols</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnother more life-altering lesson is not to use your house as collateral against your small business loan. Unless there is the proverbial economic \u2018snapback\u2019 and the economy returns to full employment very soon, small business owners are likely to be forced to sell their houses to cover their business losses.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s problematic and emotionally fraught looking for silver linings in times of such misery and economic distress. But the reality is that some businesses are more likely than others to prosper and attract the dollars of cautious investors wary of sinking money into the stock market, real estate (risky given residential and commercial rents can\u2019t be guaranteed) or high-risk e-startups.</p> <p>The bioenergy consultant Dylan Nichols has been busier than before the pandemic because the crisis has created increased demand on essential services like waste management.</p> <p>\u201cMy industry is relatively pandemic-proof, so it has been interesting to see the increased level of [investor] interest in these services,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile these industries aren\u2019t the most glamorous, it\u2019s been an interesting reminder of what we want as a society and what we need.</p> <p>\u201cUnemployment is up and people are watching their shadows \u2013 whole industries have disappeared. Essential services will do well at this time and for [at least] the short term. I\u2019d be hoping that many essential services use this time to innovate, creating new industries and jobs. Many businesses simply won\u2019t recover. Investors are looking at businesses that are pandemic proof, which brings a whole new level of due diligence. The days of raising US$120m for a juicer are over for some time. Unless people need it to live, you\u2019re going to struggle to sell it.\u201d</p> <h2>From stigma to saviour</h2> <p>I\u2019ve long been conversant with the challenges of working in the place where I live.

      "bodyText": "As Australia surveys the labour market wreckage of almost two months of pandemic-inspired physical isolation, several orthodoxies have emerged about the way we will work when the restrictions are eventually lifted. One, based partly on a history that illustrates many jobs lost in big downturns never reappear, is that Australia faces entrenched unemployment upwards of 10% for at least half a decade. Another is that some sort of \u201cnew normal\u201d will emerge whereby vast sections of workers will continue to carry out employment from home. Nobody can accurately predict how many people will become long-term unemployed. But already evident is that many thousands of businesses \u2013 in retail, hospitality, transport, manufacturing, financial services, marketing and advertising, to name a few sectors \u2013 will never operate profitably again. Many will die. And thousands of people employed by them \u2013 largely those with no capacity for home work \u2013 will not possess skills or experience to be employed in the post-pandemic economy. Aside from the enormous social and economic inequities of who can work from home, it may be wrong to assume that even those whose skills now allow them to will want this to be their new work normal. The economist Jim Stanford has been working from home for two months. It is, he says, driving him crazy. He says: \u201cYou know I\u2019m very fortunate \u2013 I\u2019ve a comfortable apartment, I have a desk that I can use as a kind of quasi office and I\u2019m in a safe and loving family environment. And despite all that, to tell you the truth, it\u2019s driving me crazy. \u201cI miss the human interaction and I find it stressful to be working in close quarters with the people that I love and live with who are also going about their business in different ways. \u201cThe level of flexibility can be helpful and it is a privilege \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t want this to be my permanent work arrangement. No offence to the people I live with.\u201d Given he\u2019s director of the Centre for Future Work, Stanford seems like a good person to ask about how employment might look in post-iso Australia. Research conducted by Stanford\u2019s centre indicates about 30% of Australia workers (4 million) have capacity to work from home. \u201cThat means 70% of people can\u2019t do their work from home ... By and large the people who can work from home worked in offices and did most of their work on a computer ... and not exclusively but largely, they are professionals, managers and other specialist white-collar occupations who were already earning above average income to start with. \u201cIt seems doubly unfair that the people who had the most secure starting point are the ones who are able to keep their jobs and their income during the pandemic. \u201cThe people who can\u2019t work from home have faced a devil\u2019s choice \u2013 do their jobs despite the risk of infection [and spreading it to others] or they have to leave their jobs.\u201d Those who can\u2019t work from home include, among others, more highly paid and educated health professionals and first responders \u2013 people admired and respected during, as before, the pandemic. But there are also also hundreds of thousands of low-wage, poorly educated and often casually employed people \u2013 cleaners and delivery drivers, supermarket workers and those on factory lines producing essential items like toilet paper and hand sanitiser \u2013 whose work has been afforded little social capital and whose very presence and contributions had often gone unnoticed. Stanford says: \u201cWhat\u2019s striking is the shift in attitudes about some of the so-called menial, low-wage often casualised jobs, who, it turns out, are also changing our lives and allowing us to get through this pandemic ... occupations that have been treated like crap for decades and we assumed that they were menial, low-skilled, easily replaceable positions and we allowed the economy and businesses to cheapen and degrade and outsource that work into almost oblivion. \u201cRecognising the importance of those so-called menial jobs and the risks associated with doing them and putting in place adequate protections and supports for them I think is a very urgent priority.\u201d Non-risky business For many whose businesses are now in hibernation, the post-pandemic future looks bleak. Rebooting without government support (many are ineligible for jobkeeper or jobseeker benefits) and with only remote prospects of attaining pre-pandemic turnover, will be too daunting. Some will cut losses and take their skills elsewhere. Some will retire. Others will become permanently unemployed. Hilary Wardhaugh has run a successful commercial photography business in Canberra for 25 years. She was very busy over summer. But business slowed towards the end of February as the viral threat captivated the world. \u201cThat\u2019s when I lost all my work ... I\u2019ve done only three headshots since then,\u201d says Wardhaugh, 56, a single parent who, with her 16-year-old son, had moved in with her elderly mother before the pandemic so she might pay down the mortgage on her own house. Her tenants are now unable to meet the rent. \u201cI\u2019ve been in Canberra for a long time and the business is well-established. I think when this [isolation] is over the work will come back in dribs and drabs. But I don\u2019t think the business will get back to where it was \u2013 I think companies who spent on corporate photography may start doing their own to save money because everyone will be looking for savings wherever they can.\u201d \u201cI need new equipment. But now I\u2019m thinking seriously about whether to invest in the business with new gear, if I want to retire at 60 or 65. I\u2019m not sure I want to take that risk. I\u2019m actually thinking about trying to get a full-time permanent job \u2013 of working for someone else instead of reinvesting in my own business with new gear.\u201d Reflecting Wardhaugh\u2019s caution about her future, Steve Koukoulas, managing director of Market Economics and an economic adviser to the former prime minister Julia Gillard, says the pandemic aftermath could see \u201ca crushing of entrepreneurship and economic risk-taking\u201d because \u201copportunity for gains has been swamped by an illustration of how bad things can get personally when things so wrong\u201d. \u201cMany small business owners and sole traders have had financial catastrophe thrust on them,\u201d Koukoulas says. \u201cIn hospitalities in particular, revenue has fallen to near zero which feeds into their own salary in the first instance, and then into unmanageable problems with servicing debt. The fallout in many instances means that in future many may shun debt or overdraft on their business \u2013 the exposure to a shock is not worth it.\u201d \u201cAnother more life-altering lesson is not to use your house as collateral against your small business loan. Unless there is the proverbial economic \u2018snapback\u2019 and the economy returns to full employment very soon, small business owners are likely to be forced to sell their houses to cover their business losses.\u201d It\u2019s problematic and emotionally fraught looking for silver linings in times of such misery and economic distress. But the reality is that some businesses are more likely than others to prosper and attract the dollars of cautious investors wary of sinking money into the stock market, real estate (risky given residential and commercial rents can\u2019t be guaranteed) or high-risk e-startups. The bioenergy consultant Dylan Nichols has been busier than before the pandemic because the crisis has created increased demand on essential services like waste management. \u201cMy industry is relatively pandemic-proof, so it has been interesting to see the increased level of [investor] interest in these services,\u201d he says. \u201cWhile these industries aren\u2019t the most glamorous, it\u2019s been an interesting reminder of what we want as a society and what we need. \u201cUnemployment is up and people are watching their shadows \u2013 whole industries have disappeared. Essential services will do well at this time and for [at least] the short term. I\u2019d be hoping that many essential services use this time to innovate, creating new industries and jobs. Many businesses simply won\u2019t recover. Investors are looking at businesses that are pandemic proof, which brings a whole new level of due diligence. The days of raising US$120m for a juicer are over for some time. Unless people need it to live, you\u2019re going to struggle to sell it.\u201d From stigma to saviour I\u2019ve long been conversant with the challenges of working in the place where I live. The upsides (flexibility, no commuting, no workplace politics, spending days with dogs instead of people) are considerable. I\u2019m privileged and beyond fortunate, especially at a time when so many people are trying to carve out a workspace in overcrowded or unsafe domestic situations. I have a dedicated, private home office, an ergonomic set-up in an inner-city house in the country\u2019s biggest city. The occasional negatives invariably relate to the flipside of the flexibility \u2013 usually the situational requirement to fill domestic gaps. Ill children can play particular havoc with deadlines. But when you work from home, sometimes practicalities mean you often pick up the care and try to make up the working time on weekends. This can undermine routine, if that is important to you. I sympathise with couples \u2013 and especially singles \u2013 who are trying to work from home while overseeing kids\u2019 primary school education. One thing I have learnt is that it\u2019s very difficult to get much meaningful work done at home, regardless of your setup, if you are caring for ill or very small children. Difficult. But not impossible. Among the revelations of the great Covid-19 disruption of 2020, will be the surprising levels of productivity and the capacity for multitasking of some employees working at home while overseeing the education of children. Many employees have long sought the flexibility to work part- or full-time from home. While some employers have resisted this (even stigmatised it as being for \u201cslackers\u201d or people not serious about career progression), they have had to accede to it for their businesses to survive isolation. Jennifer Petriglieri, an organisational behaviour academic, says post-isolation society will need to \u201cdeliberately work to bake this new capacity into the employment market permanently\u201d. \u201cBefore the forced confinement, home working was generally seen as a choice for people who are not particularly serious about their careers, and employees who took advantage of flexible working policies were sidelined when it came to promotions and pay increases,\u201d Petriglieri says. \u201cThis stigmatisation went against the research, which shows that flexible working (typically a mix of home and office working) is more productive than being in the office every day. \u201cNow, the bosses \u2026 who sidelined flexible workers previously, are themselves experiencing how productive home working can be and seeing that the technology exists such that we don\u2019t need to be in the office all the time, nor need to travel for work so much.

      "bodyText": "An extra \u00a32bn of state aid will be needed to keep London\u2019s transport system running until September, senior industry sources have told the Guardian. Transport for London has asked for the emergency funds because its revenue stream has been devastated by the coronavirus lockdown. Both TfL and the Department of Transport declined to comment on the proposed \u00a32bn rescue package. Senior industry sources confirmed that TfL and its transport commissioner had called for the cash injection to help keep buses, tube trains and light rail systems functioning until early autumn. They said TfL was seeking at least \u00a32bn in the short-term to ensure there is a transport system to cope with millions of workers returning to jobs once the lockdown is relaxed. A TfL spokesperson said the near total lack of fares in lockdown had \u201cdevastated our revenue\u201d. They continued: \u201cWe have been very clear with the government that we are going to need new support, a new grant to get us through the next period and also in the longer-term.\u201d The spokesperson said that prior to the pandemic the transport system in London had been \u201con the way to self-sufficiency\u201d in terms of passenger demand and income streams. As well as no income from fares, TfL has also lost revenue after it suspended all rent it charges to tenant business units inside London\u2019s rail, bus and tube stations. According to TfL figures it costs around \u00a3600m a month to run the capital\u2019s transport system. A spokesperson for the Department of Transport said: \u201cWe continue to work closely with Transport for London and the mayor\u2019s office to help face the challenges affecting TfL as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.\u201d The union representing the majority of bus workers in London said it believed TfL would also seek a further\u00a32bn in state aid after September to maintain the capital\u2019s transport until the end of the year. Unite blamed the hole in TFL\u2019s finances partly on the lockdown but also on the withdrawal of hundreds of millions in state subsidies that were pumped into London transport until the mid-2000s. TfL and Unite said passenger footfall on London\u2019s buses was down 85% since the pandemic began. TfL said the numbers using the tube had declined by 95%. With most buses allowing travellers to enter on side doors only to protect drivers at the front from infection, the bus network\u2019s income stream has been further reduced. The union said 31 bus workers had died from Covid-19. Pete Kavanagh, Unite\u2019s London and eastern regional secretary, called on TfL and the Department of Transport not to address the hole in the bus system\u2019s finances by making redundancies. \u201cAfter lockdown, more than ever the people of this city will want a fully functioning bus network. I believe that the community will join our staff in resisting any move to reduce the number of bus workers,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people are showing great solidarity with our colleagues who take other key workers to places like hospitals in this crisis. I am sure they will stand by the bus workers in the face of any threatened job losses,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>A universal experience is highlighting the sharp divides in our society. Few are as stark and shocking as those revealed by Thursday\u2019s news that black people in England and Wales are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">more than four times as likely to die</a> from Covid-19 as white people. Bangladeshi and Pakistani people were about three and a half times more likely, and those of Indian origin two and a half times as likely, the Office for National Statistics reported.</p> <p>The disproportionately high toll of BAME people was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\" title=\"\">already evident</a>, notably among medical staff: a <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\" title=\"\">review</a> of just over a hundred NHS staff who died found that almost two-thirds were black or Asian, though those groups account for less than one in seven workers in the health service. It is all the more striking, given that age is one of the biggest risk factors and the over-65s comprise only one in 20 of the BAME population, compared with almost one in five of the white population.</p> <p>The reasons are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/why-are-people-from-bame-groups-dying-disproportionately-of-covid-19\" title=\"\">complex, interlocking</a> and not yet fully understood. Geography has doubtless played its part; urban dwellers have been worse hit. The prevalence of underlying conditions such as diabetes vary markedly between communities. But health is intimately tied to economic wellbeing. It cannot be divorced from other considerations. We know that, in general, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-inequality-and-health-a-matter-of-life-and-death\" title=\"\">the poor die younger</a>. Black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations face higher levels of unemployment and child poverty than white groups, and are much more likely to live in overcrowded conditions.</p> <p>Even stripping out such factors, the ONS figures show black people are still almost twice as likely as white people to die a Covid-19-related death, with Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian individuals also disproportionately affected.</p> <p>Cultural factors may play a part; multigenerational occupancy may put older people at greater risk. But there are also difficult questions to be asked, such as whether BAME people enjoy equal access to healthcare and are treated in the same way. The head of the British Medical Association has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\" title=\"\">wondered</a> whether BAME doctors might feel less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment, noting that they are more likely to report feeling bullied and harassed than their white counterparts, and much less likely to raise concerns for fear of the consequences. Many of those have been born outside the UK, and the BMA has rightly urged that they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/calls-grow-scrap-nhs-surcharge-migrant-healthcare-workers-coronavirus\" title=\"\">should be exempted from the migrant surcharge</a> for the NHS. It is absurd and unjust that those risking their lives for others should be forced to pay for healthcare themselves.</p> <p>Whether more can be done to protect them must be assessed urgently. A rapid review is needed into the high death rates of BAME people, and those working in the health service especially, to protect lives. Public Health England\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/phe-to-review-how-ethnicity-affects-vulnerability-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">review</a> of health records, which aims to better understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could affect the impact of coronavirus on people, is due to report back at the end of the month. Yet quite how far it will delve into these questions is still unclear, and the involvement of a firm co-founded by Trevor Phillips, former head of the equalities watchdog, has been widely criticised.</p> <p>In the longer run, there are no quick solutions to our society\u2019s health inequalities. They are deeply rooted, have entrenched themselves in the austerity years, and will not easily be eradicated. The pandemic has exposed how devastating they can be, and when it ends, the need to address them will be as deep as ever.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A universal experience is highlighting the sharp divides in our society. Few are as stark and shocking as those revealed by Thursday\u2019s news that black people in England and Wales are more than four times as likely to die from Covid-19 as white people. Bangladeshi and Pakistani people were about three and a half times more likely, and those of Indian origin two and a half times as likely, the Office for National Statistics reported. The disproportionately high toll of BAME people was already evident, notably among medical staff: a review of just over a hundred NHS staff who died found that almost two-thirds were black or Asian, though those groups account for less than one in seven workers in the health service. It is all the more striking, given that age is one of the biggest risk factors and the over-65s comprise only one in 20 of the BAME population, compared with almost one in five of the white population. The reasons are complex, interlocking and not yet fully understood. Geography has doubtless played its part; urban dwellers have been worse hit. The prevalence of underlying conditions such as diabetes vary markedly between communities. But health is intimately tied to economic wellbeing. It cannot be divorced from other considerations. We know that, in general, the poor die younger. Black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani populations face higher levels of unemployment and child poverty than white groups, and are much more likely to live in overcrowded conditions. Even stripping out such factors, the ONS figures show black people are still almost twice as likely as white people to die a Covid-19-related death, with Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian individuals also disproportionately affected. Cultural factors may play a part; multigenerational occupancy may put older people at greater risk. But there are also difficult questions to be asked, such as whether BAME people enjoy equal access to healthcare and are treated in the same way. The head of the British Medical Association has wondered whether BAME doctors might feel less able to complain about inadequate personal protective equipment, noting that they are more likely to report feeling bullied and harassed than their white counterparts, and much less likely to raise concerns for fear of the consequences. Many of those have been born outside the UK, and the BMA has rightly urged that they should be exempted from the migrant surcharge for the NHS. It is absurd and unjust that those risking their lives for others should be forced to pay for healthcare themselves. Whether more can be done to protect them must be assessed urgently. A rapid review is needed into the high death rates of BAME people, and those working in the health service especially, to protect lives. Public Health England\u2019s review of health records, which aims to better understand how factors such as ethnicity, deprivation, age, gender and obesity could affect the impact of coronavirus on people, is due to report back at the end of the month. Yet quite how far it will delve into these questions is still unclear, and the involvement of a firm co-founded by Trevor Phillips, former head of the equalities watchdog, has been widely criticised. In the longer run, there are no quick solutions to our society\u2019s health inequalities. They are deeply rooted, have entrenched themselves in the austerity years, and will not easily be eradicated. The pandemic has exposed how devastating they can be, and when it ends, the need to address them will be as deep as ever.",

      "bodyText": "The NHS contact-tracing app must not be rolled out across the UK until the government has increased privacy and data protections, an influential parliamentary committee has said, as rights groups warn that the current trial is unlawful under the Data Protection Act. The joint committee on human rights said on Thursday it was essential legislation was enacted to ensure the mass surveillance of personal data did not result in a violation before the trial was expanded. Its report was published following a legal letter from the Open Rights Group warning of \u201cheightened and urgent concerns\u201d that the government had failed to follow laws requiring it to submit an assessment of the risks to the information commissioners office. The app, which is being trialled on the Isle of Wight, logs users\u2019 movements and can alert people if they have had contact with someone who has developed symptoms. Ministers have said it is an important tool to study the spread of Covid-19 and to help them ease lockdown restrictions. But privacy campaign groups have opposed its introduction and a group of UK academics working in cybersecurity, privacy and law recently signed a joint letter saying it could open the door to general surveillance. Harriet Harman, the chair of the joint committee on human rights, said government assurances on privacy were \u201cnot enough\u201d. \u201cThe contact-tracing app involves unprecedented data gathering. There must be robust legal protection for individuals about what that data will be used for, who will have access to it and how it will be safeguarded from hacking. \u201cParliament was able quickly to agree to give the government sweeping powers. It is perfectly possible for parliament to do the same for legislation to protect privacy,\u201d she said. Counsel to the committee and Adam Wagner, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers, are drafting a parliamentary bill that could protect the privacy of personal data, Harman said. A number of senior Tories are expected to support such a bill if it is tabled. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, told the Guardian he was \u201cminded\u201d to support the bill for two reasons. \u201cFirst of all, privacy is a crucial part of the rights of British citizens and secondly because the better the safeguards, the more likely that it will be taken up by people and be an effective tool in stopping the spread of the virus,\u201d he said. MPs and peers on the committee examined evidence submitted by experts in human rights law, surveillance and computer science from the University of Essex. The committee called for new legislation with guaranteed data and human rights protections, as well as an independent body to oversee the use, effectiveness and privacy protections of the app and any data associated with this contact-tracing, a digital contact-tracing human rights commissioner to deal with complaints from the public and report to parliament, and regular reviews of the scheme by Matt Hancock, the health secretary. Giving evidence to the committee on Monday, Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, revealed that her office had not received a data protection impact assessment from the government, a legally required step for any organisation embarking on \u201chigh risk\u201d data processing.

The foreign secretary said at the daily press conference in Downing Street that while the government was in the position to think about the next phase of its pandemic response, people should continue to follow physical distancing guidelines over the bank holiday weekend. The prime minister had earlier said changes would be introduced from Monday, but Raab would not be drawn on rumoured changes such as allowing sunbathing or more outdoor exercise. He said: \u201cAs we enter another long bank holiday weekend I think the message is very clear: follow the guidance. There is no change today in the guidance or in the rules, but the prime minister will set out a roadmap on Sunday. \u201cAny changes in the short-term will be modest, small and incremental, very carefully monitored, and as for now there\u2019s no changes.\u201d In effect the lockdown has been extended beyond the official review point of 7 May until more information is released on Sunday. Temperatures are expected to be as high as 26C over the weekend in London and south-east England, which has led to fears people may break the lockdown rules. Downing Street has said it is still receiving scientific advice on what the next steps should be and is considering setting out plans based on a number of \u201cmilestones\u201d. Sir Ian Diamond, the head statistician for the ONS, said all the data he had seen showed the importance of physical distancing and he expected it would need to be maintained. He said the \u201cR\u201d number \u2013 the rate of transmission \u2013 was below one. However, R had gone up since the last estimates because of the rise of cases in care homes. \u201cWe need certainly to get on top of the epidemic in care homes and in hospitals,\u201d he said. Raab said R was down overall, and especially in London, but he admitted that a \u201cchallenge remains in care homes\u201d. Temperature checking \u2013 as South Korea, for example, has implemented at airports, workplaces and restaurants \u2013 will not be rolled out in the UK as part of its coronavirus strategy, Raab confirmed. He said he would look at the scientific advice but \u201ctemperature tests are not a particularly effective way of proceeding\u201d. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries, said the likelihood of finding someone at the exact point they have a temperature related to coronavirus was very small, and some people presented with different symptoms. She said: \u201cWe want to catch people in the early phase of the disease where they are most likely to transmit, and not all of them will have a temperature.\u201d Figures released by the government showed that it missed its 100,000 daily tests target for a sixth 24-hour period in a row since 30 April.",

      "body": "<p>It is a story that has been repeated throughout the coronavirus crisis. An under pressure minister makes a promise about the delivery of protective equipment, new technology or testing capability only to discover that reality fails to match the hype.</p> \n<p>The result, as the saga of the shipment of 400,000 apparently unusable protective gowns from Turkey shows, is that trust in politicians among the public and above all those on the frontline of the pandemic in the NHS and social care has been eroded.</p> \n<p>Three weeks ago, on 18 April, when the NHS was days away from running out of the water resistant gowns essential to safe working in coronavirus intensive care, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, thought he had the answer.</p> \n<p>He rashly promised at Downing Street\u2019s daily press conference that \u201ca very large consignment of PPE\u201d was due to arrive in the UK from Turkey the following day, amounting to 84 tonnes of equipment and including 400,000 gowns.</p> \n<p>The Turkish supplier Selegna said on Thursday that the order had been placed in desperation a couple of days earlier. The company contacted the NHS about the possibility of supplying the gowns and a deposit was paid immediately. The badly needed gowns were supposed to be delivered three days later.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In fact the shipment was delayed for several days and despite being inspected by British officials in Istanbul, it was eventually discovered and then belatedly acknowledged that the gowns were no good for NHS use.</p> \n<p>Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said Jenrick and other ministers should have been more circumspect. \u201cWe called on the government and national NHS leaders to be careful about announcing consignments of PPE from overseas until they know they have arrived, are unpacked and the kit has been checked to ensure it passes safety tests,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Trusts had been working around the clock to secure alternative supplies as a result, he added.</p> \n<p>NHS insiders said the PPE crisis had eased over the past three weeks despite the fiasco over the Turkish order, partly because the number of patients in hospital had fallen, but that masks and gowns were still in short supply. The real casualty, however, was faith across the system, they argued.</p> \n<p>They said doctors, nurses and other frontline staff increasingly believed that when Public Health England altered gown standards last month, it was done to save ministers face rather than satisfy the needs of frontline staff. The changes were arguably medically justified, but there was no faith that they were being introduced for the right reasons.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across healthcare, said: \u201cWe have warned repeatedly that setting big targets which are then not met and saying all will be well, when at the sharp end of care it is manifestly not, undermines confidence among clinical staff on the frontline.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Turkish PPE saga is far from an isolated case, particularly when a new product or treatment is sought. It emerged a week ago that an order for 250 ventilators sourced from China had to be ditched because they were badly made and even have posed a potential danger to patients.</p> \n<p>The devices had been obtained earlier in April as part of a desperate round-the-world trawl to try to meet a target set by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, of procuring 18,000 to meet the anticipated coronavirus peak.</p> \n<p>New devices designed by non-specialist manufacturers such as Dyson as part of a much hyped \u201cventilator challenge\u201d also turned out not to be ready quickly enough, although they were not ultimately needed because number of coronavirus cases was lower than expected.</p> \n<p>NHS insiders say the pandemic has put unprecedented strain on the centralised procurement system, under which buyers have to meet the needs not only of large trusts but also GP practices, care homes and other smaller facilities.</p> \n<p>Mistakes have been made, but since a group of trust chief executives were drafted in to help NHS Supply Chain, through which most procurement is undertaken, the situation is said to have improved despite the latest debacle.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus-key-workers</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Ministerial promises on testing have also rung hollow. Hancock said he had bought 3.5m antibody tests from China at the end of March, and promised they would \u201ccome online very soon\u201d. A fortnight later it became apparent the tests did not work, and ministers denied that $20m (\u00a316m) had been paid up front for them.</p> \n<p>Despite that blunder, Hancock then promised 100,000 swab tests, which detect the presence of the virus, would be carried out each day by the end of April.

      "bodyText": "It is a story that has been repeated throughout the coronavirus crisis. An under pressure minister makes a promise about the delivery of protective equipment, new technology or testing capability only to discover that reality fails to match the hype. The result, as the saga of the shipment of 400,000 apparently unusable protective gowns from Turkey shows, is that trust in politicians among the public and above all those on the frontline of the pandemic in the NHS and social care has been eroded. Three weeks ago, on 18 April, when the NHS was days away from running out of the water resistant gowns essential to safe working in coronavirus intensive care, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, thought he had the answer. He rashly promised at Downing Street\u2019s daily press conference that \u201ca very large consignment of PPE\u201d was due to arrive in the UK from Turkey the following day, amounting to 84 tonnes of equipment and including 400,000 gowns. The Turkish supplier Selegna said on Thursday that the order had been placed in desperation a couple of days earlier. The company contacted the NHS about the possibility of supplying the gowns and a deposit was paid immediately. The badly needed gowns were supposed to be delivered three days later. In fact the shipment was delayed for several days and despite being inspected by British officials in Istanbul, it was eventually discovered and then belatedly acknowledged that the gowns were no good for NHS use. Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said Jenrick and other ministers should have been more circumspect. \u201cWe called on the government and national NHS leaders to be careful about announcing consignments of PPE from overseas until they know they have arrived, are unpacked and the kit has been checked to ensure it passes safety tests,\u201d he said. Trusts had been working around the clock to secure alternative supplies as a result, he added. NHS insiders said the PPE crisis had eased over the past three weeks despite the fiasco over the Turkish order, partly because the number of patients in hospital had fallen, but that masks and gowns were still in short supply. The real casualty, however, was faith across the system, they argued. They said doctors, nurses and other frontline staff increasingly believed that when Public Health England altered gown standards last month, it was done to save ministers face rather than satisfy the needs of frontline staff. The changes were arguably medically justified, but there was no faith that they were being introduced for the right reasons. Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across healthcare, said: \u201cWe have warned repeatedly that setting big targets which are then not met and saying all will be well, when at the sharp end of care it is manifestly not, undermines confidence among clinical staff on the frontline.\u201d The Turkish PPE saga is far from an isolated case, particularly when a new product or treatment is sought. It emerged a week ago that an order for 250 ventilators sourced from China had to be ditched because they were badly made and even have posed a potential danger to patients. The devices had been obtained earlier in April as part of a desperate round-the-world trawl to try to meet a target set by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, of procuring 18,000 to meet the anticipated coronavirus peak. New devices designed by non-specialist manufacturers such as Dyson as part of a much hyped \u201cventilator challenge\u201d also turned out not to be ready quickly enough, although they were not ultimately needed because number of coronavirus cases was lower than expected. NHS insiders say the pandemic has put unprecedented strain on the centralised procurement system, under which buyers have to meet the needs not only of large trusts but also GP practices, care homes and other smaller facilities. Mistakes have been made, but since a group of trust chief executives were drafted in to help NHS Supply Chain, through which most procurement is undertaken, the situation is said to have improved despite the latest debacle. Ministerial promises on testing have also rung hollow. Hancock said he had bought 3.5m antibody tests from China at the end of March, and promised they would \u201ccome online very soon\u201d. A fortnight later it became apparent the tests did not work, and ministers denied that $20m (\u00a316m) had been paid up front for them. Despite that blunder, Hancock then promised 100,000 swab tests, which detect the presence of the virus, would be carried out each day by the end of April. The target that was achieved for two days, with the help of counting tests in the post, and then missed for five days in a row. The tally for Thursday was 86,583, and it emerged that there were shortages of the chemical reagents required to conduct them. Dickson said it was recognised that everyone in government and the NHS was doing their best to combat the virus, but that the public\u2019s trust was at risk. \u201cIt really is better to under-promise and over-deliver,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The UK government handed a contract to feed more than a million pupils eligible for free school meals to a company which has been accused of \u201cwoeful\u201d preparation that left children going hungry and parents humiliated. The task, outsourced to French-owned Edenred under emergency powers without a competitive tendering process, involves distributing food vouchers valued at up to \u00a3234m, according to fresh disclosures. The contract runs for up to three months, indicating that the Department for Education expected the firm \u2013 which has fewer than 150 staff \u2013 to distribute the \u00a315-a-week vouchers to the 1.3 million children in England eligible for free school meals. Despite the fact that the vast scale of the challenge was indicated at the outset by the value of the contract, the scheme has been dogged by problems since it started in March. Parents of children who would usually receive free school meals, but are at home during the lockdown, are meant to be able to use vouchers provided by Edenred to buy food in shops. But the firm\u2019s website was initially overwhelmed, leaving desperate parents unable to log on and provoking fury among headteachers, who urged the government to intervene. An investigation by Schools Week last month found that some parents phoned schools in tears after being made to wait two weeks for vouchers. The site was upgraded over Easter but a report by the BBC this week found that parents were arriving at the tills only to be left \u201chumiliated\u201d when supermarkets wouldn\u2019t accept their vouchers. Edenred said 3.87m vouchers had been issued to 16,500 schools and that the scheme was now largely working well, with instances of vouchers not being accepted likely to be down to \u201chuman error\u201d. But multiple Twitter users are still complaining of being unable to access the vouchers, although the company said it does not resolve customer issues via Twitter. Companies House accounts show that Edenred\u2019s UK business has just 145 employees and revenues of \u00a311.8m. But Edenred said it rejected the notion that the business was too small to manage a \u00a3234m contract, adding that it had been the UK\u2019s largest provider of childcare vouchers. It said that its much larger French parent company, which reported revenues of \u00a31.4bn last year from managing employee benefit schemes such as luncheon vouchers, is supporting its UK subsidiary.

There are serious questions as to why the plug wasn\u2019t pulled after four weeks of abject failure and how much profit will be made on the back of this catastrophe.\u201d Edenred declined to comment on the commercial terms of the contract, which did not go through the usual competitive tendering process due to \u201cthe emergency situation caused by Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. Documents accompanying the contract cite \u201ca critical need to enable families the access to the free school meal replacement scheme\u201d. They add that \u201cstandard quality and price criteria are not applicable on this occasion\u201d. A spokesman for Edenred said: \u201cThe free school meal voucher scheme is helping hundreds of thousands of families every week and has put \u00a358m in eGift cards into the hands of people who need them.\u201d \u201cEdenred rejects entirely that the preparation for the scheme was woeful.

The foreign secretary\u2019s instructions had been clear. Make it plain that your prime function is to say you haven\u2019t a clue what\u2019s going to happen on Sunday \u2013 and even if you did, you couldn\u2019t tell \u2013 and take as long as you like to say as little of any interest as possible. Dom had eagerly accepted. After all, not knowing very much was his specialist subject.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f4aea0dd-e562-4291-8701-6fe26391d891\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What was Exercise Cygnus?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Exercise Cygnus was a government simulation of a flu pandemic, carried out to wargame the UK\u2019s pandemic preparedness. It was carried out in 2016 and involved 950 officials from central and local government, as well as emergency response planners, responding to an imaginary outbreak of \u201cswan flu\u201d. A report of the exercise was compiled the following year.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it involve?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taking place over three days in October, participants were asked to imagine a fictitious \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d flu pandemic, affecting up to 50% of the population and causing up to 400,000 excess deaths.</p>\n    <p>Officials were told to assume they were managing week 7 of the government\u2019s response. The objective of such simulations is to test how existing plans would hold up under strain, while acclimatising ministers and officials to the kind of decisions they would be forced to make.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it find?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The report warned that the government\u2019s flu plans, at least in 2016, were \u201ccurrently not sufficient\u201d to tackle a severe flu pandemic. Some organisations\u2019 plans were out of date and referred to cooperation with other bodies that no longer existed.</p>\n    <p>In other instances plans were in place, but were found to be lacking or required elaborating. Warnings were made about the inability of the social care sector to struggle with the serious pressure that a pandemic would cause.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What did it recommend?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Cygnus makes 26 recommendations to the department of health and other bodies. Among them were the suggestion that further modelling be done to understand the capacity of the care sector, the creation of a joint-level tactical plan to ensure different organisations could interact more effectively, and that more work needed to be done to understand how the public would respond to interventions by the government.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What does the government say?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The government has claimed to have implemented the recommendations of the Cygnus report in full. In an interview with LBC the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that after media reports of the simulation emerged, health officials assured him that its recommendations were followed. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the UK was among the countries of the world best prepared for a flu pandemic, and that the government tested its flu plans regularly.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At first it had all gone pretty much like clockwork.

The government moved to manage expectations about how far restrictions would be loosened next week, stressing it would exercise \u201cmaximum caution\u201d with easing any measures. There is rising tension between the UK and devolved governments, with the prime minister yet to share details of his lockdown plan with the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prompting devolved leaders to make pre-emptive announcements of their own (more below). The government also, unusually, did not formally extend the lockdown as required by law today.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Black men and women are four times more likely to die after contracting Covid-19 than white people,</strong> research from the ONS revealed. After taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still 1.9 times more likely to die with coronavirus than their white counterparts. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities are also significantly more likely to die. Social factors including living in overcrowded, multifamily or intergenerational households, relative deprivation, and working in public-facing occupations may help explain why this is the case for BAME people, but there is much to still be explained, the ONS report said.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Unemployment could double and the economy could shrink by 14%</strong> as the coronavirus causes the deepest recession in modern history, the Bank of England forecast. In a warning over the mounting damage to the economy since the onset of the pandemic and the lockdown measures to contain it, the Bank said GDP could plunge by 25% in the second quarter. It could take a year for the economy to return to normal and there were risks of long-term damage, it added.</li> \n   <li><strong>Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations \u201cmust be extended\u201d but Nicola Sturgeon will consider allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day </strong>if the scientific evidence permits, the Scottish government said. The first minister said she saw no case for relaxing the lockdown because the transmission rate was still too high.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The Welsh government said schools in Wales would not reopen on 1 June</strong>, regardless of what happens in England.</li> \n   <li><strong>Airports owned by MAG are to require passengers to cover faces and wear gloves and temperature screening trials are to begin in the coming weeks</strong>. The firm, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said people needed to be able to travel safely when the time is right.

But he said Boris Johnson would set out a \u201croadmap\u201d for the way forward on Sunday, containing \u201cappropriate measures to be taken at appropriate milestones, subject to very clear conditions\u201d. He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be detailed guidance to help inform, advise and reassure the public, businesses and other organisations. To get this right, we have set milestones. Some changes can confidently be introduced more quickly than others and some of those other ones will take longer to introduce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Raab downplayed suggestions any early changes would be far-reaching. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Any changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored.</p> \n   <p>If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren\u2019t following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Raab conceded that Scotland and Wales might not proceed at exactly the same pace as England.</strong> He said the four nations of the UK were cooperating closely. But he went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Even if different parts may move at slightly different speeds, the key thing is those decisions are made based on the science and the circumstances for each nation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that 30,615 people in the UK have now died from coronavirus, up 539 from yesterday\u2019s figure.</strong> This is the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. There will be thousands more who will have died from coronavirus without testing positive.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the reproduction number, R, was now between 0.5 and 0.9. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said Public Health England was looking at what interventions could \u201csensibly be made\u201d to protect frontline workers from BAME backgrounds.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about whether people told to quarantine because they have been notified by the government\u2019s contract-tracing app that they have been in contract with an infected person would be eligible for sick pay or other compensation.</strong> In response to the question, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think you\u2019re jumping the gun a little bit on the guidance.</p> \n   <p>They key thing is, I think, it\u2019ll be a liberating thing for people and the country as a whole, as it\u2019ll allow people who might have the symptoms to be clear that they don\u2019t have coronavirus and therefore not be subject to all of those restrictions.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019ll allow people to get out of the isolation measures earlier than otherwise would be the case.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He played down the prospects of passengers arriving in the UK being subject to temperature tests.</strong> \u201cThe evidence so far has always been that temperature tests are not a particularly effective way of proceeding,\u201d he said.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said up to a third of people with coronavirus do not have a temperature when the illness first hits.</strong> She said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A sizeable proportion, up to about a third of people, do not have a temperature at presentation.

shows.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Your probability of dying with Covid is made up of two things, firstly your probability of actually being infected in the first place and then secondly, your probability of dying once you have been infected.</p> \n   <p>Now those two things are influenced by your personal circumstances to a large degree, so the first thing we did is, we looked at adjusting for age, what the difference was of dying to these ethnic groups and that brought out some quite stark differences.</p> \n   <p>So just adjusting for age, we saw that the black ethnic grouping was just over four times more likely to die of Covid-related issues than the white group, the Bangladeshi and Pakistani grouping was about 3.5 times more likely and the Indian grouping about 2.5 times more likely.</p> \n   <p>Those figures are just when we adjust for age, but we know other circumstances matter, so we want to try and introduce those other circumstances, which we can do, because we have geographical location from the death certificate and the death registration.</p> \n   <p>So we know for example, big cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester have been more affected, we know from figures that we released last Friday that whether you\u2019re in an urban or rural area matters, your area\u2019s relative level of deprivation matters, so there\u2019s really a strong social gradient to mortality rates generally, and even more for Covid.</p> \n   <p>So we needed to adjust for those other factors as well, so geography is a key one and then other socio-economic factors, we could get data from the census records that we\u2019ve linked the deaths to, so things like people\u2019s qualifications, people\u2019s housing circumstances, what type of jobs or occupations they had and their self-reported health.</p> \n   <p>When we adjust for all those other things, then actually those rates come down significantly, a lot of the difference can be explained by these geographical and socio-economic factors.</p> \n   <p>Once we\u2019ve adjusted for that, the black ethnic group is now about 90% or 1.9 times more likely to die from Covid-related issues, Bangladeshi and Pakistani males are about 80% more likely, females about 60% more likely and Indian females are about 40% more likely and males about 30% more likely.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n

Therefore, the fully adjusted results show differences in risk between ethnic groups that are specific to those ethnic groups and are not caused by any of the factors listed on which members of the groups might differ.</p> \n   <p>Adjusting for these factors substantially reduces the odds of a death involving Covid-19 relative to those of white ethnicity for all ethnic groups.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But, even making allowance for all these factors, black people are still almost twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people.

Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital with a shout out to those who participated in the nationwide applause. The National Trust tweets a floral tribute. A tweet from Pentonville Prison in north London. The Premier League says thank you to NHS workers, social care workers and health workers across the world. The ritual applause, banging of kitchen utensils and the occasional firework is now in its seventh week as part of the Clap for Carers initiative. Thousands of people across the UK are preparing to unite again at 8pm to applaud NHS and key workers in the fight against coronavirus. Downing Street said the prime minister emphasised his commitment to collaborative working with the devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont and also insisted he had no intention of risking a fresh upsurge in Covid-19 infections by relaxing the lockdown too far or too soon. However, No 10 confirmed Boris Johnson was happy for the lockdown to be relaxed at different paces in different parts of the UK, after Nicola Sturgeon and the Welsh government said separately they would ease the lockdown at the best pace for their nations. A spokeswoman said: He reiterated his commitment to continuing our UK-wide approach to tackling coronavirus, even if different parts of the UK begin to move at slightly different speeds. Those decisions will be made based on the science for each nation. They all agreed that continued engagement between our administrations is vital and to remain in close contact in the days and weeks ahead. Boris Johnson will announce \u201cmodest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored\u201d changes to the lockdown at 7pm on Sunday, Dominic Raab said. The government moved to manage expectations about how far restrictions would be loosened next week, stressing it would exercise \u201cmaximum caution\u201d with easing any measures. There is rising tension between the UK and devolved governments, with the prime minister yet to share details of his lockdown plan with the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, prompting devolved leaders to make pre-emptive announcements of their own (more below). The government also, unusually, did not formally extend the lockdown as required by law today. Black men and women are four times more likely to die after contracting Covid-19 than white people, research from the ONS revealed. After taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still 1.9 times more likely to die with coronavirus than their white counterparts. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities are also significantly more likely to die. Social factors including living in overcrowded, multifamily or intergenerational households, relative deprivation, and working in public-facing occupations may help explain why this is the case for BAME people, but there is much to still be explained, the ONS report said. Unemployment could double and the economy could shrink by 14% as the coronavirus causes the deepest recession in modern history, the Bank of England forecast. In a warning over the mounting damage to the economy since the onset of the pandemic and the lockdown measures to contain it, the Bank said GDP could plunge by 25% in the second quarter. It could take a year for the economy to return to normal and there were risks of long-term damage, it added. Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations \u201cmust be extended\u201d but Nicola Sturgeon will consider allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day if the scientific evidence permits, the Scottish government said. The first minister said she saw no case for relaxing the lockdown because the transmission rate was still too high. The Welsh government said schools in Wales would not reopen on 1 June, regardless of what happens in England. Airports owned by MAG are to require passengers to cover faces and wear gloves and temperature screening trials are to begin in the coming weeks. The firm, which owns Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports, said people needed to be able to travel safely when the time is right. It followed a similar announcement from Heathrow yesterday. That\u2019s it from us on the UK side. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus coverage, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. Here are the main points from Dominic Raab\u2019s press conference: Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, said that any changes to the lockdown regime announced next week would be \u201cmodest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored\u201d. Speaking on the day when the government is legally obliged to review the lockdown (because it is three weeks since it was last extended), he said there was no change today in the rules. But he said Boris Johnson would set out a \u201croadmap\u201d for the way forward on Sunday, containing \u201cappropriate measures to be taken at appropriate milestones, subject to very clear conditions\u201d. He went on: There will be detailed guidance to help inform, advise and reassure the public, businesses and other organisations. To get this right, we have set milestones. Some changes can confidently be introduced more quickly than others and some of those other ones will take longer to introduce. Raab downplayed suggestions any early changes would be far-reaching. He said: Any changes in the short term will be modest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored. If we find in the future the R level goes back up or that people aren\u2019t following the rules, we must have the ability then to put back measures in place. Raab conceded that Scotland and Wales might not proceed at exactly the same pace as England. He said the four nations of the UK were cooperating closely. But he went on: Even if different parts may move at slightly different speeds, the key thing is those decisions are made based on the science and the circumstances for each nation. He said that 30,615 people in the UK have now died from coronavirus, up 539 from yesterday\u2019s figure. This is the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. There will be thousands more who will have died from coronavirus without testing positive. He said the reproduction number, R, was now between 0.5 and 0.9. He said Public Health England was looking at what interventions could \u201csensibly be made\u201d to protect frontline workers from BAME backgrounds. He sidestepped a question about whether people told to quarantine because they have been notified by the government\u2019s contract-tracing app that they have been in contract with an infected person would be eligible for sick pay or other compensation. In response to the question, he said: I think you\u2019re jumping the gun a little bit on the guidance. They key thing is, I think, it\u2019ll be a liberating thing for people and the country as a whole, as it\u2019ll allow people who might have the symptoms to be clear that they don\u2019t have coronavirus and therefore not be subject to all of those restrictions. It\u2019ll allow people to get out of the isolation measures earlier than otherwise would be the case. He played down the prospects of passengers arriving in the UK being subject to temperature tests. \u201cThe evidence so far has always been that temperature tests are not a particularly effective way of proceeding,\u201d he said. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said up to a third of people with coronavirus do not have a temperature when the illness first hits. She said: A sizeable proportion, up to about a third of people, do not have a temperature at presentation. They may have it variably through the illness or they don\u2019t have it. Q: Are you considering testing relatives who want to visit someone in a care home? Raab says there is no silver bullet here. The government is confident it now has enough information, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over, more quickly than usual. Diamond says all the data he has seen shows the importance of social distancing. He says he thinks it will be essential to maintain that in coming weeks. Q: What is the latest thinking on the impact of summer weather on coronavirus? Harries says we are seeing epidemics in warm and cold climates. So there probably is not much effect, she says. Q: People who download the contract-tracing app could be told they have to go into quarantine over and over again. Will they get sick pay? (ITV\u2019s Robert Peston wrote about this in a blog here.) Raab says the app should be liberating for people. Raab says the biggest challenge with care homes is the ebb and flow of people out of them. But at least that is something that can be controlled, he says. Q: Are you going to introduce temperature testing? Harries says temperature testing in places like a restaurant may serve a reassurance value. But she says if the incubation period could be up to 14 days, and if the thermometer is not reliable, this may be of limited value. She says about a third of people with coronavirus do not have a temperature when the illness first takes effect. Q: Prof Edmunds told the science committee earlier there could be 20,000 new cases a day. What is your estimate? Diamond says the UK has some very good experts like Edmunds. He says better data is going to become available. But he says he is \u201cvery happy\u201d with the numbers given by Edmunds. Q: Are you worried about R going up? (See 3.15pm.) Diamond says Edmunds was probably right to say R has gone up. That is because of the epidemic in care homes. But R is only relevant if you consider prevalence too. He repeats the point he made to the science committee earlier. (See 3.23pm.) Q: Yesterday the PM indicated that the rules would change on Monday. But you are saying there has been no change. So can people sunbathe on Monday, but not on Sunday? Raab says any changes will be based on what the evidence says. He says any changes will be \u201cmodest, small, incremental and very carefully monitored\u201d. And the government must have the option of reversing any changes if necessary, he says. Q: Will you take steps to protect BAME workers in frontline jobs? Raab says the government is looking very carefully at why BAME people are more at risk. When it gets those findings, it will consider what action to take. The government dashboard with the daily death figures has now just been updated with today\u2019s figures. Raab says the CQC figures show the number of deaths in care homes going down. But there is still a lot of work to do on this, he says. Q: Can you confirm you are renewing the lockdown restrictions. They have to be reviewed today. And Nicola Sturgeon says it could be catastrophic moving from the \u2018stay home\u2019 message. Is that safe? Raab says there is no change today in the rules. But the PM will set out a roadmap on Sunday. He says the PM spoke to Sturgeon today, and the PM set out his determination to maintain a four-nations approach, even if some countries move forward at slightly different speeds. Q: How does R vary regionally? Diamond says it varies a bit, and would be lowest in London. Harries is now presenting the daily slides. She says all regions are now showing a decline in the number of hospital coronavirus cases. And here are is the latest global death comparison. Boris Johnson did not share any details of his plans for easing the lockdown with Nicola Sturgeon or other devolved government leaders in a phone call which ended a short while ago, Sturgeon\u2019s office has said. In a brief statement issued after the call, the first minister\u2019s spokesman said she told the prime minister the only easing she planned was to relax the rules on daily exercise, which are limited in Scotland to one one-hour outing a day. However, a further call between the governments was expected before Sunday, when Johnson is due to give a speech on his proposals to begin relaxing the lockdown. Sturgeon\u2019s spokesman said: The first minister reiterated to the prime minister that the lockdown regulations in Scotland would remain in place and that the only issue under consideration at this time was in relation to outdoor exercise. The first minister also made clear that the \u2018stay at home\u2019 message remained crucial. While no specific detail of the plans under consideration by the UK government was shared, the prime minister confirmed that there would be further discussion ahead of a meeting of Cobra on Sunday. Raab confirms that the PM will set out a \u201croadmap\u201d on Sunday for moving forward, with conditions for reaching each milestone. Raab says 86,583 tests were carried out yesterday. That is an increase on yesterday, but it means the government has missed the 100,000 tests per day target for a fifth day in a row. He says 30,615 people have now died. That means there have been an extra 539 deaths, according to the official count (which only covers people who have died and tested positive for coronavirus \u2013 others will have died from it without testing positive). He also says the reproduction number, R, is now between 0.5 and 0.9. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, has just arrived for the press conference. He is with Sir Ian Diamond, the national statistician, and Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. Jeremy Hunt, who was the health secretary at the time that Exercise Cygnus was carried out and the report completed, has previously said he believed the report should be published. He told the Guardian that he had agreed with its recommendations and had fought within the government for an expansion of both the NHS and social care budgets but was not successful in securing extra money for the care sector. He said: All the recommendations made by officials to ministers were approved, largely around the need to prepare emergency legislation which we have now put into law. I very much agreed (then and now) with the need to expand the capacity of both the NHS and social care system, which is why I fought for big increases in both their budgets although in office was only able to secure the first part of that, which was the additional \u00a320bn annual increase for the NHS. The royal family have praised \u201call of the journalists and broadcasters working to keep us informed\u201d during the coronavirus crisis. The message closely follows an appeal from the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, on Wednesday calling on the public to buy a newspaper to support the media. At the daily press briefing, Jenrick said much of the frontline effort in the fight against coronavirus \u201cis being coordinated in our own communities\u201d, adding: A free country needs a free press and the national, the regional and the local newspapers of our country are under significant financial pressure. It sounds as if opposition party leaders at Westminster got exactly the same line from the PM as the cabinet (see 1.36pm) when he spoke to them at lunchtime. Commenting on the talks, a No 10 spokesman said: The prime minister \u2026 told them the government would approach the next phase with \u2018maximum caution\u2019 and his priority above all else would be to save lives. He committed to speaking to them again soon and to make a statement to the House of Commons on Monday. Boris Johnson has posted this on Twitter. It\u2019s a direct quote from the speech he gave outside No 10 on Monday last week (the El Alamein one). It will be seen as yet more evidence that Downing Street is trying to contain expectations for next week. (See 1.36pm.) Peter MacMahon, from ITV Border, thinks the PM may also be seeking to reduce tensions with the Scottish government. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in jails in England and Wales continues to rise slowly, the latest update from the Ministry of Justice shows, as the first official report on post-lockdown prison life was published. As of 5pm on Wednesday there were 390 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in prisoners across 74 prisons, a 1% rise in 24 hours, while the number of infected prison staff rose 3% to 447 workers in the same period. At least 19 prisoners and six prison staff have contracted Covid-19 and died. There are 80,800 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons, and around 33,000 prison staff in public-sector prisons. Prisons are currently operating on a restricted regime. HM Inspectorate of Prisons published its first scrutiny report on Thursday on the function of prisons during the crisis, looking at three young offender institutions (YOI). The report was broadly positive but found inconsistencies in the restrictive regime across the jails, with one of the YOIs \u2013 Cookham Wood in Kent \u2013 releasing teenage inmates from cells for just 40 minutes a day. A charity for people with learning and cognitive disabilities such as autism has released a \u201cstatement of rights\u201d for people to show police on their mobile phones if they are questioned for potentially breaching the lockdown. Enable Scotland said the statement, which has been designed in consultation with Police Scotland to be downloaded on to phones, followed complaints that many people with autism and learning disabilities found the rules very stressful. Guidance in Scotland states people should leave home only for exercise, once a day and for an hour, and should stay close to home. For some people those restrictions have caused distress and ill-health, Enable Scotland said, because leaving home several times a day is part of their normal routines and coping strategies. It said these people feared being stopped and challenged by the police. The latest Police Scotland data showed that by 24 April the force had stopped nearly 8,000 people for breaching the lockdown. Nicole Forsyth, Enable Scotland\u2019s delivery manager, said: It became clear from our regular phone calls and Zoom catchups with members that a major source of anxiety for many of them is the fear of being challenged by police officers when out exercising. So our members suggested this handy smartphone image, and it means our members will feel more secure and comfortable about going outside to exercise \u2013 which not only helps them stay healthy physically, but is also really important for their mental health at what is an especially challenging time for everyone. The EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has claimed the British team negotiating with Brussels on the future trade and security relationship plans to blame the economic costs of a no-deal result at the end of the year on the coronavirus pandemic. Hogan, a former Irish minister, told the Irish national broadcaster RT\u00c9: I think that the United Kingdom politicians and government have certainly decided that Covid is going to be blamed for all the fallout from Brexit and my perception of it is they don\u2019t want to drag the negotiations out into 2021 because they can effectively blame Covid for everything. He also claimed the British government did not want the talks to succeed. He said: There is no real sign that our British friends are approaching the negotiations with a plan to succeed. I hope I am wrong, but I don\u2019t think so. As reported earlier, Downing Street rejected this claim. (See 2.02pm.) Hogan\u2019s analysis is quite similar to Rafael Behr\u2019s in his Guardian column today. Essential personal protective equipment worth \u00a3166,000 has been stolen from a warehouse in Greater Manchester, police have said. Officers were called to the Trafalgar business park in Salford following reports that a large amount of PPE had been taken. Last month Greater Manchester police launched an investigation after a masked thief ransacked an NHS office and stole PPE as well as number of laptops and petty cash. The raid took place at the offices of the Care Homes Medical Practice in Windsor Street, Salford, which cares for patients living in nursing and residential homes. The British public has already started to venture out and about more, despite lockdown measures not yet being relaxed, researchers have found. The analysis, by researchers at University College London, is based on data from the company Huq Industries, which collected anonymised data via an app on where people are using their phones, giving a sense of how many people are passing through an area across a given hour. This was summed together to gauge activity levels across a day and then a week. Overall, looking across Greater London, Liverpool, Greater Manchester, Greater Glasgow, south Hampshire and the West Midlands, the team found activity levels were 50% lower on average between 13-19 April compared with levels during 9-15 March, shortly before strong physical distancing began. However, by early May levels had risen, and they are now back at 60% of the level before 16 March. When the team looked at areas with different characteristics, for example zones known to be financial hubs or shopping areas, they further found that activity levels were higher in areas linked to jobs such as construction and domestic work than those associated with activities including tourism or finance. The team said this could shed light on which jobs can be done from home and which cannot. Prof James Cheshire, a co-author of the study and deputy director of the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre, said: Our analysis suggests that people have been adhering to the lockdown rules and taking them very seriously over the first month or so. But by early May we\u2019ve started to see a shift, with more activity in recent days. It may be that people have started to increase their movements in anticipation of the government announcement expected this weekend for easing lockdown. Schools in Wales will not reopen on 1 June, regardless of decisions in England, the Welsh government announced this afternoon. Kirtsy Williams, the Welsh education minister, said that \u201cthe situation in Wales will not change\u201d on 1 June, in a statement designed to curtail speculation ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on Sunday on when schools in England will be ending their lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said this week that schools in Scotland may not return until the end of summer. The health department in Northern Ireland has released its latest coronavirus death figures. There have been four new coronavirus deaths, taking the total to 422. The full details are here. Labour has called on Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, and other ministers and former ministers to explain \u201cwhat they knew and why they didn\u2019t fix the problems that were so clearly identified\u201d in a secret government report from 2017 that warned about problems with the UK\u2019s flu pandemic preparedness. Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, highlighted the warning in the Exercise Cygnus report, revealed today by the Guardian, about care homes\u2019 lack of readiness to accept large numbers of patients discharged from hospital. She said the plan to protect the NHS relied on removing thousands of people from hospitals into care homes and without mandatory testing, and \u201ccare homes have struggled to cope mainly because they can\u2019t effectively isolate them\u201d. Kendall said: [The report] specifically highlighted problems with social care, the lack of planning and the inability of social care to cope with huge numbers of people being discharged from hospital. There was a lack of a plan and a lack of ability to cope. Ministers have to say what they knew and why they didn\u2019t fix these problems that were so clearly identified and why the front line care providers weren\u2019t involved [in planning]. Covid-19 has spread rapidly in care homes, killing 6,686 people up to 1 May in England and Wales, and deaths in care homes now account for a third of all virus fatalities. Newsnight\u2019s James Clayton has a useful Twitter thread on why the government is finding it so hard to meet the daily testing figure it claimed to meet at the end of last week. It starts here: At the start of the science committee hearing, Sir Ian Diamond, the UK\u2019s national statistician, announced that the ONS would start publishing data next week showing what the incidence of coronavirus is in the population. Current coronavirus figures are based on the number of people who test positive. The ONS is trying to get a more representative figure, based on sampling (a bit like an opinion poll). He also said the indirect health impacts of the crisis could persist for a very long time. And he said the epidemic in care homes would not go away soon. Sir Ian Diamond, the UK\u2019s national statistician, is also giving evidence to the Commons science committee. Referring to what Prof John Edmunds said about the R number (see 3.15pm), Diamond said it was important to understand that the R number on its own was not all that matters. Prevalence mattered too, he said. He explained: An R of 1 effectively means you are flat-lining. So you can imagine a situation where the prevalence was, shall we say, 0.401 of the population - ie, a very, very tiny prevalence - but if it were staying there over time, then R would be 1. That\u2019s actually not a bad place to be in ... R is incredibly important. But you also need to see it in context. Prof John Edmunds, who is head of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has just started giving evidence to the Commons science committee. He is a member of Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and his team has provided some of the modelling considered by Sage as it advises the government. Asked for his current estimate of R, the reproduction number (the rate at which people are getting infected), he told the committee he thought it was between 0.75 and 1. He said two weeks ago he would have given a different figure, between 0.6 and 0.8. He said this was because the nature of the spread had changed. He said that there was much less community transmission now. Coronavirus was not spreading widely in the community now, he said. But he said it was still spreading in closed settings such as hospitals, which explained why the latest number was higher. UPDATE: See 3.23pm for some helpful context to this. The Foreign Office has announced five more rescue flights for British nationals still stranded in India, seven weeks after lockdown. Dominic Raab was heavily criticised for not laying on the flights earlier. The charter planes from Amritsar and Ahmedabad next week bring the total flights from the country to 64, transporting 16,500 people home, said the minister for south Asia, Tariq Ahmad. The government has pushed to delay the legal challenge to its lockdown legislation by a millionaire businessman, asking for an extension to the deadline for a response. It wrote to the Jota Aviation owner Simon Dolan to ask for another week to respond to the \u201cletter before legal action\u201d, but his lawyer has given the government until Tuesday on the grounds of the urgent public interest. Dolan\u2019s lawyers have argued the lockdown was imposed ultra vires - outside the legal authority - because it implemented regulations under the Public Health Act 1984 instead of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 or the emergency Coronavirus Act 2020. They have also argued that the legal test that must be passed at every stage of lockdown review is faulty because it is based on one set of metrics, Covid-19 data, and not wider health outcomes from cancelled cancer and other life-saving treatments or economic data. His lawyers say they have hired the human rights lawyer Philip Havers QC, a barrister and deputy high court judge, to press the case. NHS England has announced another 383 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 22,432. The full details are here (pdf). Of the 383 new deaths announced today, 58 occurred on 6 May, 120 occurred on 5 May and 29 occurred on 4 May. The figures also show 29 of the new deaths took place on 1-3 May, 131 took place in April, and the remaining 16 deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 19 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for patients to be confirmed as having tested positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data to be validated. Britain\u2019s medicines regulator has issued a warning about medicines and other products being sold online that are claimed to treat or prevent Covid-19, saying they may pose a threat to life. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said it had been receiving reports of \u201cmiracle cures\u201d, \u201cantiviral misting sprays\u201d and antiviral medicines being sold through websites by British users of Facebook and Amazon as a treatment for the virus. Colloidal silver, which can lead to skin turning a light bluish-grey and has been touted in the past by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Debbie McGee, has been the target of action by the US authorities. However, it continues to be sold below the radar in the UK on Amazon and Facebook Marketplace. One Facebook seller in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, claimed the \u201cCrystal Silver\u201d being sold would act against flu and coronavirus. Lynda Scammell, a senior enforcement advisor at the MHRA, said: We cannot guarantee the safety or quality of these products and this poses a risk to your health. The UK sales of colloidal silver were flagged up by a new grouping, Youth Against Misinformation, which is supported by youth organisation Restless Development and the anti-hate organisation Center for Countering Digital Hate. One of the members of the new group, Sara, said: My dad is still working as a bus driver at TfL and I have elderly grandparents who have underlying health issues, so my family and I understand first-hand the distress and anxiety that misinformation can cause. I want to be part of this project as it will bring more peace and truth to worrying families and friends during this stressful and intense time. A further 18 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths there to 1,062. Public Health Wales said a further 87 people had tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 10,851. Dr Robin Howe, from Public Health Wales, reminded the public to stay at home over the bank holiday weekend: With the upcoming May Day bank holiday, Public Health Wales reminds the public to continue to adhere to Welsh government\u2019s restrictions on non-essential travel, caravan and campsites, hotels, B&amp;Bs and holiday accommodations, as well as the limited access to our national parks. We also remind owners of second homes in Wales to act responsibly and to avoid travelling to these homes until restrictions have been lifted. As reported earlier, No 10 seems concerned that what Boris Johnson says on Sunday night about the lifting of the lockdown will not match the expectations generated by some of today\u2019s front-page headlines. (See 1.36pm.) Here are some examples: We\u2019ve already posted the main line from the Downing Street lobby briefing. (See 1.36pm.) Here is a summary of all the lines that emerged. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman claimed that the 100,000 tests per day target had been a success even though it has not been met for four days in a row. He said the target \u201cserved a very significant purpose in increasing capacity\u201d. The spokesman said the PM stood by the four-nation approach to coronavirus measures. He said: Throughout we have said we would take a four-nation approach and we believe that provides the best way forward. The four nations entered the restrictions at the same time and should, where it makes sense, exit the restrictions at the same time. We agree that the only circumstances where there should be divergence is when there is evidence that supports it. The spokesman did not challenge what Nicola Sturgeon said at her press conference this lunchtime, about there being no case for relaxing the lockdown on Monday (see 12.50pm), although he did not respond to her words in detail. He said Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, would speak on this at the press conference at 5pm. The other people at the press conference will be Sir Ian Diamond, chief statistician at the ONS, and Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. The spokesman did not deny reports saying sunbathing and picnicking will be among the first activities to be allowed as the lockdown starts to get lifted. Asked about these reports, he did not say they were wrong, and he reminded reporters that Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has said the risk of transmission is much lower outdoors. Asked if the government was telling people not to sunbathe this weekend, the spokesman declined to say that was the message. But he did say people should continue to observe social distancing. The spokesman said the government planned to publish the conclusions of its study into why coronavirus is more deadly for different groups of people at the end of this month. Asked for a response to today\u2019s ONS report about coronavirus and ethnicity, the spokesman said: We\u2019re aware that this virus has sadly appeared to have a disproportionate effect on people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. It is critical that we find out which groups are most at risk so that we can take the right steps to protect them and minimise their risk. We are commissioning Public Health England to better understand the different factors such as ethnicity that may influence the effect of the virus. The spokesman said the research was being led Prof Kevin Fenton, the London regional director of Public Health England. The spokesman rejected a claim from the European commission that the UK does not want the trade talks with the EU to succeed. The EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, told RTE today: Despite the urgency and enormity of the negotiating challenge, I am afraid we are only making very slow progress in the Brexit negotiations. There is no real sign that our British friends are approaching the negotiations with a plan to succeed. I hope I am wrong, but I don\u2019t think so. The spokesman said the UK did want a deal, but this would only happen if the EU dropped its unreasonable demands. He said the EU was insisting on level playing field provisions that were not in other EU free trade deals with independent nations. The spokesman said that the government was trying to get a Turkish supplier to provide adequate replacements for a consignment of PPE gowns that have turned out to be sub-standard. As Sky reports, 400,000 gowns flown in from Turkey are not being used because their quality is too poor. The spokesman said the government had paid a deposit for them. He said it was in discussion with the supplier about getting proper replacements. If not, it would seek a refund, he said. The spokesman confirmed that Johnson will give a speech at 7pm on Sunday announcing the steps that will be taken to ease the lockdown. It is also expected that Johnson will chair a cabinet meeting earlier that day. But it seems likely that Johnson will not publish the document setting out details of the government\u2019s plans until Monday, when he will make a statement to the House of Commons. The spokesman said the government had not yet abandoned its \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan. That advice still applies, the spokesman said. But he would not confirm that it would be dropped on Sunday, as has been widely reported. See, for example, the Telegraph\u2019s splash. The spokesman said claims that the government has already announced that the lockdown will be extended for at least three weeks \u2013 circulating on social media this morning (see below) \u2013 were based on an Instagram advert from the last time the lockdown was extended. Johnson has been speaking to the Westminster leaders of the opposition parties this lunchtime, the spokesman said. Johnson will be doing Clap for Carers tonight, the spokesman said. But he told reporters not to expect the PM\u2019s new baby to be on display while the PM is clapping. Notting Hill carnival has been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, the event\u2019s board has announced. For the first time in more than 50 years, the August bank holiday event on the streets of west London will not take place, but the board said they were working on holding a celebration in an alternative form on the same weekend. It is the latest in a string of summer calendar events to have been postponed as a result of Covid-19, including Glastonbury and the Tokyo Olympics. In a statement on Twitter, Notting Hill carnival said cancelling the event was \u201cthe only safe option\u201d and \u201ceveryone\u2019s health has to come first\u201d. They added: We also have no wish to place extra strain on our colleagues St John Ambulance and the NHS. We, of course, work very closely with them for carnival and want to take this opportunity to express our utmost respect, admiration and gratitude for their work. We look forward to welcoming you back to the streets of Notting Hill in 2021. Last year more than a million people were expected to attend the festival, which has been held since 1966. The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has emphasised the importance of a cross-UK consensus on leaving lockdown and called on Boris Johnson to involve the devolved nations and opposition parties in \u201cmeaningful\u201d discussion. Having different approaches and rival strategies isn\u2019t going to help. I\u2019m not talking about [more cautious nations having] a veto but my strong preference is that the whole of the UK move as as one on this. Speaking to Scottish lobby reporters as he took part in a series of Zoom events with \u201cnot just the party faithful\u201d, he said: It is really important in Scotland and across the UK that we are cautious about this, that nothing is done that might push the infection rate above one. There is a strong preference on my part that this is done across the UK as a whole. That\u2019s the approach we took going into lockdown, that\u2019s the approach we should be taking coming out. Asked about Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s warning at her own media briefing this lunchtime that it would be a \u201cpotentially catastrophic mistake\u201d to move too quickly (see 12.50pm.), Starmer said: The danger if we don\u2019t act together is that there are then different rules for different places, that makes it much more difficult to police,\u201d adding that it was \u201cvery hard to see how you could have separate regimes in different countries or regions. It is very important that we build a national consensus about what happens next ... It does mean that the prime minister has got to involve the devolved nations, trade unions civic society and opposition parties in a very meaningful way. Six weeks into the UK\u2019s Covid-19 crisis, the latest instalment of Anywhere but Westminster asks how a city keeps going when everything has ground to a halt. The team virtually visits Plymouth, population 250,000, to see how the services that are vital to a city and its inhabitants are scrabbling to stay afloat. The fishing industry is in meltdown, temporary housing is oversubscribed and nurses facilitate goodbyes over Zoom. Most of all, people are asking: what on earth happens after this? You can catch up on previous episodes in the series here. Speculation about how the lockdown in England might be lifted risks sending \u201cmixed messages\u201d across the UK, the Welsh government has said. The Welsh cabinet met this morning to discuss the lockdown restrictions and will meet again this evening. It has not given details of its next steps but said the message for this weekend remained the same \u2013 people should stay at home. In a statement it said: It is crucially important that the people of Wales are informed clearly and accurately about what, if any, changes are made to the current stay-at-home restrictions. Some of the reporting in today\u2019s newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK. The first minister of Wales [Mark Drakeford] will announce the outcome of the cabinet\u2019s decision in due course. Our message for this bank holiday remains, stay home, protect the NHS, save lives. The daily Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here is what is probably the top line. Boris Johnson has told his cabinet that the government will adopt \u201cmaximum caution\u201d as it moves to ease the lockdown. Johnson chaired a cabinet meeting this morning and, according to the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, Johnson told his ministers: We are not going to do anything that risks a second peak. We will advance with maximum caution in order to protect the NHS and to save lives. We will be guided at every step by the science and the data and we will closely track the impact of any easing of the social distancing measures and and will not hesitate to tighten the rules if required. Some newspapers this morning splashed on stories suggesting that a major shift away from lockdown will start on Monday. Here\u2019s one example. No 10 seems worried about the expectations raised by some of these stories, because the spokesman made a point of stressing that anything happening next week would be \u201cvery limited\u201d. He told reporters: You all need to be very clear: any easement to the guidelines next week will be very limited. We are at a critical moment in the fight against the virus and we will not do anything which risks throwing away the effort and sacrifices of the British public. I will post more from the briefing shortly. This is from Heidi Alexander, the deputy mayor of London for transport and deputy chair of TfL. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, announced the London Streetspace plan yesterday. The initiative will create new cycle lanes and wider pavements to accommodate increased demand for walking and cycling, and to enable members of the public to maintain physical distancing. Similar measures are to be implemented in Greater Manchester in the next few weeks. The former Labour leader Gordon Brown and Prof Hugh Pennington, one of Scotland\u2019s leading microbiologists who has advised both the UK and Scottish governments, are calling for mass testing \u201cto become the new normal\u201d. Launching a new paper from Our Scottish Futures thinktank, they said it was now clear that mass testing across the community was the only way to give people the confidence to return to work, but the Scottish government\u2019s testing target for 15,500 tests a day by the end of May is \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d. Brown said: A maximum of 8,000 tests now and 15,500 by the end of the month is simply not good enough when we have 162,500 NHS staff, more than 130,000 adult social care workers, 170,000 construction workers, 100,000 frontline public servants from police and fire to teachers and 137,000 retail workers. Even on the Scottish government\u2019s most optimistic plan - 15,500 tested by the end of the month - we would be covering only 0.3% of the people. He added that it was \u201ca scandal and a tragedy\u201d that care home residents and workers were not being tested as a matter of routine. Reactive testing - when the disease breaks out - is not good enough when people can carry the disease for days and infect others without showing symptoms. A secret government report that said the UK was not prepared for a pandemic and forewarned of the Covid-19 crisis in care homes has been published in full by the Guardian. The 2017 report is based on the findings of a government simulation of an influenza pandemic, codenamed Exercise Cygnus. It concluded starkly that Britain was not adequately prepared for a flu-like pandemic\u2019s \u201cextreme demands\u201d. It is likely to raise questions over whether ministers ever implemented key recommendations pertaining to the care home sector, which has been beset by shortages of PPE to protect staff and vulnerable residents. At least 6,686 people have died in care homes in England and Wales \u2013 in some cases single facilities have reported dozens of fatalities. The report contained 26 key recommendations, including boosting the capacity of care homes and the numbers of staff available to work in them. It also warned of the challenge facing homes asked to take in patients from hospitals. Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed she sees no case for relaxing Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown regulations on Monday because she believes the country\u2019s coronavirus transmission rate is still worryingly high. The first minister said she had just been told Boris Johnson planned a teleconference with her and the Welsh and Northern Irish governments this afternoon to discuss his proposals to ease the lockdown in England. She revealed she could agree to relax restrictions on the number of outdoor exercises people were allowed to take, currently limited to one hour outside per day, but only if the scientific evidence justified it. The Guardian disclosed yesterday the Scottish and Welsh governments were unhappy at the prime minister\u2019s plan to relax the lockdown without consulting the three devolved governments. She disclosed that the numbers in Scottish hospitals with Covid-19 had fallen again, with 45 fewer people in hospital overall, leaving a total of 1,587, and the numbers in intensive care down by three, to 86. There were 59 deaths recorded yesterday, taking the total to 1,762. Sturgeon said the data was welcome, but she feared the Scottish transmission rate was still nearer 1, much higher than was safe for wholesale easing of the restrictions. She said it could be a \u201cpotentially catastrophic mistake\u201d to do too soon. Hundreds of items of PPE have been donated to a hospital in memory of a woman who died after contracting coronavirus. Patricia Hughes, 73, was a stalwart of the Morriston Hospital League of Friends and helped raise \u00a32.5m to support care for patients and their families there. She died last month following serious ongoing health problems, and with Covid-19. Colleagues of her husband John, 77, at Tata Steel in Port Talbot have now donated hundreds of items of certified PPE in tribute. His line manager, Mike King, personally delivered 200 face visors and 100 face masks for staff on the frontline at the Swansea hospital. King said: We thought about sending flowers. But then we thought it\u2019d mean more if we gave something which will be useful to the staff who Trish valued so highly and worked so hard to help over the years. When deciding who to ease lockdown measures, the government needs to know what the likely impact of relaxing each measure is going to have on the rate of infection. Scientists from the University of East Anglia have been looking at this issue and they have concluded that the two safest policies would be lifting stay-at-home orders and letting shops open that are selling non-essential goods. The UEA press release goes on: [Researchers] found that closing schools, prohibiting mass gatherings and the closure of some non-essential business, particularly in the hospitality sector, were the most effective at stopping the spread of the disease. Enforcing the wearing of face masks in public was not found to make additional impact. The press notice is here, and the full academic paper, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, is here (pdf). The research is based on the impact of various social distancing measures in 30 different countries. Passengers travelling through Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports will be required to cover their faces and wear gloves from Thursday, owner Manchester Airports Group (MAG) has announced. All airport staff serving passengers will wear gloves and face masks, and temperature screening trials will take place over the next few weeks. The airports are also considering requiring passengers to make a health declaration before they are allowed to enter. The firm said the move was designed to ensure that the small number of passengers currently making essential journeys through its airports feel safer and more confident about flying, as well as providing a further level of protection to colleagues working at the airport. The MAG chief executive, Charlie Cornish, said: It\u2019s clear that social distancing will not work on any form of public transport. But we\u2019re confident that when the time is right, people will be able to travel safely. We now need to work urgently with government to agree how we operate in the future. This has to be a top priority so that people can be confident about flying, and to get tourism and travel going again. At MAG we\u2019ve taken expert medical advice on how people can travel safely, and we\u2019re pleased to be piloting these new measures at our airports for those passengers who do still need to travel. We expect to be able to agree a new framework by the end of May that will support a restart of the industry as soon as possible. Yesterday, Heathrow, the UK\u2019s busiest airport, announced it will soon begin temperature screening of arriving passengers. From the BBC\u2019s political editor Laura Kuenssberg Anas Sarwar, a Scottish Labour MSP, has urged the Scottish government to carry out urgent research into the ONS findings that in England and Wales the risk of dying with Covid-19 is significantly higher amongst BAME communities. Sarwar, whose father, Mohammad Sarwar, was the UK\u2019s first Muslim MP, said: These stark findings will cause considerable alarm in ethnic minority communities across the UK. Given the data from England and Wales, it\u2019s now imperative for the Scottish government to record, study and publish the coronavirus impact on Scotland\u2019s BAME community. While Scotland\u2019s BAME population may be smaller than in England, ethnic minorities make up a large proportion of those on the frontline in Scotland \u2013 in our NHS, care homes and shops. We know that a huge number of deaths in the medical profession involve ethnic minority workers. Scotland\u2019s ethnic minority communities deserve to know whether they are at a greater risk from Covid-19 and, if so, what steps can be taken to prevent further loss of life. There are many reasons for thinking that the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis has been, as policy types might put it, \u201csub-optimal\u201d. But there is no evidence that this is having any impact (yet?) on the government\u2019s standing with the electorate. YouGov has published its latest poll this morning and it shows the Conservatives on 50%, ahead of Labour on 30%. Ethnic minorities\u2019 war and postwar efforts and sacrifices were erased from the national narrative. Today, as our doctors and nurses give their lives, we cannot have a repeat \u2013 their stories must be central to how we reshape Britain\u2019s shared future and identity, writes Guardian columnist Afua Hirsch. It\u2019s beyond ironic that black and Asian people in Britain underpinned the creation of the institutions that so often define Britishness, not least the NHS. Yet that same postwar era also laid the foundations for the inadequate access to healthcare, housing and secure labour that must be part of the reason why minorities are so disproportionately affected by today\u2019s coronavirus crisis. And we now witness the remarkable full circle of Britain recruiting foreigners to carry out essential work, whether in agriculture or the NHS. It\u2019s just like the last time \u2013 when Enoch Powell was among the first to ask Caribbean nurses to come and work in the NHS before turning to race hate. But this time it\u2019s taking place quietly, so we can continue the national pastime of deluding ourselves that Britain can survive without immigrants, while our very survival depends on their labour. The difference between this moment and the social contract of 75 years ago, is that this time the service and sacrifice of ethnic minority people in Britain is impossible to ignore. It\u2019s clear that racial injustice deserves a central place in our new settlement. Bob Seely, the MP for the Isle of Wight, has just told Sky News that around 30% of people living on the island have already downloaded the government\u2019s contact-tracing app, which is being piloted there. He said that was a remarkable take-up given that ordinary residents are only being invited to download it from today. Earlier in the week key workers were asked to sign up. But Seely said people started downloading it anyway. Alongside its main report on coronavirus deaths and ethnicity (see 9.41am and 10.33am), the ONS has also published what it calls a technical appendix, explaining in detail how social factors help to explain why BAME people are more at risk of coronavirus deaths. It gets quite technical, but it is worth reading if you want to understand this in more detail. Here is an extract. Another indicator of social disadvantage is living in an overcrowded household (defined as having fewer bedrooms than needed to avoid undesirable sharing). Analysis of the English Housing Survey showed that between 2014 and 2017, around 679,000 (3%) of the estimated 23 million households in England were overcrowded; however, there were marked contrasts between ethnic groups. While only 2% of White British households experienced overcrowding, it was 30% of Bangladeshi households (the highest percentage), 16% of Pakistani households and 12% of black households. There is also a contrast in the propensity to live in a multi-family household. An unpublished analyses of Labour Force Survey data showed that in 2018, those with a Bangladeshi and Pakistani ethnicity were much more likely than any other ethnic group to live in a multi-family household ... Occupations involving close contact with the public are deemed to be a risk factor for Covid-19 infection. Figure 1 shows how ethnicities are distributed when working in occupations classified to the transport and drivers and operatives standard occupational classification sub-major group, which encompasses bus, coach and taxi drivers and those driving other types of industrial and agricultural vehicles. And this is figure 1, showing that more than 10% of Bangladeshi and Pakistani people work as bus or taxi drivers, or in similar transport jobs - a far higher proportion than for other ethnic groups. Sir Harry Burns, Scotland\u2019s former chief medical officer, has warned against relaxing the lockdown until the community rate of transmission for the coronavirus, known as R, has fallen below 0.5. Burns, who advised Scottish ministers during the swine flu pandemic in 2009, told MSPs on the Scottish parliament\u2019s new Covid-19 committee he had been told the R rate in Scotland was about 0.7 and said he feared it would rise once the lockdown was eased. Boris Johnson is expected to announce modest relaxations from next Monday in a statement on Sunday night, including allowing family picnics, more outdoor exercise and potentially authorising outdoor cafes to reopen. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is resisting a relaxation too early, and has said Scotland\u2019s R rate may be slightly higher than in England. Burns told the committee: I would expect [the R number] to go up when we ease lockdown because people will be getting together, unless we have a very effective trace and isolation and approach. I would probably like it to be a bit less than .7 because it\u2019s going to oscillate a bit and it will go up. It would be nice for it to be below .5 but that might be asking a bit much. He said some people were at increased risk of being infected, particularly people who lived in crowded high rises and used shared lifts. Wealthier people in the suburbs with private gardens will be less exposed. That meant the R rate would be higher in crowded urban areas. Burns added that he was also \u201cleery\u201d about lifting the lockdown too early because there were clear risks transmission rates would surge. As the sole carer for his 96-year-old mother, who was shielding at home, he already avoided shops and public spaces to lower the chance he catches the virus. He said: So I understand why people are concerned [about lifting lockdown] and I share their concerns, so we need to tread very carefully. The UK economy could shrink by 14% and unemployment could more than double as the pandemic causes the deepest recession in modern history, the Bank of England has warned. Leaving interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.1% as the economic crisis unfolds, the central bank said economic activity across the country had fallen sharply since the onset of the global health emergency and the lockdown measures to contain its spread. In a warning over the mounting damage to the economy, the Bank said GDP could plunge by 25% in the second quarter. For 2020 as a whole, the economy could shrink by 14%, marking the deepest recession for more than three centuries. As Boris Johnson prepares to announce the government\u2019s plan to gradually ease lockdown measures after more than a month of sweeping controls on social and business life, the BoE said it would take a year for the economy to return to normal and there were heightened risks of long-term damage. For more on this story and for all the latest economic news and analysis, head over to our colleague Graeme Wearden\u2019s business live blog. This is from David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, on the ONS report into coronavirus deaths and ethnicity. This is from Nick Stripe, head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics, explaining to the BBC what its report on coronavirus deaths and ethnicity (see 9.41am and 10.33am) shows. Your probability of dying with Covid is made up of two things, firstly your probability of actually being infected in the first place and then secondly, your probability of dying once you have been infected. Now those two things are influenced by your personal circumstances to a large degree, so the first thing we did is, we looked at adjusting for age, what the difference was of dying to these ethnic groups and that brought out some quite stark differences. So just adjusting for age, we saw that the black ethnic grouping was just over four times more likely to die of Covid-related issues than the white group, the Bangladeshi and Pakistani grouping was about 3.5 times more likely and the Indian grouping about 2.5 times more likely. Those figures are just when we adjust for age, but we know other circumstances matter, so we want to try and introduce those other circumstances, which we can do, because we have geographical location from the death certificate and the death registration. So we know for example, big cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester have been more affected, we know from figures that we released last Friday that whether you\u2019re in an urban or rural area matters, your area\u2019s relative level of deprivation matters, so there\u2019s really a strong social gradient to mortality rates generally, and even more for Covid. So we needed to adjust for those other factors as well, so geography is a key one and then other socio-economic factors, we could get data from the census records that we\u2019ve linked the deaths to, so things like people\u2019s qualifications, people\u2019s housing circumstances, what type of jobs or occupations they had and their self-reported health. When we adjust for all those other things, then actually those rates come down significantly, a lot of the difference can be explained by these geographical and socio-economic factors. Once we\u2019ve adjusted for that, the black ethnic group is now about 90% or 1.9 times more likely to die from Covid-related issues, Bangladeshi and Pakistani males are about 80% more likely, females about 60% more likely and Indian females are about 40% more likely and males about 30% more likely. The ONS has also published a report this morning on coronavirus and the economy. As PA Media reports, it says almost a quarter of UK firms have halted trading due to the coronavirus lockdown. The PA report goes on: The ONS said 23% of businesses have temporarily closed or paused trading, according to its latest survey on the business impact of coronavirus, for the two weeks to April 19. It said the accommodation and food service sector was the worst hit, with 81% of firms halting operations, while the arts and entertainment sector saw 80% cease trading. Most businesses across all sectors have continued to trade, but most of these reported a slump in turnover. The survey revealed that 58% of companies said turnover had slipped below normal levels. Of those that had not closed sites, 30% said their financial performance was not impacted. This is from Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a social justice thinktank, on today\u2019s ONS report about coronavirus deaths and ethnicity. Today\u2019s figures are a stark reminder that although we are all weathering the same storm, we are not all in the same boat. People from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are more likely to live in deprived areas, employed in low-paid jobs where they cannot work from home. We know that both these factors increase the risk of catching coronavirus. Workers from BAME communities are also more likely to live in overcrowded homes, increasing the risk for their families too. We entered the crisis with millions of people locked in poverty, struggling against a rising tide of low pay, insecure jobs and spiralling living costs. With the Bank of England now forecasting the deepest recession on record, we must ask ourselves what kind of society we want to live in after the virus passes. It doesn\u2019t have to be like this \u2013 as a society that prides itself on justice and compassion we can and must do better. Here are the five key charts from the ONS report on coronavirus deaths and ethnicity. (See 9.41am.) 1 - Coronavirus deaths by ethnicity This one is self-explanatory - coronavirus deaths by ethnicity 2 - Comparative risk of dying from coronavirus - Men The most shocking figures in today\u2019s report are those showing that black men and women are more than four times more likely to die from coronavirus than their white counterparts. This sets out the increased risks by ethnicity for men. In this set of data the figures are adjusted for age (the age profile of different ethnic groups is different, and older people are more at risk), but not for other factors. 2 - Comparative risk of dying from coronavirus - Women And here is the equivalent chart for women. 3 - Comparative risk of dying from coronavirus - men (fully adjusted) But of course part of the reason people of BAME heritage are more likely to die from coronavirus is because of other factors, including health, relative deprivation or where they live. The ONS has adjusted the death figures to take account of this. It explain how here. Differences in the risk of dying from the coronavirus (Covid-19) across ethnic groups may be driven by differences in a group\u2019s demographic and socio-economic profile. Existing evidence indicates that most ethnic minority groups tend to be more disadvantaged than their white counterparts. For more detail, see How ethnicity intersects with other dimensions of social disadvantage in the Technical appendix ... To ensure that a broad range of factors were taken into account, we also adjusted for region, rural and urban classification, area deprivation, household composition, socio-economic position, highest qualification held, household tenure, and health or disability in the 2011 census. Therefore, the fully adjusted results show differences in risk between ethnic groups that are specific to those ethnic groups and are not caused by any of the factors listed on which members of the groups might differ. Adjusting for these factors substantially reduces the odds of a death involving Covid-19 relative to those of white ethnicity for all ethnic groups. But, even making allowance for all these factors, black people are still almost twice as likely to die from coronavirus as white people. The ONS says it does not have an explanation for why this is. Here is the chart showing increased risks by ethnicity for men, fully adjusted for other relevant factors. 5 - Comparative risk of dying from coronavirus - Women (fully adjusted) And here is the chart showing increased risks by ethnicity for women, fully adjusted for other relevant factors. A majority of British voters want the UK government to force social media sites to remove false information from their platforms, with misinformation proliferating on sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. A poll by Survation for the open data campaign Open Knowledge Foundation found 55% of people believed the government needed to \u201cimpose compulsory action on social media sites to prevent the spread of disinformation on their sites\u201d. A third (33%) said those sites should take voluntary action against misinformation. All the sites involved, including YouTube, insist they do remove fake news and misinformation both proactively and if content is flagged, but they also argue people are entitled to freely share their opinions, even if they are wrong. The poll found 51% had seen misinformation about the coronavirus, often posts wrongly linking the pandemic to 5G mobile phone masts. That echoes similar results in polls by Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator, which has already taken enforcement against broadcasters for airing such claims by David Ike, the conspiracy theorist. YouTube deleted Ike\u2019s channel on the platform for repeatedly breaching its ban on disputing the existence of Covid-19. The ONS has just published its report on coronavirus deaths by ethnicity. Here are the main points. The ONS says the risk of death from coronavirus is \u201csignificantly higher\u201d among some ethnic groups than among people of white ethnicity. Black men are 4.2 times more likely to die from coronavirus than their white counterparts, and black women 4.3 times more likely, the ONS say, when age is taken into account. When allowance is made for health factors and deprivation, black people are still 1.9 times more likely to die from coronavirus than their white counterparts, the ONS says. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities are also significantly more likely to die from coronavirus than their white counterparts, the ONS says. Bangladeshi and Pakistani men are 1.8 times more likely to die from coronavirus than their white counterparts, even when health factors and deprivation is taking into account. Bangladeshi and Pakistani women are 1.6 times more likely to die from coronavirus. The ONS says that, although deprivation and other factors explain some of these differences, a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here are the main items on the agenda for later. 9.30am: The Office for National Statistics is due to publish data on the economic impact of coronavirus, and deaths by occupation and ethnicity. 9.30am: The Commons home affairs committee takes evidence on coronavirus and asylum accommodation. Morning: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily briefings. Around 1pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Prof Sir Ian Diamond, the national statistician, and Prof John Edmunds, head of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, give evidence to the Commons science committee about the R number. At 3.30pm Prof David Peters from Johns Hopkins University and Prof David Spiegelhalter will give evidence. 5pm: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is expected to take the UK government\u2019s daily press conference. Schools have been asking teachers to come into work during lockdown to decorate classrooms, attend face-to-face meetings and make fresh preparations for a reopening, a union has claimed. NASUWT, the teachers\u2019 union, says it has received reports of teachers being brought back into work amid speculation that schools will be asked to reopen to more pupils before the summer. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, has said the requests - which he called \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d - have \u201cintensified\u201d in the past week following reports of an early return. In recent days, teachers have been told to come into school to get them \u201cused to\u201d the workplace and to get classrooms ready for social distancing measures, according to the union leader. Roach has urged schools not to act prematurely as staff are being put \u201cat risk unnecessarily\u201d. Schools, colleges and nurseries closed more than six weeks ago due to the coronavirus outbreak, remaining open only for vulnerable youngsters and the children of key workers. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has warned the government to \u201cbe quite careful\u201d about saying employees who have been furloughed have become \u201caddicted\u201d to the scheme. Dodds told Sky News: I think we need to be quite careful about suggesting there is some kind of psychological desire of people to stay in that status. Ultimately, a lot of people are seeing quite a major hit to their income as a result of going onto the furlough scheme, they want to be back at work, but we need to have the systems there to make sure they can do so safely. On the unusable gowns from Turkey, she added: \u201cWell to be completely honest, clearly a mistake was made around this but for me the critical thing is how are we going to deal with this in the future? \u201cBecause I don\u2019t see that need in care homes, in particular, ebbing away actually, it is even more pressing now, so let\u2019s not dwell too much on what might have gone wrong, let\u2019s focus on how we can actually try and get this fixed and sorted.\u201d I will be updating you on the latest news and developments. Please do get in touch to share any thoughts, news tips or insights with me. It\u2019s always really helpful, thanks in advance Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Nadia Whittome, a Labour MP who said she was fired from her temporary role as a carer for speaking out about PPE shortages, has responded to her former employer after it said it had sufficient equipment. Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Whittome said: I\u2019ve never in any of my media appearances blamed my employer for the lack of PPE, I\u2019ve always been clear that this is a national crisis and the responsibility for that lies with government. Of course I\u2019m delighted that there is now sufficient PPE, of course that wasn\u2019t the case when I spoke out, I\u2019ve always told the truth and that\u2019s corroborated by the fact that ExtraCare had themselves put out a plea for PPE donations. When asked if speaking to the media about PPE shortages may have been unsettling for the residents in her care, Whittome said: That\u2019s not the experience that I have on the front line with residents and it\u2019s not the experience of my colleagues. Radiohead guitarist Ed O\u2019Brien has praised Liam Gallagher for announcing a free concert for NHS workers, but said his own band had no such plans. Former Oasis singer Gallagher plans to perform at The O2 arena in London, which has a capacity of 20,000, on October 29. O\u2019Brien, 52, said Radiohead were \u201cdormant\u201d, although they occasionally came together for band meetings. But he suggested NHS and care home workers might not even want to see them perform live. He told the PA news agency: \u201cRadiohead is kind of dormant at the moment. We have meetings but it\u2019s not an active thing. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans but I think it\u2019s brilliant, the way that the initial wave of people like Liam Gallagher ... I think that all of that stuff is brilliant. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has called for ethnicity to be recorded on all death certificates to expose the disproportionate effect that Covid-19 and other illnesses are having on the capital\u2019s black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. The Institute of Fiscal Studies estimates that hospital death rates are highest among those with black Caribbean, Pakistani and black African heritage. However, it\u2019s not possible to understand the full extent of this inequality as, unlike in Scotland, ethnicity is not recorded on death certificates in England. Khan has successfully lobbied ministers to routinely collect and publish demographics of those dying in hospital and welcomed the government\u2019s review into the disproportionate effect of the virus, but only by adding ethnicity on to death certificates would we be able to get a complete picture, he said. Khan said: We need to fully expose the effect it is having on our communities, have honest conversations about what is behind it why it is happening, and work hard to tackle these problems. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling for greater transparency and bringing city leaders together to see what we can do. I\u2019m working hard to do all I can to support and fight for London\u2019s diverse communities, but the government cannot ignore the structural problems in our society that mean minority ethnic Londoners are more likely to work in lower paid jobs, live in overcrowded accommodation and suffer from underlying health conditions which put them at greater risk. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has urged Boris Johnson to build a consensus with all the devolved nations on easing lockdown restrictions. Yesterday we reported on significant tensions between the UK government, Scotland and Wales on exit strategy. Blackford told BBC Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme: \u201cIt\u2019s important we do all seek to work together... this shouldn\u2019t be about politics, this should be about the scientific and medical advice.\u201d Criticising the UK government for \u201cbriefing to newspapers ahead of discussions with devolved leaders\u201d, he said: \u201cWe know that the R rate in Scotland is slightly above that of rest of the UK and the public would expect the first minister to take action to look after the people of Scotland ... If we do allow an earlier lifting of restrictions all we do is run the risk of a second spike.\u201d Morning all and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live feed. I will be updating you on the latest news and developments. Please do get in touch to share any thoughts, news tips or insights with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer told BBC Good Morning Scotland he thinks lockdown should continue. He told the programme: Of course we want the number of infected cases to go down, we want the death toll to go down but we\u2019ve got to also plan for the future and I\u2019m convinced that testing, tracing and isolating is going to have to be part of any strategy for the future. But if that\u2019s going to happen the planning needs to go in now because we need many many more tests than we\u2019ve got already. Asked whether we should continue with lockdown measures he said: I think we should. I\u2019m sure that that is going to be the UK government\u2019s decision and we will support it. Lockdown needs to stay in place until we are sure the infection rate has gone down. I will be very surprised if the government doesn\u2019t reimpose the lockdown when it comes up for review later on and we will support them in that. This is not about lifting the lockdown now, it\u2019s about planning for the future. On testing, Lewis told Sky News that \u201cthere has been a bit of a drop-off in the tests in the last couple of days because of some technical issues\u201d. On the Bank of England figures, he added: This is going to be a very difficult time for our country, it is a difficult time for countries around the world. And that is why it is important that, as we start to look at what the other side of the virus might be, one of the key things for us will be looking at how we can safely ensure that people can start to get back to work so that our economy will have a chance to blossom and grow again in the future and as quickly as possible once we\u2019re the other side of this virus. Speaking on Sky News on the review of lockdown measures, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said: I think it would be wrong to get too carried away. We will be discussing some of the options and the advice that is being put to us in cabinet later on today, the review is today, the prime minister will then outline if there are going to be any changes. But I think we\u2019ve got to understand that this is a pandemic and a virus that spreads so easily that we have to be very cautious as we look at how we come out of the current lockdown.\u201d He added that \u201cthe way in which we do it, I think we\u2019ve got to be very cautious\u201d. \u201cBecause the worst thing that could happen would be to have a very fast, quick and dangerous second peak to this virus.\u201d The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee (MPC) voted unanimously in favour of holding rates. In a statement, the central bank added: \u201cThe spread of Covid-19 and the measures to contain it are having a significant impact on the United Kingdom and many countries around the world. \u201cActivity has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and unemployment has risen markedly.\u201d The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, has said it is possible for the Bank of England to lend money to the government to help the economic situation. Davey told BBC Breakfast: It is quite possible for the Bank of England to lend money to the government. We saw that after the 2008 financial crisis but now even more so, this is an unprecedented crisis and I think the Bank of England needs to be clear that it is prepared to lend the government that money and in a country like ours that is quite possible and with interest rates at record lows, that could be sustained for some time to come and we could focus on growth and not cuts. On loosening lockdown, he said: I think if we\u2019re going to ask people to do some more exercise, if we\u2019re going to open things like garden centres, that message certainly has to be relaxed. But the real question is we don\u2019t want to give a false impression that things have changed dramatically and that life can go back to normal. It\u2019s essential the government gets the balance right. He added: I want to see a plan that does really ensure that the health of the nation really is sorted out with a proper testing, tracing and isolating strategy and the economy really can be sustained, ensuring that employers have confidence and they don\u2019t have to start consulting on redundancy. Picnics, sunbathing and unlimited rambles will be among the first activities to be allowed when the lockdown loosens, it emerged on Wednesday, after Boris Johnson announced that restrictions would begin to ease from Monday. With the stringent restrictions due to be reviewed on Thursday \u2013 and details to be announced on Sunday \u2013 the prime minister is expected to change the rules so that people would be able to leave the house repeatedly in a single day, so long as they keep a safe distance from anyone from outside their household. Every one of the 400,000 protective gowns that arrived from Turkey has been impounded after being found not to conform to UK standards. The Department for Health and Social Care confirmed on Wednesday evening that the items were being held in a facility near Heathrow airport. It is understood that they are due to be sent back and that the DHSC intends to seek a refund, as it has done in similar situations in the past. Donald Trump has again suggested the US may need to accept the reality of more deaths in order to start reopening the economy, as governments around the world continued to ease out of lockdown restrictions. After backtracking on earlier indications that he would wind up the White House coronavirus taskforce, the Trump spelled out a potentially brutal approach to kickstarting the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d Trump told Fox News when asked if Americans should expect additional deaths as the country looks to reopen. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d The results of hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests carried out at privately run drive-through centres in England have not yet been shared with GPs or local authorities, who complain they have \u201cno idea\u201d where local disease clusters are. A statistician has asked the government to stop using an article he wrote for the Guardian as justification for why Britain\u2019s death toll from coronavirus should not be compared with that of other countries. Prof David Spiegelhalter said in the piece published on 30 April that comparing the number of deaths from Covid-19 between countries was difficult because of the different methodologies used by governments to measure deaths.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Boris Johnson will review coronavirus lockdown measures with ministers on Thursday ahead of an expected easing of restrictions next week. The prime minister will chair a cabinet meeting which is likely to focus on what freedoms can be restored weeks after the \u201cdraconian\u201d measures were put in place on society to halt the spread of the virus. Johnson hinted he would announce a limited return to pre-pandemic life in an address to the nation on Sunday, with new measures set to come in as early as Monday. Reports suggest changes could include unlimited exercise, the return of some sports, park picnics, and the opening of pub and cafe gardens - but people would still be required to remain two metres apart. The move could also see the government scrap its \u201cstay home\u201d slogan, and encourage people to wear face coverings on public transport and in crowded places as some return to work, according to the Daily Telegraph.",

But the clash between the two reopening orders highlights the struggles that come with governing a state as large and as diverse as California, especially in a pandemic. Last week, officials from six rural northern California counties<a href=\"https://ad03.asmrc.org/sites/default/files/files-uploaded/Local%20Control%20COVID19.pdf\"> wrote to Newsom</a>, asking him to allow their localities to take charge of their own reopening.</p> <p>Many in these counties argue that a one-size-fits-all approach from Sacramento too often ignores the needs of rural communities in favor of<strong> </strong>population centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t paint us with the same paintbrush that you\u2019re going to paint San Francisco and San Diego and Sacramento with,\u201d said the Sutter county lawmaker Mike Ziegenmeyer. \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We cannot wait for a vaccine\u2019</h2> <p>Yuba and Sutter are located just north of Sacramento, but a few minutes\u2019 drive from the state capital, the region\u2019s agriculture overtakes the scenery. Miles of orchards, plowed fields, flooded rice paddies and cow pastures separate Sacramento and Yuba City, the county seat of Sutter, and Marysville, the county seat of Yuba, located just over the Feather River from Yuba City.</p> <p>Just more than 78,000 live in Yuba while almost 97,000 live in Sutter, with more than two-thirds of the county population residing in Yuba City. Since the pandemic reached California, the two counties have reported 50 cases and three deaths. California in total has seen 58,815 cases, with 2,412 deaths as of Thursday. The six Bay Area counties that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area\">were the first</a> in the country to issue a stay-at-home order have had more than 8,100 cases, while Los Angeles county\u2019s more than 28,000 cases have led to more than half of the state\u2019s deaths.</p> <p>For three weeks before Luu issued her reopening order, the rate of new cases in Yuba and Sutter plateaued, she said. In the more populated counties around Yuba and Sutter, the rate has plateaued for almost two weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2a00d4b993abfe106881dcf54ec48abde9c19e37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a00d4b993abfe106881dcf54ec48abde9c19e37/0_169_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zhen Wan of YW Massage wears gloves and face masks as he massages a customer in Yuba City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhen Wan of YW Massage wears gloves and face masks as he massages a customer in Yuba City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Kitagaki Jr/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many in the county have attributed the low rate of infection to rural living \u2013 with fewer people who live further away from one another, the chances of spreading the virus are lowered. But with rural living comes a different set of needs. There\u2019s more of a sense of isolation when sheltering in place. With fewer businesses open, fewer supplies are available. And perhaps most daunting in counties like Yuba and Sutter is the question of the economy.</p> <p>More than a third of the civilian labor force work farm jobs, according to the <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/ca_yubacity_msa.htm#eag_ca_yubacity_msa.f.2\">US Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Of the remaining workforce, only about 3,600 work the information or professional and business services jobs that allow for telecommuting.</p> <p>Luu said as a public health official, she had to consider \u201cthe totality of health for the entire community\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCovid-19 is dangerous and scary but it is not the only health issue,\u201d Luu said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot wait for a vaccine without seeing extreme economic damage done to our community. The consequences of waiting will be additional health concerns brought on by stress and the very real dilemma for those with limited resources whether to buy life-saving food or life-saving medicines.\u201d</p> <p>By Wednesday, Luu was<a href=\"https://sacramento.cbslocal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15909776/2020/05/2020-05-06_Luu_Business_Letter.pdf\"> issuing a warning</a> to the Yuba and Sutter business community, warning them about not following the social distancing and protective gear guidelines she had put in place for the counties\u2019 reopening. \u201cIt has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI understand that some of your customers may strongly object to a facial covering requirement, but the long-term safety of our community is at stake. We do not want to take any steps back in our phasing-in efforts.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re following the guidelines strictly\u2019</h2> <p>In Yuba City and Marysville on Tuesday, few customers wore masks when they entered stores or strolled along the sidewalks. But several businesses took Luu\u2019s guidelines to heart.</p> <p>The waitstaff at the Happy Viking sports bar wore face masks and gloves and were strict about how many people they allowed inside at a time. While diners sat at tables spaced feet apart from each other inside the restaurant, those waiting outside to be seated bunched up by the door.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still smoothing stuff out,\u201d said Sandy Drown, who has owned the Happy Viking with her husband for 12 years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3f69ef31a4d16726fce006e426534d573320c6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3f69ef31a4d16726fce006e426534d573320c6c/0_185_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant owner Sandy Drown talks with a customer, Tim Schmidt, at the Happy Viking Sports Pub.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Restaurant owner Sandy Drown talks with a customer, Tim Schmidt, at the Happy Viking Sports Pub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sharon Bernstein/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though they still offered takeout under the stay-at-home order, their business dropped 74% since March, Drown said. They burned through their savings and had to let go of 39 of their 47 employees.</p> <p>She rehired all of them this week.</p> <p>At the Training Zone in Marysville, staff stood at the front to remind entering gym members that they had wear face masks while working out. In addition to spacing out all the equipment and limiting capacity to 75 members at a time, the owner, Chris Gill, hired more cleaning staff and cut hours to fit in extra cleaning.</p> <p>\u201cWe really respect what the county did and kind of going out on a limb for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re taking the precautions and following the guidelines really, really strictly.\u201d</p> <p>In the past few days, his staff has taken a number of calls from prospective members wanting to sign up because their gym still wasn\u2019t open, Gill said. They have also taken a number from members who wanted to freeze their accounts because they were not comfortable returning just yet.</p> <p>Melissa Poma, owner of Melissa Poma Hair Salon in Yuba City, has been contacted nonstop by new clientele. On Monday, the first day of the reopening, she said it was like a scene out of a zombie movie, people coming up to her window just in shock to see someone cutting hair again. She received an inquiry from a woman who lived a few hours away but was so desperate for a haircut that she was willing to drive in.</p> <p>The problem is, Poma said, she needs to be careful. Even though she burned through her savings during the closure and could use the extra income, she is only taking clients that she knows and can be honest with when it comes to their health. \u201cI have a child,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my child is in the hospital, I\u2019m not going to be there with him. I have a mother, I have a grandmother. I\u2019m taking it very seriously.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We recognize one size does not fit all\u2019</h2> <p>Though she\u2019s getting in what work that she can, Poma doesn\u2019t think the counties\u2019 reopening will be long-term. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can go by the health regulations in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do a six-foot-away haircut.\u201d Like others, Poma is conflicted.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country worships the money god so much that we will put our health on the back burner. But livelihoods, people are closing down. I can\u2019t imagine if you don\u2019t have any sort of anything to fall back on.\u201d</p> <p>She knows too that by operating while the state\u2019s order is still in effect, she risks the state taking away her license. Already this week, the state regulatory boards have begun flexing in the rural communities that reopened early. On Tuesday, state alcoholic beverage control officials were in Yuba and Sutter, asking licensed locations to shift to takeout dining, and to close in-house dining voluntarily. John Carr, a spokesman for the state agency, said while agents could discipline and file administrative action against businesses that do not comply with their requests, \u201cwe hope for voluntary compliance.\u201d</p> <p>Newsom could choose to enforce the state order more stringently in the coming days. Previously, he\u2019s leaned toward education rather than enforcement, but when photos of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/27/california-beaches-coronavirus-orange-county\">packed beaches in southern California</a> made headlines around the country, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/california-beaches-closed-coronavirus-risks-experts\">ordered</a> all beaches in Orange county closed for a weekend. Even then, however, law enforcement aimed not to arrest people violating the order.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a4efc8242aab0344ef0bc00c1e0e6a913031aba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a4efc8242aab0344ef0bc00c1e0e6a913031aba/0_81_5417_3252/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Server Jonnie Overmire goes over the menu for customers at the Lambert House Cafe in Yuba City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Server Jonnie Overmire goes over the menu for customers at the Lambert House Cafe in Yuba City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Across the state, cases have continued to rise incrementally, but<strong> </strong>numbers have not reached the doomsday predictions initially projected by state experts. As of Thursday, only 3,334 patients with confirmed cases were hospitalized statewide, along with 1,347 with suspected cases. State health officials have repeatedly pleaded with Californians,<strong> </strong>however, not to become complacent with their efforts, and to recognize that it is because of their actions that the numbers are where they are.</p> <p>For some in communities like Yuba and Sutter, however, the state is taking it too far. \u201cI feel like the state\u2019s a little overdramatic,\u201d said Steve Lewis, a tattoo artist at Artistic Temple Social Club in Marysville. After weeks of no work, Lewis is just happy he can pay his bills again.</p> <p>\u201cI have a lot of friends in this industry in other parts of the state who are in the same boat I was in just last week, and they\u2019re just trying to get through, selling art, trying to do gift cards, doing GoFundMes,\u201d he said. \u201cI can work again. They can\u2019t. I see everyone else in that position, and it\u2019s a rough thing. I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/coronavirus-er-nurse-testing-swabs\">Six swabs a shift: hospital units battle over precious rapid Covid tests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Newsom often refers to California as a \u201cnation-state\u201d in his daily briefings, to give \u201ca sense of the scale and scope\u201d of a state with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and a population of almost 40 million.</p> <p>\u201cWe recognize that one size does not fit all,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CAgovernor/status/1249773282309468165\">said</a>. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage a state this large, this diverse in every way, shape or form ethnically, racially, religiously, on the basis of geography, without recognizing a bottom-up construct.\u201d</p> <p>But he has repeatedly stressed that California must be united in its response against coronavirus.</p> <p>In that regard, the governor and Ziegenmeyer, the Sutter county lawmaker, are in agreement. \u201cThis is the way I look at it, and the way I hope he looks at it: we\u2019re all a team in this in the state of California,\u201d Ziegenmeyer said.

Many in these counties argue that a one-size-fits-all approach from Sacramento too often ignores the needs of rural communities in favor of population centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco. \u201cYou can\u2019t paint us with the same paintbrush that you\u2019re going to paint San Francisco and San Diego and Sacramento with,\u201d said the Sutter county lawmaker Mike Ziegenmeyer. \u201cThat\u2019s just not fair.\u201d \u2018We cannot wait for a vaccine\u2019 Yuba and Sutter are located just north of Sacramento, but a few minutes\u2019 drive from the state capital, the region\u2019s agriculture overtakes the scenery. Miles of orchards, plowed fields, flooded rice paddies and cow pastures separate Sacramento and Yuba City, the county seat of Sutter, and Marysville, the county seat of Yuba, located just over the Feather River from Yuba City. Just more than 78,000 live in Yuba while almost 97,000 live in Sutter, with more than two-thirds of the county population residing in Yuba City. Since the pandemic reached California, the two counties have reported 50 cases and three deaths. California in total has seen 58,815 cases, with 2,412 deaths as of Thursday. The six Bay Area counties that were the first in the country to issue a stay-at-home order have had more than 8,100 cases, while Los Angeles county\u2019s more than 28,000 cases have led to more than half of the state\u2019s deaths. For three weeks before Luu issued her reopening order, the rate of new cases in Yuba and Sutter plateaued, she said. In the more populated counties around Yuba and Sutter, the rate has plateaued for almost two weeks. Many in the county have attributed the low rate of infection to rural living \u2013 with fewer people who live further away from one another, the chances of spreading the virus are lowered. But with rural living comes a different set of needs. There\u2019s more of a sense of isolation when sheltering in place. With fewer businesses open, fewer supplies are available. And perhaps most daunting in counties like Yuba and Sutter is the question of the economy. More than a third of the civilian labor force work farm jobs, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of the remaining workforce, only about 3,600 work the information or professional and business services jobs that allow for telecommuting. Luu said as a public health official, she had to consider \u201cthe totality of health for the entire community\u201d. \u201cCovid-19 is dangerous and scary but it is not the only health issue,\u201d Luu said in a statement. \u201cWe cannot wait for a vaccine without seeing extreme economic damage done to our community. The consequences of waiting will be additional health concerns brought on by stress and the very real dilemma for those with limited resources whether to buy life-saving food or life-saving medicines.\u201d By Wednesday, Luu was issuing a warning to the Yuba and Sutter business community, warning them about not following the social distancing and protective gear guidelines she had put in place for the counties\u2019 reopening. \u201cIt has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI understand that some of your customers may strongly object to a facial covering requirement, but the long-term safety of our community is at stake. We do not want to take any steps back in our phasing-in efforts.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re following the guidelines strictly\u2019 In Yuba City and Marysville on Tuesday, few customers wore masks when they entered stores or strolled along the sidewalks. But several businesses took Luu\u2019s guidelines to heart. The waitstaff at the Happy Viking sports bar wore face masks and gloves and were strict about how many people they allowed inside at a time. While diners sat at tables spaced feet apart from each other inside the restaurant, those waiting outside to be seated bunched up by the door. \u201cWe\u2019re still smoothing stuff out,\u201d said Sandy Drown, who has owned the Happy Viking with her husband for 12 years. Though they still offered takeout under the stay-at-home order, their business dropped 74% since March, Drown said. They burned through their savings and had to let go of 39 of their 47 employees. She rehired all of them this week. At the Training Zone in Marysville, staff stood at the front to remind entering gym members that they had wear face masks while working out. In addition to spacing out all the equipment and limiting capacity to 75 members at a time, the owner, Chris Gill, hired more cleaning staff and cut hours to fit in extra cleaning. \u201cWe really respect what the county did and kind of going out on a limb for us,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re taking the precautions and following the guidelines really, really strictly.\u201d In the past few days, his staff has taken a number of calls from prospective members wanting to sign up because their gym still wasn\u2019t open, Gill said. They have also taken a number from members who wanted to freeze their accounts because they were not comfortable returning just yet. Melissa Poma, owner of Melissa Poma Hair Salon in Yuba City, has been contacted nonstop by new clientele. On Monday, the first day of the reopening, she said it was like a scene out of a zombie movie, people coming up to her window just in shock to see someone cutting hair again. She received an inquiry from a woman who lived a few hours away but was so desperate for a haircut that she was willing to drive in. The problem is, Poma said, she needs to be careful. Even though she burned through her savings during the closure and could use the extra income, she is only taking clients that she knows and can be honest with when it comes to their health. \u201cI have a child,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my child is in the hospital, I\u2019m not going to be there with him. I have a mother, I have a grandmother. I\u2019m taking it very seriously.\u201d \u2018We recognize one size does not fit all\u2019 Though she\u2019s getting in what work that she can, Poma doesn\u2019t think the counties\u2019 reopening will be long-term. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can go by the health regulations in this industry,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to do a six-foot-away haircut.\u201d Like others, Poma is conflicted. \u201cIt\u2019s rough,\u201d she said. \u201cOur country worships the money god so much that we will put our health on the back burner. But livelihoods, people are closing down. I can\u2019t imagine if you don\u2019t have any sort of anything to fall back on.\u201d She knows too that by operating while the state\u2019s order is still in effect, she risks the state taking away her license. Already this week, the state regulatory boards have begun flexing in the rural communities that reopened early. On Tuesday, state alcoholic beverage control officials were in Yuba and Sutter, asking licensed locations to shift to takeout dining, and to close in-house dining voluntarily. John Carr, a spokesman for the state agency, said while agents could discipline and file administrative action against businesses that do not comply with their requests, \u201cwe hope for voluntary compliance.\u201d Newsom could choose to enforce the state order more stringently in the coming days. Previously, he\u2019s leaned toward education rather than enforcement, but when photos of packed beaches in southern California made headlines around the country, he ordered all beaches in Orange county closed for a weekend. Even then, however, law enforcement aimed not to arrest people violating the order. Across the state, cases have continued to rise incrementally, but numbers have not reached the doomsday predictions initially projected by state experts. As of Thursday, only 3,334 patients with confirmed cases were hospitalized statewide, along with 1,347 with suspected cases. State health officials have repeatedly pleaded with Californians, however, not to become complacent with their efforts, and to recognize that it is because of their actions that the numbers are where they are. For some in communities like Yuba and Sutter, however, the state is taking it too far. \u201cI feel like the state\u2019s a little overdramatic,\u201d said Steve Lewis, a tattoo artist at Artistic Temple Social Club in Marysville. After weeks of no work, Lewis is just happy he can pay his bills again. \u201cI have a lot of friends in this industry in other parts of the state who are in the same boat I was in just last week, and they\u2019re just trying to get through, selling art, trying to do gift cards, doing GoFundMes,\u201d he said. \u201cI can work again. They can\u2019t. I see everyone else in that position, and it\u2019s a rough thing. I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d Newsom often refers to California as a \u201cnation-state\u201d in his daily briefings, to give \u201ca sense of the scale and scope\u201d of a state with the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy and a population of almost 40 million. \u201cWe recognize that one size does not fit all,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t manage a state this large, this diverse in every way, shape or form ethnically, racially, religiously, on the basis of geography, without recognizing a bottom-up construct.\u201d But he has repeatedly stressed that California must be united in its response against coronavirus. In that regard, the governor and Ziegenmeyer, the Sutter county lawmaker, are in agreement. \u201cThis is the way I look at it, and the way I hope he looks at it: we\u2019re all a team in this in the state of California,\u201d Ziegenmeyer said. But in rural California reopening, he sees not risk but economic potential. \u201cIf one small region can get back to work, think about the impact we\u2019re going to have on the unemployment lines,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that right there, opening up with the direction of a good health doctor who is going by the science and the numbers, that is huge.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government was on Thursday evening urgently trying to regain control of the next phase of the pandemic crisis as it faced fierce criticism and warnings that mixed messaging was priming the public to give up on the lockdown. Downing Street\u2019s plans for laying out a \u201croadmap\u201d on Sunday were thrown into chaos by a rash of headlines pointing to a significant easing next week. This prompted concern from many quarters, including from one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers who said the public were mistakenly being given a \u201cgreen light\u201d to abandon the lockdown. \u201cIt\u2019s really unhelpful to have bits and pieces of information leaked,\u201d a member of the Sage advisory committee told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly damaging. If people are primed to look at things in a certain way, it will shape how they receive the information. So on Sunday they will be looking for the green lights and they won\u2019t notice the red lights. It\u2019s a really powerful way of influencing people.\u201d The mixed messages emanating from the government also infuriated the Scottish and Welsh governments, threatening to rupture the \u201cfour nations\u201d approach No 10 has sought to pursue. As ministers scrambled to dampen expectations before the bank holiday weekend, Dominic Raab insisted any changes to the lockdown made by the prime minister on Sunday will be \u201cmodest, small, incremental and carefully monitored\u201d, after a chorus of voices warned against relaxing restrictions prematurely. Sunbathing, long walks and \u201cunlimited exercise\u201d are likely to be permitted, government sources suggested. But Downing Street poured cold water on the idea of wider changes, saying Boris Johnson had told his cabinet he would exercise \u201cmaximum caution\u201d in moving to the next phase of the crisis. And Raab said: \u201cAs we enter another long bank holiday weekend I think the message is very clear: follow the guidance. There is no change today in the guidance or in the rules, but the prime minister will set out a roadmap on Sunday.\u201d Johnson briefed opposition leaders about plans for the next stage on Thursday, and one source with knowledge of the call said he appeared \u201calmost uncomfortable\u201d about some of Thursday\u2019s front pages, whose headlines included Happy Monday and Hurrah! Lockdown Freedom Beckons. \u201cThis was not bombastic Boris, he was quite a different character. He was far more doveish about lockdown than has been suggested,\u201d the source said. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, warned that it would be a \u201cpotentially catastrophic mistake\u201d to move too quickly. And a statement from the Welsh government said: \u201cSome of the reporting in today\u2019s newspapers is confusing and risks sending mixed messages to people across the UK.\u201d The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, later insisted the country\u2019s schools would not open on 1 June, whatever England decides. And she urged the Welsh public not to share information from \u201cother sources\u201d. Baroness Sal Brinton, a former president of the Liberal Democrats who has been leading the party\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, said: \u201cI think people are taking it to mean they can travel around for the bank holiday weekend. I\u2019ve already seen more tweets about lots more traffic on the roads. \u201cThey are mishandling the announcement in order to be seen to speak to people who are frustrated. I want an end to the lockdown but I want it to be done when people are safe and the government need to come and explain it to parliament.\u201d Teaching union NASUWT urged the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, not to reopen English schools fully until September, amid widespread expectations of a phased return for the children of non-key workers from 1 June. In a letter to Williamson, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \u201cIn view of the continued and pressing public health challenges and the considerable task that will be required to ensure that every school is ready to admit increased numbers of children and adults into safe learning and working environments, the NASUWT urges the government to end speculation on the reopening of schools beyond the current restrictions prior to September 2020.\u201d The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, emphasised the importance of a cross-UK consensus on leaving lockdown and called on Boris Johnson to involve the devolved nations and opposition parties in \u201cmeaningful\u201d discussion. \u201cHaving different approaches and rival strategies isn\u2019t going to help.

The warnings comes ahead of a long bank holiday weekend to mark VE day, with the forecast warm weather likely to tempt people to go out after six weeks of restrictions. Several police chiefs told the Guardian that more people were going out by foot and road and there were clear signs of people getting tired of lockdown.

With the lockdown extending into a seventh week, the influential Conservative thinktank Onward is warning the government about the impact on the nation\u2019s mental health. \u201cAs the Covid-19 crisis progresses, we are likely to face increased levels of depression, harmful use of alcohol and drugs, as well as self-harm or suicidal behaviour,\u201d it says, in a report called Building a Social Stimulus published on Friday. \u201cIn the longer term there is likely to be an increase in cases of post-traumatic stress disorder, both amongst healthcare workers and those who have suffered grief or serious illness.\u201d The thinktank calls for a \u00a35m boost to mental health support charities.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 8 May. Top stories A Melbourne meat processing company linked to 62 coronavirus cases has admitted it was told a second worker had contracted Covid-19 on 24 April \u2013 three days before the case that has been widely reported. A spokeswoman for Cedar Meats told Guardian Australia the phone call wasn\u2019t considered \u201cofficial information\u201d because it did not come from the Victorian health department, which did not call the company until 27 April. It wasn\u2019t until 29 April that staff were told they could stay home to avoid catching the virus. The state\u2019s opposition leader, Michael O\u2019Brien, has called the cluster \u201cDaniel Andrews\u2019s own Ruby Princess\u201d, after it was revealed the state health department had been advised as early as 2 April that a Cedar Meats worker had tested positive. China\u2019s threats of a consumer boycott against Australia are a \u201cwake up call\u201d to its \u201ccoercive behaviour\u201d, a senior public servant has warned. Scott Morrison\u2019s calls for the World Health Organization to be given investigative powers similar to weapons inspectors sparked a war of words between the two nations, drawing the threat of trade retaliation from China\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Jingye Cheng. The former Treasury secretary Martin Parkinson said Australians \u201cshouldn\u2019t be too spooked\u201d by the rhetoric, but urged the nation to accelerate the digitisation of the economy and to encourage greater domestic innovation to reduce trade reliance upon China. Russia appears to have become a new global hotspot for the coronavirus, with the mayor of Moscow, home to more than half the country\u2019s reported 177,160 cases, saying actual infections could be closer to 300,000. T With medical staff dying at worrying rates, the pandemic is being seen as a significant threat to Vladimir Putin\u2019s authority. Elsewhere, France has announced its borders will stay closed until at least 15 June, Madrid\u2019s public health director has resigned in protest at the government\u2019s plans to begin easing restrictions, and one of Donald Trump\u2019s personal valets has tested positive. Australia A government-commissioned report into the cashless debit card trial has raised further questions about the stigmatisation of users. The scheme, which pays welfare recipients 80% of their benefits via a card they can only use at certain outlets, was extended a day before the report was released. The Law Council has called for reforms to the federal secrecy laws invoked in the defamation case involving the special forces veteran Ben Roberts-Smith. The council\u2019s president, Pauline Wright, said it was a \u201cfundamental rule\u201d that justice take place in open court. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has called proposed changes to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation a \u201cTrojan horse for coal and gas\u201d. The Coalition is looking to amend the act to allow the CEFC to administer a $1bn grid reliability fund, which critics suggest could be a loophole to allow investments in coal and gas. The world The parents of Ahmaud Arbery, shot in southern US two months ago, have called for arrests for what their attorney dubbed \u201ca modern lynching in the middle of the day\u201d. A 911 caller rang to report a \u201cblack male running\u201d shortly before a father and son duo shot dead the 25-year-old. Hundreds of people have been taken to hospital in India after a gas leak at a chemical factory that\u2019s feared to have killed at least 11 people. Workers were preparing to restart the plastics plant after a coronavirus-enforced shutdown when two 5,000-tonne tanks released a blanket of gas over a radius of 3km, enveloping local villages. An international police operation has recovered more than 19,000 stolen artworks and archaeological artefacts including a pre-Columbian gold mask, a carved Roman lion and thousands of ancient coins. The coordinated taskforce included Spanish, Latvian, Argentinian and Afghan police. A second member of a popular Turkish leftwing folk group has died in an Istanbul hospital after a hunger strike, 323 days after the 41-year-old began his protest. The band, Grup Yorum, has been banned from performing in Turkey since 2016 and has been protesting the ongoing incarceration of its members.

The pregnant woman was identified as Ashlynn Lisby, 23. Lisby was white. Her fetus did not survive. Protests began after video of the events leading up to Reed\u2019s shooting appeared on Facebook. The video shows him being pursued by police before incoherent shouting and popping sounds are heard during a later foot chase. Later, a male voice says, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a closed casket, homie,\u201d an apparent reference to a closed-casket funeral. Taylor said on Thursday that he was \u201caware of inappropriate comments made by an IMPD detective that was broadcast live on social media during the incident\u201d. He said \u201cimmediate disciplinary action\u201d would be pursued against the detective, who was responding to the shooting and was not present when it happened. The department has conducted a pilot body camera program but has not finalized which cameras it wants to equip its officers with, Assistant Chief Chris Bailey said during a news conference with Taylor. Reed\u2019s shooting happened around 6pm on Wednesday after a pursuit that began after officers, including Taylor, observed someone driving recklessly on Interstate 65, police said. Supervisors ordered an end to that pursuit because the vehicle was moving close to 90mph. It was later spotted by an officer on a city street before being parked. That officer left his vehicle and Reed then ran, Bailey said. Reed was shot, the assistant chief said, as he and the officer exchanged gunfire. Continuing the police narrative of events, Baily said it appeared that a gun found near Reed had been fired at least twice. The officer who shot Reed is black, the Indianapolis Star reported, and he has been placed on administrative leave. The car chase and foot chase were both captured on video, apparently by Reed. The second shooting happened about eight hours later, as police investigated a burglary at an apartment complex. Police said a man armed with a rifle shot at four responding officers. Police said officers returned fire, killing the man, later identified as Rose. Between those two shootings, Officer Jonathon Henderson struck Lisby with his vehicle. Police said Henderson rendered first aid to the woman. Lisby was pronounced dead at a hospital. The Greater Indianapolis NAACP said it was monitoring information about both fatal police shootings. \u201cOur hearts this morning are with the families who lost loved ones during these tragic events. All of us are trying to make a new normal in an un-normal time. Incidents like these do not help restore normalcy to our community,\u201d said Chrystal Ratcliffe, the president of the NAACP branch.",

      "bodyText": "UK lenders have granted nearly 1.2 m payment holidays on credit cards and personal loans for customers struggling with the Covid-19 outbreak. Figures released by the banking lobby group UK Finance show that by the end of April payment holidays had been granted for around 700,000 credit cards and around 470,000 loans had been put on pause. Banks have also offered to waive interest on overdrafts of up to \u00a3500 for 27 million customers, the industry body said. Its chief executive, Stephen Jones, said: \u201cMany people across the country are facing financial pressures due to the coronavirus, and lenders are taking decisive action to help them through these tough times.\u201d UK Finance urged customers to apply to put repayments on hold only if they needed immediate help. It said interest would still be charged on most credit cards and personal loans during payment holidays. Customers have been able to request a freeze on payments for up to three months since early April, when the Financial Conduct Authority introduced emergency measures to help protect vulnerable customers. The measures were designed to help consumers and renters who were not benefiting from other relief measures including mortgage holidays and the government-backed coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) for business owners. This week data collected by economists at Capital Economics showed that 2 million households in the UK had applied to access mortgage holidays. It said five UK banks accounting for 57% of the country\u2019s mortgages had either received applications for or approved 1,150,000 payment holidays by mid- to late April. Capital Economics said missed mortgage payments were likely to \u201cblow past\u201d levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis, when the number of mortgages that fell into arrears for at least three months peaked at 288,000. \u201cAdmittedly, payment holidays are not treated as arrears, so borrowers have longer than usual to get their finances back in order. Still, to avoid breaching the previous record, a hefty 85% of households who currently have payment holidays would need to resume payments by September,\u201d said Hansen Lu, a property economist.

Madrid health director resigns as region seeks to lift lockdown The director of public health for the Madrid region, Yolanda Fuentes, has resigned, apparently in protest at the regional government\u2019s decision to seek to loosen lockdown restrictions in the area of Spain hardest hit by coronavirus. Fuentes stepped down as the Madrid regional government prepares to seek permission from the national health ministry to reopen small businesses, with restaurant and bar terraces opening at 30% capacity. Fuentes is understood to have had grave reservations about the move, as Madrid remains badly affected by the virus. France\u2019s daily death total falls France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall from 278 the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March. The health ministry said 25,987 people were now confirmed to have died from the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. France reveals easing of lockdown measures The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the country\u2019s border will remain closed for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d except for absolutely essential professional or family reasons and trans-border workers, and they will still need to carry an international declaration. Although restrictions will be eased in some areas, in the capital and the four adjoining regions \u2013 Ile-de-France, Hauts-de-France, Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comte \u2013 which comprise the \u201cred zone\u201d, public parks and gardens will remain shut. Anyone stopped by police or gendarmes making a journey of more than 100km will need a new sworn declaration stating the journey is absolutely essential. Brazil records further 610 deaths Brazil registers 9,888 new cases of coronavirus and 610 deaths on Thursday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. That brought the total to 135,106 confirmed cases in Brazil, with 9,146 deaths from Covid-19. WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus Up to 190,000 people in Africa could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organization. Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon are among the countries at high risk if containment measures are not prioritised, the study found. It also warned that health services would be overwhelmed with the number of people requiring treatment and recommends that hospitals increase their capacity. Turkey records 57 further deaths The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 57 in the last 24-hours to 3,641, Health Ministry data showed. The overall number of cases rose by 1,977 to 133,721, the highest total outside western Europe, the US and Russia. Australian cabinet set to ease restrictions in stages Australia\u2019s national cabinet is expected to ease some social distancing restrictions on Friday as the number of new coronavirus infections slows. Australia\u2019s minister for health, Greg Hunt, said he expected the cabinet to detail a timetable for easing those restrictions. \u201cWhat I expect is a clear roadmap out, with clear stages,\u201d Hunt told reporters.",

Somebody was stupid,\u201d he added during a meeting with the Texas governor. It comes after US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed he had seen \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced. China has denied the claims. Global death toll nears 270,000 The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached 268,999, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic. The US death toll from coronavirus has now surpassed 75,000 people, the highest globally, followed by the UK with 30,689 deaths. The countries with the next highest numbers of deaths are Italy with 29,958 and Spain with 26,070. White House reportedly shelved guidance on reopening businesses A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was shelved by the White House, according to AP News. The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The 17-page report was scheduled to be published on Friday but now the guidance \u201cwill never see the light of day\u201d, a CDC official told AP. It urges businesses to slowly reopen while continuing to observe social distancing. Trump has pushed for a rapid reopening despite fears of a surge in coronavirus cases. Concerns over UK contact-tracing app The UK\u2019s contact-tracing app must not be rolled out until the government has increased privacy and data protections, a parliamentary committee has said, as rights groups warn that the current trial is unlawful under the Data Protection Act. The joint committee on human rights said it was essential legislation was enacted to ensure the mass surveillance of personal data did not result in a violation before the trial was expanded. The app, which is being trialled on the Isle of Wight, logs users\u2019 movements and can alert people if they have had contact with someone who has developed symptoms. Madrid health director resigns as region seeks to lift lockdown The director of public health for the Madrid region, Yolanda Fuentes, has resigned, apparently in protest at the regional government\u2019s decision to seek to loosen lockdown restrictions in the area of Spain hardest hit by coronavirus. Fuentes stepped down as the Madrid regional government prepares to seek permission from the national health ministry to reopen small businesses, with restaurant and bar terraces opening at 30% capacity. Fuentes is understood to have had grave reservations about the move, as Madrid remains badly affected by the virus. France\u2019s daily death total falls France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall from 278 the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March. The health ministry said 25,987 people were now confirmed to have died from the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. France reveals easing of lockdown measures The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said the country\u2019s border will remain closed for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d except for absolutely essential professional or family reasons and trans-border workers, and they will still need to carry an international declaration. Although restrictions will be eased in some areas, in the capital and the four adjoining regions \u2013 Ile-de-France, Hauts-de-France, Grand Est Bourgogne-Franche-Comte \u2013 which comprise the \u201cred zone\u201d, public parks and gardens will remain shut. Anyone stopped by police or gendarmes making a journey of more than 100km will need a new sworn declaration stating the journey is absolutely essential. Brazil records further 610 deaths Brazil registers 9,888 new cases of coronavirus and 610 deaths on Thursday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. That brought the total to 135,106 confirmed cases in Brazil, with 9,146 deaths from Covid-19. WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus Up to 190,000 people in Africa could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO). Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon are among the countries at high risk if containment measures are not prioritised, the study found. It also warned that health services would be overwhelmed with the number of people requiring treatment and recommends that hospitals increase their capacity. Turkey records 57 further deaths The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 57 in the last 24-hours to 3,641, Health Ministry data showed. The overall number of cases rose by 1,977 to 133,721, the highest total outside western Europe, the US and Russia. Australian cabinet set to ease restrictions in stages Australia\u2019s national cabinet is expected to ease some social distancing restrictions on Friday as the number of new coronavirus infections slows. Australia\u2019s minister for health, Greg Hunt, said he expected the cabinet to detail a timetable for easing those restrictions. \u201cWhat I expect is a clear roadmap out, with clear stages,\u201d Hunt told reporters. Brazil registers 9,888 new cases of coronavirus and 610 deaths on Thursday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. That brought the total to 135,106 confirmed cases in Brazil with 9,146 deaths from Covid-19. Australia\u2019s national Cabinet was on Friday expected to ease some social distancing restrictions as the number of new coronavirus infections slows. With fewer than 20 new infections each day, Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week said he would meet with state and territory leaders to decide which restrictions will be eased. Australia\u2019s Minister for Health Greg Hunt said he expected the Cabinet to detail a timetable for easing those restrictions. \u201cWhat I expect is a clear roadmap out, with clear stages,\u201d Hunt told reporters in Melbourne. Starting Friday, California will allow retailers to begin offering curbside pick-up as the state moves deeper into \u201cstage 2\u201d of its reopening plan, governor Gavin Newsom said. Manufactures and warehouses that support these retailers will also be allowed to reopen with modifications. Eventually the reopening plan in stage two will include some office spaces, dining at restaurants, shopping malls and outdoor museums, Dr Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services, said. Ghaly said starting Friday, retailers can begin delivering items to customers\u2019 cars with gloves and a mask while using hands-free devices that allow customers to pay. He added manufacturers should use outdoor spaces as break rooms and warehouses should carry sanitation materials when making deliveries. Stage 4, the final stage in the state\u2019s reopening plan, will allow for large gatherings to resume, such as concerts and sporting events, Newsom said. However, he indicated that stage would occur once a vaccine is made available. California has been under a two-month lockdown. The US death toll from coronavirus has now surpassed 75,000 people, according to the counter from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths in the US are the highest globally at 75,447, a rise of around 2,000 in a day, followed by the UK at 30,689 deaths. The proceeding countries with the highest numbers of casualties are Italy with 29,958 and Spain with 26,070. Donald Trump said his administration was considering further economic measures, possibly via executive orders, to provide help against the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. In remarks to reporters at the White House, the US president appeared to confirm the possibility of further postponement of the deadline for filing 2019 federal income tax returns, already extended by three months to July 15. \u201cThings could happen like that. We have to help people,\u201d he said in response to a question about the tax deadline and economic measures that would not require congressional action. \u201cWe can do things ... through executive order or otherwise that can help a lot of people ... like delays. We can do delays of various files. ... I can see that happening,\u201d he said. Congress has passed major coronavirus relief bills worth nearly $3 trillion, including payments of $1,200 to many individuals and more than $650 billion in loans to small businesses. Asked whether there would be more direct payments to individuals, Trump said: \u201cWell, something could happen. There\u2019s talk about something happening. We\u2019ll see what\u2019s going on.\u201d Up to 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) based on prediction modelling and analysing 47 countries in the region. Algeria, South Africa and Cameroon are among the countries at high risk if containment measures are not prioritised, the study found. It also warned that health services would be overwhelmed with the number of people requiring hospital treatment. An estimated 3.6-5.5 million people could need hospital treatment for the virus among which around 52,000-107,000 would need breathing support. The study recommends that hospitals increase their capacity. A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was abruptly shelved by the White House, according to AP News. The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal.

It urges businesses to slowly reopen while continuing to observe social distancing, while the president has pushed for a rapid reopening despite fears of a surge in coronavirus cases. The White House has sought to control guidance on the virus outbreak rather than the CDC, which has traditionally let the US fight against epidemics. Our Australia live blog has launched, covering developments in the country where news of a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions is expected. A doctor in the UK has used the weekly clap for carers, where people stand on their doorsteps to applaud those key workers on the coronavirus frontline, to call for more PPE. The issue has dogged the government\u2019s response to the epidemic and has been cited by some bereaved relatives of healthcare staff as a factor in their loved ones\u2019 deaths. See the video here. Trump said his administration is talking to Republican senators about the work visa issue. Four Republican senators sent a letter earlier urging the US president to suspend all new guest worker visas for 60 days and certain categories of new guest work visas for at least a year, until unemployment returns to normal levels. Trump added he wants to ease international travel restrictions at the appropriate time. \u201cSomething happened,\u201d Trump told US reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \u201cProbably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,\u201d the US president added during a meeting with the Texas governor. It comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced. China has denied the claims. Albania will let shopping centres and services start work and drivers travel without permission from Monday after Thursday marked the ninth day without any deaths, officials said. It has closed its borders and imposed long lockdowns since its first case on March 8. In May, still enforcing dusk-to-dawn curfews, more businesses have resumed working or will. Albania has registered 31 deaths from Covid-19 and 842 infections. \u201cFortunately, we are not facing those indicators that stop the opening,\u201d said Mira Rakacolli, the head of the committee of health experts managing the crisis, said in a statement. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Pope Francis discussed the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the world in a phone call today and agreed on the need to help poorer countries, her spokesman said. The conversation centred on the humanitarian and political situation in view of the pandemic and the importance of cohesion and solidarity in Europe and the world, spokesman Steffen Seibert said. \u201cBoth favoured supporting in particular poorer countries in the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he added. Merkel, daughter of a Lutheran pastor, also invited him to visit Germany when circumstances allow. Italian footballl club Sampdoria announce that four new Covid-19 cases have been found in their squad. The entire squad and staff were subjected to swabs before a return to training. The club said: \u201cUC Sampdoria inform that, during the tests performed on the players, results emerged that showed three new positive cases for Coronavirus-COVID-19 and one return to positivity. \u201cCurrently asymptomatic, they have been placed in quarantine and will be constantly monitored, as per protocol.\u201d It comes after Fiorentina earlier announced six cases, three players and three members of staff. Senior US health official Francis Collins told a Senate hearing today that the country needs better diagnostic testing technology to cope with the pandemic. Collins, director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, said existing testing technology still relies on sending samples to labs for results, and new technologies must be developed to deliver tests that rapidly deliver results on site and be widely distributed. \u201cWe believe it is not just a matter of taking what we have and making it higher throughput, we need new technologies that have these more appropriate features,\u201d he said. Collins\u2019 comments echoed those by Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force, who said last month that \u201cwe have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing\u201d in order to fully reopen the economy. A shortage of tests has hampered the U.S. response to the pandemic, which has killed about 74,000 people in the country and infected more than 1.2 million. In April, the NIH announced plans to fund development of new testing technologies in academia and business, and scale them up by the end of summer. Former boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard has revealed one of the ways he stays sane through the coronavirus lockdown is by attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings online. Leonard, who won six world titles at five weights between 1979 and 1989, has been attending AA meetings for around 15 years. Speaking from his home in California, the 63-year-old told Reuters: \u201cI can*t go to meetings now but I am on Zoom, I get it on Zoom and I join AA meetings that (have) people from the UK, Puerto Rico, all over the world and we*re watching this, like I am doing with you, because technology is so amazing. \u201cI can relate to that and I love this. You can go anywhere. It takes you to where everyone else is. It puts us together.\u201d Austria said that several coronavirus patients were cured after receiving transfusions using blood plasma from people who had recovered from the virus. The treatment has been tested in several countries but there is still little medical data available about its effectiveness. Three patients who had transfusions at a hospital in the southeastern city of Graz are now cured, Robert Krause, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital told a press conference. However, he said it is \u201can option for hand-picked patients and is not readily transferable\u201d to anyone who falls sick with the virus. Two of the three patients had other diseases and very weakened immune systems. A total of 20 people have been treated in Austria with the therapy, which uses part of the blood rich in antibodies, known as convalescent plasma, from Covid-19 patients. The Red Cross launched an urgent appeal to plasma donors on Thursday to allow this therapy, which is still experimental, to be tested more widely. Some 200 donations have so far been made in Austria. The number of people who have died from Covid-19 in Turkey has risen by 57 in the last 24 hours to 3,641, Health Ministry data showed. The overall number of cases rose by 1,977 to 133,721, the data showed, the highest total outside Western Europe, the United States and Russia. The number of daily deaths and new cases has fallen sharply from peaks recorded last month. A French court has ordered Renault to suspend production that had resumed at a plant in northern France due to insufficient precautions against the coronavirus. The car factory at Sandouville, which has almost 2,000 employees, resumed work on April 28 after stopping on March 16 due to the epidemic. But the court in Le Havre ordered it to stop production until further notice because the resumption did not \u201censure the safety of workers in the factory facing the risk linked to COVID-19\u201d, according to the court order first reported by Norman media Le Poulpe of which AFP obtained a copy. The court ordered that production be suspended \u201cfor the time it takes to effectively implement measures\u201d and also told the company to carry out a risk assessment. French courts have already ordered online retailing giant Amazon to restrict its operations in France pending an evaluation of virus risks to its staff. Amazon said on Thursday it now planned to extend the closure of its distribution centres in France as a result of the ruling until Wednesday. Here is our report from our US office about a valet to Donald Trump testing positive for coronavirus. Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said: \u201cThe president and the vice-president have since tested negative for the virus and they remain in great health.\u201d The UK has come together for its weekly Clap for Carers to celebrate key workers on the frontline. The UK live blog has more details. The National Trust tweets a floral tribute. South Sudan has announced the easing of restrictions to combat the coronavirus, including re-opening bars and restaurants and shortening a curfew even as cases continue to rise. South Sudan confirmed 16 new cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 90 in the country - up from a total of six cases at the beginning of last week. President Salva Kiir took the decision which will be effective \u201cin 72 hours\u201d, according to Richard Laku, a member of the country\u2019s task force on the virus. The measures include re-opening internal travel by air, land and river and allowing regional flights back to South Sudan, Laku said. Markets, shops, bars and restaurants will also be allowed to re-open. Schools, mosques, churches and night clubs will remain shut, while sports activities and other public gatherings remain banned. The curfew which had been from 7pm to 6am has been shortened to start only at 10pm. The task force decided to maintain other measures such as requiring all travellers coming to and exiting South Sudan to present a certificate proving they are free of the virus. Denmark is to allow shopping centres to reopen from Monday and colleges, restaurants and places of worship a week later, authorities announced. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told a press conference that professional footballers will also be able to resume training immediately. \u201cIt is mainly because we have followed the advice of the health authorities to keep our distance and disinfect our hands that we can now open seriously,\u201d he said. The easing of restrictions comes with a series of health instructions in particular the need to respect a two-metre gap between people. The borders, closed to foreigners since March 14, remain shut but a decision on their reopening is expected on June 1. Since the start of the epidemic, Denmark has recorded 10,281 cases, with 514 deaths. France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall on the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March. The health ministry said 25,987 people were now confirmed to have died from the virus in hospitals and nursing homes. Over the past 24 hours, 178 people died from COVID-19, down from 278 on Wednesday. France\u2019s lowest daily death rate in recent weeks was reported on May 3 when 135 people were confirmed to have died. France is due to emerge from a lockdown on Monday that began in mid-March. As well as a decline in death rates, France also reported 186 fewer patients suffering from the coronavirus in intensive care, making a total of 2,961. This is the first time that the number in intensive care - which rose above 7,000 at its peak in April - has been below 3,000 since March 25. Nationwide, there were 23,208 patients in hospital, 775 fewer than the previous day. The World Health Organization has advised governments to clinically test a herbal drink touted by Madagascar\u2019s President Andry Rajoelina as a remedy against coronavirus. The Covid-Organics infusion is derived from artemisia - a plant with proven anti-malarial properties - and other indigenous herbs. Rajoelina hopes to distribute the infusion across West Africa and beyond, claiming it cures COVID-19 patients within 10 days. Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Niger have already received consignments of the potion. Others such as Tanzania have expressed interest. But the World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned that there are no published scientific studies of the herbal tea and that its effects have not been tested. \u201cWe would caution and advise countries against adopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,\u201d WHO Africa Director Matshidiso Moeti said. She urged Madagascar to put the drink \u201cthrough a clinical trial\u201d. A federal judge has ordered Massachusetts authorities to allow gun shops to reopen after the governor deemed them non-essential businesses that needed to close to slow the spread of the coronavirus. US District Judge Douglas Woodlock in Boston ruled that the restrictions ordered by governor Charlie Baker in response to the pandemic imposed an \u201cimproper burden\u201d on the constitutional rights of citizens seeking to possess firearms. Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad issued a decree Thursday postponing the country\u2019s parliamentary elections until July due to coronavirus. The elections were initially scheduled for April 13 but in March a presidential decree delayed them until May 20. The latest decree pushes the new date to July 19. Syria has recorded 45 cases of infections and three deaths because of COVID-19. The government has began gradually easing restrictions imposed since mid-March to fight the virus but schools and universities remain closed and a night-time curfew is in place. Georgia will lift its lockdown in the capital Tbilisi and allow shops to reopen on Monday as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia said. He told a televised cabinet meeting on Thursday that a lockdown imposed in another large city, Rustavi, would be lifted on May 14. The country would reopen to foreign tourists from July 1, with domestic tourism resuming from June 15. Tbilisi, Rustavi, Batumi and Kutaisi were locked down on April 15, with bans on vehicles entering or leaving. Batumi and Kutaisi were released last week. Georgia still has a state of emergency until May 22, which includes a night curfew, the closure of restaurants, cafes and most shops, the suspension of public transport and a ban on gatherings of more than three people. Gakharia said retail and wholesale stores, except those selling clothing and footwear, would reopen on May 11, provided they were not located in shopping malls. The construction and automotive sectors were allowed to resume on May 5. Georgia reported 615 cases of the coronavirus as of Thursday, with nine deaths. Fiorentina football club in Italy have announced they have found six new Covid-19 cases, three of them players and three staff, after the first round of medical tests. All the Serie A clubs are performing swab tests before the return to training. The Florence-based club said the individuals who tested positive have been isolated and the rest of the squad is due to begin training tomorrow. This is Jessica Murray signing off for the day, I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Nadeem Badshah. Thanks to everyone for reading along. Global death toll approaches 265,000. The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 264,679, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus. The US has the highest number of deaths, 73,573, followed by the UK with 30,150 and Italy with 29,684. International tourism to plunge by up to 80%. The number of international tourist arrivals could plunge by 60-80% in 2020 owing to the coronavirus, the World Tourism Organization has said. Widespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and national borders to curb the spread of the virus had plunged international tourism into its worst crisis since records began in 1950, the UN body said. Tourist arrivals fell by 22% in the first three months of the year and by 57% in March alone, with Asia and Europe recording the biggest declines, according to the Madrid-based organisation. Death toll rises by 539 in UK. The UK coronavirus death toll has reached 30,615 after a further 539 people died, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, revealed at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. In the 24 hours up to 9am on 7 May there were 86,583 tests for coronavirus in the UK \u2013 the fifth day running that testing was below the government\u2019s 100,000 target. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said testing numbers had dropped due to a \u201ctechnical hitch over the weekend\u201d but were now rising again. UK minister warns against abandoning social distancing rules. Raab said that if people \u201cabandon the social distancing rules\u201d the virus \u201cwill grow again at an exponential rate\u201d. He said the prime minister, Boris Johnson, would set out the roadmap for the next phase of lockdown on Sunday, along with the conditions for each milestone in the easing of restrictions. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that any changes [to the lockdown] in the short term will be modest, small, incremental.\u201d Trump tests negative for coronavirus after report valet was infected. Donald Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, have tested negative for coronavirus after finding out that a member of the US military who worked on the White House campus had become infected, a White House spokesman said. The military official was identified by CNN as personal valet to the US president. US unemployment claims hit 33.3 million. A further 3.2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from coronavirus continued to mount. The new applications brought the total number of jobless claims since mid-March to 33.3 million, which is 20% of the US workforce. However, the number of new claims reported each week by the Department of Labor has subsided since hitting a peak of 6.9 million in March. Russia overtakes Germany and France after record rise in cases. Russia overtook France and Germany for coronavirus cases on Thursday, giving it the fifth highest total in the world at 177,160. More than half of all cases and deaths have been in Moscow, which on Thursday reported a record overnight tally of 6,703 new cases, bringing its official total to 92,676. Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said research showed the real number of cases in the Russian capital was about 300,000, or more than triple the official figure. Donald Trump, offered to send medical aid to Moscow during a phone call with Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said. France to keep borders closed until at least mid-June. France\u2019s borders will remain closed until further notice following the lifting of the coronavirus lockdown on Monday, said the interior minister, Christophe Castaner. He said the restrictions would remain in place until at least 15 June. The country\u2019s health minister, Olivier Veran, said France would be able carry out 700,000 tests a week for the virus from Monday. Australia hits back at US claim linking coronavirus to Wuhan lab. The Australian government has pushed back at US claims the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan lab and has determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document. It is understood Scott Morrison\u2019s government sees the promotion of the theory that the virus leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan as counterproductive to Australia\u2019s push to gain broad international support for an independent inquiry into the origins and overall handling of the pandemic. The US embassy in Canberra declined to comment on a report in the Nine newspaper on Thursday of suspicions within senior ranks of the government and the intelligence community about a staffer\u2019s possible role. Guardian Australia understands Anthony Byrne, a Labor MP, has been in regular contact with the intelligence community and senior members of the government to support them in pushing back against US government claims. Virus exposes shortages across Africa\u2019s healthcare systems. African nations are facing a surge of Covid-19 cases with fewer than one intensive care bed and one ventilator per 100,000 people, a Reuters survey found. Even in a best-case scenario, the continent could need at least 10 times the numbers it has now as the outbreak peaks, an analysis of researchers\u2019 projections showed. The shortages across Africa\u2019s national health systems are among the starkest elements to emerge from the survey, which polled 54 countries and received responses from health officials or independent experts in 48 of them. The World Health Organization has warned that Africa, home to 1.3 billion people, could become the next centre of the pandemic. Schools in Norway, where the number of new cases of coronavirus is decreasing by the day, will be able to reopen as of Monday and bars from 1 June, the government said. Cultural and sporting events of up to 200 people will be permitted from 15 June, the government also said. The national football championship, which was due to start in April, can get underway on 16 June, with training resuming this Thursday. The Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, at a press conference: Our goal is that by June 15 we will have reopened most of the things that were closed. But there is an important condition. We will only end confinement on these dates if we manage to keep the epidemic under control. Norway adopted a semi-confinement regime in mid-March to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Kindergartens reopened on 20 April with primary schools returning a week later. \u201cThis is not the end,\u201d said the health minister, Bent Hoie. \u201cAt best, it\u2019s the beginning of the end\u201d. The infection ratio, that is, the number of people infected by each patient, has now fallen to 0.49, according to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, which means that the epidemic is on the decline. However, physical distancing remains the rule, travel abroad is officially discouraged and the borders remain closed to people without a residence permit. Norway has officially registered 7,995 cases of coronavirus, with 209 fatalities. As the coronavirus lockdown clamps down on the informal economy and tourism dries up, Egypt\u2019s most vulnerable are left without protection or food security. This powerful photo essay from Elle Kurancid and photographer Hamada Elrasam explores the lives of Egypt\u2019s most poor in the face of the coronavirus crisis. The director of public health for the Madrid region has resigned, apparently in protest at the regional government\u2019s decision to seek to loosen lockdown restrictions in the area of Spain hardest hit by the coronavirus. Yolanda Fuentes stepped down as the Madrid regional government, led by Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, prepares to seek permission from the national health ministry to move to the next phase of de-escalation from Monday 11 May. The next stage - known as phase one - will see the reopening of small businesses, and restaurant and bar terraces reopening at 30% capacity. Hotels and tourist accommodation will reopen, with the exception of communal areas. Fuentes is understood to have had grave reservations about the move, as Madrid remains badly affected by the virus. Of the 221,447 confirmed cases in Spain, 63,870 are in and around the capital. To date, more than 8,500 people have died from Covid-19 in the region. The French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, and his cabinet colleagues gave details of how France will end the strict lockdown on Monday. While saying the good news was that the whole country would see the end of some of the most draconian coronavirus restrictions, the \u201cnot so good news\u201d was that some areas - including the Paris region - were still designated \u201cred\u201d and would continue to face some rules. Philippe said the measures would be reviewed in three weeks. Ministers spoke about schools, transport, the reopening of businesses, and health measures. Some points of particular interest include: The French border will remain closed for the \u201cforseeable future\u201d to all except for absolutely essential professional or family reasons and trans-border workers, and they will still need to carry an international declaration. Anyone stopped by police or gendarmes - and extra officers will be on duty - making a journey of more than 100km will need a new sworn declaration stating the journey is absolutely essential for the above reasons. The 100km will be counted as the crow flies from their primary residence so they will also need to be carrying proof of primary residence. Parks will be closed in \u201cred\u201d departments. All beaches will be closed unless the local prefect and councillors decide otherwise, and can guarantee that health and distancing measures will be respected. Almost 90% of nursery and primary schools are ready to welcome back children. Priority will be given to children of frontline workers, the handicapped and those students who are struggling to keep up with home schooling. Public transport will be running but not at 100%. Employers are advised to stagger working hours to avoid rush hours on public transport or traffic jams on the road. Masks are obligatory on public transport. There will be fines of \u20ac135 for anyone travelling more than 100km without good reason, for anyone on an inter-regional train without a reservation, and fines for those who do not respect social distancing rules in public. South African Breweries (SAB), one of the world\u2019s largest brewers, says it may have to destroy 400m bottles of beer as a result of the country\u2019s ban on alcohol sales that is part of its lockdown measures. South Africa stopped all sales of alcohol when its lockdown came into effect on 27 March and the brewery has seen beer pile up at its production facilities. The brewer is seeking special permission from government to move the beer to other storage facilities. The transport of alcohol has also been outlawed in South Africa. SAB told news station eNCA that if it\u2019s not able to move the beer, which amounts to about 130m litres (34m gallons), it\u2019ll be forced to discard it at a loss of about $8m. That loss would put 2,000 jobs at risk, SAB said. It would also be frustrating news for millions of thirsty South African beer drinkers who are going without. South Africa is one of just a handful of countries that have prohibited alcohol sales as part of its fight against the coronavirus. India and Thailand also had bans on alcohol sales, but recently lifted their restrictions. Panama and Sri Lanka still have bans in place. The South African government has also banned the sales of cigarettes in the lockdown and has been criticised over its hard-line approach. Prof. Salim Abdool Karim, one of the government\u2019s top health advisers in the Covid-19 pandemic, defended the alcohol ban at a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. He said alcohol is a significant contributing factor to violent crime and road accidents in South Africa, and banning its sale has reduced pressure on medical services. Representatives of the alcohol industry say the government should allow alcohol to be purchased for consumption at home only. The UK\u2019s contact-tracing app must not be rolled out until the government has increased privacy and data protections, an influential parliamentary committee has said, as rights groups warn that the current trial is unlawful under the Data Protection Act. The joint committee on human rights said on Thursday it was essential legislation was enacted to ensure the mass surveillance of personal data did not result in a violation before the trial was expanded. Its report was published following a legal letter from the Open Rights Group warning of \u201cheightened and urgent concerns\u201d that the government had failed to follow laws requiring it to submit an assessment of the risks to the information commissioners office. The app, which is being trialled on the Isle of Wight, logs users\u2019 movements and can alert people if they have had contact with someone who has developed symptoms. Ministers have said it is an important tool to study the spread of Covid-19 and to help them ease lockdown restrictions. But privacy campaign groups have opposed its introduction and a group of UK academics working in cybersecurity, privacy and law recently signed a joint letter saying it could open the door to general surveillance. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, will proceed with maximum caution as he looks to the next phase of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus, a spokesman from his office said. The prime minister spoke to opposition party leaders today to update them on the government\u2019s strategy to combat coronavirus. He told them the government would approach the next phase with \u2018maximum caution\u2019 and his priority above all else would be to \u2018save lives\u2019 International tourism faces its worst crisis since records began, with up to 1.1 billion fewer people taking trips globally in 2020. The scale of the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s impact is outlined in a report by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), which predicts a decline in international arrivals of between 58% and 80% this year. This is due to widespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and borders worldwide. The prediction of a 58% decline is based on the gradual reopening of international borders and easing of travel restrictions in early July; the 80% figure is based on early December. Globally, the crisis threatens the livelihood of up to 120 million people who directly rely on tourism for work - and millions more indirectly \u2013 while representing a financial loss in export revenues from tourism of between \u00a3736bn and \u00a3971bn. The predictions are based on UNWTO figures for the first three months of this year, which show a worldwide decline in international arrivals of 22%. Following the start of the lockdown in many countries, arrivals dropped by 57% for March alone. Zurab Pololikashvili, UNWTO secretary general said. The world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis. Tourism has been hit hard, with millions of jobs at risk in one of the most labour-intensive sectors of the economy. More than 50% of shops on Paris\u2019 famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es avenue are expecting to reopen for business on 11 May, said the business committee representing the district in a statement. The committee said shops would have reinforced health and safety measures, and would be open from 11am-7pm from Monday to Saturday, and from 11am-6pm on Sunday. New York City will test 140,000 people for coronavirus antibodies between next week and early June, mayor Bill de Blasio announced. The antibody tests, which indicate whether a person has been infected with the virus at some point, will be offered for free by appointment at five locations around the city, de Blasio said. The results will be available to the individual in one to two days and will also be used for epidemiological research, he said. Researchers have said it is unclear whether antibodies for the coronavirus provide immunity or whether people who test positive for the antibodies can still be sickened by the virus. De Blasio said: We are not promising people a rose garden here. We\u2019re not saying the antibody test is the last word. Its not. But it tells you something. Blood tests are different from the nasal swab tests currently used to diagnose active Covid-19 infections. Instead, the tests look for blood proteins called antibodies, which the body produces days or weeks after fighting an infection. Most use a finger-prick of blood on a test strip. Health officials in the US and around the world have suggested the tests could be helpful in identifying people who have previously had the virus with or without getting sick and developed some immunity to it. But researchers haven\u2019t yet been able to answer many questions about the tests including what level of antibodies it takes to be immune and how long that immunity lasts. France is \u201cready to massively test\u201d people suspected of having the coronavirus and anyone who has come into contact with them from next week, the country\u2019s health minister said. Olivier Veran said France will be able carry out 700,000 tests a week for the virus from Monday when it begins the fraught process of relaxing its almost eight-week lockdown. The minister said the authorities - which have been heavily criticised for the lack of mass testing - now have enough capacity to cover the needs of the whole population. France has been one of the hardest hit European countries, with some 26,000 deaths since March. Testing and tracing are regarded as key to allowing the country to get back to work, by pinpointing those with the virus so they can be quickly isolated. Veran admitted that there may have been a \u201cgap between the theory and the practice\u201d of testing in France, with many people with doctor\u2019s prescriptions for tests unable to get them. But he insisted that \u201cour capacity for testing is today at the level of our estimated needs\u201d. Qatar has launched a new drive-through coronavirus testing programme to assess the prevalence of the disease in the wider population beyond the worst-affected groups where tests had been targeted. The Gulf monarchy of 2.75 million people has seen a relatively high number of cases with 18,890 testing positive. However its death rate with 12 fatalities is one of the world\u2019s lowest which experts say is down to the country\u2019s young population and mandatory health checks for its vast foreign workforce. Migrant labourers in the Industrial Area suburb of Doha and Qataris returning from virus hotspots like Iran have been the focus of testing efforts, along with those found to have been in contact with them. But a two-day pilot launched on Wednesday has seen citizens invited to participate in voluntary tests at several clinics across the country. Roberto Bertollini, an adviser to the health minister, said: The project aims at understanding what is the prevalence of the disease in the community - the community at large. We have a lot of data coming from the labourer community but not much from the overall community of white collar (workers) Qataris, and other populations. Tens of thousands of residents were quarantined in the Industrial Area after cases of Covid-19 were confirmed among the community in mid-March but authorities have begun to ease restrictions. \u201cThis will allow us to know how many people are actually infected today,\u201d added Bertollini. Senegal\u2019s Supreme Court has upheld a ban on repatriating the bodies of citizens living abroad who have died of coronavirus, rejecting a plea from their distraught relatives. A group of families with dead relatives abroad had sought to overturn the ban on the grounds that it violated their right to mourn and practice religion in the Muslim-majority West African country. Senegal\u2019s government had ruled out bringing back the bodies to stem the spread of the virus. Family members have said that around 80 Senegalese have died from Covid-19 overseas, including 40 in France alone. On Thursday, their lawyers said that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision had caused deep distress. They had argued during the proceedings that the health risk of bringing back bodies was \u201cnon-existent,\u201d and that the ban infringed religious rights. After weeks of mounting pressure, Toronto\u2019s mayor has pledged to make streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists as residents are encouraged to spend more time outside. In the coming weeks, the city plans to curtail traffic along select residential streets, expedite the creation of temporary bike lanes and close major roadways near to parks. The city\u2019s plan, dubbed \u2018ActiveTO\u2019, is an attempt to remedy growing frustration among residents that Toronto has been too slow to adjust its infrastructure to the coronavirus pandemic. Health officials have suggested residents spend time outside, but narrow sidewalks in Canada\u2019s largest city make physical distancing difficult. Part of the project involves curtailing the amount of cars allowed on residential streets while giving preference to pedestrians and cyclists. The new plan is modelled on the approach other urban centres have taken to ensure people can safely move around the city. \u201cThese quiet streets will roll out fairly quickly, and our initial target will be 50 kilometres of quiet streets,\u201d mayor John Tory said. \u201cOakland, Portland and San Francisco ... have already adopted similar quiet street projects.\u201d Tory also said the city will likely close major roads near parks on weekends to ensure pedestrians can safely enjoy time outside. Toronto has lagged behind other major cities like New York and London, who have shut down not only major roadways to provide residents with more walking space, but also started making permanent changes to city infrastructure. \u201cBetter late than never, and if you\u2019re going to do it later, it\u2019s good to see that it\u2019s quite vast,\u201d Amanda O\u2019Rourke, head of 8 80 cities, a non-profit that advocates for accessible cities, told the Toronto Star. The US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, laid out the broad outlines of the next massive coronavirus-response bill Democrats will seek, with possible votes as soon as next week. Pelosi said the bill\u2019s major components will include additional aid to state and local governments, more money for coronavirus testing and help for the financially-troubled US postal service. Just before she spoke, house minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, said such a bill was premature. Zoom plans to offer end-to-end encrypted meetings to all paying subscribers, as it seeks to quash criticism of its platform over security. The company, which has faced backlash from users for failing to disclose that its service was not fully encrypted, is planning to develop tools that will give more controls to meeting hosts and allow users to securely join a meeting. It also said on Thursday it had bought Keybase, a secure messaging and file-sharing service, for an undisclosed price as it sought the encryption engineering expertise to deliver complete encryption for its conferencing platform. After preparing the draft design, Zoom plans to host discussions with cryptographic experts and customers, and integrate feedback into a final design before rolling the feature out to users. Founded in 2014, Keybase is key directory that maps social media identities to encryption keys. Zoom has seen an extraordinary jump in users, now numbering 300 million a day, since the coronavirus crisis forced millions of people and students to work from home. But concerns about the security of its platform have led companies including Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Sweden\u2019s Ericsson to ban employees from using the platform. To address security concerns, Zoom embarked on a 90-day plan which has included hiring former Facebook security chief, Alex Stamos, and other known industry figures while launching new versions of its software with better encryption. France\u2019s borders will remain closed until further notice following the lifting of the coronavirus lockdown on 11 May, interior minister, Christophe Castaner, has said. During a news conference, he said: Since the start of the crisis the closure of the borders is the rule, and the authorisation to cross a border is the exception. We have to keep this protection in place, this will not change soon. He said that the restrictions would remain in place until at least 15 June. The US president, Donald Trump, offered to send medical aid to Moscow during a phone call on Thursday with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said. In a readout of the phone call, the Kremlin said the two presidents had also discussed global oil markets, noting their support for last month\u2019s output deal between OPEC and non-OPEC producers, something they said had helped stabilise oil prices. Times are truly strange when a man dressed in a grim reaper\u2019s costume in 90F (32C) heat is the most sane person around. But last week, as people flocked to Florida\u2019s recently reopened beaches, Daniel Uhlfelder had a message for beachgoers. \u201cThe grim reaper represents death. This is a deadly virus. It\u2019s a global pandemic,\u201d he said in a televised news broadcast. It\u2019s not in Uhlfelder\u2019s nature to want to keep beaches closed \u2013 as a lawyer, he has campaigned to keep beaches publicly accessible in the past. But as the coronavirus death toll reaches 75,000 in the US and global shutdowns help to slow the spread of the deadly virus, Uhlfelder felt he had to say something. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the pandemic getting out of control and killing a lot of people \u2026 I couldn\u2019t sleep at night [if I just did nothing],\u201d he says. And so, he came up with an idea to dress up with a cloak and scythe, and take a Grim Reaper tour of Florida\u2019s beaches. The protest has garnered national attention: Uhlfelder has appeared on Saturday Night Live, the Daily Show and CNN, and has raised thousands of dollars, which he will donate to Democrats who run for Congress. A coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 30% of inmates at a prison in Colombia has sparked fear among local officials, neighbours and prisoners\u2019 families that the virus may spread further. The prison in Villavicencio, Meta province, houses 1,756 inmates, of whom 599 have tested positive for Covid-19. Fifty-six guards and administrative staff have also tested positive. The prison currently has nearly double the 899 inmates it is meant to hold, creating an environment in which the virus can easily spread. Prison populations in Colombia average overcrowding of 50%, according to prison agency INPEC. \u201cThe prison in Villavicencio worries us, it is enormously overpopulated,\u201d Meta\u2019s governor, Juan Guillermo Zuluaga, told Reuters. \u201cRight now we don\u2019t have anyone in hospital, everyone inside the prison is asymptomatic.\u201d So far, Colombia has reported almost 9,000 Covid-19 cases and 397 deaths. While infected prisoners are isolated from the rest of the population, Villavicencio mayor, Juan Felipe Harman, fears the outbreak could spread into surrounding neighborhoods where thousands of people live. \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that the prison is a public health problem,\u201d Harman said. \u201cWe need to keep controlling that risk factor by guaranteeing isolation conditions within the prison are the same as the city.\u201d The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights warned this week that growth of coronavirus infections in crowded and unhygienic prisons in Latin America and the United States was a source of grave concern. Protests by prisoners fearing infection have led to riots and the deaths of dozens of inmates in Venezuela, Peru and Colombia in recent weeks. The Afghan health minister, Ferozuddin Feroz, has tested positive for Covid-19, the ministry\u2019s spokesman said, as the number of transmissions continued to surge in the war-torn country. Wahidullah Mayar said Feroz is in a stable condition and has isolated himself at home. The country has so far recorded 3,563 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 106 deaths. Fighting coronavirus is challenging in Afghanistan as despite government-authorised lockdowns, cities are crowded and war has intensified in recent days. Canada and the 10 provinces have agreed to boost the pay of essential workers, such as those working in seniors\u2019 residences where many coronavirus cases have occurred, prime minister Justin Trudeau said. Trudeau told a briefing that Ottawa would contribute $4bn CAD, which he said represented 75% percent of the total cost. The provinces will be responsible for determining who is essential and how much they receive, he added. London\u2019s Notting Hill Carnival, held annually over a long weekend in late August, has been cancelled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers announced. They said in a statement: After lengthy consultations with our strategic partners and our advisory council, the board has taken the decision that this year\u2019s carnival will not take place on the streets of Notting Hill as it has done for over 50 years. This has not been an easy decision to make, but the reality of the Covid-19 pandemic and the way in which it has unfolded means that this is the only safe option. Everyone\u2019s health has to come first. The west London carnival traces its roots back to Caribbean music festivals in the 1950s after the first surge in arrivals from former British colonies post-World War II. Feathered dancers, steel bands and earth-shaking sound systems feature in the vibrant two-day celebration of British Caribbean culture. Organisers added they were planning \u201can alternate\u201d event this year \u201cthat we hope will bring the Carnival spirit to people from the safety of their homes, and make them feel connected and engaged\u201d. \u201cWe will share more information on how it will take shape soon,\u201d they said, adding they looked forward to welcoming revellers back to the streets of Notting Hill in 2021. The US president, Donald Trump, and vice president, Mike Pence, have tested negative for coronavirus after finding out a member of the US military who worked on the White House campus had become infected, a White House spokesman said. The military official was identified by CNN as personal valet to Trump. Spokesman Hogan Gidley said in a statement: We were recently notified by the White House Medical Unit that a member of the United States Military, who works on the White House campus, has tested positive for coronavirus. The President and the Vice President have since tested negative for the virus and they remain in great health. Trump has now been tested at least twice for the coronavirus, with previous results on 2 April, and both times tested negative. On 3 April, the White House said that anyone expected to be near Trump or Pence would be given a rapid Covid-19 test out of an abundance of caution. The Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent, Andrew Roth, reports on the cancelled Victory Day celebrations in Russia, and what the coronavirus crisis means for Putin\u2019s political plans. If all had gone to plan, Vladimir Putin would have marked Victory Day in Red Square this weekend, hosting Emmanuel Macron and Xi Jinping as columns of soldiers and artillery passed by to honour the 75th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. The 9 May celebrations would have crowned a historic political season in Russia, including a symbolic referendum to amend Russia\u2019s constitution and reset Putin\u2019s term limits, allowing him to remain in the Kremlin until 2036. Instead, the coronavirus pandemic has brought on Russia\u2019s toughest crisis in years, scrapping the Kremlin\u2019s political agenda and putting the country\u2019s economy in peril amid a collapse in oil prices. Chinese researchers who tested sperm of men infected with Covid-19 found that a minority of them had the coronavirus in their semen, opening up a small chance the disease could be transmitted sexually, scientists have said. A study of 38 men hospitalised with the disease found that six of them, or 16%, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in their semen. The doctors at China\u2019s Shangqiu Municipal Hospital said the findings were preliminary and based on only a small number of infected men, and more research is needed to see whether sexual transmission might play a role in the spreading Covid-19. The team wrote in a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA): Further studies are required with respect to the detailed information about virus shedding, survival time and concentration in semen. If it could be proved that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted sexually ... (that) might be a critical part of the prevention, especially considering the fact that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the semen of recovering patients. Independent experts said the findings were interesting but should be viewed with caution and in the context of other small studies that have not found the coronavirus in sperm. A previous small study of 12 Covid-19 patients in China in February and March found that all of them tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 in semen samples. Allan Pacey, a professor of andrology at Britain\u2019s Sheffield University, said the studies should not be seen as conclusive, since there were some technical difficulties in testing semen for viruses. He said the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm did not show whether it is active and capable of causing infection. \u201cHowever, we should not be surprised if the virus which causes Covid-19 is found in the semen of some men, since this has been shown with many other viruses such as Ebola and Zika,\u201d he said. Sheena Lewis, a professor of reproductive medicine at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, stressed that this was a \u201cvery small study\u201d and said its findings were in keeping with other small studies showing low or no SARS-CoV-2 in tests of semen samples. \u201cHowever, the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 on male reproduction are not yet known,\u201d she said. This is Jessica Murray, taking back over the blog after a short break. The European Union executive will next week outline plans on lifting internal border controls within the passport-free travel zone. EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson told MEPs the commission will present guidance on lifting internal border controls in the 26-country Schengen free-travel zone, although she added that unwinding national restrictions would take some time. The Swedish commissioner said she had received dozens of letters from \u201cdesperate people\u201d about border closures, citing pensioners in Spain who had been planning to move to France, a Franco-Belgian couple separated by the border and people stranded in another EU member state. Speaking to the parliament\u2019s home affairs committee, Johansson said: The situation is now stable, but it does not mean that it is acceptable, preferable or viable for the future. People are understandably sad, angry, they are frustrated, which shows that free movement has become part of our everyday lives.\u201d EU member states have the ultimate power to open and close borders, but signatories of the European border-free travel zone are obliged to consult Brussels when they take measures to seal their frontiers. The UK and Ireland have never been part of the zone, which includes non-EU states, such as Norway and Switzerland. The EU executive is urging countries to coordinate on lifting restrictions, unlike when the pandemic first unfolded and governments hastily imposed restrictions. The commissioner also warned governments against any selective re-opening of borders: \u201cNo discrimination: member states cannot open borders for citizens from one EU country, but not from others. This is essential.\u201d France will gradually end its lockdown from Monday, French prime minister Edouard Philippe has confirmed but warned some restrictions will remain in place in the more densely-populated Paris region where Covid-19 is circulating quicker. \u201cFrom Monday we will progressively unwind the lockdown that started on March 17... but the country is cut in two, with the virus circulating more quickly in some regions, notably in the Ile de France region, which is very densely populated,\u201d he said. In other parts of France, secondary schools, cafes and restaurants may open from early June if the infection rate remains low. An outbreak of Covid-19 in a remote prairie community in a Canadian province has left health officials scrambling to halt further spread of the virus and protect vulnerable residents. In recent days, La Loche, Saskatchewan and the surrounding area have recorded 138 new cases of the coronavirus \u2014 representing 70% of all active cases in the province. \u201cPeople are taking it extremely seriously because these are more vulnerable situations,\u201d said Theresa Tam, the country\u2019s chief public health officer said Wednesday. The region is remote and home to a number of Indigenous communities, which expertise are likely to be a greater risk to the coronavirus. A sustained outbreak would likely overwhelm the region\u2019s limited health care capacity. Officials believe the virus was first transmitted into the town of La Loche from a nearby oil-sands work camp and is now spreading quickly. The province hopes to scale up testing, warning that numbers will rise as more tests are conducted. To date, two residents living in long term care homes have died of the virus. Part of the driving force behind the spread is likely the tightly-knit nature of the La Loche, which has a population of 2,800 people. \u201cEverybody knows everybody. Everybody visits everybody. Somebody new comes to town and we\u2019re there with open arms to say, \u2018Hi!\u2019\u201d Amanda Black told CBC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know of even having a rule around here where you knock on the door before you walk into someone\u2019s house.\u201d One in five people aged under 35 is feel lonely as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown, according to a Europe-wide survey which suggests the young are feeling the strain of the lockdown more than older adults. The report, which surveyed 85,000 people across the continent, found a sharp deterioration in the quality of life among all ages but even more so among younger people, 20% of whom now said they were lonely \u2013 up from just 4% in normal times. With most Europeans confined to their homes by the coronavirus outbreak, overall 16% said they were lonely \u201call or most of the time\u201d over the past two weeks \u2013 compared to 6% who described themselves as lonely in surveys before the crisis. The report was conducted by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, an agency of the EU. The agency said: This probably implies that young people feel they have been more affected by the restrictions than other age groups, with social events being cancelled and their inability to meet their friends and family outside the household.\u201d Younger adults also reported lower levels of overall happiness and satisfaction, and lower mental health scores than their older peers, although they were more likely to be optimistic about the future. The report found differences across countries, with Greeks and Bulgarians reporting the lowest level of life satisfaction. Meanwhile, loneliness was most common among the French. Good afternoon folks, it\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the live blog while my colleague, Jessica Murray, takes a break. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will announce a very limited easing of Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown next week, adopting a cautious approach to ensure there is no second peak of infections that could further hurt the economy. Johnson is due to announce the next steps in Britain\u2019s battle to tackle Covid-19 on Sunday following a review by ministers of the current measures that have all but shut the economy and kept millions at home. His government has been criticised for moving too slowly to tackle the outbreak which has led to more than 30,000 deaths in Britain, and after more than six weeks of lockdown, ministers are judging how and when to relax it. Ministers, who say they have taken the right decisions at the right time, fear a swift easing could lead to a second peak in infection rates, which might overwhelm hospitals and force a second shutdown of the economy. At a cabinet meeting of his top ministers, Johnson said Britain would advance \u201cwith maximum caution\u201d and be guided by the science and data when considering whether any of the strict social distancing measures could be eased. His spokesman told reporters: Any easement to the guidelines next week will be very limited. We are at a critical moment in the fight against the virus and we will not do anything which risks throwing away the efforts and sacrifices of the British public. Earlier, the Bank of England underlined how deeply the lockdown had hurt the economy, saying Britain could be headed for its biggest economic slump in over 300 years. Johnson, who says he fought for his life after himself contracting Covid-19, has ploughed money into a support programme for businesses, but appears to be erring on the side of caution of immediately firing up the economy. Bulgaria\u2019s football league will resume on 5 June, the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) has decided, with clubs allowed to start training as early as mid-May. The league was stopped on 13 March when the country declared a state of emergency over the spread of coronavirus. \u201cProvided that the training process restarts in mid-May, the First Professional Football League will resume on June 5 with the matches from the 25th round of the regular season,\u201d the BFU said in a statement. \u201cThe plan is for the 2019/2020 season to end on July 11,\u201d it added. The matches will be played behind closed doors. If new \u201cforce majeure circumstances\u201d lead to a new stoppage of the league, it will not resume again and the final round results will be considered as final, the federation said. Last year\u2019s champions Ludogorets Razgrad currently lead the league table with 55 points and a match less than Lokomotov Plovdiv, Levski Sofia and CSKA Sofia, who have 46 points each. The German airline giant Lufthansa has confirmed that it is in talks for Berlin to offer support worth \u20ac9bn euros in exchange for a 25% stake in the company, as the coronavirus batters the world\u2019s carriers. The \u201cstabilisation package\u201d under discussion with the Federal Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) launched in March would include \u201ca silent participation and a secured loan\u201d, Lufthansa said. \u201cThe conditions are currently being discussed. A stake by the German government in the company\u2019s share capital is also part of the negotiations.\u201d Earlier on Thursday, the economy minister Peter Altmaier had told the tabloid newspaper Bild that Lufthansa was part of Germany\u2019s \u201cfamily silver\u201d and that Berlin aimed to avoid a \u201cfire sale\u201d of valuable firms. Meanwhile Bloomberg news reported that some members of Altmaier and chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s centre-right CDU/CSU parliamentary group were holding up talks with opposition to a direct government stake in Lufthansa. \u201cThe negotiations and the process of political decision-making are still ongoing,\u201d the airline said in its statement. Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr has previously warned that the group is bleeding cash and might have to declare insolvency. Like airlines worldwide, Lufthansa and its subsidiaries that include Swiss and Austrian Airlines have been essentially grounded and face an uncertain future once operations are fully up and running again. Italy\u2019s government and Roman Catholic bishops have signed an agreement to allow people to attend Masses again from later this month, ending a standoff between the Church and state over the coronavirus lockdown. The government banned attendance at Masses in early March, part of its prohibition on gatherings as it sought to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Many Catholics asserted that church services should have been permitted along with other essential activities such as food shopping. Tensions ran high again late last month when the government announced a gradual staged easing of the lockdown, but did not include a return to Masses in a phase that began on 4 May. The bishops told the government they could \u201cnot accept seeing the exercise of freedom of religion being compromised\u201d. Most of Italy\u2019s churches have remained open during the crisis, but only for individual prayer. Catholics have been following Masses on television or on the internet as priests led them from empty churches. With Thursday\u2019s agreement, Masses for the public can resume on 18 May but under strict conditions outlined in a protocol signed by prime minister Giuseppe Conte and Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti, president of the Italian Bishops Conference. Individual pastors will determine the maximum number of people who can fit in a church while staying at least a metre apart. If there is demand, additional Masses should be held, rather than allowing more people into the church for one service, the protocol says. The faithful will have to wear masks in church. Priests can celebrate most of the Mass without masks but they will have to wear one, as well as gloves, when they distribute the communion wafer. Initially, choirs will be banned, holy water fonts will remain dry, and the traditional exchange of a sign of peace - usually in the form of a handshake - will be eliminated. The collection, in which a basket is passed around for offerings of money, will be replaced by containers where the faithful can make contributions. The Masses will resume on the same day Italian museums and libraries can reopen. The Vatican, which for the most part has been mirroring Italy\u2019s containment measures, has not yet said when St Peter\u2019s Basilica or the Vatican museums will reopen. Coronavirus restrictions in Moscow have been extended until 31 May, the city\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said on in a blog post on his personal website. Some measures in place since late March will be eased from 12 May, he said, including the return to work for industrial and construction companies. But Sobyanin added it was still too early to reopen sports facilities, restaurants and theatres. Moscow is the centre of Russia\u2019s coronavirus crisis, with 92,676 of the country\u2019s 177,160 cases, though Sobyanin said earlier the real number of cases in the capital was around 300,000. Blood tests have begun in the region around Rome to allow authorities to gauge how many people have been exposed to the coronavirus since the epidemic struck Italy. More data will help to map out how the virus has travelled through the population, as the country begins to emerge from the health crisis that has killed nearly 30,000 of its citizens. Over the following few days, the region of Lazio - of which Rome is the capital - will perform some 150,000 blood tests on health workers and police, those assumed to be most exposed to the virus. Such tests have already begun in other regions, especially Lombardy in Italy\u2019s north which has been hardest hit by the coronavirus. Sergio Bernardini, a professor in biochemistry and director of the lab at Rome\u2019s Tor Vergata hospital, said the large-scale screening efforts will produce a closer estimate of the number of people who have been infected with the virus. \u201cIn reality, they\u2019re probably much more numerous, eight to ten times more than the figures we have today,\u201d Bernardini told AFP. The tests, which require just a finger prick of blood, look for the presence of antibodies indicating that the person has been exposed to the virus at some point. The hope is that the person has developed immunity to the virus, although that is not guaranteed. Bernardini cautioned: [A positive result] does not mean that you are protected, it is not a licence to return to normal daily life. It\u2019s absolutely necessary to continue using ... masks, which are still the most important thing, even more important than knowing if you have antibodies. The blood tests differ from the more common swab tests, which check molecules from nasal secretions to know whether a person currently has the virus. Pakistan will begin easing its nationwide lockdown over the weekend, prime minister Imran Khan has said, citing the economic havoc the measures have wreaked, even as increased testing shows a rise in new coronavirus cases. Khan called on the public to continue following social distancing guidelines as businesses start to reopen in phases, saying another lockdown would be imposed if cases spiked again. \u201cWe need to discipline ourselves,\u201d said Khan in a televised address announcing the easing of the lockdown would begin on Saturday. \u201cWe can\u2019t send the police to make raids. In an independent society this doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Schools will remain closed until mid-July, while there were no plans to restart public transportation or domestic flights just yet. The easing of the lockdown comes with many across the country already openly flouting its restrictions and gathering in public, especially during the evenings as people celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. Last month, authorities buckled under pressure from religious groups ahead of Ramadan and allowed mosques to hold daily prayers and evening congregations after clerics promised to instruct religious leaders to clean their facilities regularly. Thousands of shoppers have also thronged popular markets, including many without wearing protective gear, to buy food for the evening iftar meal that celebrates the end of each day\u2019s fasting. Infections have been rising steadily as testing has increased, with over 23,000 cases recorded in the nation of over 210 million people. The death toll in Pakistan however remains low, at 564, according to government figures. Japan has approved Gilead Sciences\u2019 remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19, the health ministry said, making it the country\u2019s first officially authorised drug for the coronavirus. Remdesivir will be give to patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms, a Japanese health ministry official said at a press briefing. With no other approved treatments for Covid-19, interest in the drug is growing around the world. Gilead on Tuesday said it was in discussion with several companies, including generic drugmakers in India and Pakistan to produce remdesivir in large quantities. Remdesivir was granted authorisation last week by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in treating Covid-19. Japan, with just over 16,000 infections and under 800 deaths, has recorded fewer cases than other major industrialised nations. However, a steady rise in cases has put pressure on medical facilities in some parts of the country, and a drug that helps patients recover more quickly could help in freeing up hospital beds. On Monday, Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, extended a month-long state of emergency until the end of May. After standing empty for two months, Greece\u2019s ancient sites, including the Acropolis hill towering over Athens, will reopen to visitors on 18 May, authorities said. The ancient monuments were closed along with museums in mid-March as part of Greece\u2019s lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Restrictions have gradually been eased this week. Museums will open again in mid-June while open-air performances will resume in mid-July, the culture minister, Lina Mendoni, said. Distance and safety rules will apply. The many historical sites are one of the mainstays of Greece\u2019s vital tourism sector and efforts will now kick in to encourage visitors, after travel restrictions and widespread closures caused a collapse in bookings. Hundreds of musicians, actors and art workers rallied outside parliament to demand more support for their sector. \u201cWe are here,\u201d read a message drawn in chalk on the street. Protesters waved a giant theatre puppet. In the northern city of Thessaloniki, musicians performed tied up in a red and white cordon tape. Many artists have performed live online for those staying home since Greece reported its first case of the new coronavirus in February. \u201cWe stayed home but we didn\u2019t stay silent,\u201d artists\u2019 unions said in a statement. Poland plans to test 1,000 miners a day for coronavirus at drive-through sites, as data showed a rapid growth in new cases in the coal region. The country has reported 14,898 infections, including 737 deaths. Earlier this week the Silesia mining region in southern Poland showed the highest number of infections at 3,025. \u201cI have become acquainted with the situation in Silesia. It is very complicated, because it is a large agglomeration, with a huge density of workplaces,\u201d the chief sanitary inspector said in a statement. Poland\u2019s biggest coal group, PGG, which employs around 40,000 people, has reported 384 cases of coronavirus among its workers, its spokesman said, adding that 1,516 were in quarantine. In the last 24 hours, there were 1,494 tests in the Silesia region. In total 481 miners are infected in Poland, which generates most of its electricity from coal. PGG, which is also struggling with falling prices and demand for coal and rising stockpiles, closed three of its eight mines due to the epidemic. Another three million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Lauren Aratani report. As the coronavirus pandemic continues to extract its terrible toll on the US jobs market, some 33 million jobless Americans have now made claims in the past seven weeks. The latest figures from the US labor department come ahead of the first official monthly report on the American jobs market since the pandemic triggered lockdowns across the country. In March, the official unemployment rate in the US was 4.4%, close to a 50-year low, but economists predict it could now be as high as 20%, a level unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. The pace of layoffs has overwhelmed state unemployment systems across the country. Over a million people in North Carolina have now made unemployment insurance benefit claims, equivalent to 20% of the state\u2019s workforce. S ome four million have applied in California and the state\u2019s jobless benefits fund is \u201cvery close\u201d to running out, governor Gavin Newsom said this week. Germany will have to learn to live with the coronavirus, building tactics such as physical distancing and strict hygiene into normal daily life, the country\u2019s leading public health institution has said, as it wound up its regular press briefings on the pandemic as a result of a continued fall in new infections. Lars Schaade, the vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute, said that as Germany\u2019s infection rate had been \u201csubstantially pushed back\u201d, the decision to drop its briefing \u2013 which has attracted millions of viewers since it began in February, first daily and later twice weekly \u2013 marked a \u201cnew phase\u201d. He said: The epidemic is of course not over. But having substantially pushed the virus back so that the number of new cases are between 600 and 1,300 a day \u2026 our approach now has to be to learn to live with the virus and to control it. Journalists attending the briefing strongly voiced their opposition to it being scrapped. It has provided the public and media with detailed information on Germany\u2019s infection rates, up-to-date information on the virus\u2019s development, and explanations on preventive measures and the science behind public health decisions, free of any political colouring. Schaade said the media could continue to put questions to the institute\u2019s press department and there would be press conferences in the event of significant developments. The number of international tourist arrivals could plunge by 60-80% in 2020 owing to the coronavirus, the World Tourism Organization said, sharply lowering its previous forecast. Widespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and national borders to curb the spread of the virus had plunged international tourism into its worst crisis since records began in 1950, the UN body said in a statement. Tourist arrivals fell by 22% in the first three months of the year, and by 57% in March alone, with Asia and Europe suffering the biggest declines, according to the Madrid-based organisation. \u201cThe world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis. Tourism has been hit hard, with millions of jobs at risk in one of the most labour-intensive sectors of the economy,\u201d the body\u2019s secretary general, Zurab Pololikashvili, said. Airlines have suffered the most since the outbreak began in China in late 2019 with most flights grounded, but hotel groups, cruise operators and tour operators are also reeling. The UN body had forecast at the beginning of the year that international tourism would grow by 3-4% in 2020 but then revised its forecast at the end of March, predicting a 20-30% decline. It now said the full extent of the fall in international tourism will depend on the duration of travel restrictions and shutdown of borders. Under a best-case scenario, with travel restrictions starting to ease in early July, international tourist arrivals could fall by just 58% If borders and travel restrictions are only lifted in early December the fall would be more on the order of 78%. Saudi Arabia has formed a police unit to monitor violations of rules banning gatherings of more than five people imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the state news agency SPA said. The kingdom had previously said such gatherings were prohibited and said on Thursday that those breaching the rules would be punished by law. It also encouraged people to report in breach of the restrictions. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia overtook France and Germany on Thursday to become the fifth highest in the world after a record daily rise. Moscow\u2019s mayor said the real figure, not captured by official statistics, was much higher. The official tally surged to 177,160, meaning Russia now has more registered cases than Germany or France, as the number of new coronavirus cases jumped by 11,231 in the past 24 hours. More than half of all cases and deaths are in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak, which on Thursday reported a record overnight increase of 6,703 new cases, bringing its official total to 92,676. But Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said research showed the real number of cases in the Russian capital was around 300,000, or more than triple the official figure. Sobyanin, a close ally of president Vladimir Putin, said the number of cases was rising steeply because authorities had doubled the amount of tests they were carrying out in Moscow. Nationwide, Russia says it has conducted over 4.8 million tests. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve identified so many sick people is a huge plus, not a minus,\u201d Sobyanin told state TV. Identifying people who were infected meant they could be quarantined and the spread of the virus slowed, he said. Russia\u2019s official death toll, which remains far lower than in many countries - something that has been called into question by some Kremlin critics - rose to 1,625 on Thursday after 88 people died overnight, official figures showed. Despite rising infections, Sobyanin said there were some encouraging signs and that the number of people being hospitalised in Moscow in the past two weeks had stabilised. More people had been discharged than hospitalised on Thursday, he said. Putin on Wednesday backed a plan put forward by Sobyanin to gradually begin lifting some lockdown restrictions after 12 May, allowing certain industrial facilities to begin working. Sobyanin said on Thursday that anyone who used public transport after 12 May would need to wear a mask and gloves to offset the risks that came with the partial easing. Egypt has extended a nationwide nighttime curfew until the end of the holy month of Ramadan to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, announced. Finland\u2019s government will work remotely at least until the end of this week as a precaution, it said, after two ministers were possibly exposed to the coronavirus this week. The minister of social affairs and health, Aino-Kaisa Pekonen, and the minister of employment, Tuula Haatainen, were on Tuesday in the same room with a person suspected to have contracted the disease. They met with some of the government\u2019s other ministers on Wednesday. A virtual meeting of South African lawmakers has been disrupted by hackers who flooded the video call with pornographic images, Associated Press reports. In the the incident on Thursday, the hackers also hurled racial and sexual insults at the meeting\u2019s chairwoman, Thandi Modise, who is the speaker of the National Assembly. South Africa\u2019s parliament is closed and all its meetings are currently held by video conference calls, as the country remains under strict lockdown restriction. A shocked Modise said that she had earlier warned about using the virtual video call platform Zoom for the meeting. The parliamentary meeting later continued with a different link. At least one other South African parliament video call has been similarly hacked. Zoom has been facing criticism internationally as a result of reports of hackers who disrupt meetings by posting offensive content - being referred to as \u2018Zoom-bombing\u2019. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands have risen by 455 to 41,774, with 84 new deaths, health authorities have said. The country\u2019s death toll stands at 5,288, the National Institute for Health (RIVM) said in its daily update. The RIVM cautioned that it only reports confirmed cases, and actual numbers are higher. The first wave of a massive exercise to bring home hundreds of thousands of Indians stuck abroad is underway, with two flights preparing to leave from the United Arab Emirates. India banned all incoming international flights in late March as it imposed one of the world\u2019s strictest virus lockdowns, leaving vast numbers of workers and students stranded. Some 15,000 nationals will be repatriated from 12 countries on planes and naval ships, in a mammoth exercise which saw the civil aviation ministry\u2019s website crash on Wednesday as panicked citizens rushed to register. Two warships have steamed to the Maldives and another to the UAE - home to a 3.3-million-strong Indian community which makes up some 30% of the Gulf state\u2019s population. The consulate in Dubai said that it alone had received almost 200,000 applications, appealing on Twitter for \u201cpatience and cooperation\u201d as India undertakes the \u201cmassive task\u201d of repatriation. As Indian citizens with coveted tickets arrived at Abu Dhabi and Dubai airports for the first two flights on Thursday, the consulate said medical assessments were underway and that so far all passengers were cleared in antibody tests. The EU\u2019s foreign affairs wing, the European external action service (EEAS), is embroiled in an embarrassing row after allowing the Chinese government to censor an open letter from EU ambassadors published in Beijing\u2019s China Daily newspaper. The letter, calling for closer relations with China, was published without the original references to coronavirus having emerged first in China. A spokesperson for the EEAS spoke of regret that the letter was \u201cnot published in full by the China Daily\u201d, after the editing was highlighted in a report by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung. The change was said to have been agreed with \u201cconsiderable reluctance\u201d. The sentence deleted referred to \u201cthe outbreak of the coronavirus in China, and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world over the past three months\u201d. The row follows claims last month that an EEAS report about Chinese disinformation over Covid-19 had been watered down in response to pressure from Beijing. The allegation has been denied. Black men and women are more than four times more likely to die with coronavirus than white people in England and Wales, the Office for National Statistics said. The data, compiled from analysis conducted between 2 March and 10 April, is the latest to indicate marked differences in how the outbreak affects different ethnic groups. A University College London study also indicated a disproportionate effect on people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. The ONS analysis suggested black males in England and Wales were 4.2 times more likely to die after contracting Covid-19. The figure rose to 4.3 for black women. It also found people of Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian, Chinese and mixed heritage had an increased risk of death compared to those from white backgrounds. The ONS said its findings suggested differences were in part a result of geographic and socioeconomic factors, such as deprivation. \u201cHowever, these factors do not explain all of the difference, suggesting that other causes are still to be identified,\u201d it added. Vietnam reported 17 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, all of which were imported infections involving Vietnamese citizens repatriated from virus-hit areas, the health ministry said. The southeast Asian country has registered a cumulative total of 288 infections and has recorded no deaths, the ministry said. Nearly 21,000 people have been quarantined. A new report suggests that January\u2019s Sundance film festival, the annual gathering of cinephiles in Park City, Utah, may have been a key early hub for coronavirus in the US. The article, in the Hollywood Reporter, cites numerous attendees who experienced Covid-19-like symptoms either during or immediately after the festival. None were believed to have been tested for the disease. Sundance this year attracted about 120,000 people to the small mountain resort, to watch films and party in confined spaces. The snowy conditions that make Park City perfect for skiing mean that socialising indoors is common, as are some flu-like symptoms as a result of the low temperature and high altitude. Yet this year\u2019s \u201cSundance plague\u201d appears to have been more virulent for regular attendees than earlier iterations, with many complaining of considerable difficulties breathing, multiple trips to hospital and at least a fortnight bedbound. The Hollywood Reporter cites \u2013 but declines to name \u2013 one major actor who apparently became \u201cgravely ill\u201d after the festival, as did members of his entourage. Syria has postponed a parliamentary election for a second time as part of measures to protect the war-battered country from the coronavirus pandemic. The Syrian government has recorded 44 cases, including three deaths in areas under its control, while the Kurdish administration in northeastern Syria has reported three cases, including one death. The president\u2019s office said on its official social media accounts that the vote will be pushed back to 19 July, from the scheduled date of 20 May as \u201cpart of preventive measures\u201d to combat the virus. The polls, to be held across government-run areas, are the third since the start of a conflict nine years ago that has killed at least 384,000 people. They were initially supposed to happen on 13 April before the government in March enforced a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. President Bashar al-Assad warned on Monday of a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d if the easing of lockdown measures in the country is mishandled. A night-time curfew is still in force and travel is prohibited between provinces. But the government last week started to gradually lift restrictions by allowing markets and businesses to reopen during the day. This week, it said sermons would resume in mosques from Friday. The Israeli government has continued to relax its lockdown restrictions, going further than many countries by opening shopping centres, market and gyms on Thursday. It also announced that preschools would restart on Sunday. Imposing early and stringent lockdowns, while also virtually shutting down its borders, the small country of 9 million has seen significant drops in reported coronavirus cases over the past two weeks. Around 16,300 people in Israel have tested positive for the coronavirus, with 239 fatalities. Recent counts have seen less than 50 new confirmed cases per day, with twice as many recoveries as people with the virus. For malls and markets, patrons will be required to wear masks, have their temperature taken and remain two metres apart, with a limited number of people allowed in at any time. Preschools will be limited to 17 children in one group. Gyms will also cap the number of participants. The Israeli government also relaxed regulations on people arriving in the country. Previously, almost all arrivals were ordered to isolate for two weeks in government-run hotels. Now, some people will be allowed to self-isolate in their own homes if they can prove they won\u2019t infect others. Calls to domestic violence hotlines in Europe are up by as much as three-fifths, as alcohol and drug abuse combine with close confinement in coronavirus lockdowns to fuel abuse of the most vulnerable, the World Health Organization has said. WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, cited reports from many countries including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russia, Spain and Britain of increases in violence against women and men by an intimate partner and against children during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cAlthough data is scarce, member states are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year compared to last,\u201d he told an online briefing from Copenhagen. Online enquiries to violence prevention hotlines had increased by up to five times, the agency said, calling the issue a global problem. Kluge noted some countries had provided examples of how to address the issue. Italy has an app to ask for help without a phone call, while victims can alert pharmacists in Spain and France through code words. Hotels in France and Belgium have converted to shelters, and Greenland has limited the sale of alcohol to make homes safer for children. Kluge said: With job losses, rising alcohol-based harm and drug use, stress and fear, the legacy of this pandemic could haunt us for years. US scientists are working to understand a rare, life-threatening inflammatory syndrome in children associated with exposure to the coronavirus by quickly assembling clinical trials and patient registries. Cases were first reported in Britain, Italy and Spain, but now doctors in the United States are seeing clusters of children with the disorder, which can attack multiple organs, impair heart function and weaken heart arteries. At least one child in Britain has died. No children are believed to have died so far in the US, \u201cbut that could change,\u201d said Dr Sean O\u2019Leary, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado who serves on the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious disease. O\u2019Leary said efforts are getting underway to collect information on the disorder: \u201cEvery academic centre I know of is looking for these cases and trying to systematically track them.\u201d The New York department of health reported 64 cases of the new syndrome as of 5 May, and is calling on hospitals to immediately report any cases to the department. It did not say how many children tested positive for the coronavirus, but said it believes the syndrome is potentially associated with Covid-19. Georgia will lift its lockdown of the capital Tbilisi on 11 May and allow shops to reopen next week as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, prime minister Giorgi Gakharia has said. He told a televised cabinet meeting that a lockdown imposed in another large Georgian city, Rustavi, would be lifted on 14 May, and that the ex-Soviet republic of 3.7 million people would reopen to foreign tourists from 1 July. Tbilisi, Rustavi, Batumi and Kutaisi were locked down on 15 April, with bans on entry or exit of vehicles, to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Batumi and Kutaisi were taken out of lockdowns last week. Georgia reported 615 cases of coronavirus infections as of Thursday, with nine deaths. Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Pacheco, the Spanish former policeman accused of being the most notorious interrogator and torturer of the Franco era, has died from the coronavirus in a Madrid hospital, according to reports in the local media. Gonz\u00e1lez Pacheco, who was 73, was nicknamed Billy El Ni\u00f1o (Billy the Kid) for his habit of spinning a gun around his finger while brutalising those he questioned. Efforts to extradite him to Argentina to face trial on torture charges under the principle of universal jurisdiction failed in 2014 after judges in Spain ruled that the statute of limitations had expired. Gonz\u00e1lez Pacheco could not be tried in Spain because of the amnesty law that helped the country return to democracy following Franco\u2019s death in 1975. Spain\u2019s socialist-led coalition government had been attempting to strip Gonz\u00e1lez Pacheco of his medals and the pension increases to which they entitled the former officer, but had not managed to do so by the time he died. One of Gonz\u00e1lez Pacheco\u2019s most outspoken victims died from the coronavirus at the end of March. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda \u201cChato\u201d Galante, a veteran campaigner for truth, justice and historical memory in Spain, was imprisoned and tortured under the dictatorship. By a quirk of fate, the two men ended up living just a 10-minute walk from each other in Madrid. Speaking to the Guardian in 2018, Galante recalled his torture by \u201cthat idiot Billy the Kid, who\u2019d killed other people and could kill you while making Bruce Lee noises\u201d. He also said that he was still unable to fathom how the regime and its torturers had treated himself and others. \u201cI couldn\u2019t treat an animal the way they treated me,\u201d he said. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t. No animal could do that; only human beings are capable of torture.\u201d Despite his experiences, Galante remained optimistic and was determined to see justice done for all Franco\u2019s victims. He was also never deserted by his sense of humour. When asked how he had come to spend so much time in prison for trying to oppose the regime. he replied: \u201cThey arrested me a lot of times; I\u2019ve always been more of a dreamer than an expert.\u201d InterContinental Hotels expects sales to have plunged by a record 80% in April as the coronavirus outbreak shuts its chains, including Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn. InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG), the world\u2019s largest hotel operator by number of rooms, added that global revenue per available room - a key industry measure - tanked 55% in March, when the world implemented mass lockdowns to contain the deadly Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cCovid-19 represents the most significant challenge both IHG and our industry have ever faced,\u201d said chief executive, Keith Barr. With around 15% of its hotels currently shut, IHG has offered facilities to frontline health workers and the homeless. The group franchises, leases, manages or owns about 5,900 hotels, which together comprise almost 882,000 rooms in more than 100 countries. Iran said on Thursday its coronavirus outbreak was \u201crelatively stable\u201d as it announced another 68 deaths, as well as more than 1,000 infections for a fourth straight day. The Islamic republic has battled to contain the Middle East\u2019s deadliest outbreak of Covid-19 since reporting its first cases in mid-February. On Saturday, the government\u2019s official tally of daily infections hit 802 - its lowest level since 10 March. Iran\u2019s count stayed below 1,000 again on Sunday, however its caseload has bounced back up above that mark on each day since then. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the situation was \u201crelatively stable\u201d as he announced that the latest fatalities took the overall death toll to 6,486. Jahanpour said there were 1,485 new cases of infection, putting the country\u2019s outbreak total at 103,135. \u201cMore than 986 of these individuals had mild to moderate symptoms, or they were outpatients, or family members of infected patients,\u201d he said. Of all those infected, he added, 82,744 people had recovered from the illness and been discharged from hospital. A European coalition is forming around an approach to using smartphone technology to trace coronavirus infections that, its backers hope, could help to reopen borders without unleashing a second wave of the pandemic. As countries rush to develop apps that would use Bluetooth short-range wireless to identify those who have come into contact with people infected with the virus, controversy has erupted over how best to handle the personal data they collect. Britain and France argue people should trust their health authorities to hold such information on a central computer server. A loose coalition of other nations, led by Switzerland and including Germany and Italy, believe data should be kept only on handsets so that it would be impossible for governments to spy on their citizens. Crucially for the coalition, its approach is compatible with that of US technology giants Apple and Google, whose iOS and Android operating systems run 99% of the world\u2019s smartphones. Apple has, on privacy grounds, erected a roadblock to centralised apps by preventing the Bluetooth low energy function on its iPhones from monitoring other devices while running in the background. That means for such apps to work, they would need to be open while the phone is unlocked - a pain for the user and a drain on the battery. Attempted workarounds have proven to be unreliable. Supporters of the phone-based approach from Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland this week backed a roadmap view to enable national apps to \u2018talk\u2019 to each other and handle infections when people travel abroad. \u201cEverything about these projects has from day one been about how we can make it work on an international level,\u201d said Marcel Salathe, a digital epidemiologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. My colleague Dan Collyns has this dispatch from Lima: In the final hours before Covid-19 claimed her life, Cecilio Sangama watched helplessly as his eldest sister Edith gasped for breath. Hospitals across Peru\u2019s largest Amazon city had run out of oxygen, and the shortage had pushed the black market price of a cylinder well above $1,000 (\u00a3810). \u201cHer body could not hold on. She needed oxygen but we just couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d said Sangama, 49, a municipal worker, speaking by telephone from Iquitos. \u201cI had promised her: \u2018Don\u2019t worry sister, today I will find you a cylinder,\u2019\u2026 but in the end, there was nothing I could do.\u201d His voice broke and he fell silent for a few seconds. \u201cMy sister died just a few hours ago, we are trying to find the way to give her a Christian burial.\u201d Read the full story here: A key US senate democrat pushed back on republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell\u2019s, drive to protect employers from coronavirus-related lawsuits when the economy begins to reopen, saying it would be unnecessary if the White House set clearer standards. Republicans and business groups warn that companies could face a flood of litigation from employees and customers who become infected after operations resume. Plaintiff advocates counter that employers are protected by legal barriers, including the difficulty of demonstrating where Covid-19 infections occur. McConnell has made a bill protecting employers a top priority as Congress weighs what next steps to take to address a pandemic that has killed more than 71,000 Americans and thrown more than 26 million out of work. Republicans, led by president Donald Trump, have pushed for a reopening of state economies, saying Americans can no longer endure the toll of shuttered businesses and lost livelihoods. \u201cThe president is forcing workers back into unsafe plants and Mitch McConnell is trying to slam the courthouse door on the workers who get hurt,\u201d democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse told Reuters. Whitehouse, a member of the senate judiciary committee that will hold a hearing on liability protection next week, said clear guidance on worker safety would give employers \u201ca strong \u2018standard of care\u2019 defense in court\u201d and would \u201ckeep people safer, so there weren\u2019t lawsuits in the first place\u201d. African nations are facing a surge of Covid-19 cases with less than one intensive care bed and one ventilator per 100,000 people, a Reuters survey has found. Even in a best-case scenario, the continent could need at least 10 times the numbers it has now as the outbreak peaks, an analysis of researchers\u2019 projections showed. The shortages across Africa\u2019s national health systems are among the starkest elements to emerge from the survey, which polled 54 countries and received responses from health officials or independent experts in 48 of them. The results provide the most detailed public picture to date of the continent\u2019s key resources, testing and personnel for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 262,000 people worldwide. The World Health Organization has warned that Africa, home to 1.3 billion people, could become the next centre of the pandemic. The continent has recorded over 51,000 Covid-19 cases, a fraction of the 3.76 million recorded globally. But low levels of testing make it impossible to know the true scale of infection. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) has said Africa could see nearly 123 million cases this year, causing 300,000 deaths. Assuming a complete lockdown for an indefinite period, at least 121,000 critical care beds will be needed continent-wide when the pandemic peaks, according to a Reuters analysis of the projections by scientists at Britain\u2019s MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, on which the UNECA forecasts are based. That compares with just 9,800 available intensive care beds found in the survey, conducted through April and May. The survey also revealed severe shortfalls in testing, personnel and oxygen supplies. Many African nations moved quickly to contain the virus, launching high-profile public health campaigns, restricting movement and repurposing factories to produce protective equipment. Bewley\u2019s cafe, described by the poet Brendan Kennelly as \u201cthe heart and hearth of Dublin\u201d, is likely to permanently close after concluding it will not be able to operate post-lockdown under Ireland\u2019s social distancing rules. Managers at the historic cafe on Grafton street, long associated with James Joyce and other writers, told employees \u201cwith deep regret and great sadness\u201d that it was likely to permanently close in coming weeks, with the loss of 110 jobs. The cafe closed temporarily in mid-March due to the Covid-19 restrictions and would be allowed to reopen next month under the government\u2019s lockdown easing blueprint. However social distancing measures, along with high rent and a collapse in tourist numbers, made the business no longer viable, the managing director, C\u00f3l Campbell, said in a note to staff. Opened in 1927, the aroma of coffee and the promise of sticky buns and cakes drew crowds of artists, students and tourists, a bustle that created a unique atmosphere no longer viable under social distancing rules. Thanks Amy, it\u2019s Jessica here - I\u2019ll be running the live blog for the next few hours as countries across the world tentatively start to ease their coronavirus restrictions after weeks of lockdown. As always, please do get in touch with your observations and experiences, via email- jessica.murray@theguardian.com - or via Twitter - @journojess_ - and I\u2019ll do my best to respond to as many messages as I can. For UK-specific coronavirus news, my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Lucy Campbell are heading up the UK live blog, following the news from the ONS that black people are more likely to die from Covid-19. That\u2019s it from me, Amy Walker. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Jessica Murray now, who will steer you through global coronavirus updates for the rest of the day. Summary Coronavirus cases in India have risen past 50,000 according to the country\u2019s health ministry, with the pace of infection showing no sign of abating. A gas leak at a chemical factory in India has killed at least nine people and led to hundreds of others being taken to hospital, amid warnings that the death toll could climb higher. China\u2019s exports saw a shock 3.5% rise in April despite a hit to external demand from the coronavirus pandemic, official figures showed on Thursday. The number of people who have died after contracting Covid-19 in Europe has surpassed 150,000, with most in the UK, Italy, Spain and France, a tally of official figures by the AFP news agency showed. Mayor\u2019s in many of the world\u2019s leading cities have warned there can be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis if humanity is to escape catastrophic climate breakdown. The United Nations has warned that the global pandemic could cause \u201cmultiple famines\u201d, as it appealed for a further $4.7bn in funding to help more than 50 vulnerable countries. Poland has postponed Sunday\u2019s presidential election amid the outbreak. The postal-only ballot will now take place \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, but is likely to not happen until at least June. Every one of the 400,000 protective gowns that were flown to the UK from Turkey has failed to conform to the country\u2019s health standards, with the shipment due to be flown back. The coronavirus lockdown in Lebanon has sent an economy already in deep trouble into financial freefall, with many people struggling to survive. In a new video, our multimedia team follow Gino Raidy \u2013 an activist who was prominent during the October 2019 anti-government protests \u2013 as he helps to keep demonstrators safe during the pandemic. The number of people killed by Covid-19 in Europe has surpassed 150,000, with most deaths occurring in the UK, Italy, Spain and France, according to a tally compiled from official sources by the AFP news agency. Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, has said that the number of coronavirus cases in the Russian capital is around 300,000, according to the TASS news agency. The figure is more than three times higher than the official total of 92,676 reported by authorities. As of Thursday, the reported case tally across Russia was 177,160. A cruise ship which had been at the centre of Australia\u2019s biggest coronavirus cluster has arrived off the Philippines to repatriate more than 200 crew members. Just under a quarter of Australia\u2019s 97 Covid-19 deaths have been traced back to Carnival Corp\u2019s Ruby Princess, leading to outrage over why symptomatic passengers were allowed to disembark. It has also become the focus of a criminal investigation after a spike in cases followed its March 19 arrival in Sydney. The 19-deck ship reached Manila Bay on Thursday, joining a group of around a dozen other cruise ships that will be subjected to onboard coronavirus testing before any Filipino crew members can disembark. Mayors in many of the world\u2019s leading cities have warned there can be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis if humanity is to escape catastrophic climate breakdown. City leaders representing more than 750 million people have published a \u201cstatement of principles\u201d, which commits them to putting greater equality and climate resilience at the heart of their recovery plans. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio said: \u201cHalf-measures that maintain the status quo won\u2019t move the needle or protect us from the next crisis. \u201cWe need a new deal for these times \u2013 a massive transformation that rebuilds lives, promotes equality and prevents the next economic, health or climate crisis.\u201d You can read the full report, which includes the measures which have already been announced by some cities, from my colleague Matthew Taylor here: The UN urged for a united front to fight against Coronavirus in Afghanistan as number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reached 3,563 amid high threat of continued transmissions across the war-torn country. United Nations Special Representative Deborah Lyons has highlighted the need for \u201cdeep collaboration with all partners to create a united front against Covid-19\u201d, in a meeting with Afghan vice president. Together they discussed the Covid-19 pandemic and its socio-economic impacts on people\u2019s lives in Afghanistan. \u201cBoth agreed that the collective efforts of all Afghans are needed to tackle this pandemic that has already killed nearly a quarter million people around the world\u201d, according to a UN mission statement. The country\u2019s health ministry has confirmed 171 new infections over past 24 hours as the testing capacity increased and more people are getting tested. The country had a shortage of testing kits early this month which paused testing process for several days. The ministry has also confirmed two deaths of Coronavirus in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 106. Afghanistan\u2019s struggle with a shortage of diagnostic testing equipment known as \u201cRNA extraction kits\u201d, which scientists use to isolate the RNA (ribonucleic acid) in samples of the novel coronavirus, had been solved after it recieved the equipment from WHO. The health ministry has so far tested 14,389 suspected patients. Most of new cases confirmed in western province of Herat which borders Iran, one of the world\u2019s worst affected countries. More than 250,000 Afghans have returned home from neighbouring Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Number of new infections slowed down in Kandahar compared with recent days as 16 new cases were reported in the province. Capital Kabul, which is Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area with a population of nearly six million, reported 34 new cases overnight, raising the total number to 943 confirmed cases. Concerns are high in the capital as one-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in came back positive, health officials said last week. Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister has said the result of 500 tests are concerning though. He has warned that the threat of the virus is its \u201chighest level\u201d. Despite a government authorised lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded which raises fears of a surge in number of death and infections among experts. Meanwhile, war intensified across the country, Defense ministry said the insurgents carried out attacks in around 20 provinces on Tuesday as the Taliban rejected multiple offers of ceasefire. The United Nations Mission in Afghanistan has said that more than 533 civilians including 152 children were killed in first quarter of 2020. A team of Indonesian engineers have said they have produced a compact ventilator from plastic drinking tumblers to sell at a fraction of the usual cost. The 40 engineers from the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) have developed the Vent-I ventilator, which is the size of a mini-oven. The institute will aim to sell the machines for $1,000 each, one-twentieth or less than the typical $20,000 to $25,000, said team leader Syarif Hidayat. \u201cThe structure of this ventilator is much simpler compared to the ventilator we see in the intensive care unit,\u201d Hidayat told Reuters. Like many countries across the globe, Indonesia has also experienced a shortage of the mechanical breathing devices during the pandemic. Coronavirus cases in India have risen past 50,000, according to the health ministry. The update comes as the pace of infection in the country shows no signs of slowing, despite a strict lockdown. On Thursday, India reported 3,561 new cases, taking its total to 52,952. The country\u2019s death toll rose by 89 to 1,783. The figures are still low compared to western countries including the US, UK and Italy. Indian officials have attributed the low toll to the government\u2019s move to impose a stay-at-home order on the nation\u2019s 1.3bn people early in the crisis. However, they noted an eruption in cases within the densely packed economic centres of Mumbai, Delhi and Ahmedabad. Health minister Harsh Vardhan said Maharashtra, the state in which Mumbai is located, was an area of particular concern and that the federal government was on standby to help. \u201cThe [government] is ready to help in every way possible. Be it manpower increase, capacity building, technical assistance etc. or any kind of handholding that is required to manage the situation,\u201d he said at a meeting with state health officials. The United Nations has warned that the coronavirus pandemic could cause \u201cmultiple famines\u201d. The comments came as the UN appealed for a further $4.7bn (\u00a33.8bn) in funding for its global humanitarian response plan. Under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, Mark Lowcock, said the worst effects of the crisis would be felt in the world\u2019s poorest countries. \u201cUnless we take action now, we should be prepared for a significant rise in conflict, hunger and poverty. The spectre of multiple famines looms,\u201d he said. More than 50 vulnerable countries are to receive donations bought with the funds by the UN including medical equipment to test and treat the sick and hand-washing stations. In March, the UN initially requested $2bn to be donated to the response plan, of which $900m has already been received. The chief of staff to German chancellor Angela Merkel has said the coronavirus pandemic will last for at least the rest of the year. \u201cWe are not living after the pandemic now - rather we are living in the middle of a pandemic, one that will be with us for a while - at least for this year and that\u2019s being very optimistic,\u201d Helge Braun told Deutschlandfunk radio on Thursday. Yesterday, Merkel announced steps to ease the coronavirus lockdown in Germany but simultaneously launched an \u201cemergency brake\u201d mechanism allowing for restrictions to be renewed if Covid-19 infections rise again. Every one of the 400,000 protective gowns flown to the UK from Turkey has failed to conform to the country\u2019s health standards. The UK\u2019s Department for Health and Social Care confirmed on Wednesday that the items were being held in a facility near Heathrow airport. It is understood that they are due to be flown back to Turkey, and the DHSC intends to seek a refund. The shipment was first announced by UK ministers last month amid dire warnings of personal protective equipment for health workers. You can read the full story from my colleague Kevin Rawlinson here: Poland\u2019s governing coalition parties have postponed Sunday\u2019s presidential election amid the coronavirus outbreak. Although ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party wanted the vote to go ahead, its coalition partner Agreement and the opposition said it was prioritising political gain over public health. The election \u2013 which will be a postal-only ballot \u2013 will now to be rescheduled to a date \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. However, the deputy prime minister said the earliest it could take place would be in June. PiS had received criticism both nationally and internationally over concerns that the ballot would not be sufficiently fair while candidates were suspended from campaigning due to the country\u2019s lockdown. According to John Hopkins University, Poland has reported 14,740 cases of Covid-19 while 733 people have died after contracting the virus. But while figures are lower than in most Western European countries, the Polish health minister has previously warned that cases have not yet peaked. I\u2019m Amy Walker, steering you through the next few hours of global coronavirus updates. You can get in touch with me on Twitter @amyrwalker. Yesterday, the Guardian published its views on the upcoming election: More than 15,000 Indian citizens are expected to be brought home over the next week as part of the Vande Bharath (hail India) mission, local media report. Eventually, as many as 200,000 citizens will be brought home on flights, before being quarantined. The BBC reports that, \u201cIf successful, this would be India\u2019s biggest evacuation mission since 1990, when it rescued 170,000 civilians from Kuwait during the Gulf War. \u201cAir India, the country\u2019s national airline, will carry out the mission and fly planes to the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Qatar and Malaysia, among other countries.\u201d In the UAE alone, the Indian mission has received 197,000 repatriation applications. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan in Sydney. Thank you for following along \u2013 I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Amy Walker now in London. She will be bringing you the latest from around the world for the next few hours. A gas leak at a chemical factory in southern India has killed at least nine people and led to hundreds being taken to hospital, amid warnings that the death toll could climb higher. Styrene leaked from the Korean-owned LG Polymers plant during the early hours of Thursday morning when families in the surrounding villages were asleep, a local official in Andra Pradesh state said. The leak was from two 5,000-tonne tanks that had been unattended due to India\u2019s coronavirus lockdown in place since late March, according to a local police officer. Footage on Indian television channels showed people, including women and children, lying in the streets of Visakhapatnam, an industrial port city halfway between Kolkata and Chennai on India\u2019s east coast. Swarupa Rani, an assistant commissioner of police in Visakhapatnam, said that at least nine people had died and between 300-400 had been hospitalised. Another 1,500 people had been evacuated, mostly from a neighbouring village. But B K Naik, district hospitals coordinator, said that at least 1,000 people had been sent to different hospitals, and that it was feared many others may be unconscious in their homes. Global report: deaths are price of reopening, says Trump, as China warns risks remain Donald Trump has again suggested the US may need to accept the reality of more deaths in order to start reopening the economy, as governments around the world continued to ease out of lockdown restrictions. After backtracking on earlier indications that he would wind up the White House coronavirus taskforce, the Trump spelled out a potentially brutal approach to kickstarting the world\u2019s biggest economy. \u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d Trump told Fox News when asked if Americans should expect additional deaths as the country looks to reopen. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d The president added: \u201cHopefully that won\u2019t be the case \u2026 but it could very well be the case.\u201d By Thursday morning the number of cases in the US stood at more than 1.2 million and 73,431 deaths, with infections still on the rise in some states. Worldwide there were more than 3.75 million cases and 263,831 people had died from the disease, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. But there were more signs of light at the end of the tunnel for people around the world still constrained by lockdown rules. The United Nations announced Thursday it is increasing its appeal to fight the coronavirus pandemic in fragile and vulnerable countries from $2bn to $6.7bn, AP reports. UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock reiterated that the peak of the pandemic is not expected to hit the worlds poorest countries for three to six months. But he said there is already evidence of incomes plummeting and jobs disappearing, food supplies falling and prices soaring, and children missing vaccinations and meals. Since the original appeal on 25 March, the United Nations said $1bn has been raised to support efforts across 37 fragile countries to tackle Covid-19. The updated appeal launched Thursday includes nine additional vulnerable countries: Benin, Djibouti, Liberia, Mozambique, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sierra Leone, Togo and Zimbabwe. Lowcock said in the poorest countries we can already see economies contracting as export earnings, remittances and tourism disappear. \u201cUnless we take action now, we should be prepared for a significant rise in conflict, hunger and poverty,\u201d he warned. \u201cThe spectre of multiple famines looms.\u201d Patterns of pain: what Covid-19 can teach us about how to be human We are learning a whole new etiquette of bodies. We swerve around each other, hop into the near-empty street, calculate distances at entrances to parks, avoid body contact, even eye contact, and keep a look out for those obliviously glued to their phones, whose lack of attention threatens to breach the two-metre rule. It\u2019s odd and disconcerting and isn\u2019t quite second nature. Until the pandemic arrived, many of us were finding texting, email and Whatsapp more suitable to our speeded-up lives. But now we are coming to reuse the telephone, and to enjoy the sounds in our ears and the rhythm of conversation, instead of feeling rushed and interrupted. A few of my sessions as a psychoanalyst are now conducted on the phone but, for the most part, I am spending my time looking into a screen, and seeing faces rather than whole bodies. Until I learned to turn off the view of myself, I, like others, was disconcerted by the oddness of catching sight of myself \u2013 a view I don\u2019t think we are meant to see. There are 3.75 million confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The number of confirmed cases stood at 3,755,341 on Thursday, with 263,831 deaths. China exports see surprise 3.5% jump in April, imports fall. China\u2019s exports saw a shock 3.5% rise in April despite a hit to external demand from the coronavirus pandemic, official figures showed Thursday. But imports fell 14.2% from a year ago, a steeper drop from last month, according to the Customs Administration.A forecast of analysts by Bloomberg had predicted an 11% dive in exports and a 10% plunge in imports. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the country will consider easing restrictions to \u201cLevel 2\u201d. \u201cAlert Level 2 will see significantly more activity open up across the country requiring New Zealanders to play it safe and remain vigilant so the virus doesn\u2019t bounce back,\u201d the government announced in a statement. It would include allowing for gatherings of up to 100 people. Brazil sees record daily cases and deaths. Brazil, one of the world\u2019s emerging coronavirus hot spots, registered a record number of cases and deaths on Wednesday, prompting the health minister to flag the possibility of strict lockdowns in particularly hard-hit areas. Trump said the White House coronavirus taskforce would \u201ccontinue on indefinitely,\u201d a reversal from his comments yesterday suggesting the group\u2019s work would be winding down. The president said today he \u201chad no idea how popular the taskforce is.\u201d Trump suggests more deaths a necessary price. US President Donald Trump has again suggested the country may need to accept the reality of more deaths in order to start reopening the economy.\u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 John Roberts when asked if Americans should expect additional deaths as the country looks to reopen. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d Diplomatic split widens amid virus origin row and China shrugs off US claims and calls for focus on beating pandemic.China will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging, its UN ambassador says. China\u2019s foreign ministry says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is wrong to claim he has evidence suggesting the virus originated in a Chinese lab. The US-China relationship is one of \u201cdisappointment and frustration\u201d, the White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has said, highlighting the deepening rift between Washington and Beijing. US sees 1st detained immigrant death from coronavirus. A 57-year-old person in immigration custody died Wednesday from complications related to the coronavirus, authorities said, marking the first reported death from the virus among about 30,000 people in immigration custody. Coronavirus threatens eurozone\u2019s future, Brussels warns. The eurozone faces an existential threat if the economic recoveries of its 19 member states are insufficiently even, the EU\u2019s economic commissioner warns. Some countries are expected to suffer significantly more than others during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression. WHO warns of more lockdowns if transition not managed carefully. The director general of the World Health Organization warns of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions \u201cextremely carefully and in a phased approach\u201d. preparedness. Germany eases restrictions but retains \u201cemergency brake\u201d. The country\u2019s top football league, the Bundesliga, is set to resume this month \u2013 one of various restrictions to be lifted as Germans are once again allowed to meet a limited number of friends and family and some shops are allowed to reopen. UK could start easing virus lockdown next week. The British government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, says, adding his hope that some measures could come into force the following day. Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson says \u201cevery death is a tragedy\u201d, calling the statistics \u201cappalling\u201d. Spain extends state of emergency after bitter political dispute. Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government secured an extension until 24 May. Congress\u2019s approval for the latest extension of the crisis powers comes after days of bitter rowing and frantic negotiations. China\u2019s exports saw a shock 3.5% rise in April despite a hit to external demand from the coronavirus pandemic, official figures showed Thursday. But imports fell 14.2% from a year ago, a steeper drop from last month, according to the Customs Administration. A forecast of analysts by Bloomberg had predicted an 11% dive in exports and a 10% plunge in imports. Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics noted that \u201cApril shipments may have been boosted by exporters making up for shortfalls in the first quarter due to supply constraints then\u201d. In the January-February period, the height of the coronavirus outbreak in China, exports had plummeted 17.2%. But in spite of the bounceback this time - the first return to positive territory this year - Kuijs does not expect the trend to last as China\u2019s key trading partners fall into recession. Professional rugby and netball are close to returning to action in New Zealand after the government unveiled its rules for sport when the country next eases its coronavirus restrictions. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday announced a range of new societal rules that will apply when the country moves from alert level three to level two, including changes to professional and community sport. Sam Cane named All Blacks captain as new coach Ian Foster makes first major moveRead more Cabinet will announce a date on Monday for the shift to alert level two, which could happen as soon as Wednesday. The announcement was enormous for rugby and netball, the country\u2019s two professional winter competitions which have suffered significant financial damage. Under Boris Johnson, Putin and Trump the world has uncanny parallels to 1945 Victory in Europe was made possible by a remarkable military collaboration between the main anti-Axis powers \u2013 the US, Russia and Britain. But the three-way relationship, between Franklin D Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin and Winston Churchill, was never easy, and it set a pattern of national rivalry, suspicion, fear and distrust that persists to this day. Today\u2019s world bears some uncanny similarities to the world of 1945. Post-Soviet Russia under Vladimir Putin is again on the offensive, employing asymmetrical means such as info-wars and cyberhacks instead of armoured divisions to project its influence across Europe. Boris Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit Britain, having rejected the concept of a common European home, stands alone in ways not seen since 1940. Brexiters\u2019 calls for a stronger US security, economic and trade relationship, to offset the EU rupture, are the modern-day equivalent of Churchill\u2019s desperate \u201cdarkest hour\u201d appeals for Roosevelt\u2019s help. EU to propose process for how WHO can learn from Covid-19 outbreak The European Union is to put forward proposals for a mechanism to learn from the coronavirus pandemic at the next meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO) but will stop short of calls from the US and Australia for a full international inquiry. Brussels is trying to steer a course between the US and China in the blame game between the superpowers. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has blamed China for tens of thousands of deaths and demanded the WHO hold an inquiry into what it was told by the country about the outbreak. At issue in any inquiry would be timing and whether it would focus on what happened in China, China\u2019s communications with the WHO or the WHO\u2019s own response. Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief, said the bloc\u2019s proposal, to be put forward at a virtual meeting of the WHO on 18 May, would \u201cprovide access to how to learn more about the origin of this disease to prevent the next pandemic. Because it wasn\u2019t going to be the last. Lessons will have to be learned from it.\u201d There is support within Europe, including from the UK, for an examination of the WHO\u2019s role. The US has reduced its leverage in calling for a full inquiry, however, by suspending its payments to the WHO in a move widely seen as counterproductive. Meanwhile Indians in the UAE have voiced scepticism about a \u201cmassive\u201d operation announced by New Delhi to bring home some of the hundreds of thousands of nationals stranded by coronavirus restrictions, AFP reports. \u201cIt is just propaganda,\u201d said Ishan, an Indian expatriate in Dubai, one of seven emirates in the UAE and long a magnet for foreign workers. He was reacting to his government\u2019s announcement this week that it would deploy passenger jets and naval ships to bring home citizens stuck in a host of countries. India\u2019s consulate in Dubai said it received about 200,000 requests from nationals seeking repatriation - mostly workers who have lost their jobs in the pandemic. One vessel was heading to the UAE, India\u2019s government said, while two flights were scheduled to depart the UAE for India on Thursday. India banned all incoming commercial flights in late March as it imposed one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns to tackle the spread of coronavirus. The UAE is home to a 3.3-million-strong Indian community, who make up around 30 percent of the Gulf state\u2019s population. Our New Zealand correspondent Eleanor Ainge Roy has this full report of the announcement today about the country\u2019s potential path out of lockdown. Hairdressers, bars and competitive sport could be back on the agenda for New Zealanders from next week as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the country was \u201chalf-way down Everest\u201d in its fight against Covid-19. New Zealand has been under strict lockdown restrictions for more than five weeks, but the low number of cases this week \u2013 zero for two consecutive days \u2013 means restrictions will soon be lifted. Ardern and her cabinet will make a decision on downgrading the country\u2019s alert level from three to two on Monday, and by Wednesday, life could begin to look much more normal \u2013 and fun \u2013 for millions of cooped-up Kiwis. Public spaces such as playgrounds and libraries would be reopened, bars and restaurants would be able to accept patrons, and domestic travel and competitive sport allowed to resume, including the professional leagues. Widespread social-distancing rules would continue to apply, including patrons being seated two metres apart in public spaces, strangers keeping their distance from one another, and hairdressers, barbers and beauticians being required to wear PPE. In Dubai\u2019s ritzy Marina district, white yachts are tethered to docks, standing idle - like many companies behind a luxury lifestyle industry battered by the coronavirus crisis. The boardwalks that snake around the precinct\u2019s artificial bays and canals, once packed with tourists, mostly from China, Russia and Britain, are now deserted, AFP reports. \u201cNearly 95 percent, if not 100 percent, of turnover has been lost,\u201d the manager of a yacht charter company told AFP. When the United Arab Emirates halted all commercial flights and enforced a strict curfew to stem the spread of the disease, fishing trips and sightseeing excursions dried up \u201cwithout warning\u201d, the young Frenchman said. Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, lacks the oil wealth of its neighbours. But it has the most diversified economy in the Gulf, building a reputation as a financial, commercial and tourism hub that draws some 16 million visitors a year. The cosmopolitan city state\u2019s services sector is fuelled by hundreds of thousands of foreigners, ranging from the super-rich to low-income migrant workers behind the scenes of the highlife. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,284 to 166,091, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. The reported death toll rose by 123 to 7,119, the tally showed. At least 47 residents and three workers have been infected with coronavirus at a retirement home in the northern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon, authorities said on Wednesday, in one of the biggest outbreaks yet reported in the country, Reuters reports. Nuevo Leon\u2019s health minister, Manuel de la O, said the infections were registered among the 98 residents and 48 workers at the Casa de Retiro Luis Elizondo in the municipality of Guadalupe, east of the state capital, Monterrey. He told a news conference that the average age of residents at the home is 84, that 40% of them had diabetes and 45% suffered from hypertension, calling them a \u201chigh-risk group\u201d. De la O later said that all 50 who tested positive for coronavirus were \u201cstable\u201d and that three of the residents had been taken to a hospital for treatment. The home\u2019s medical director, Fernando Coindreau, said staff began to notice symptoms among some older residents on Saturday before tests were carried out. Nursing homes have been some of the worst-hit places during the pandemic, particularly in continental Europe. Mexico has so far registered 27,634 cases of coronavirus and 2,704 deaths. Nuevo Leon, which borders the United States, has reported 909 cases and 29 fatalities. De la O said that authorities believed the virus could have spread from a cook who worked at the home. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. In China, at a meeting of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s highest political group, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, Xi Jinping said the spread of coronavirus overseas was ongoing, and that while Hubei province had successfully contained the outbreak and was no longer an emergency, prevention and control measures had to stay in place. Reports of the meeting in Chinese media were largely non specific, but said Xi urged the implementation of new policies to promote economic and social development, and to improve healthcare structures, reform disease prevention and control systems, increase epidemic monitoring and early warning capabilities, and strengthen public health and emergency laws. The Central Committee also decided to send a liaison group to to Hubei and Wuhan to support follow-up work. On Thursday Chinese authorities reduced the risk level of Linkou County in the city of Mudanjiang to \u201clow\u201d, meaning there were no medium or high risk areas anywhere in the country, Beijing News reported. A separate meeting of the State Council executives, chaired by premier Li Keqiang, determined a set of 90 financial support and stimulus measures was working, with production \u201csteadily returning to the usual capacity\u201d, state media report. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang. In Australia meanwhile, premiers of the country\u2019s two most populous states have warned that social distancing restrictions will not be eased before Mother\u2019s Day on 10 May, despite Queensland\u2019s decision to allow up to five members to visit a household from Sunday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has attempted this week to build the case for opening up the economy by pointing to the accumulating costs of the restrictions, and Friday\u2019s national cabinet meeting is expected to try to land a timetable for easing the lockdowns implemented to try and flatten the curve of Covid-19 infections. But before Friday\u2019s deliberation, premiers in New South Wales and Victoria have warned that Australia risks throwing away the successful containment of the pandemic. Washington state sees sudden rise in Covid parties Moving away from New Zealand now to bring you this story: You can call them BYOC parties. That\u2019s bring your own Covid-19. Health officials in Walla Walla, Washington, are admonishing the sudden rise in so-called \u201cCovid-19 parties\u201d where non-infected guests mingle with those who have tested positive for the virus, ostensibly in hopes of speeding up the process of catching, and overcoming, the virus. \u201cWalla Walla County health officials are receiving reports of Covid-19 parties occurring in our community, where non-infected people mingle with an infected person in an effort to catch the virus,\u201d the county said in a press release Tuesday. As of Tuesday, 94 people in the county have tested positive for Covid-19, including employees who worked at a nearby Tyson Fresh Meats plant who were infected. Some of those cases can be linked back to parties, Meghan DeBolt, director of the county\u2019s Department of Community Health, told the Walla Walla Bulletin. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when it is happening. It\u2019s after the fact that we hear from cases. We ask about contacts, and there are 25 people because: \u2018We were at a Covid party\u2019.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s irresponsible.\u201d Washington state, hit early and hard by the coronavirus, has tallied 15,185 cases and 834 deaths that have been attributed to the coronavirus. More from that statement by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern now: On Monday, 11 May, we will make a decision on whether to move, taking into consideration the best data and advice we can, recognising the impact of restrictions, and ensuring we don\u2019t put at risk all of the gains we have made. We need to balance the risk of the virus bouncing back against the strong desire to get the economy moving again. We will continue to act with caution and not move before it is safe to do, so entry into Level 2 could be phased, with higher risk activity occurring when there is stronger evidence it is safe to do so.\u201d Some reactions now to the possible Level 2 restrictions in New Zealand: New Zealand\u2019s Sport and Recreation Minister Grant Robertson says professional sports will be able to resume domestically under Covid-19 Alert Level 2 with the necessary public health measures in place. \u201cMoving to Alert Level 2 continues to expand the opportunities for sport and recreation and reintroduces the opportunity for competitive sport \u2013 both at a local and professional level,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cObviously, the paramount concern is that a return to competitive sport is done safely. This means ensuring there are systems in place to implement public health measures such as contact tracing and hygiene requirements to create a safe environment.\u201d The statement also said that Super Rugby and the Premiership Netball League had confirmed their intention to resume domestic competition at Alert level 2. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said if the decision is made on Monday to move to Level-2 restrictions, that would start on Wednesday next week. New Zealand has announced that it will take the decision of whether to ease restrictions to \u201cAlert Level 2\u201d on Monday, 11 May. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement, \u201cEvery alert level to fight Covid-19 is its own battle. When you win one, it doesn\u2019t mean the war is over.\u201d \u201cIn a nutshell, Level 2 is a safer normal designed to get as many people back to work as possible and the economy back up and running in a safe way, made possible only by our collective actions at Levels 4 and 3 to beat the virus and break the chain of transmission. \u201cStrong public health measures such as physical distancing, good hygiene and contact tracing will be essential to making Level 2 work.\u201d Level 2 restrictions would mean: Businesses can restart for staff and customers Bubbles can cease Domestic travel recommences Schools and early learning centres can open Gatherings both indoors and outdoors are limited to 100 people Public places reopen Sport and recreation comes back on-stream, including professional sports competitions Home gatherings must be kept small Hospitality must follow the three S\u2019s \u2013 seated, separated, single-server Five US Senate Republicans introduced a bill on Wednesday seeking a review of US participation in the World Health Organization and other international institutions, Reuters reports, after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration suspended US contributions to the UN health agency and accused it of mishandling the coronavirus pandemic. Introduced by Chairman Jim Risch and four other Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the \u201cMultilateral Aid Review Act of 2020\u201d would establish a task force to assess how well multilateral institutions carry out their missions and serve American interests.

China reported two new coronavirus cases for 6 May, unchanged from the same number of increases the day before, data from the national health authority showed on Thursday. Both were so-called imported cases involving travellers from overseas, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The two cases from the day before were also imported. The commission also reported 6 new asymptomatic cases for 6 May, versus 20 from the previous day. China\u2019s total number of coronavirus cases now stands at 82,885, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,633, the national health authority said. Live and Let Die plays as Trump visits mask factory without a mask During a pandemic that has seen more than 70,000 deaths in the US (almost a quarter of the global amount), there is probably no worse song the president could walk out to than Live and Let Die, a cover by the rock band Guns N\u2019 Roses. But these are strange times, and so as Donald Trump walked around an N95 mask manufacturing plant in Phoenix, Arizona, that\u2019s exactly what happened. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Wednesday reported 1,609 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 197 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 27,634 cases and 2,704 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is significantly higher than the confirmed cases. A 57-year-old person in immigration custody died Wednesday from complications related to the coronavirus, authorities said, marking the first reported death from the virus among about 30,000 people in immigration custody, AP reports. The detainee had been held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego and hospitalized since late April, said Craig Sturak, a spokesman for the San Diego County Health &amp; Human Services Agency. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement would neither confirm nor deny the death. CoreCivic Inc., the private company that operates the detention center, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Otay Mesa has been a hotbed for the spread of Covid-19, with nearly one of five detainees who have tested positive nationwide. As of Wednesday, 132 of ICE\u2019s 705 positive cases were at the San Diego facility. Additionally, 10 of 39 ICE detention employees who have tested positive are at Otay Mesa. Two guards at an immigration detention centre in Monroe, Louisiana, died late last month from the coronavirus Carl Lenard, 62, and Stanton Johnson, 51. Until Wednesday, no detainees had been reported dead. A Justice Department attorney, Samuel Bettwy, said at a hearing on Monday that the San Diego detainee was intubated at a hospital with a prognosis that was not good. While the death came as no surprise, advocacy groups that have been pressing ICE to release detainees on bond swiftly criticized the agency. Last month, amid dire warnings of shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers, ministers publicised the imminent arrival from Turkey of a fleet of RAF cargo planes bringing in a \u201cvery significant\u201d shipment of PPE for the NHS. More than a fortnight later, it has emerged that every one of the 400,000 protective gowns that arrived has been impounded for not to conform to UK standards. The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) confirmed on Wednesday evening that the items were being held in a facility near Heathrow airport. It is understood that they are due to be sent back and that DHSC intends to seek a refund, as it has done in similar situations. The announcement of the shipment by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, on 18 April came as unions and professional bodies warned that NHS staff may refuse to work without PPE. An internal assessment seen by the Financial Times warned the UK was potentially only days away from running out of aprons altogether. Jenrick told the daily Downing Street press briefing that healthcare workers should be \u201cassured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue\u201d, saying they would have the equipment they \u201cneed and deserve\u201d. Sources later told the Guardian that the DHSC had advised No 10 not to allow him to publicise the shipment in case it backfired, but was overruled. The necessary clearances, it turned out, had not been sought. When the consignment did not arrive on time as promised, the delay prompted hospital leaders to directly attack the government for the first time during the pandemic. El Salvador will from Thursday temporarily suspend public transport in a bid to strengthen efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the government said on Wednesday, Reuters reports. A decree published by the government on Wednesday said the measure would remain in place for 15 days. El Salvador, which has reported 15 deaths from the pandemic, has applied some of the toughest measures in the Americas to tackle the coronavirus. That has sparked complaints by some human rights groups that the government is overreaching itself. Brazil, one of the world\u2019s emerging coronavirus hot spots, registered a record number of cases and deaths on Wednesday, prompting the health minister to flag the possibility of strict lockdowns in particularly hard-hit areas. According to health ministry data, the nation registered 10,503 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the last 24 hours, well above the previous record of 7,288 cases on April 30. Brazil also registered 615 deaths, up from the previous record of 600 on Tuesday. There are over 100,000 completed coronavirus tests that still have not been registered in the national database, Wanderson Oliveira, a health ministry sub-secretary warned, meaning the number of cases could continue to rise steeply in the coming days. Overall, Brazil has registered 125,218 cases and 8,536 deaths due to the virus. As part of Brazil\u2019s bid to combat the coronavirus outbreak, officials said on Wednesday they were attempting to dramatically ramp up testing capacity, which stands at 2,700 tests per day. \u201cAt the most elevated level of (test) production, which we think we\u2019ll get to in the middle of July, we\u2019ll get to 70,000 per day,\u201d Oliveira said. Coronavirus-related border controls, lockdowns and flight shortages are making illegal drugs more expensive and difficult to obtain around the world, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said in a report published on Thursday. The pandemic is having a mixed effect on drug production in different regions and on smuggling by air, land and sea, but the overall trend in countries where drugs are consumed appears to be relatively uniform, the UNODC said in the report on Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. While opioids like heroin are almost entirely transported by land, where increased checks may be disrupting deliveries, cocaine is mainly shipped by sea. A recent rise in heroin seizures in the Indian Ocean might indicate an increase in heroin shipments to Europe by sea, the UNODC said. The current lack of flights will probably have a \u201cparticularly drastic\u201d effect on smuggling of synthetic drugs including methamphetamine to countries such as South Korea, Japan and Australia, it added. In Afghanistan, the world\u2019s biggest producer of heroin, the opium harvest between March and June might be disrupted if workers are unable or unwilling to travel, the UNODC said, though it provided little evidence to support that. In Bolivia, recent challenges related to the spread of COVID-19, combined with political turbulence in late 2019, appear to be limiting the ability of state authorities to control coca bush cultivation, the UNODC said. NBA teams are expected to get the go-ahead to reopen practice facilities for limited use as early as Friday, less than two months after the coronavirus outbreak forced the suspension of the season. With head and assistant coaches barred and scrimmages forbidden, the workouts are unlikely to resemble business as usual for the NBA but would nonetheless be a step towards normalcy for a league whose season was upended in dramatic fashion in March. Players will be required to wear face masks inside team facilities, \u201cexcept during the period when they are engaged in physical activity\u201d, according to a league memo. Teams must also thoroughly disinfect any equipment used, from basketballs to weight-room equipment. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news from around the world. In a reversal of yesterday\u2019s statements confirming the reports that the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce would be winding down, US President Donald Trump said in an Oval Office meeting that the taskforce would continue \u201cindefinitely\u201d. Trump also said the taskforce would \u201cadd or subtract people\u201d as necessary, which raised some concerns about whether health experts would be pushed off the team. Trump said the White House coronavirus taskforce would \u201ccontinue on indefinitely,\u201d a reversal from his comments yesterday suggesting the group\u2019s work would be winding down. The president said today he \u201chad no idea how popular the taskforce is.\u201d Trump suggests more deaths a necessary price. US President Donald Trump has again suggested the country may need to accept the reality of more deaths in order to start reopening the economy.\u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 John Roberts when asked if Americans should expect additional deaths as the country looks to reopen. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d Coronavirus threatens eurozone\u2019s future, Brussels warns. The eurozone faces an existential threat if the economic recoveries of its 19 member states are insufficiently even, the EU\u2019s economic commissioner warns. Some countries are expected to suffer significantly more than others during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression. WHO warns of more lockdowns if transition not managed carefully. The director general of the World Health Organization warns of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions \u201cextremely carefully and in a phased approach\u201d. preparedness. Germany eases restrictions but retains \u201cemergency brake\u201d. The country\u2019s top football league, the Bundesliga, is set to resume this month \u2013 one of various restrictions to be lifted as Germans are once again allowed to meet a limited number of friends and family and some shops are allowed to reopen. UK could start easing virus lockdown next week. The British government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, says, adding his hope that some measures could come into force the following day. Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson says \u201cevery death is a tragedy\u201d, calling the statistics \u201cappalling\u201d. Spain extends state of emergency after bitter political dispute. Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government secured an extension until 24 May. Congress\u2019s approval for the latest extension of the crisis powers comes after days of bitter rowing and frantic negotiations. Diplomatic split widens amid virus origin row and China shrugs off US claims and calls for focus on beating pandemic. China will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging, its UN ambassador says. China\u2019s foreign ministry says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is wrong to claim he has evidence suggesting the virus originated in a Chinese lab. The US-China relationship is one of disappointment and frustration, the White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has said, highlighting the deepening rift between Washington and Beijing. Sweden nears 3,000 deaths. \u201cWe are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number,\u201d Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, says. The country\u2019s public health agency reports that a total of 23,918 cases have been confirmed and 2,941 deaths recorded; an increase of 87 deaths from the day before. Rather than enforcing a lockdown, Sweden has allowed many businesses to remain open, while asking citizens to keep their distance. Iran warns of \u201crising trend\u201d as virus cases top 100,000. Iran records 1,680 new infections, the highest daily figure since 11 April, taking its overall caseload beyond the 100,000 mark. The country\u2019s apparent success in controlling the epidemic has gone into reverse, with a sharp rise in the number of new daily infections over the past four days. \u201cMore than 90,000 health workers infected worldwide\u201d. At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally are believed to have been infected, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) says, noting that the the true figure could be as much as twice that. It says more than 260 nurses have died amid reports of continuing shortages of protective equipment, as it urges authorities to keep more accurate records.",
