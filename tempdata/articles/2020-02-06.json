The public broadcaster, Kan Radio, interviewed one of the Israeli passengers on board. </p> <p><strong>Q: Hello Nicole Ben-David. We\u2019re calling to ask how you guys are managing while stranded and in quarantine at sea.</strong></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re well. A bit confused, a bit worried but, all in all, we\u2019re doing well. We were supposed to disembark yesterday and to finish our 15-day tour. They informed us that it seems that we have an epidemic. They examined all of us. This morning they informed us that they had found ten people who were infected. As of 6:30 this morning, we\u2019ve been asked not to leave our rooms. We\u2019re inside the rooms. </p> <p>They\u2019ve given us food and beverages. They gave us free internet access beginning yesterday or the day before, when they announced that they were beginning the examinations. This morning they informed us that we were going to have to remain on board the ship for at least 14 days in quarantine. It isn\u2019t clear to us whether we\u2019re going to have to remain in our rooms for 14 days or on board the ship. For the time being, we\u2019re in our rooms and we\u2019re not allowed to leave them.\u201d<br></p> <p><strong>Q: Are any of the people who were diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus Israeli?</strong></p> <p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t given us information about who the people who got sick are. Out of the Israelis, we\u2019re a family with ten people, and I know that there are another two [Israeli] couples. We saw them completing the tour. As far as I can tell, none of the Israelis have been infected.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Q: How anxious are you, finding yourselves quarantined inside a cabin on board a ship out at sea? That must be an unpleasant experience.</strong></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep our sense of humour and our cool. This is just the first day. As long as we\u2019re healthy, and aren\u2019t sick, and we\u2019re getting food and beverages and the TV works\u2026 we\u2019re trying to remain optimistic and to remain calm. </p> <p>\u201cTo tell you that this isn\u2019t something that makes me anxious? It does make me anxious. Yes, it does.

Twenty people who had contact with the couple, from Wuhan but who have not shown symptoms of the virus, are still under observation at the hospital. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Italy\u2019s three-month suspension of flights from China, Hong, Macau and Taiwan sparked a diplomatic row with Taiwan. </p> <p>A representative from the Taiwanese government has urged Italy to drop the ban, arguing that the island is not part of China and that cases of the virus there have been limited. </p> <p>Italy on Wednesday began scanning passengers arriving on all international flights at its airports.

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points from today so far: The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government is \u201ctaking no chances\u201d and adopting a science-led approach in its response to the outbreak. He added that the government was expecting further cases in the UK. All arrivals to Hong Kong from mainland China will face \u2018compulsory quarantine\u2019. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said all people entering the semi-autonomous territory from the mainland, including Hong Kong residents, will be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine because of the outbreak of the new virus. Thousands of medical staff in Hong Kong have gone on strike in a bid to get the government to completely seal the border with mainland China. The medical union wants the government halt cross-border travel and prevent the spread of a new virus. Thousands of people face spending the next fortnight stuck on a luxury cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese port of Yokohama, after initial results showed 10 passengers have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Australia confirmed its 14th case of coronavirus. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton flagged that Australians being evacuated from Wuhan in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak could be sent to isolated mining camps if Christmas Island reaches capacity for people being quarantined. The Department of Health said 468 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus. All the 1,500 people who arrived on direct flights from Wuhan in January have either left the UK or are now outside the 14-day incubation period for the virus. Turkey will now also be taking temperatures of all arriving airline passengers in new prevention measures aimed at halting the spread of a virus outbreak that has killed hundreds of people in China, AP reports. Turkish health minister Fahrettin Koca said thermal cameras installed at Turkish airports would begin screening all arriving passengers Thursday. Previously, Turkey was screening travelers from China, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea and Malaysia. Turkey joins Italy, which announced earlier today that they would be screening all passengers. Last week, Italy barred all commercial flights to and from China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, the same day two Chinese tourists from hard-hit Wuhan tested positive for the new type of coronavirus in Rome. To boost precautions, the Italian health ministry and civil protection agency announced they would use thermo-scanners on all arriving passengers. \u201cIt is clear that this is a temporary measure, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told The Associated Press. The Department of Health said 468 people in the UK have now tested negative for coronavirus, according to a report by PA Media. All the 1,500 people who arrived on direct flights from Wuhan in January have either left the UK or are now outside the 14-day incubation period for the virus. Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, has criticised the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. York Press reports that Maskell called on the Government to \u2018get a grip\u2019 after it emerged that the York student with coronavirus spent a night in student accommodation. \u201cThe student did access student accommodation\u2014Vita Student accommodation\u2014despite our being told they had not,\u201d she said through a point of order in the House of Commons. \u201cThere is confusion over how information is being gathered and shared, which could have a serious impact on public confidence in how the coronavirus is being managed.\u201d Maskell added: \u201cThe government need to get a grip as we may be in the early stages of the management of this infection.\u201d Sean, who didn\u2019t want to give his last name, said it was \u201cincredibly eerie in Beijing today\u201d. The 34-year-old manager of an English language school said there was heavy snow and few people on the street. \u201cI worked from a cafe today, and was the only one inside.\u201d He described the Foreign Office\u2019s advice to \u2018leave China\u2019 last night as \u201ca huge over-reaction and disregard for expats that actually live here and call China their home\u201d. Sean added: \u201cIt\u2019s not simply a matter of hopping on a plane, it\u2019s a huge undertaking. It seemed to be a decision disconnected from the reality.\u201d He pointed out that Beijing is thousands of kilometres from Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak. \u201cIt seems strange to refer to China as a whole, we are talking about a country almost the size of Europe, and to evacuate the entire territory seems a bit much,\u201d Sean said. A Southampton student who went into isolation after feeling ill after returning from China has been given the all-clear from the new coronavirus, PA media reports. Paramedics were sent to the Mayflower halls of residence at the University of Southampton on Monday to take the student to hospital after they contacted the NHS saying they felt ill. The student has since been discharged and allowed to return to their accommodation. The student\u2019s flatmates have been told to self-isolate as a precaution and communal areas of the flat and lifts were deep-cleaned. A university spokesman said: \u201cThe student concerned at our Mayflower halls has tested negative for the new coronavirus, so has the all-clear.\u201d Here\u2019s an explainer on what self-isolation actually means. Thousands of medical staff in Hong Kong have gone on strike in a bid to get the government to completely seal the border with mainland China, AP reports. Hong Kong\u2019s hospital authority says 4,600 medical staff, mainly nurses, didn\u2019t turn up for work on Wednesday. The medical union disputes the authority\u2019s figure and said about 7,000 people took part in the strike. The group wants the government halt cross-border travel and prevent the spread of a new virus. Opposition lawmakers have criticised the decision of Hong Kong leader, Carrie Lam, to quarantine all people arriving from the mainland for 14 days instead of shutting the remaining two land border checkpoints. They said it could lead to more people from the mainland coming to Hong Kong to seek treatment that would further burden the city\u2019s already taxed medical facilities. Some Britons in China have been in touch with the Guardian to say they have no plans to leave the country any time soon. Sharon Moan, a chemistry teacher who lives with her husband and two children in Shanghai, said she is baffled by the foreign office\u2019s advice. \u201cLife here is very calm. We have few restrictions and feel that everything the local government has put in place is for everybody\u2019s benefit. We actually only began to panic when we read Western media news reports that do not reflect what is happening here. We don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary and many of our colleagues feel the same. \u201cWe feel unsupported by the consulate as there is no clear explanation as to why they have made this announcement. This is our home and the foreign office hasn\u2019t actually given us a good reason to leave it. We have no plans to leave and will carry on regardless.\u201d Dr Rob Burton, a 65-year-old academic living in a state of self-quarantine in Hangzhou with his Chinese wife, said he is under no illusion that she would be allowed entry to the UK. \u201cI have a life here and my semester at the Communication University of Zhejiang is due to start on 24 February. I feel that the attitude by the foreign office towards British nationals who are married to foreign spouses is toxic. I\u2019m not going to say goodbye to my wife and leave her stranded on her own. Who would do that? It would actually be easier for me to get my English dog, Snooky, and Chinese cat, Fluffy Bum (named in honour of Spike Milligan), home than it would my wife. \u201cI was actually in Wuhan in November so have had a few weeks of wondering if I have been infected. We have been inside for 15 days now and have only been to the supermarket twice. It becomes a psychological test as you become more stir crazy as the rumours mount up. That said, there is a huge effort going on by ordinary Chinese people which I don\u2019t see much about in the foreign press.\u201d Israeli media is reporting around 15 Israeli citizens are on the cruise ship. The public broadcaster, Kan Radio, interviewed one of the Israeli passengers on board. Q: Hello Nicole Ben-David. We\u2019re calling to ask how you guys are managing while stranded and in quarantine at sea. \u201cWe\u2019re well. A bit confused, a bit worried but, all in all, we\u2019re doing well. We were supposed to disembark yesterday and to finish our 15-day tour. They informed us that it seems that we have an epidemic. They examined all of us. This morning they informed us that they had found ten people who were infected. As of 6:30 this morning, we\u2019ve been asked not to leave our rooms. We\u2019re inside the rooms. They\u2019ve given us food and beverages. They gave us free internet access beginning yesterday or the day before, when they announced that they were beginning the examinations. This morning they informed us that we were going to have to remain on board the ship for at least 14 days in quarantine. It isn\u2019t clear to us whether we\u2019re going to have to remain in our rooms for 14 days or on board the ship. For the time being, we\u2019re in our rooms and we\u2019re not allowed to leave them.\u201d Q: Are any of the people who were diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus Israeli? \u201cThey haven\u2019t given us information about who the people who got sick are. Out of the Israelis, we\u2019re a family with ten people, and I know that there are another two [Israeli] couples. We saw them completing the tour. As far as I can tell, none of the Israelis have been infected.\u201d Q: How anxious are you, finding yourselves quarantined inside a cabin on board a ship out at sea? That must be an unpleasant experience. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep our sense of humour and our cool. This is just the first day. As long as we\u2019re healthy, and aren\u2019t sick, and we\u2019re getting food and beverages and the TV works\u2026 we\u2019re trying to remain optimistic and to remain calm. \u201cTo tell you that this isn\u2019t something that makes me anxious? It does make me anxious. Yes, it does. But we don\u2019t really have much in the way of choices.\u201d A hotel worker in the northern Italian city of Verona has tested negative for coronavirus. The woman, who was isolated after coming down with a fever, is a member of staff at the same hotel where a Chinese couple being treated for the virus in Rome stayed for one night. Doctors at Rome\u2019s Lazzaro Spallanzani hospital for infectious disease said the couple were in a \u201cstable\u201d condition after their health deteriorated on Tuesday. Twenty people who had contact with the couple, from Wuhan but who have not shown symptoms of the virus, are still under observation at the hospital. Meanwhile, Italy\u2019s three-month suspension of flights from China, Hong, Macau and Taiwan sparked a diplomatic row with Taiwan. A representative from the Taiwanese government has urged Italy to drop the ban, arguing that the island is not part of China and that cases of the virus there have been limited. Italy on Wednesday began scanning passengers arriving on all international flights at its airports. Thermal scanners had previously only been used on passengers arriving from areas affected by the virus. At Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport, the checks have also been extended to domestic flights. Here\u2019s a report from Josh Taylor, a Guardian reporter based in Melbourne, that the Australian government is considering sending its citizens evacuated from Wuhan to isolated mining camps if Christmas Island reaches capacity for people being quarantined. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, admitted there is the possibility that Christmas Island could reach capacity if the outbreak continues to spread. He said one option would be for people to share rooms, or potentially even open up other locations away from the rest of the Australian population. \u201cThere are isolated mining camps or the prospect of hotels that you could take over. But I think we\u2019ll look at all of those in order of what we think is the best response, but all of this is in the spirit of preparation.\u201d Australia has confirmed its 14th case of the coronavirus. Dr Jeannette Young, the chief health officer, said the latest case was the fourth confirmed positive test of novel coronavirus in Queensland. She said: The 37-year-old man, a Chinese national from Wuhan (Hubei province), is currently isolated in the Gold Coast University hospital (GCUH). The man is a member of the same tour group travelling with the previously confirmed cases \u2013 a 44-year-old man, a 42-year-old woman and an eight-year-old boy. All four people who have been confirmed to have novel coronavirus are stable. The five others from the same tour group remain in isolation in GCUH. African governments remain under pressure from citizens to arrange their evacuation from China amid fears of the outbreak reaching the continent. So far, most have resisted the calls but Kenyan officials have said they will evacuate 85 of their citizens who are under lockdown in Wuhan city, when restrictions on movements are lifted by Chinese authorities. The Star newspaper in Nairobi reported the decision along with comments from Kenya\u2019s ambassador to China, Sarah Serem, who last week said Kenya \u201cwill not risk further infection by flying any citizens back from China on the basis that it would be better if Kenyans in China were monitored and protected as China found a way to terminate the highly infectious virus. \u201cI don\u2019t think Kenya is ready to deal with the virus. The government of China is in a better position to deal with the virus and bringing Kenyans in China back to Kenya will only further expose the rest to the danger of infection,\u201d the newspaper quoted the ambassador as saying. Serem\u2019s comments underline the significant concerns over the potential consequences of an outbreak of the virus in Africa. The World Health Organization said yesterday the coronavirus outbreak \u201cis a high risk globally and Africa has close ties with China and other Asian countries\u201d. Dr Michel Yao, the emergency operations programme manager in WHO\u2019s regional office for Africa, said health officials were prioritising stopping transmission from affected countries and ensuring that capacity exists to isolate and to provide appropriate treatment to any confirmed cases. \u201cWhat we are emphasising to all countries is that at least they have early detection because we know how fragile is the health system in the African continent and these systems are already overwhelmed by many ongoing disease outbreaks,\u201d Yao told reporters. Many airlines have suspended or restricted flights to China from Africa, where there is yet to be a confirmed case of the virus. An Australian on a flight out of virus-struck Wuhan to Auckland has written for the Guardian on the stress of his evacuation. He wrote: I said my goodbyes to my grandparents at the house, they were holding back tears. My dad sent me into the airport. After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home, and I\u2019ll look after myself from there on. There were a lot of us evacuating, with two or three other countries including us. Everyone\u2019s wearing masks, and it was nerve-racking being around so many people in such close proximity. Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight, it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport. British nationals on holiday have spoken of their frustration and anxiety of not being able to return to their homes in China. Gareth Gough, a teacher who lives in Shenzhen with his wife, got in touch to say they are both stuck in Thailand. \u201cThere is no certainty when or if we should return and all our stuff is in our apartment,\u201d he said. Gough described the Foreign Office travel advice as \u201cfrustrating\u201d and said it\u2019s not clear what it\u2019s grounded in. \u201cA lot of people may not be able to or afford to leave \u2013 what about them? Matt Hancock says British people should leave on commercial operations, but also if you come home and have symptoms then stay at home \u2026 so which is it? I appreciate its infectious but they have not been very helpful!\u201d Christopher Halkou was on holiday in Vietnam when the Foreign Office changed its advice, \u201cinvalidating my insurance if I return to China for work as an English teacher in Shanghai\u201d. The 25-year-old said after he had two flights cancelled from Vietnam to Shanghai, he made the decision to return to London to assess the situation from there until it was deemed safer to return. Halkou added there was a \u201cfeeling of uncertainty and precariousness about when I\u2019ll be returning to Shanghai. I have valuables in my flat and rent to pay for so I have to return in some capacity to sort things there even if I decide to terminate my work contract.\u201d Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s report on the luxury cruise ship carrying 3,700 quarantined passengers off the Japanese port of Yokohama, after initial results showed 10 passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Diamond Princess has been prevented from sailing on Monday after an 80-year-old passenger who had travelled on the vessel late last month tested positive after he arrived home in Hong Kong, according to Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kat\u014d. Of a further 273 people onboard who have since been tested following health screenings, 31 results had come back \u2013 and of those 10 were positive. Hong Kong\u2019s leader has released more information on the recently announced quarantine for all those arriving from mainland China. Carrie Lam said all people entering the semi-autonomous territory from the mainland, including Hong Kong residents, will be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine because of the outbreak of the new virus, according to a report by AP. Lam said the measure will take effect on Saturday to allow Hong Kong day travellers to make necessary arrangements. She added that two cruise ship terminals, including one where a ship is under quarantine, will be shut down. Lam said the government is looking for more quarantine facilities in addition to the three camps in use and stressed the authorities have remained vigilant and will not shy away from introducing stringent measures to stem the spread of the virus. There\u2019s been praise for the British embassy in Beijing, which is supporting the evacuation process. Paul Maloney, who works for the British Council in China, tweeted he was grateful the embassy was able to help evacuate his family, including his young son Theo, who needed an emergency passport in order to travel. AFP is reporting that travellers from mainland China will be forced to face \u201dcompulsory quarantine\u201d when they arrive in Hong Kong. More readers have got in touch in response to the Foreign Office\u2019s advice urging UK nationals to leave China. Liam Dutch, a 26-year-old teacher in Shenzhen, said he was \u201cconflicted\u201d about the British government\u2019s advice to leave China. \u201cMany of us have spent a lot of time building new lives here, it is not simply a case of \u2018booking a flight home to then return at an unknown date\u2019. \u201cIt would be like putting my life on pause. Firstly, it\u2019s highly expensive to travel 10,000 miles home, and then come back again. Secondly, we do have contractual obligations, rent to pay, friends and girlfriends and of course, our general everyday lives, which we have become accustomed to.\u201d Andy Roberts, a university lecturer, said he is currently housebound with his wife in Ningbo. Roberts has been married to his wife, a 39-year-old Chinese national for 14 years. She has previously lived in UK for 10 years. The 59-year-old said they are restricted to staying in their apartment and only one family member is allowed to visit the supermarket every two days. \u201cThe UK advice is not very practical as getting to an airport and finding a flight would be difficult right now. And if I did go back where would I go? My home is here in China. We are keeping our spirits up; I\u2019m cycling everyday on my indoor trainer, escaping to Zwift virtual worlds, while my wife is working out from YouTube Zumba clips. The cats aren\u2019t fussed. \u201cAt the moment we can still walk round the compound as long as we have masks on and we stop and chat to neighbours, albeit from a distance.\u201d Stock markets have staged a rapid reversal in the last few minutes, after reports of an effective treatment for coronavirus. The reports remain unconfirmed. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.5% at about 7,477 points, having previously been down by 0.3%. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which measures large companies across Europe, is up by 0.5% for the day, having previously dipped. Reuters reports that traders have cited a Chinese TV report that a research team at Zhejiang University has found an effective drug to treat people with the new coronavirus. Oil prices, weighed down by concerns on coronavirus\u2019s impact on demand, have gained a dollar after the reports. Brent crude oil futures prices jumped from a low of $54.12 per barrel just after 8am to over $55.1 an hour later. They are now up by 2.2% for the day. Cathay Pacific has asked its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave in the next few months as Hong Kong\u2019s flagship carrier reels from coronavirus outbreak, according to a report by South China Morning Post. \u201cI am appealing to each and everyone of you to help,\u201d said Augustus Tang Kin-wing, the company\u2019s CEO, in a taped video recording, adding the situation the company faced was \u201cjust as grave\u201d as the global financial crisis of 2009. \u201cPreserving our cash is now key to protecting our business,\u201d he said. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government was expecting further cases in the UK. He insisted the government was \u201ctaking no chances\u201d and adopting a science-led approach in its response to the outbreak. In an unexpected announcement on Tuesday, the Foreign Office urged UK citizens to leave China because of the coronavirus. Asked how, logistically, Britons are expected to return to the UK, Hancock told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThere are still commercial flights available. The principle that we are taking is that we want to take no chances with this virus. We want to take a science-led approach.\u201d \u201cThe approach we have been taking is very much driven by the advice of the chief medical officer. This is a very serious virus and having a very serious impact in china,\u201d Hancock added. \u201cThere are two cases only here in the UK but we do expect more, so we are taking no chances.\u201d The two people confirmed to have the virus in the UK remain in quarantine, while a Briton has tested negative after falling ill on a flight back from China. Hancock said people returning from China would not be quarantined and should instead remain at home and call medics if they express symptoms. \u201cThe advice is that if they have symptoms then they should stay at home, self-isolate as it\u2019s called, and call 111, not go to the GP or to the A&amp;E because there\u2019s a risk of spreading the virus,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. Owen Moone, a British teacher in Shenzhen in Guangdong province, said he was stuck in Vietnam because his flight back was cancelled. The 34-year-old was on holiday in Vietnam for the lunar new year. \u201cLuckily it\u2019s a cheap country, but I only have a 30-day visa. I\u2019m not sure when flights will be reinstated to Hong Kong or mainland China, but I need to return either to work or get my stuff,\u201d Moone said. \u201cPart of me is tempted to go home or to Canada where my girlfriend is visiting family. Not sure when the situation will change as there is currently a lot of ambiguity and things are changing by the day.\u201d Moone added his school was due to start back on 10 February, but has now been delayed until 17 February. \u201cIt\u2019s the ambiguity and lack of clarity that is frustrating for me, although I am of course sympathetic that it is a rapidly changing situation so certainties are hard to come by,\u201d he said. The spread of a new coronavirus could throw \u201ccold water\u201d on the 2020 Olympics, senior organisers have warned. Toshiro Muto, the chief executive officer, sounded a grave note speaking at a meeting with officials of the International Paralympic Committee, according to a report by AP. \u201cI am seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games,\u201d Muto said. \u201cI hope that it will be stamped out as soon as possible.\u201d Saburo Kawabuchi, the mayor of the Athletes Village, where 11,000 Olympians will stay, was also apprehensive. \u201cI truly hope that the infectious disease will die down somehow so that we will be able to operate the Paralympics and Olympics smoothly,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the worst case we will do our utmost for the athletes so that they will be able to concentrate on performing their best.\u201d I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the Coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com, or reach me through my Twitter profile, @aamnamohdin Good morning, this is Aamna Mohdin taking over the blog from Martin Farrer. LG has become the first major technology company to pull out of the Mobile World Congress (MWC) due to take place in Barcelona over concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. PA Media reports that the Korean firm would not be attending the technology convention, one of the largest events in the industry calendar, to announce its latest gadgets. The company will instead hold separate events in the near future. A number of other technology companies, including Sony, Samsung, Huawei and Microsoft are still due to appear at MWC. LG said in a statement: LG Electronics is closely monitoring the situation related to the novel coronavirus outbreak, which was recently declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization, as the virus continues to spread outside China. With the safety of its employees, partners and customers foremost in mind, LG has decided to withdraw from exhibiting and participating in MWC 2020 later this month in Barcelona, Spain. This decision removes the risk of exposing hundreds of LG employees to international travel, which has already become more restrictive as the virus continues to spread across borders. In lieu of its participation in MWC, LG will be holding separate events in the near future to announce its 2020 mobile products. LG Electronics thanks its supporters and the public for their understanding during these difficult and challenging times.\u201d That\u2019s about it from me for today. I\u2019m handing our rolling coverage to my colleague Aamna Mohdin. Thanks for joining me. Here are the main points from today so far: The death toll from novel coronavirus has climbed to 490 in mainland China. There remains one additional fatality in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. There are now 24,505 confirmed cases around the world, 24,292 being in mainland China. Thousands of crew and passengers onboard a cruise ship in Japan are being held in quarantine for at least two weeks after 10 people tested positive for the virus. Hundreds more people have been tested and results are awaited. A British passenger, David Abel, said the Diamond Princess was like a \u201cghost town\u201d. Passengers and crew on another cruise ship, the World Dream, are also being quarantined in Hong Kong after 30 crew members showed symptoms of coronavirus, including fever. Britain is sending a final evacuation plane to Wuhan this weekend where it is understood that about 165 Britons remain. Japan is sending a fourth plane. A plane carrying New Zealanders, Australians, Britons and people from several Pacific nations has landed in Auckland from Wuhan. They will be quarantined for two weeks. The economic impact on China is mounting as more cities went into lockdown. Oxford Economics say two percentage points could be knocked off the country\u2019s growth this quarter. United and American Airlines have suspended flights in and out of Hong Kong. The World Health Organization says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. Financial markets in Asia have rallied again on Wednesday as investors continued to believe that the economic impact of the crisis will be limited. Economists have warned that the Chinese economy faces a severe hit in the first quarter of the year as huge parts of its manufacturing and service industries remain shut down. \u201cThe inopportune timing of the outbreak around Chinese New Year, a time of increased transport and economic connectivity... as well as the lockdown of affected regions all add to the equation,\u201d Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics told AFP. Oxford Economics believes the virus could knock at least two percentage points off China\u2019s growth in the first quarter before it bounces back in April-June. It cut its full-year outlook to an expansion of 5.4%, which is well down from its previous estimate of 6%. AFP says that 56 million people in Hubei province alone are in lockdown as the government tries to stop the spread of the disease. The annual new year holiday was due to end last weekend but has been extended for many factories until 10 February to limit contagion. Hangzhou near Shanghai has imposed severe restrictions on residents. Some three million people in the city, the home of Alibaba, one of China\u2019s biggest companies, have been told only one person per household will be allowed outside every two days to buy necessities. At least three other cities in eastern Zhejiang province - Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo - have imposed the same measures, affecting some 18 million people, AFP says. Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which is based in Wuhan and is one of China\u2019s biggest carmakers, said its factories remained shut and would only reopen dependin \u201con the prevention and control of the epidemic\u201d. The team at Capital Economics said there was very little data coming out of China to make a proper judgment but they said that the number of confirmed cases within China has continued to rise and is now almost four times the number recorded in the Sars outbreak in 2003. Capital said: If the disruption fades soon, there is still a chance that employment and incomes will be relatively unaffected. In this case, consumer spending may simply be deferred temporarily, resulting in a strong rebound in domestic demand later this year, as happened with SARS. But the longer the outbreak drags on, the greater the risk of a hit to employment and a more permanent loss of output. A third case has been confirmed in the Philippines. The WHO says a 60-year-old Chinese woman has coronavirus. And in another development, Uzbekistan is evacuating 84 people from Wuhan, according to Uzbekistan Airways. The central Asian nation joins a host of other countries to send planes to rescue its citizens. Reuters has reported some fascinating detail about an international business meeting held in Singapore in Janaury that reveals something about the way in which the virus has spread around the world. Officials in Malaysia said on Tuesday that its first citizen to be infected with the virus - a 41-year-old man - had attended the meeting that had also included several international delegations, some from China, Reuters says. On Wednesday officials in South Korea said a 38-year-old Korean who came into contact with the Malaysian when he travelled to Singapore for a conference has also been infected. The South Korean man had a meal with the Malaysian man, as well as several other South Koreans during the conference, South Korea\u2019s Joongang Ilbo newspaper reported. Singapore\u2019s health ministry said on Tuesday that the meeting involving the Malaysian took place at the Grand Hyatt Hotel, adding the city-state was working to identify individuals in close contact with the cases. Peter Beaumont, a senior reporter on the our global development desk, has been looking at whether it\u2019s fair to criticise the World Health Organization for its handling of the crisis. Critics have said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been guilty of doing China\u2019s bidding by not declaring the virus a world health emergency quickly enough. A smiling Ghebreyesus has been pictured in Beijing with Chinese president Xi Jinping leading to accusations that Beijing was not being pushed hard enough to come clean about the extent of the contagion. Beijing is a large donor to the WHO. But Beaumont argues that it is still difficult for the WHO to push its diplomacy with China too hard for fear of being shut out. He quotes one source as saying: \u201cChina was very quick to let the WHO know what was happening on 31 December. The organisation\u2019s goal was to get as much information about what was happening in China to inform what the rest of the world would need to do.\u201d Read his whole piece here: A new documentary Netflix series called Pandemic has been released with horribly appropriate timing. It explores what can be done to tackle the spread of diseases such as Sars and swine flu. Our feature writer, Brigid Delaney, says it \u201cmoved her to tears\u201d. Hong Kong health officials say 90% of passengers on the ship are Hong Kongers and that none have had contact with three mainland Chinese who developed symptoms of the virus while on board between 19 and 24 January. Three passengers developed the virus after leaving Guangzhou on the ship on 19 January, Genting Cruise Lines, which owns the operator Dream Cruises, said. They disembarked in Vietnam for treatment and the ship returned to Guangzhou on 24 January. The South China Morning Post and the Chinese website TenCent reports that authorities in Zhaoqing, a city in northern Guangdong, said a person who was on that cruise was diagnosed with coronavirus on Saturday. Health officials in Zhaoqing said another 41 people on the cruise should quarantine themselves at home or get in touch with dooctors if they develop a fever. They added that there were 108 people from Hubei on the cruise, including 28 from Wuhan. Hong Kong\u2019s health department says 30 crew on the World Dream cruise ship docked in Hong Kong have symptoms of the coronavirus. It added that department staff are conducting tests on 1,800 crew and passengers on board the ship. It was refused a berth in port in Taiwan on Tuesday and returned to Hong Kong. Medical workers in Hong Kong have begun a third day of strike action over concerns that the city\u2019s government is not doing enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Hong Kong recorded its first death from the outbreak on Tuesday and has 18 confirmed cases, bringing more calls for the authorities to seal the last remaining routes in and out to the mainland. \u201cAs the disease is spreading rapidly in our community, and locally infected cases are steadily increasing, we are dangerously close to a massive community outbreak comparable to Sars,\u201d a newly formed union called the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance (HAEA) said in a statement. On Wednesday, dozens of medical representatives including the chairwoman of HAEA, Winnie Yu, marched to government headquarters to press their demands for the border to be sealed. Carrie Lam, the city\u2019s chief executive, has kept open three routes to China, arguing that to close them would be \u201cinappropriate, impractical and discriminatory\u201d. The UK\u2019s Press Association agency has spoken to a British man in Wuhan who fears he contracted the virus at the end of November but is not sure how he will get out of the city. So news of another evacuation flight may give hope to Jamie Morris, a 23-year-old teacher from New Tredegar in South Wales. He said he had not been able to make the recent flights back to the UK because his passport had been given to the Chinese government to extend his residency permit. He said the Foreign Office\u2019s crisis team in London had told him \u201cto be patient and they will be in touch if anything changes\u201d. The Japanese foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said on Wednesday that Japan would send a fourth chartered flight to Wuhan tomorrow to bring back about 200 passengers. The passengers could include Japanese nationals as well as their Chinese spouses, Motegi told reporters. Japan has already sent three planes to Wuhan to evacuate hundreds of its citizens. Reuters reports that a Canadian man on a flight from Toronto to Jamaica falsely announced to passengers that he had the coronavirus, forcing the plane to return to the airport where he was arrested. The incident occurred on Monday during a WestJet Airlines flight from Toronto to Montego Bay. The Boeing 767 was carrying 243 passengers. \u201cA male was causing a disturbance on the flight, saying he had been to China and had the coronavirus,\u201d said Sarah Patten, a spokeswoman for police in the town of Peel, close to Toronto\u2019s Pearson international airport. After the plane landed, the 29-year-old man was checked by medical staff who concluded he did not have the coronavirus. He was arrested, charged with mischief and will appear in court on 9 March. Julie-Anne Broderick, a passenger on the plane, said she saw the man taking a selfie and announcing he had the virus. \u201cThe flight attendants came, gave him a mask and gloves and just told him that he had to move to the back of the plane,\u201d she told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The captain then told passengers he thought the incident was a hoax but had to return to Toronto, she added. The UK government is chartering a final flight to bring British nationals back from Wuhan. After Britons in mainland China were controversially urged to leave the country, the Foreign Office said the plane was expected to leave in the early hours of Sunday morning local time and will land at RAF Brize Norton. It added that the government wanted to ensure that all British nationals in Hubei province contact the Foreign Office to register if they want to leave on the flight. According to the Press Assocation new agency, 165 Britons and their dependants remain in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, while 108 people have requested assistance to leave as of the early hours of Wednesday. A total of 94 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain from Wuhan on two flights which arrived on Friday and Sunday. One passenger was taken to hospital in Oxford after telling medics he had a cough and a cold, while the rest of those who came back are in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral. Passengers on another cruise ship are being tested for the virus. World Dream, which is run by Dream Cruises, was denied entry to the southern Taiwan port of Kaohsiung aon Tuesday and docked in Hong Kong on Wednesday. All passengers and crew are undergoing health checks, Cable TV reported, according to Reuters. The ship visited Taiwan\u2019s northern Keelung port on Monday, Taiwan\u2019s health authorities said, and some passengers were allowed to disembark. The death toll from novel coronavirus has climbed to 490 in mainland China, with one additional fatality in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. There are now 24,505 confirmed cases around the world, 24,292 being in mainland China. Ten people on board a cruise ship anchored off Yokohama in Japan have tested positive for the virus. In total, 273 people of the 3,700 on board the Diamond Princess have been tested, with only 31 results in so far. The infected people have been taken to hospitals onshore for treatment. The ship and all those on board is being quarantined for at least 14 days. Read our full story on the stricken vessel here. United and American Airlines have suspended flights in and out of Hong Kong. Nearly 200 people \u2013 mostly New Zealanders and Australians \u2013 are on their way to Auckland on a specially chartered plane from Wuhan. The World Health Organization says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to halt the spread of the disease. Financial markets in Asia have rallied again on Wednesday as investors continued to believe that the economic impact of the crisis will be limited. The Chinese government continues to try to put a positive spin on the crisis that has seen millions of people forced to stay in their homes. The state news agency Xinhua tweeted some suggestions today about how families can amuse themselves in the confines of their homes. My colleague Alison Rourke detailed some of the other positive message put out by Beijing here: The number of cases of novel coronavirus around the world has reached 24,505, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker site. The vast majority \u2013 24,292 \u2013 are in mainland China with 213 around the world. (Those figures from the university don\u2019t include the 10 on the Diamond Princess in Japan.) The Carnival statement said the infected people will be taken ashore to Yokohama by the Japanese coastguard and taken to local hospitals. The ship will remain under quarantine off Yokohama for at least 14 days, as required by the ministry of health. The statement also said: The ship will go out to sea \u201cto perform normal marine operations\u201d such as the production of fresh water and ballast operations before picking up food, provisions and other supplies from Yokohama. Passengers will receive free internet and telephone to stay in contact with their family and loved ones. The crew is working to keep all guests comfortable. Princess Cruises \u2013 part of the UK-listed Carnival \u2013 \u201cwill continue to fully cooperate with and follow the instructions of global medical authorities and the Japanese government\u201d. Carnival has cancelled the next two Diamond Princess cruises departing Yokohama (yesterday and 12 February). There are 2,666 guests and 1,045 crew currently onboard. Approximately half the guestsare from Japan. Two Australians are among the 10 people who have tested positive for coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the cruise company Carnival have confirmed. The other people infected are three Japanese, three from Hong Kong, one American and one Filipino crewmember. Justin McCurry has been finding out more information about the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is being quarantined off the coast of Yokohama in Japan after an outbreak of coronavirus on board. Ten people have tested positive for the virus out of 31 results that have come back so far from 273 tests. David Abel, a British passenger who is on board the ship with his wife Sally, described the situation on his Facebook page. We are now officially in quarantine. It appears that our quarantine is on board the ship, that we will not be taken off to a hospital. The 10 people that are affected, they are being taken off very soon by the local coastguard into a medical facility. We are to remain on board the ship and we are confined to our cabins. The ship is like a ghost town, it\u2019s really weird. I went for a walk around a part of the ship that is normally really busy \u2013 the musicians were still out playing, but where there normally would have been crowds of people, I saw maybe 20. Even the shopping areas where it would be packed are empty. We\u2019ll have a full report soon. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, the authorities are converting an additional eight buildings, including gymnasiums, exhibition centres and sports centres, into hospitals, the official Xinhua news agency has reported. That\u2019s on top of three conversions already announced. Together the process will add an extra 10,000 beds to the city\u2019s hospital capacity. There have been 8,351 confirmed cases in the city, according to the Chinese news website TenCent. A new hospital in Wuhan with 1,000 beds opened to patients on Monday. And here\u2019s a timelapse video of how that first emergency hospital was built in a matter of days. There\u2019s also another 1,600-bed hospital being built. The economic impact of the outbreak appears to be building. We\u2019ve already heard about a widening lockdown in China, with Hangzhou being the latest city to restrict movement. That kind of measure will inevitably hurt the economy but foreign companies are also feeling the impact and deepening the effects by suspending operations in China and Asia generally. The latest companies to warn about the impact, or to flag closure of some operations include: American Airlines and United Airlines are suspending all flights to and from Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific Airways which said on Tuesday that it will cut around 30% of its capacity over the next two months. The carmaker Hyundai is suspending production in South Korea because of disruption to the supply of parts. Nike, which has closed around half its stores in China, says its operations will continue to be hurt by the lockdown seen across China. Nevertheless, the financial markets appear fairly sanguine about it all. All the major stock markets are up quite a bit today. The ASX200 in Sydney is up 0.43%, the Nikkei is up 1%, Seoul is up 0.74%, Hong Kong is up 0.87 and Shanghai is 1.11% to the good. Oil also shook off its problems. Brent crude oil futures rose US44c, or 0.8%, to $54.40 a barrel on the prospect of production cuts by Opec this month. The World Health Organization says there is a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The WHO has declared the outbreak a global health emergency but it said on Tuesday night that the lockdown put in place by the Chinese government to limit the spread from the epicentre of Wuhan offered a chance to halt transmission. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday: While 99% of cases are in China, in the rest of the world we only have 176 cases. That doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t get worse. But for sure we have a window of opportunity to act\u201d More on the Japanese cruise ship from our correspondent in Tokyo, Justin McCurry. Tests for the virus have been carried out on 273 of the 3,700 passengers and crew on board the Diamond Princess after an 80-year-old man who had been on the ship last month tested positive when he arrived home in Hong Kong. Justin writes: Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said only passengers and crew who had been in close contact with the infected man or were feeling unwell had been tested. Of the 273 people tested, 31 results had come back \u2013 and of those 10 had tested positive, Kato said. The 10 infected passengers, who include three Japanese nationals, are being transferred to a hospital. It was immediately not clear if health authorities planned to test other passengers. Kato said the remaining passengers and crew would be required to stay on the vessel for 14 days \u2013 the maximum incubation period of the respiratory illness. Carnival Japan, the local unit of the British-American cruise operator, said on Tuesday the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by about 24 hours. It was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. The 10 new cases bring the total number of confirmed infections in Japan to 33. The suspension of flights by airlines into China has now spread to Hong Kong. The two biggest carriers in the United States, American Airlines and United Airlines, said late on Tuesday US time that they won\u2019t fly in or out of the territory for two weeks. An American Airlines spokeswoman said its suspension of its Hong Kong flights to and from Los Angeles and Dallas had begun on Tuesday and would continue until 20 February. United Airlines said falling demand meant it was suspending its flights, also until 20 February. The carrier\u2019s last US flight to Hong Kong will depart San Francisco on Wednesday and the last return flight to San Francisco from Hong Kong will depart on Friday. The US government has already placed severe restrictions on travel from China into the US. Last week American Airlines suspended its flights to and from mainland China until 27 March. United has now suspended US-bound flights from mainland until 28 March. Ten people onboard a cruise ship docked off the port of Yokohama have tested positive for coronavirus, the Japanese health minister said on Wednesday morning. Hundreds more of the 3,700 passengers and crew on the Diamind Princess ship have been tested and are awaiting results. So far 273 people have been tested and 31 results have come back. The ship is run by the UK-listed Carnival cruise company. It said on Tuesday night that the departure of the ship had been delayed by 24 hours. The health checks began on Monday evening after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man who sailed on the vessel last month tested positive for the Wuhan coronavirus, Reuters said. Back to the Air New Zealand flight that left Wuhan on Wednesday morning. Radio New Zealand is reporting that one person was stopped from boarding the plane because they were found to be unwell after the screening process for passengers. RNZ reports that New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry said about 60 people who registered for the flight did not turn up at the airport. This is the full list of nationalities on the plane: 54 New Zealand citizens and 44 New Zealand permanent residents on Chinese passports 23 Australian Citizens and 12 Australian permanent residents on Chinese passports 17 Timor Leste 17 Papua New Guinea 8 Britain 5 Samoa 4 Tonga 2 Fiji 1 Kiribati 1 Federated States of Micronesia 1 Uzbekistan 1 Netherlands Our reporter Ben Doherty is on Christmas Island where Australian evacuees are being taken for quarantining. There are 35 Australians on board an Air New Zealand plane that left Wuhan for Auckland on Wednesday morning local time, along with 100 New Zealnders, some Britons and also people from several Pacific nations. The Australians will then be flown from Auckland to Christmas Island, which is on the other side of Australia in the Indian Ocean, making for a journey of 17,000km. Ben has sent this report on the extraordinarily roundabout route the Australians are being forced to take and it includes this excellent map. It\u2019s worth noting that the number of deaths in China rose by 65 from 425 on Tuesday to 490 today. That\u2019s an increase of 15.3% compared with a percentage increase of 18% the day before. So perhaps there are signs that the rate of fatalities is slowing. The number was closer to 30% on some days last week. The latest figures show that 490 people have died in mainland China from the virus. According to the very reliable Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are now 23,680 confirmed cases in the mainland meaning the mortality rate from the virus is 2.07% nationally. Of the deaths, 479 have now occurred in Hubei province where the capital, Wuhan, is the eipicentre of the deadly outbreak. There have been 16,678 confirmed cases in the province making for a death rate of 2.87% in the province. The next highest number of deaths is two in the provinces of Henan, Chongqing and Heliongjiang, showing how concentrated the outbreak has been. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and I\u2019ll start by outlining the main developments today: The death toll in the Chinese province of Hubei has risen to 479 as of the end of Tuesday local time. There have been 3,156 new cases reported in the epicentre making 16,678 in the province. The mainland China total is now 490 deaths, with 23,680 recorded cases. There has also been one death in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines, bringing the global total to 492. Almost a dozen people on a cruise liner at the Japanese port of Yokohama have tested positive for coronavirus, Reuters is reporting. All British nationals have been advised to leave China in a move criticised as leaving people to fend for themselves. An eight-year-old boy has become Australia\u2019s 13th confirmed case. He is isolation in a hospital in Queensland. An Air New Zealand evacuation has left Wuhan carrying 193 passengers, including 100 New Zealanders, 23 Australians and 70 people from Pacific countries such as Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. Hyundai is suspending production in South Korea because the outbreak has disrupted the supply of parts from China. Nike became the latest multinational company to warns that it expects its business to be damaged by the outbreak. Global financial markets rallied for the second day in a row on Tuesday as invesorts shrugged off concerns that the virus could damage the world economy. BeforeI bring you more details on all these developments, here is a roundup some of the precautions being taken by countries around the world:",

Phosphate mining remains the major industry on the island \u2013 yellow and blue high-vis shirts dominate backs and clotheslines all over \u2013 but as production winds down, including a months-long shutdown last year and this, the industry counts its future in years, not decades. The question is being asked: \u201cWhat next does this island do?\u201d Tourism is the obvious answer. The remote beauty of the island, its forests, snorkelling and the red crab migration, are all attractions, but the detention centre, hidden away at the end of the island, somehow looms large still. \u201cFor years this place was known as an island of incarceration. We were emerging from that and, while this is short-term and the reasons are different, again, all that people are hearing about Christmas Island is people being incarcerated again,\u201d Thomson says. He argues Christmas Island is a non-self-governing territory and should be placed on the United Nations of those territories that have the right to a vote on independence. He believes there is significant support across the island for a \u201cfree association\u201d with Australia, as the Marshall Islands does with the US, and Tokelau with New Zealand \u2013 a political arrangement which would give the island greater autonomy and control over its own land. \u201cThat way, we\u2019d have a say in what happens here.\u201d",

It\u2019s about survival.\u201d Economists at Fitch Solutions Macro research have slashed their growth forecasts for Hong Kong in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and believe the economy will shrink another 2.6% this year even though the protests have stalled. \u201cAlthough the protests seem to have lost momentum amid health concerns, the 2019 novel coronavirus would further weigh on the economy,\u201d they said in a note on Tuesday. \u201cMoreover, we believe that the political outlook in Hong Kong remains fragile, given that the \u2018Five Great Demands\u2019 of the protestors remain unmet, which suggests that large-scale protests would easily resume once the coronavirus epidemic subsides.\u201d Only government spending would make a positive contribution to the bottom line, they said, as consumer spending and tourism faced huge falls. The tourism sector would be particularly badly hit, they said, as the closure of 11 out of 13 border crossings and the new quarantine measures would see a \u201csignificant\u201d reduction of Chinese tourists, who make up three-quarters of holidaymakers. Business investment has also \u201ctaken a pounding\u201d Fitch Solutions added, and could get much worse if the virus spreads more widely within Hong Kong, resulting in a Wuhan-style lockdown. Trinh Nguyen, senior economist for emerging Asia for the investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, said the wider Asia Pacific economy faced a gloomy outlook if the coronavirus crisis was not brought under control quickly. \u201cWe know for sure that Chinese tourists are staying home and that is bad news for Macau, Hong Kong, and Thailand,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cBut other economies like the Philippines and Vietnam will feel it too as the share of GDP is large. So across the region, the impact is negative but more so for Thailand as its dependency on Chinese tourists has increased to now 2.7% of GDP. \u201cBeyond tourism, the slowdown of China will curb import demand and also disrupt supply chain as many economies in Asia depend on China for imported parts for final production as well as lower Chinese demand for commodities pushing down prices. Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia and Australia are very impacted by this,\u201d she said.",

between <strong>Tim Watts</strong> and <strong>Tony Smith</strong> on the <strong>Christopher Pyne</strong> \u2018joke\u2019.</p> <p><strong>Watts:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I refer to recent comments made by the former minister for defence, Christopher Pyne, in conversation with the former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, <strong>Martin Parkinson</strong>, on the 20 January 2020 episode of the <em>Pyne Time</em> podcast. In the conversation, Mr Pyne commented on the malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network, discovered in early 2019, stating that he and Mr Parkinson knew \u2018how much worse it all was\u2019 and that they \u2018could never talk about it\u2019. </p> <p>Putting aside the extraordinary indiscretion of a former minister for defence making comments of this kind, I refer to your statement to the House on 12 February 2019 about the extent of this attack. </p> <p>I know that you appreciate the seriousness of public confidence in this institution and I acknowledge and thank you for your written response to my correspondence with you on this matter. I ask whether for the benefit of the House you could share your response to Mr Pyne\u2019s comments.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Smith:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I first thank the member for Gellibrand for bringing the matter to my attention in writing. I have replied, as he said, outlining \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve replied jointly with the president of the Senate. I think it is important that I do, given these comments have been made, make a statement to the House, which I\u2019ll do now.</p> <p>I\u2019m only aware of the comments thanks to the member for Gellibrand, but I\u2019ll just say this: following discovery of the cybersecurity incident in January of last year, as members would be aware, the president and I, as we have said, received detailed briefings from the Australian Signals Directorate and the Department of Parliamentary Services. Communication and management of the incidents was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament on this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself.</p> <p>I finally say the podcast also refers to a cyberintrusion at the Australian National University, which is in the transcript that you kindly forwarded to me. So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. </p> <p>The important point is that the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant with his comments, and I thank the member for Gellibrand again.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T06:25:50.500Z\">at 6.25am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3ba8588f086a28115a6865\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T05:47:15.764Z\">5.47am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Senator <strong>Jacqui Lambie </strong>has been asked on ABC Afternoon Briefing about her proposed amendments to the union penalty bill.<br></p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/04/jacqui-lambie-wants-deal-on-union-busting-bill-as-soon-as-possible\">Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday</a>, Lambie is trying to strike a deal with the government \u201cas soon as possible\u201d on the bill, which lowers the threshold for deregistering unions or disqualifying their officials.</p> <p>Lambie replied: \u201c<em>We are still talking through those amendments ... <strong>The hold-up is when it comes to, there\u2019s a points system, on whether or not it\u2019s constitutional</strong>, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing at the moment. I do believe that the other amendments are sitting there, there\u2019s just a couple of other issues and one of them is the points system. That could be a little bit constitutional.

I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself.</p> <p>I would just finally say the podcast also refers to a cyber intrusion at the Australian National University.</p> <p>...

But as is the case with all fire events, or as is the case with all flood events and other natural disasters, this actual nationally coordinated effort is designed to constantly look at those issues, post these events. </p> <p>And the recommendations come forward from the chiefs, those directly responsible for fighting these fires and coordinating resources. </p> <p>And you\u2019re right, these fires have been going on for some months now and when I was speaking with the commissioner on the weekend out at Wilberforce, where we have the megafire in the north-west at the moment, we were talking through the crew rotations. </p> <p><strong>And the fact is these crews, yes, they\u2019re tired, but they also want to be out there defending their communities.

Plus estimates is coming up. So prepare yourself. It is committee day tomorrow, so make sure you check in with the Guardian to see what is happening across the day, as well as all the other news which happens outside this place. A very, very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for their never-ending help today, which is also extended to the rest of the Guardian brains trust. You might not get to know all their names, but it is a small but mighty team who keep this blog ticking over and from the moderators to the subs, to the editors, we could not do it without them. I hope you manage to have some switch-off time between now and Monday morning. I\u2019ll be back on the news beat in the meantime, but will be back with you in blog capacity just before 8am when parliament resumes. Have a wonderful weekend. And take care of you. And now the House is adjourned. From Mike Bowers\u2019 lens to your eyeballs: When you start with the man in the mirror and ask him to change his ways. The Senate is on to its adjournment debate. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go There\u2019s a heart (there\u2019s a heart), a hand to hold onto. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go There\u2019s a place, of Somebody who needs you Everywhere you look. Further to my earlier post on Jacqui Lambie: A spokesman for the attorney general, Christian Porter, said: \u201cThere are no constitutional issues with the points system and the government is continuing direct discussions with the crossbench including Senator Lambie.\u201d Here is the whole exchange between Tim Watts and Tony Smith on the Christopher Pyne \u2018joke\u2019. Watts: I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. I refer to recent comments made by the former minister for defence, Christopher Pyne, in conversation with the former secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Martin Parkinson, on the 20 January 2020 episode of the Pyne Time podcast. In the conversation, Mr Pyne commented on the malicious intrusion into the Australian Parliament House computer network, discovered in early 2019, stating that he and Mr Parkinson knew \u2018how much worse it all was\u2019 and that they \u2018could never talk about it\u2019. Putting aside the extraordinary indiscretion of a former minister for defence making comments of this kind, I refer to your statement to the House on 12 February 2019 about the extent of this attack. I know that you appreciate the seriousness of public confidence in this institution and I acknowledge and thank you for your written response to my correspondence with you on this matter. I ask whether for the benefit of the House you could share your response to Mr Pyne\u2019s comments. Smith: I first thank the member for Gellibrand for bringing the matter to my attention in writing. I have replied, as he said, outlining \u2013 in fact, I\u2019ve replied jointly with the president of the Senate. I think it is important that I do, given these comments have been made, make a statement to the House, which I\u2019ll do now. I\u2019m only aware of the comments thanks to the member for Gellibrand, but I\u2019ll just say this: following discovery of the cybersecurity incident in January of last year, as members would be aware, the president and I, as we have said, received detailed briefings from the Australian Signals Directorate and the Department of Parliamentary Services. Communication and management of the incidents was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament on this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself. I finally say the podcast also refers to a cyberintrusion at the Australian National University, which is in the transcript that you kindly forwarded to me. So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. The important point is that the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant with his comments, and I thank the member for Gellibrand again. Senator Jacqui Lambie has been asked on ABC Afternoon Briefing about her proposed amendments to the union penalty bill. As Guardian Australia reported on Tuesday, Lambie is trying to strike a deal with the government \u201cas soon as possible\u201d on the bill, which lowers the threshold for deregistering unions or disqualifying their officials. Lambie replied: \u201cWe are still talking through those amendments ... The hold-up is when it comes to, there\u2019s a points system, on whether or not it\u2019s constitutional, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing at the moment. I do believe that the other amendments are sitting there, there\u2019s just a couple of other issues and one of them is the points system. That could be a little bit constitutional. So do we work it around so we still get the same result and the same outcome and we\u2019re just trying to tie that in now\u201d. That\u2019s a very interesting answer. The points system was introduced by Centre Alliance amendments as a sort-of three strikes policy to prevent disqualification of union officials for minor offences. The government accepted the amendments in a bid to pass the bill. It\u2019s possible Lambie has blown the whistle on a problem not just with her proposed amendments but the scheme of the bill put to the Senate and defeated in November. I\u2019ve asked the attorney general, Christian Porter, to clarify. OK, it took some transcription time, but we got there. At the end of question time, Tim Watts raised an issue with Tony Smith, asking about comments the former minister Christopher Pyne made in his podcast with the former Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary Martin Parkinson. Pyne and Parkinson were talking about the breach of the parliamentary network last year on the podcast, which led to this exchange: Parkinson: I\u2019m amazed, actually, at how little concern is expressed by the public when these breaches occur. Pyne: Everyone almost factors it in, don\u2019t they? Parkinson: Yeah. Pyne: They think \u201coh well\u201d. Parkinson: Look at ANU, at what\u2019s happened. I\u2019m not blaming ANU but just saying we should be appalled by this. Look at what happened at Parliament House. We should be appalled. Pyne: You and I know how much worse it all was, which we could never talk about (laughs). Parkinson: No (laughs). Watts asked Smith whether this is something Pyne should be joking about, and whether he had gone past his boundaries by hinting there was more to what the public was told about the breach. Smith said he was unaware of what Pyne was talking about: Communication and management of the incident was guided by the information available to us as presiding officers in the context of the parliamentary computing network,\u201d Smith said. Of course, as we pointed out, our statements balanced the need for transparency with discretion on matters of national security. But any inference that our statements to the parliament to this issue were inaccurate or misleading as to the seriousness of the situation is false. I stand by the statements made by the president of the Senate and myself. I would just finally say the podcast also refers to a cyber intrusion at the Australian National University. ... So perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be inferred that the comments necessarily relate to the parliamentary network. The important point is the president and I have no further information or knowledge as to what Mr Pyne meant.\u201d Asked about the AFP decision not to investigate Angus Taylor, Anthony Albanese says: Well, Scott Morrison could ask Angus Taylor tomorrow what happened. How did this occur? That\u2019s what he should do. You shouldn\u2019t need outside organisations. A PM who actually cared about integrity would have dealt with this. The PM quite clearly doesn\u2019t care about integrity. And I make this point as well \u2013 and I\u2019ll conclude with this \u2013 Australia needs a national integrity commission. We need one with real power to make independent investigations. The fact is that faith in our politics is at an all-time low. It\u2019s at an all-time low because of the sports rorts saga that we can see. ... Angus Taylor of course has been involved in a Watergate scandal, he\u2019s been involved in the issue around Jam Land and his declarations to the parliament. He\u2019s been involved in this document where we still don\u2019t know where it came from. We know it was given from his office to the Daily Telegraph. Where did it come from? They can\u2019t just say we don\u2019t know because quite clearly someone does know. We know it didn\u2019t come from the City of Sydney because the police in their investigation went to the City of Sydney and went through their data. Now why the data of minister Taylor\u2019s office wasn\u2019t gone through is a question for others to answer. Anthony Albanese: ... If you look at Stuart Robert\u2019s answer today to my question in parliament, it is clear he knows they will have to pay money back. It was clearly implied. And I will make two points in addition to the point that Bill has been making, and I praise Bill for what he has done in pursuing this issue. The fact is, every single person who came to my electoral office seeking assistance either got their debt reduced to zero or got it reduced substantially. Without exception. The truth is the most vulnerable people in our society don\u2019t go to their local MP\u2019s office. People from non-English-speaking backgrounds, in some cultures if you get a demand letter from the government, you rush and you pay that money even if you don\u2019t have it \u2013 you borrow it from a relative. That is what has gone on here. Bill Shorten: [Scott Morrison] was the treasurer when they invented robodebt. No doubt his fingerprints will be all over it. The point about it is they want to pretend they are making a surplus. They will string out vulnerable people. This is a government who basically had no authority to send vulnerable people on safety net payments, they just assume that people would pay up. ... This is a mass act of unjust enrichment by the government. It is theft of people\u2019s money \u2013 the government has abused its power. ... How may times of this government after getting caught breaking the rules before it simply says they got it wrong. Bill Shorten: The federal government has been illegally and unjustly enriching itself with the government adding money back. They don\u2019t have the power to do it. The fact they are still running a legal action when their own public servants have already privately said it is not legal. This is a waste of money. The interest bill is ticking over because if you owe someone money that you have taken, you owe them the interest on that lost income. They are paying lawyers to fight it, they shouldn\u2019t have taken the taxpayers\u2019 money and they are spending more taxpayer money ... ... the commonwealth has been pretending that it is allowed to take money by issuing these notices. It is not! If I sent you an email demanding money, and you pay me, that is illegal. Anthony Albanese throws to Bill Shorten: Due to the persistent efforts of Labor, a document was put up on the Senate website, which goes to the heart of the robodebt scandal: 700,000 Australians received robodebt notices over the last four years. The government has taken $1.5bn off Australians back to the coffers for themselves. Labor has campaigned against the robodebt, it\u2019s been unfair. Mothers report their children have taken their lives, adult children, because of the pressure of these robodebt notices. But today a document has been released which the government did not want people to see, they resisted that. What it reveals is that the chief legal officer of the tax commission has told the tax commissioner that he\u2019s been told by the government, the department of social security, that there is no valid legal basis for the commonwealth to issue these debt notices. Or to put it in plain English, the government has been illegally, unjustly enriching itself, ripping off hundreds of thousands of the most vulnerable Australians. Today in response to Anthony\u2019s question, minister Stuart Robert said, we have justified it. No minister, you have been illegally taking money from Australians for four years. Now the government needs to answer the following questions. When did they find out the scheme was illegal? Why didn\u2019t they find out the scheme was illegal? Furthermore, how many people will be repaid? How much money will be repaid? Why are they wasting taxpayer money fighting legal class actions, when their own ... documents reveal the government has been running a legal ponzi scheme, ripping off hundreds of thousands of its own people with no legal authority. Anthony Albanese and Bill Shorten are holding their second press conference together since the election, on robodebt \u2013 asking when the government knew it was illegal. Albanese: Today in question time we started by asking about the correspondence that came from the Australian Taxation Office that we know, as a result of Senate questions on notice that were delivered today, that months ago the government was advised that the robodebt scheme was in fact illegal. Even after being presented with that, what the government did today was consistent with what it does on everything. They couldn\u2019t confess, they said it was just an adjustment. They couldn\u2019t say they got it wrong. The fact is, given the ATO advice, the government will have a very significant liability indeed. Because people were put under enormous pressure getting bills we now know were not only unfair and just wrong but also illegal at the time. Christian Porter: ... Now it has been previously noted that meritless political referrals to key law enforcement agencies waste resources that could be allocated to the investigation of serious matters such as homicides, terrorism offences, drug offences, offences against children, and the NSW police commissioner said they are a great diverter of my time. It has also been previously noted that the shadow attorney general has either made or oversighted from Labor eight meritless political referrals, with zero charges laid, referred, pursued. Zero. And so now, the information before House is that the strike rate is now zero from 10. Not zero from nine, because the shadow attorney general first referred it ... to NSW police under NSW law, they said nothing, then it went to the AFP, two more strikes. Zero from 10. I noted previously, to try and find some context to put to this, the most Test cricket ducks in Test cricket history was from a poor person, Ajit Agarkar, who had five in a row (shared by Australia\u2019s Bob Holland). I can now inform the House that the record in all first-class cricket innings without scoring a run was set in 1930 by an English cricketer, Seymour Clark, nine innings, zero runs, he has now been beat. Zero from 10. If the shadow AG was a cricket player, he would be the worst first-class batsman in cricket history. In fact, I have been into deep ministerial discussions with the minister of health, to see if we can provide the shadow AG with a referral pad, so he can just save time with his referrals, just by writing the name, and the offence, and sending it off to the police. Perhaps now you might ask yourself, do you regret, do you apologise? Brendan O\u2019Connor is making a personal explanation on being \u201cmisrepresented\u201d after his photo was used in multiple News Corp outlets in place of Michael McCormack. Which it was. Because after two years, apparently even newsrooms can\u2019t identify who the deputy prime minister is. It\u2019s hard being sourdough. The attorney general calls on Labor to apologise to Angus Taylor. Cue the prime minister: \u201cAnd on that note, I ask for all other questions to be tabled.\u201d Christian Porter says Labor now has a strike rate of \u201czero from 10\u201d in \u201cmeritless\u201d referrals to police We get one more dixer \u2013 on Angus Taylor not being investigated by the AFP. The motion to suspend standing orders fails, and the MPs return to their normal seats. \u201cArrogance and cowardice is what characterises this man,\u201d says Richard Marles, pointing to an indifferent prime minister, before he too is shut down. Tony Burke gets in \u201cwe saw the prime minister\u2019s true character on display \u2013 stubborn, all about marketing\u201d before he is shut down by Christian Porter. The bells ring again. Joel Fitzgibbon has welcomed David Littleproud\u2019s return to the agriculture portfolio: I congratulate both David Littleproud and Keith Pitt on their ministerial appointments. It was a mistake to remove David Littleproud from the agriculture portfolio and Labor welcomes his re-appointment. David Littleproud was denied the portfolio following the 2019 election because he diverged too far from the National party playbook and its failed populism and pork-barrelling guidance. His challenge this time will be to take the prime minister and his colleagues with him on a reform journey to turn around the flat-lining productivity and poor profitability in the food and fibre sector. The Morrison government has no national plan for the agriculture sector and no coherent national plan for the ongoing drought. Despite some welcome rain, the drought is very much still with us. David Littleproud\u2019s first act should be to stop cutting farming families off Farm Household Allowance. Labor will work with David Littleproud on any reform agenda in pursuit of sustainable profitability in the agriculture sector. The government can\u2019t keep claiming the National Farmers Federation\u2019s plan as its own. In the face of challenges from drought, bushfires, biosecurity threats, trade wars and the coronavirus, the sector deserves better. There are some rumblings from government backbenchers to just let Labor have one of these debates and get it over and done with, because Labor has been responding to the shut down of the motions by calling a quorum every chance it gets. Because of that, government MPs are having their speeches interrupted \u2013 they also can\u2019t do their work, because they keep getting called back into the chamber. These aren\u2019t things that impact Scott Morrison, because he doesn\u2019t make those speeches, and he doesn\u2019t have to form the quorum. But it is annoying the backbench, who have been doing this for a while now and are a bit sick of it. Still, rules are rules and Labor can call for a quorum if there aren\u2019t enough government MPs in the chamber. And Labor\u2019s tactics are honed through decades of factional wars within its own conferences and branches \u2013 it is better at this sort of political warfare, because it is a natural part of its own brand of politcs. And there is more chance that a Hemsworth will suddenly take notice of me than Morrison allows one of these debates to go forward. Christian Porter moves that Anthony Albanese no longer be heard. The division bells ring for four minutes. You know where this is going. The motion: That the House, one, notes: a) The prime minister is incapable of expressing regret and admitting when he is wrong. b) The prime minister blames others and attempts to cover up his failings with false or misleading claims including but in no way limited to: 1. The prime minister\u2019s claim the response to the national bushfire crisis was a matter for the states and territories. 2. The prime minister\u2019s claim volunteer firefighters didn\u2019t need economic compensation because they wanted to be there. 3. The prime minister\u2019s statement that he didn\u2019t hold a hose when Australians were looking to him for national leadership in an unprecedented bushfire crisis. 4. The prime minister\u2019s claim he had a conversation with a bushfire survivor who had lost everything, when he instead forced her to shake his hand only to turn his back when she asked for help, and c) The prime minister can\u2019t learn from his mistakes if he never admits them, and Two, therefore calls on the prime minister to put the national interest ahead of his political interest, Labor is now moving to suspend standing orders with its latest \u201cthe prime minister is terrible\u201d motion. Scott Morrison, who actually appears under pressure with these questions, but still hasn\u2019t actually expressed regret, continued that answer: Mr Speaker, I do not \u2013 I do not regret establishing the national bushfire recovery agency within days. And putting $2bn into the national bushfire recovery agency. Mr Speaker, I don\u2019t regret pulling together the peak groups of all the organisations from Indigenous organisations to charitable groups to tourism industry bodies to small business bodies, to those looking after wildlife and getting them together and putting the plan in place, that is now in full operation, that is out there supporting local communities. And I don\u2019t regret that I did not take the actions that those opposite now seek to be doing in seeking to politicise a bushfire crisis, as they sought to do all summer. As they sought to do all summer, Mr Speaker, as we sought to communicate how we were helping Australians. As we reached out to Australians, as we coordinated our response, as we got that response out ... boots on the ground. All the leader of the opposition could do was seek political opportunities for himself and his colleagues. Mr Speaker, our government is responding to the crisis of the bushfires. Our government responded to the crisis of the north Queensland floods. Our government is responding and delivering on the response to the devastating drought that is being faced by the Australian people. Our government is responding to the virus that threatens the world today, and we are ensuring that to date our measures have been effective at protecting Australian people not just here in this country but overseas. The leader of the opposition is consumed by his political ambition. He is consumed by his political vanity and he has displayed a lack of character in this House today which only confirms what I expect: the each-way attitude he has to everything will be confirmed more and more in the eyes of the Australian people. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister refuse to express any regret for saying the national bushfire crisis was a matter for the states, forcing a handshake on a bushfire survivor only to turn his back when she asked for help, claiming volunteer firefighters didn\u2019t need compensation because they wanted ... and launching a political ad on a catastrophic fire day? Why can\u2019t the prime minister admit that he ever got anything wrong? Morrison: No member of this House is perfect, Mr Speaker. Not me, not the leader of the opposition. And where there are things that need to be improved, and over the summer where I could have responded to events in different ways, I have already made those comments public because I will always seek to do my best each and every day for the people of Australia. But I tell you what I don\u2019t regret ... I don\u2019t regret when I returned to Australia \u2013 with my family ultimately, who followed me \u2013 I don\u2019t regret the fact that we put in place the single biggest call-out of our reservists to go to the aid of Australians who are fighting this bushfire crisis. Josh Frydneberg continues to use old auditor general reports to attack Labor, in some sort of tactic to explain why the sports grants auditor general\u2019s report into its scheme isn\u2019t so bad. Or something. I am not sure how highlighting all the times the auditor general has said \u201cthis is dodgy\u201d makes what is still happening any less smelly. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret telling communities devastated by the bushfires that the economic impact \u201ccould well prove to be positive\u201d? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I\u2019d be happy for the member to relay to me outside of this place or to send to my office what he\u2019s actually referring to. But what I can say to the House is this: that, Mr Speaker, once we work through the recovery arrangements across all the bushfire-affected areas, once we get past the devastation that has impacted all of these bushfire-affected areas, there will be a recovery. There will be a rebuilding. There will be significant economic activity going into these areas to rebuild these communities, and that will support their economies when that occurs. This is a similar observation, Mr Speaker, that has been relayed to us by the treasury. That once you go through the process of rebuilding and recovery, that is what can support those economies getting back on to their feet. Those are the remarks I have made. Once again I suspect that the Labor party is seeking to be grubby on bushfires. I don\u2019t remember those comments Labor is referring to, and I can\u2019t find them, so can\u2019t help you with that one, sorry. And here is the relevant part of the transcript at the time: Journalist: Do you think volunteer firefighters \u2013 should we be looking at starting to pay them? Prime minister: Well, we have a volunteer firefighting force across the country which numbers in the, you know, the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands. And that also includes those who come in from other jurisdictions. It is a standing volunteer force. And these are matters that are considered from time to time, but this is why I am so appreciative of the commitment made by employers to support that volunteer effort. The volunteer effort is a big part of our natural disaster response and it is a big part of how Australia has always dealt with these issues. We are constantly looking at ways to better facilitate the volunteer effort, but to professionalise that at that scale is not a matter that has previously been accepted and it\u2019s not a matter that is currently under consideration by the government. But as is the case with all fire events, or as is the case with all flood events and other natural disasters, this actual nationally coordinated effort is designed to constantly look at those issues, post these events. And the recommendations come forward from the chiefs, those directly responsible for fighting these fires and coordinating resources. And you\u2019re right, these fires have been going on for some months now and when I was speaking with the commissioner on the weekend out at Wilberforce, where we have the megafire in the north-west at the moment, we were talking through the crew rotations. And the fact is these crews, yes, they\u2019re tired, but they also want to be out there defending their communities. And so we do all we can to rotate their shifts to give them those breaks, but equally, they \u2013 and in many cases \u2013 you\u2019ve got to hold them back to make sure they get that rest. And I thank them all for what they\u2019re doing, particularly all those who support them. Mark Butler and Mark Dreyfus have responded to the news that the Australian federal police will not be investigating Angus Taylor: Serious questions remain unanswered over Angus Taylor and his doctored documents scandal. Two police investigations have now failed to clarify where Angus Taylor got his dodgy figures from. Angus Taylor assured parliament that this fabricated report was \u2018directly downloaded\u2019 from the City of Sydney council website. We know this is not true, as a law enforcement official confirmed: \u201cThe document had to have been doctored from Canberra.\u201d The public internet archives, the Trove database maintained by the National Library, confirmed that the correct version of the report was on the internet all through 2019. We know the Department of Energy\u2019s draft letter provided to the minister\u2019s office contained no reference to the City of Sydney\u2019s travel expenditure. If Angus Taylor continues to refuse to come clean, then the prime minister must order a proper, independent and transparent investigation into his minister and commit to making the findings public. But it is done. And a reminder that NSW Liberal minister Andrew Constance \u2013 who fought, alongside his neighbours, to save his house in that electorate, and was out there every single day (and was so involved that for a brief period was put on a list for unaccounted people) \u2013 had a different take to Scott Morrison of that visit: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t even know he was coming and I haven\u2019t had a call from him,\u201d Constance told the Seven network. So to be honest with you, the locals probably gave him the welcome that he probably deserved. I\u2019d say this to the prime minister today: the nation wants you to open up the cheque books, help people rebuild their lives. I know this is tough and I know I\u2019m on his side of politics, but you know, Gladys [Berejiklian, the NSW premier] and [the RFS commissioner] Shane Fitzsimmons came here two days ago and they obviously visited the fire-affected part of my electorate in the north. Glad\u2019s he going to come back, but this is the feeling that people are going through.\u201d Terri Butler to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying he had a conversation with a bushfire survivor who lost her home in Cobargo, when video clearly shows there wasn\u2019t a conversation? He forced her to shake his hand and then turned his back on her as she asked for help. Morrison: I thank the member for her question about my visit to Cobargo with my wife Jenny on that occasion. I\u2019d just been through fire response centre and been elsewhere. Fire had raged through Cobargo days before. I was the first member of parliament to visit Cobargo after those fires. I went there because I knew the community needed to know that the government would be there and, Mr Speaker, that I was prepared to hear from them. And to be there, as I had spoken to many people, including Mark, who was the captain of the Rural Fire Service brigade there, and the many others I met at the Rural Fire Service brigade, and I went up to the showgrounds and there were some people who were very pleased that I was there, and I discussed the impact of the fires on them. And there were others who were very distraught. They were very upset. I was there and they were able to vent their frustration and their anger directly at me. When you\u2019re prime minister, you turn up and you listen and whatever comes at you ... you\u2019re prepared to do. That the lady you referred to raised with me funding levels for the NSW fire service, that\u2019s the issue that they raised with me. The leader of the oppposition will remember back when he was on the mid-coast, I think it was further north, people heckled him at a press conference and yelled out at him. Now, you will not find me criticising him for being in a fire zone and being subject to those sorts of things. I don\u2019t think that helps. For the opposition to be engaging in this sort of low-rank behaviour, it doesn\u2019t help anybody recovering from the fires. All I know is I was in Cobargo ... I was there for the people of Cobargo, and I\u2019ll be there for the people of Cobargo into the future as well, and they know it. And here is when he said he didn\u2019t hold a hose, on December 20: I mean, I took leave in June as well and we did follow exactly the same practice. So I mean, we don\u2019t always say where we\u2019re going. My privacy with my family when we\u2019re having leave, I\u2019m sure people understand, that\u2019s something that I know Australians would respect. But I think on this occasion, John, because there have been such horrendous events that have understandably caused a lot of anxiety, I deeply regret that and so does Jenny, and to all those who were affected by the fires especially, we deeply regret it. And I\u2019ll be getting back there as soon as I can. The girls and Jen will stay on and stay out the rest of the time we had booked here. But I know Australians understand this and they\u2019ll be pleased I\u2019m coming back, I\u2019m sure. They know that, you know, I don\u2019t hold a hose, mate, and I don\u2019t sit in a control room. That\u2019s the brave people who do that are doing that job. But I know that Australians would want me back at this time out of these fatalities, so I\u2019ll happily come back and do that. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying, and I quote, \u201cI don\u2019t hold a hose, mate\u201d when Australians were looking to him for national leadership? Morrison: I was simply making the point that the operational response that was going on at that time was being handled excellently by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. And I stand by those comments, Mr Speaker, that I support the amazing efforts of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, which only a few days ago were in here, and I commend them here again today. Each and every day we\u2019ve been working closely with that service, as we have with the firefighting service, CFA in Queensland and South Australia. I note today, as they did yesterday, those opposite sought to politicise the bushfires over summer and they continue to do it now. Here is the story on that at the time: Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret saying that volunteer firefighters don\u2019t need economic compensation for lost income because they \u201cwant to be out there\u201d? Morrison: And once again the leader of the opposition is misrepresenting what occurred for political purposes. For political purposes, as he always does, Mr Speaker. There is no issue that the leader of the opposition will not seek to exploit for personal, political gain. And this is just another example. Another example of his lack of character. Now, Mr Speaker, what he suggested, Mr Speaker, was not what I outlined when those remarks were made. Mr Speaker, what was raised in the press conference I was at was in relation to \u2013 for the first time when the suggestion was made that there may be some ... that there may be raised by the journalists about whether, Mr Speaker, we would be considering ... It was being raised with me as to whether the commonwealth would be providing compensation for the rural and regional affairs and transport references committee \u2013 Rural Fire Service volunteers. That is not a matter that is normally dealt with by the federal government. It is a matter that is traditionally dealt with by the Rural Fire Services, Mr Speaker. On that occasion, I was reflecting comments made back to me when I had advised with Rural Fire Service\u2019s members, and they had put it to me when they were out there they wanted to be out there protecting their communities. That\u2019s what I was talking about. They know that they would prefer not to have fires. They know that they would prefer to be at home with their families and their communities. What I was saying is that duty called, they wanted to answer that call to duty, because that\u2019s what our volunteers do. Michael McCormack just gave an update on the coronavirus and I have never wished to be on a cruise ship more. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has met with Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, with the pair holding a brief media conference ahead of question time. It is the first overseas visit for the UK foreign secretary since Brexit was finalised six days ago. Raab faced questions about the Australian government\u2019s record on climate change and the UK\u2019s ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 \u2013 a position it will be advocating in the lead up to the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow later this year. Raab said he had a \u201cgood, constructive\u201d conversation with Payne about the UK\u2019s goal and Australia\u2019s position. \u201cWe want to lead in producing a step change in the international response, the global response to this challenge of our times,\u201d he said. When he was asked about Australia\u2019s policy record on climate change, which was \u201cpolitically contentious\u201d in the wake of the summer bushfire crisis, Raab said the UK\u2019s approach was to \u201ctry to make a success\u201d of COP26. \u201cWe are also going to talk to all the countries about their contributions in getting their emissions down.\u201d Payne said that in the lead up to COP26, the Australian government would be looking at what \u201cpractical climate action we can take together\u201d. On the British government\u2019s decision to allow the Chinese tech giant Huawei a substantial role in supplying the country\u2019s 5G network \u2013 at odds with Australia\u2019s decision \u2013 Raab suggested there had been a \u201cmarket failure\u201d that had contributed to the decision. However, he said there was nothing in the agreement that would inhibit intelligence sharing among Five Eyes partners. On 20 December 2019 the AFP received a referral from NSW police regarding allegations of falsifying documents from the office of the lord mayor of Sydney by the office of the minister for energy and emissions reduction. Following inquiries undertaken and information provided by NSW police, the AFP has determined it is unlikely further investigation will result in obtaining sufficient evidence to substantiate a commonwealth offence. The AFP assessment of this matter identified there is no evidence to indicate the minister for energy and emissions reduction was involved in falsifying information. The low level of harm and the apology made by the minister for energy and emissions reduction to the lord mayor of Sydney, along with the significant level of resources required to investigate, were also factored into the decision not to pursue this matter. The AFP now considers this matter finalised. Vincent Connelly, who continues to treat question time dixers like it\u2019s an audition for the unauthorised Perth society of over-actors, asks Josh Frydenberg to turn the auditor general\u2019s report into the sports grants affair into Labor\u2019s fault, and the treasurer joins in on the chewing the scenery theme: As those opposite will be aware, this is not the only report of the auditor general that\u2019s made some interesting observations. I\u2019m reminded that there was an ANAO report number 3, 10-11, into a $550m infrastructure program, which said on page 38, and I quote: \u2018Ministers made an explicit decision to approve an application that was known to be otherwise ineligible under the guidelines.\u2019 And also went on to say: \u2018The equitable situation of all applicants was not evidence in the processes employed.\u2019 So, Mr Speaker, who are the beneficiaries of this process? Well, the auditor general went on to say on page 48, and I quote: \u2018The awarding of funding to projects disproportionately favoured ALP seats.\u2019 In fact, the auditor general found, when it came to funding, ALP electorates had a success rate almost three times the coalition, Mr Speaker. Who was the responsible minister overshowing this $550m grant program? None other than the member for Grayndler, Mr Speaker! Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor. Dude \u2013 that was a decade ago. Scott Morrison jumps up to add to his answer to Mike Kelly: I\u2018m sure the member for Eden-Monaro would like to know that the NSW government opened their program, which is funded by the federal government in relation to small business recovery, on 2 February 2020; 109 expressions of interest have been received before the program opened, 68 applications have been received, with an average amount requested of $30,981 per grant. And for the information of other members, the Victorian program has not yet opened. It\u2019s expected to open this week. These programs are run by the state governments, funded by the federal government; 114 expressions of interest have been received by 5 February. For South Australia, that opened on 30 January 2020, with 14 grants totalling $329,435 paid so far. And they have approved a further five grants. In Queensland there have been nil small business impact, with no grants program in place from at this point. The NSW loans opened on 3 February 2020, just a few days ago. That is also run by the NSW government. Queensland concessional loans opened on 3 February also, and guidelines are now being considered by South Australia and Victoria. I hope that information is helpful. Cool beans. The AFP still hasn\u2019t got back to anyone, but Anne Davies has confirmed the Sky News story with Taylor\u2019s office. No investigation. David Littleproud likes Rebekha Sharkie\u2019s mum\u2019s mulberry jam: \u201cBest I have ever tasted.\u201d Mike Kelly to Scott Morrison: The Long Stock Brewery in my community this time of year would be paying 24 to 30 casual shifts a week. Because of the bushfires they\u2019re currently paying four. Loss of wages for casual and permanent staff is hurting my community. They\u2019re losing jobs, they\u2019re leaving the region, and the government, they tell me, is not providing any help. Why is it that after they were promised bushfire-affected businesses immediate relief that they are still unable to access that help? Morrison says he\u2019ll get Stuart Robert to add to the answer, but then takes up all the time and just answers it himself: Now, when it comes to small businesses, as the member would be aware, there are qualifying criteria for businesses that have been directly impacted by those fires which is the same criteria that applies to small businesses that are affected by the floods up in north Queensland that occurred at this time last year. They apply the same criteria to those affected businesses in the bushfire-affected zones today. That is important because we will provide the same support that was provided to those in devastating disasters as to this disaster as well. ... But if the member is suggesting that the disaster recovery arrangements should change that, the taxpayer should be the insurer of last resort on all matters, then that is not a policy that your government pursued and it is not a policy that this government is pursuing. Those grants ... [are] for small businesses that need those grants, those businesses we have put the support through with the NSW government access to the support they need. These individual cases, I\u2019m sure the minister who is responsible for emergency management would be pleased to pass on through the recovery agency to provide whatever assistance we can. But this government is providing the most significant package of relief we have seen in relation to a disaster of this nature. It\u2019s initial, it\u2019s additional and it will keep rolling every single day and it will be there for years and years and years to come. The next dixer is just on how amazing the economy is. Pretty amazing, says Josh Frydenberg. The most amazing economy you\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s a beautiful economy. Everyone says it. It is so much more amazing than Labor\u2019s economy, don\u2019t cha know. Oh, also the drought and the fires and coronavirus is an issue, but don\u2019t you worry about that. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister aware that the deputy prime minister foreshadowed yet another reshuffle when he told Kieran Gilbert on Sky News yesterday that Senator McKenzie would be coming back? Does the prime minister intend to return Senator McKenzie to his cabinet? Morrison launches into a congratulations spree of the new ministers. You get a congratulations. And you get a congratulations. YOU ALL GET A CONGRATULATIONS. Coalition governments in this country have given Australians stronger economies, safer borders, Mr Speaker, stronger national security and a focus on the needs of rural and regional Australians. Morrison accuses Labor of voting against the drought fund (it voted for it) so Albanese asks him to withdraw. Tony Smith doesn\u2019t require Morrison to withdraw (procedure is you do this stuff after QT) but Morrison withdraws anyway. Just so he can get to this bit: But this each-way leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker, each way, he\u2019s for a drought fund, he\u2019s against a drought fund. He\u2019s for tax cuts, he\u2019s against tax cuts. ... So this each-way leader of the opposition, he\u2019s for things, he\u2019s against things. What is the leader of the opposition... Smith sits him down because the time is up. The end of Stuart Robert\u2019s answer is here: These changes are designed to make the program more robust by requiring additional evidence ... when using income information to identify potential overpayments. As stated in November this year, this means we\u2019ll no longer raise a debt where the only information we\u2019re relying on is the averaging of ATO. For those debts raised to date, the statement was made that Services Australia will be carefully and methodically working to identify those customers whose debts may have been calculated using a portioned ATO PAYG income data. It\u2019s complex to do that, it\u2019s a highly manual process. It\u2019s not appropriate to pre-empt the outcome of this process and we\u2019ll advise the House in the future when that process comes to its conclusion.\u201d So, not sorry for it being illegal, just making robodebt \u201cmore robust\u201d. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret administering an illegal robodebt scheme, a fact that was revealed in answer to a question on notice in the Senate today by the Australian Taxation Office. Stuart Robert takes it: As the House would know, on the morning of 19 November last year the government announced a further refinement of the income compliance program. This is part of my ... to strengthen and improve the scheme. The program has already undergone a number of iterations and refinements since its inception under Labor in 2011. In response to community feedback, these changes will make the program more robust by requiring additional evidence when the... Albanese interrupts with \u201cyou\u2019re breaking the law\u201d, which Tony Smith takes as a point of order on relevance. Robert continues reading his prepared answer (the release of the documents meant they knew this was coming) but does not address the question of regret. Luke Henrique-Gomes has a story on when the government received legal advice about robodebt: The government received legal advice that debts issued under the botched robodebt scheme were unlawful, confidential documents provided to a Senate committee have revealed. Emails between top tax office officials published on Thursday show that the agency was told by the Department of Social Services that debts based solely on the controversial \u2018income averaging\u2019 method were \u2018not lawful debts\u2019. The same year we were told the weekend was under attack because of electric cars, electric vehicle sales increased. I\u2019ve just been alerted that Katie Allen and Tim Wilson have just made speeches on the fires in the federation chamber (the Michael McCormack of parliamentary chambers because no one pays attention to it). Both have pushed for more action on climate. That\u2019s of note because, as Sarah Martin reported this morning, Allen has called for a minister for climate change \u2013 and there have been suggestions Wilson should be it. Earlier this week (I think it was Tuesday), Sky News political editor Andrew Clennell reported on air that he had heard there may be some \u201cgood news\u201d for Angus Taylor later this week. Sky News is reporting the Australian federal police has determined not to pick up the Angus Taylor investigation. We checked in with the AFP this morning and have not heard back \u2013 a call to the media unit made in the last few minutes also hasn\u2019t confirmed it, as yet. Adani has another statement: Adani will not have a conviction recorded after self-reporting to the Queensland government that we made an administrative error in our 2017/18 annual return for the Carmichael mine. We today pleaded guilty in the Brisbane magistrates court for providing the administering authority an erroneous document and will pay a $20,000 fine. This is in relation to an administrative error. There was no environmental harm, all relevant works were legal, and fully complied with our project conditions. We took responsibility for the administrative error at the time and introduced improvements to internal processes when it was discovered in 2018 and reported by us, to ensure paperwork errors of this nature are avoided in the future. We are pleased this matter is now resolved. Bob Katter, who stepped down as party leader to concentrate on being a gladiator against his enemies or some such thing (presumably crocodiles), has had a very Bob Katter response to David Littleproud\u2019s return to agriculture. From his statement: Our farmers are in deep trouble with drought, so what\u2019s his solution? Get rid of the farmers. Now the only people out there buying the farms are the Chinese and others with foreign interests. I\u2019m looking forward to him being Ag Minister like the Pope watching Attila the Hun coming for the Peninsula. He\u2019s a free marketeer. His party\u2019s free market policies have been the death knell of the dairy industry, the national cattle herd is down 20%, sheep are down 60% and we are a net importer of fruit and vegetables, pork and seafood. I will continue to fight for a rural reconstruction bank, dams in north Queensland and across Australia, as well as vital freight links for our rural areas. The Greens have held a press conference pressuring the government over the failure to release its anti-corruption commission bill. Greens Senate leader Larissa Waters and senators Sarah Hanson-Young and Janet Rice were also asked if they\u2019ll be keeping their portfolios after Adam Bandt became leader. Waters replied: We\u2019ve just had some new leadership arrangements and we\u2019ll be having, naturally, those discussions about what important issues we\u2019ll continue to work on. That\u2019s a matter for the leader, and always has been in our party. Hanson-Young replied: I love the environment portfolio, I love fighting for Australia\u2019s environment, and I have every intention I\u2019m going to keep doing it. That was stated with a degree of confidence. Hanson-Young didn\u2019t directly answer the question about whether she had confirmed this with Bandt but, if not, she has rowed the boat out very far. Waters also commented on the mysterious $165,000 donation the Liberal party declared from a company run by Scott Briggs \u2013 a key Scott Morrison ally \u2013 and then revoked, claiming the declaration was a mistake. Waters: It just goes to show how much we need donations reform and a federal corruption watchdog. First, there was a donation made by a mate that was wanting a favour, to get a contract. Then a couple of days later, \u2018Oh no, there was no donation.\u2019 What\u2019s the story here? And why are people able to make donations when they are applying for government approval or government contracts? Clean up the system! The Brisbane magistrates court fined Adani $20,000 after it pleaded guilty for wrongly declaring land clearing to the Queensland environment department. The court did not record a conviction. The UK\u2019s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, is in Australia to talk trade for the newly single nation, after its split from the EU. This is pretty important for Australia, which is also negotiating an EU free trade agreement. That one is a little more tricky, because as the French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told the AFR in November last year, France expects Australia to do more on climate before it agrees to any trade deal: The other priority challenge is indeed for the future agreement to be highly ambitious in terms of sustainable development. Our two countries are nearly 15,000 kilometres apart and we must show that a trade agreement between the EU and Australia plays a positive role in the face of climate change: that\u2019s a very important point for our parliament and our civil society,\u201d he said at the time. The UK is also strong on the need for more climate action. Here was Boris Johnson at the Glasgow climate conference yesterday: We\u2019ve put so much CO2 in the atmosphere collectively that the entire planet is swaddled in a tea cosy of the stuff. It\u2019s now predicted, unless we take urgent action, to get 3C hotter, and in the hurricanes and the bushfires and melting of the ice caps and the acidification of the oceans, the evidence is now overwhelming. We know as a country, as a society, as a planet, as a species, we must now act. Scott Morrison insists Australia is doing just fine. The UK may not be pushing quite as hard for Australia to do more on climate, as some in the EU, but in an interview with Sabra Lane on the ABC earlier this week, Vicky Treadall, the British high commissioner, said it was part of the talks: Well, Britain has made it very clear that they want everyone to have a greater level of ambition. We are taking a global leadership role on climate change. We are hosting COP26 (2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference) and at COP26 we will be asking all nations to look again at where they stand. Obviously we are working closely with the Australian government to see what the art of the possible is. Now I won\u2019t go into details. These are ongoing conversations that we will have in the coming months but where we know we can work very closely with Australia is in the whole area of renewables, the new technology, the new jobs that will come. The transition of our own economy, the lessons we have learnt and how we can share that with others. AAP has an update on the latest trade figures: Australia\u2019s trade surplus shrank to $5.223 billion in December, a drop of $295 million on the surplus in November 2019. In seasonally adjusted terms, exports rose 1.0% to $41.29 billion for the month and imports were up 2% to $36.07 billion, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday. Westpac economist Andrew Hanlan said the result broadly met market expectations for a surplus of $5.5 billion. He said a narrowing trade surplus was to be expected with commodity prices moderating in the quarter, notably iron ore, which had spiked in the June quarter due to the supply shock from Brazil. \u201cThe key surprise for the month of December was around exports. Metal ores, gold and fuels all moved in the right direction ... However, we were looking for stronger gains \u2013 based on partial information and mindful of a potential pre Lunar New Year bounce,\u201d he said. The Senate is dealing with the government\u2019s latest round of banking royal commission bills. Labor is in support, so there\u2019s no problem there. But the banking royal commission was handed down a year ago. So there is a lot of chat about how long this is all taking. Labor has supported a motion by Liberals Eric Abetz and Concetta Fierravanti-Wells asking schools to consider having children recite the same pledge that naturalised Australian citizens must make. The motion states that the Senate: notes the Australian citizenship pledge, which in part reads as follows: I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey; and (b) calls on all schools to consider having the citizenship pledge recited by students on appropriate occasions. This is a slight troll of Labor education spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek \u2013 who supports the idea, has done since 2011, and reiterated the value of the pledge as recently as Australia Day. It got up 51 to 9, with only the Greens voting against. Among the Labor members who voted on it: Tony Sheldon, Louise Pratt, Jenny McAllister, Tim Ayres, Murray Watt, Kimberley Kitching, Deb O\u2019Neill, Helen Polley, Don Farrell and Kim Carr. Eric Abetz and Connie Fierravanti-Wells look like they are trolling Labor in the Senate, calling a Senate motion over Tanya Plibersek\u2019s repeated call for a citizenship pledge. Labor is voting with the government on the (non-binding) motion that there should be one. Mark Butler has some thoughts about Keith Pitt\u2019s elevation to the cabinet: The new minister for resources and water, Keith Pitt, is the government\u2019s biggest advocate for nuclear power and a dedicated opponent to global action on climate change through the Paris agreement. Minister Pitt\u2019s history as a nuclear power advocate is well documented, most recently through pushing the energy minister into commissioning an inquiry into nuclear power. Having appointed such a strong nuclear advocate to the resources portfolio, Scott Morrison must now come clean about his government\u2019s nuclear power plan and let Australians know which regions are in his nuclear firing line. Over 100 Australian communities have previously been identified as possible locations for nuclear reactors and nuclear dumps, including; Jervis Bay, Townsville, Gladstone, Perth, Western Port in Victoria and the New South Wales north coast. Keith Pitt\u2019s appointment to the crucial resources portfolio is also another signal that Scott Morrison is walking even further away from action on climate change. Keith Pitt\u2019s opposition to the Paris climate agreement is so deep that in 2018 he resigned from the assistant ministry in protest against Australia\u2019s participation in global action on climate change. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation has welcomed David Littleproud\u2019s return to the agriculture portfolio: National Farmers\u2019 Federation President Fiona Simson has congratulated David Littleproud on his appointment as Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management. \u2018Having held the agriculture portfolio before and most recently the responsibilities of water, drought, rural finance, natural disaster and emergency management, Minister Littleproud knows the farm sector\u2019s issues better than most,\u2019 Ms Simson said. \u2018Importantly, Minister Littleproud\u2019s appointment will provide our industry continuity during a period of unprecedented challenges.\u2019 The NFF also welcomed Keith Pitt to the all-important water portfolio. Sometimes the world looks perfect Nothing to rearrange. Sometimes you get a feeling Like you need some kind of change. No matter what the odds are this time, Nothing\u2019s going to stand in my way. This flame in my heart, And a long lost friend Gives every dark street a light at the end. Standing tall, on the wings of my dream. Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream. The department of community affairs has released a series of question on notice answers, after questions were raised over the legality of robodebt. Greens senator Rachel Siewert said the government needs to answer how long it knew there were issues over robodebt \u2013 ahead of the court case. This is a fundamental question and with the government making a claim of Public Interest Immunity over the release of legal advice it is clear that they don\u2019t want Australia to know. People in our community have been traumatised and harassed for years and years, many have large debts they don\u2019t owe and are being forced to pay with interest and they want and deserve answers. There is so much uncertainty around the review process and which debts have been paused and when. The government has a responsibility to be open and upfront about this process. It should not be up to the slow court process for us to uncover what on earth has been going on and it\u2019s clear that the government must come clean. It\u2019s a failure of both economic management and basic duty to not have provided a costing for the robodebt clean-up process in MYEFO. Marise Payne will hold a press conference with her UK counterpart, Dominic Raab, at 1.30. George Christensen spoke about Julian Assange\u2019s case in the parliament yesterday. Andrew Wilkie and Christensen will travel to visit Assange on February 16 in UK (they are paying for the trip themselves). In less than two weeks time the member for Clark and I will travel at our own expense to meet with Australian citizen and journalist-publisher Julian Assange, who is being detained in Belmarsh prison in London. The social visit with Mr Assange will take place on Sunday 16 February. We want to see firsthand how Mr Assange is fairing, because of a number of concerning reports about his health and the severity of his treatment within the UK prison system. We appreciate the cooperation of the British authorities at Belmarsh in confirming our social visit. My concern is that a foreign country, the US, is seeking to extradite an Australian citizen from another foreign country for breaching laws of a foreign country that they were not subject to as they were not in that country, the US, to breach those laws. What is the alleged breach? It is the receipt of information that was in the public interest that he then published. That should not be a crime. It is my view and the view of the Parliamentary Friends of the Bring Julian Assange Home Group that extradition proceedings should cease and Mr Assange should be brought back to Australia. Mr Assange has been pursued for 10 years, and he spent more than six years holed up in an Ecuadorian embassy ahead of his arrest and imprisonment at Belmarsh. Mr Assange must now be allowed to return home. This is also ticking away on the backbench. Andrew Wilkie and George Christensen are leading a bipartisan (backbench) push to have Julian Assange returned to Australia. They will be visiting him next week, ahead of his extradition hearing in the UK. Swimmingly well The Greens will now move a motion in the Senate calling for Adani\u2019s approval to be cancelled, using the guilty plea in the Brisbane magistrates court as a trigger. It will also wedge Labor on the issue. From Larissa Waters\u2019 statement: The federal government must now cancel Adani\u2019s approval and I\u2019ll be lodging a motion in the Senate today calling for just that. A criminal conviction is a legal trigger for the federal government to review and revoke Adani\u2019s approval. If the government keeps ignoring Adani\u2019s breaches, it\u2019s just one rule for coal donors and another for ordinary Australians. Adani will be criminally convicted today, yet it is still in line for public subsidies. But if you miss one Centrelink appointment and you\u2019re screwed. It shows where the government\u2019s priorities lie - with the coal donors, not the community. People will also be watching on Monday how Labor votes on my motion - they will have to finally pick a side on Adani and show whether they stand with the big polluters or a safe climate. The Sydney Morning Herald has reported on some comments by Malcolm Turnbull to the Coalition for Conservation, that Liberal MPs who are sceptical about climate change are \u201creinforced and amplified ... by the rightwing media\u201d, including News Corp, and \u201cbasically operates like terrorists\u201d. \u201cBasically they say, unless you give us what we want we will blow the joint up,\u201d he reportedly said. Turnbull blamed entrenched internal opposition to his climate policy for his downfall in August 2018, and he\u2019s used the \u201cterrorist\u201d line before \u2013 in comments to Guardian Australia and the BBC among others. Still, if it\u2019s any sign of the content of his upcoming autobiography, he\u2019s not holding back. Turnbull also said: If ever Australians were under any illusion that the consequences of a hotter and drier climate were real, harsh and dangerous, those illusions have been shattered this summer. These bushfires are utterly without precedent in our history ... This has branded us in a way that we would never ever imagine could happen. We are seen as very behind ... as a leader in a negative sense. That should really embarrass so many Australians. Adani has pleaded guilty to providing misleading information to Queensland environmental authorities in the Brisbane magistrates court this morning. It failed to report land clearing in its 2017/18 return. Adani has responded by calling it \u201can administrative error\u201d. After self-reporting to the Queensland Government that we made an administrative error in our 2017/18 Annual Return for the Carmichael mine, Adani will today plead guilty in the Brisbane Magistrate\u2019s Court for providing the administering authority an erroneous document. Importantly, there was no environmental harm, all relevant works were legal, and fully complied with our project conditions. We have taken responsibility for the administrative error and improvements to internal processes were introduced at the time the administrative error was discovered in 2018 and reported by us to ensure paperwork errors of this nature are avoided in the future. We look forward to this matter being resolved. The court is yet to deliver a sentence on the matter. The maximum penalty is $3m. The press conference finishes on the bushfire royal commission. Scott Morrison: I\u2019ve also said that that royal commission needs to look at the preparedness and resilience in relation to these bushfire events. And that means an understanding that that needs to be done in a hotter, longer and drier summer. And the impacts of climate change on that are acknowledged and understood. And so that means that we need to have a discussion not just about emissions reduction, which happens in the broad, but if you\u2019re talking about climate resilience, then hazard reduction is as important, if not more, for the direct safety of people affected by these fires than emissions reduction. The longer-term adaptation measures are also important. I\u2019m not going to allow a confined, narrow debate when it comes to understanding what it means to live in the climate we\u2019re going to live in. It\u2019s not just about emissions reduction. That\u2019s important. But it\u2019s also about resilience and it\u2019s also about adaptation. Asked about the push within the Coalition to build new coal fired power stations/invest in coal, Scott Morrison sticks to the same old lines about \u201cbalance\u201d. He is then asked by Sarah Martin about whether or not he is talking about retro-fitting some of the existing coal fired power stations, and his response is included below: Our policy is a common sense one. It gets the balance right. It understands the need for the maintenance and sweating of those assets which are providing reliability to the system, and where those types of assets in the future can be developed in the way that would be required under the environmental standards, then that\u2019s not ruled out either. And so it\u2019s common sense. It\u2019s a common-sense, well-balanced policy and I think that embraces everybody, not just in the Liberal party room, but right across the Coalition. Martin: Are you talking about retro-fitting existing coal-fired power stations to reduce emissions? Morrison: Well, we work with all the energy companies, because we know that we don\u2019t want to force people\u2019s power prices up. And we don\u2019t want to see a loss of capacity out of the system that is unnecessary. And so we take all of these decisions in the national interest. Martin: So government funds could be used to do that? Morrison: Look, that\u2019s your speculation. That\u2019s not what I\u2019ve said. Martin: But I\u2019m asking you ... Morrison: That\u2019s not what I\u2019ve said. Asked about the hit to the economy by the coronavirus, Scott Morrison says: So, yes, there will be an economic hit because of the coronavirus, just as there will be as a result of the bushfires. But there will also be a recovery and there will be a recovery to the bushfires with the extensive works that will be undertaken with rebuilding and equally you can expect down the track. [When?] Hard to know, because there are so many unknowns about the duration of this virus. You would have heard from [chief health office] Dr Murphy that they\u2019ve been preparing a lot of work for the government on what the various scenarios are at a global level and how that might impact domestically. So a lot of work [is] to be done but we\u2019re being very transparent about that with states and territories and we intend to be, also, with the Australian people. But we expect a hit, particularly in this quarter, on the coronavirus, and how much more it extends beyond that really does depend on how this virus continues to play out at a global level. David Littleproud\u2019s return to the agriculture portfolio was so readily expected that lobby groups already have their congratulation emails ready to go: CropLife Australia\u2019s chief executive officer, Matthew Cossey, said, \u201cCropLife Australia and our members congratulate Minister Littleproud on his appointment to the important role of minister for Agriculture. Minister Littleproud has shown he is a passionate advocate for agriculture and regional Australia more broadly. There is still work to do to further improve the performance of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to ensure Australian farmers have timely access to the crucial innovations of the plant science industry. Michael McCormack explains the need for a two-thirds majority in any future Nationals leadership spill (which, in a divided room of 21 people, would all but certainly shore up his leadership) with all the charisma of a bowl of overcooked pasta. It\u2019s a matter for the party and the party\u2019s management as to whether this goes forward. Both of the other major parties have a similar sort of rule in place. The fact is we want to make sure that for the member who brought this up and raised it, wants to end the speculation about the leadership. And I think that\u2019s probably an important thing. This is the same man who yesterday told the Seven network after being asked how many votes he held on by: Just how close I am not sure. It is National party convention not to reveal the votes and at the end of the day, the votes do not count. What counts, for me, is regional Australians. Keith Pitt has been a massive, massive, massive advocate for nuclear power. Scott Morrison is asked about whether that will be a problem. He says the government is looking at all energy options, but the nuclear policy remains (that would be a no to nuclear). \u201cOnwards and upwards from here,\u201d says Michael McCormack. The new ministry will be sworn in at 5.30pm. That\u2019s after question time, meaning the new ministers will get some time to scrub up on their portfolios before Monday when, no doubt, Labor will attempt to trip a few of them up. Scott Morrison: On Mark Coulton: Mark Coulton will continue to serve as minister for regional health, regional communications and local government. Andrew Gee: Andrew Gee will come into the ministry as minister for regional education, decentralisation and minister assisting the minister for trade and investment. Michelle Landry: Michelle Landry will continue to serve as an assistant minister for children and families, and will also serve as assistant minister for northern Australia. And you won\u2019t find a stronger champion than Michelle Landry. ... other than Keith Pitt [the guy who actually holds the portfolio] for northern Australia, when it comes to ensuring that the needs of northern Australia are addressed. Kevin Hogan: And Kevin Hogan will come into the assistant ministry, where he will be the assistant minister to the deputy prime minister. Scott Morrison: On Michael McCormack: Obviously the leader of the Nationals will continue on in his current portfolios and that will also include a very big focus on the water grid and ensuring that Australia has the water infrastructure it needs for a resilient future. On David Littleproud: David Littleproud will continue to serve in cabinet. He will take on the portfolios of minister for agriculture and that will combine with his other portfolios of drought and emergency management. The issue of natural disasters is one that encompasses all portfolios of government and obviously, as minister for emergency management, that will have particular responsibilities for him, but when it comes to dealing with natural disasters and our broader resilience to the environment and the climate we are living in \u2013 as I outlined at the Press Club last week \u2013 I believe this goes across every single portfolio of government. On Darren Chester: Darren Chester will be entering cabinet, but he will continue to do the wonderful and outstanding job he\u2019s been doing as minister for veterans\u2019 affairs and minister for defence personnel. I\u2019m advised that this is the first time veterans\u2019 affairs has been back in cabinet since the late Ben Humphreys in 1993 and I think that sends a strong message about our commitment to veterans in this government. On Keith Pitt: Keith Pitt will take on the role and enter cabinet as minister for resources, water and northern Australia, highlighting again the importance of all of those portfolio matters and their presence around the cabinet table. We are getting a short continuity with change message ahead of the cabinet reshuffle announcement. Everything is hunky dory with the Liberals and the Nationals, Scott Morrison says. Never been stronger. The heart of the relationship between the Liberals and the Nationals is our deep passion and conviction for supporting the needs of rural and regional Australians, and our belief in the future of rural and regional Australia. And at its heart, that\u2019s what the Coalition is about. That\u2019s why we have come together so willingly over such a long period of time. Andrew Giles had some things to say about Chris Knaus\u2019s story this morning on the \u201cmistaken\u201d $165,000 donation made to the Liberal party by a Scott Morrison ally, who is also vying for the visa privatisation contract: Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison won\u2019t walk away from visa privatisation. And today this issue has descended into a complete farce. Mr Scott Briggs, the principal behind one of the bids, a close Liberal party associate of the prime minister and Minister Coleman, has declared donations of $300,000 to the Liberal party, $165,000 through an entity known as Southern Strategy. This morning it\u2019s reported that he says this donation was an accident. The Liberal party won\u2019t comment or explain it. This is a complete farce. Mike Bowers was in the chamber for the Angus Taylor motion Scott Morrison will hold a press conference at 10.45 to announce the new cabinet. Keith Pitt gets Matt Canavan\u2019s former portfolio of mining, resources and northern Australia. Lucy Barbour of the ABC reports that David Littleproud won\u2019t hold onto the water portfolio but will get agriculture back \u2013 which was also expected. Darren Chester\u2019s portfolio of veteran affairs will move into the cabinet. The frontbench reshuffle we were supposed to get yesterday, is coming today. As expected, Darren Chester and Keith Pitt get the cabinet promotions. Scott Morrison also told Alan Jones that he had concerns over where the bushfire donation money was being sent: Jones: Forget what you are giving, the government are giving, I\u2019m talking about the public. People listening to you now have given a half a billion dollars. And can I just leave it with you? They\u2019re down there. They\u2019re seeing none of this money. And so something\u2019s got to be mobilised to get the money to the people. If I could leave that thought with you. Morrison: Look, absolutely Alan, I have a similar concern about this. I mean, I can tell you that over $111 million dollars has been paid out. I think it\u2019s very important that charities, and state governments for that matter, are reporting on how much money is going out the door and to where. Jones: Well \u2026 there are very few people who can tell the prime minister to stop talking but I\u2019ve got to go to the news. But we\u2019ll talk again soon about that and other issues. Alan Jones had a chat to Scott Morrison this morning. From the transcript: Jones: I was just thinking last night, when we\u2019re going to talk to you today, you must feel as though you\u2019ve gone 10 rounds with Muhammad Ali. It\u2019s been pile on the prime minister for a couple of months, hasn\u2019t it? Morrison: Well, there\u2019s been a lot of that. But, you know, that\u2019s what this job\u2019s about. You stand up to that and you stand up for what you believe in. You just put your head down and you just keep going. That\u2019s what my dad always taught me. Jones: Ah your dad, well I\u2019m sorry about all that too, you\u2019ve had a \u2026 Morrison: Yeah, thanks for your lovely message. Annastacia Palaszczuk doubled down on her attack on the federal government when speaking to the ABC this morning, calling for disaster payments to be given to Queensland tourism operators over the coronavirus impact: But we also know that this coronavirus is going to have an impact. It\u2019s going to have an impact on the Queensland economy and a very large impact on the Australian economy. So yesterday I convened large members of the stakeholder groups across Queensland, from the Gold Coast, from far north Queensland, from a whole different range of sectors, from resources to tourism, to seafood, to international education. And what they told me very clearly is that they need assistance and support, and they need it now. And they want the state and the commonwealth to work together. So, that\u2019s why I wrote to the prime minister, in the spirit of cooperation, to say, \u2018Let\u2019s treat this huge impact on our economy just as we would a natural disaster, like a cyclone or a bushfire.\u2019 We need that help and we need to work together, and we need to contribute, I believe, equal share, like we do with natural disasters. Queensland is moving forward, putting together its economic recovery group which is activated after natural disasters. The motion will fail. Tony Smith also warns Labor that the motions are \u201cbecoming far too long\u201d given that Mark Butler\u2019s motion is two pages and took three minutes to read. Butler takes it on board. Leave is not granted. Butler moves forward again, with pretty much the same motion which will also fail \u2013 but Labor takes these as a win, because it puts its allegations on the Hansard record. Here is the motion: That the House: (1) Notes: (a) New South Wales Police detectives formed Strike Force Garrad in November 2019 to investigate the creation of a fraudulent document that was disseminated by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction as part of a political attack on the Lord Mayor of Sydney; (b) New South Wales Police concluded \u201cthe document had to have been doctored from Canberra\u201d; (c) the criminal investigation by New South Wales Police, encompassing the use of the fraudulent document by the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, was referred to the Australian Federal Police in December 2019; (d) the Australian Federal Police has not concluded its assessment of the state referral; (e) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction has not provided a full statement to the House about the role the Minister and his office played in the creation and dissemination of a fraudulent document which gave rise to long-running, and not-yet-concluded, criminal investigations in two jurisdictions; (f) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction has not advised if he and/or his office has assisted the criminal investigations related to his conduct by providing statements, documents and access to data; (g) the Prime Minister has failed to uphold his ministerial standards by failing to sack the Minister for Emissions Reduction for repeated breaches of those standards, including bringing the government and this House into disrepute by creating and/or disseminating a fraudulent document; (h) the Prime Minister has failed to explain why the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction holds a place in his Cabinet when the former Minister for Agriculture, Senator McKenzie, was forced to resign her place; and (2) Requires: (a) the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction to attend the House at any time before 1pm today and, for a time not exceeding 10 minutes, (i) provide a full statement to the House about his role in the creation and dissemination of a fraudulent document that targeted the Lord Mayor of Sydney (ii) advise how he has assisted New South Wales and Federal police in the conduct of their inquiries and (iii) apologise to the House for his conduct; and (b) the Prime Minister to attend the House at any time before 1.30pm today and, for a time not exceeding 10 minutes, explain to the House why the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction is fit to serve as a Minister in his government but Senator McKenzie is not. Labor has started the day\u2019s proceedings with an attempt to suspend standing orders over Angus Taylor. Mark Butler is leading this charge. The parliament bells are ringing. Sigh. Back on the economy for the moment, because this story in the Australian about cabinet ministers getting upset that the RBA governor, Philip Lowe, isn\u2019t doing their job for them is amazing. From the report: The Morrison government is increasingly frustrated with Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe\u2019s calls for it to spend more to lift the nation\u2019s flagging productivity, after a confidential cabinet briefing from the RBA boss on Monday left ministers exasperated by an absence of detailed policy ideas. Dr Lowe in a speech on Wednesday again exhorted the Coalition to do more to foster business spending as he highlighted a \u201ctroubling decline in productivity growth\u201d, despite \u201cfantastic\u201d economic fundamentals. \u201cWhile the reasons for this are complex, it is hard to escape the conclusion that higher levels of investment spending would promote productivity growth and our collective living standards,\u201d he said. The Australian understands Dr Lowe relayed those calls in a rare confidential cabinet briefing on Monday, leaving senior cabinet members frustrated by a lack of detail from the governor on specific measures and projects he wanted the government to pursue. Pro tip \u2013 coming up with government policy is YOUR job, guys. It is literally in the job description. Come up with policies and measures to keep the place ticking over is pretty much the only reason we have a government, because, as we have seen, the bureaucrats and departments are pretty good at keeping the machinery of government ticking over without you. But if only there were reports, and predictions, and information to help you \u2026 oh wait THERE IS. Binders and binders and binders of it. Going back years. It\u2019s your job to take that information and do something with it. While we\u2019re on Peter Dutton, hopefully he will be pressed in question time over his deliberate muddling of information on the ABC yesterday when he was asked about climate change: Obviously, as we\u2019ve all pointed out, we\u2019re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it or more that have been charged with arson. That\u2019s not climate change. Pulled up by Patricia Karvelas that the most common start to the fires was lightning strikes, not arson, Dutton says: Nobody\u2019s disputing that. There\u2019s been lightning strikes for as long as there have been bushfires in this country. I\u2019m happy to accept the involvement of climate change but your point was about the views in our party room. No one is saying that climate change *started* the fires. Just that it is making the seasons worse. And in case it has to be debunked AGAIN, here is what police said in January about the numbers of arson charges. Not sure where the 250 figure came from, but the 183 legal actions police had issued from the start of the fire season, were mostly for things like ignoring the total fire ban, or throwing out lit cigarette butts. And you would hope a former police officer, and the man in charge of our border security, would be across the detail. From the police last month: Victoria police say there is no evidence any of the devastating bushfires in the state were caused by arson, contrary to the spread of global disinformation exaggerating arsonist arrestsduring the current crisis. A misleading figure suggesting 183 arsonists have been arrested \u201csince the start of the bushfire season\u201d spread across the globe on Wednesday, after initial reports in News Corp were picked up by Donald Trump Jr, US far-right websites and popular alt-right personalities. The figure included statistics from some states covering the entirety of 2019, rather than just the current bushfire season, which began in September. Late on Wednesday Peter Dutton accused the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, of using the coronavirus for political point scoring (that\u2019s a common theme from the government, which also accused the federal opposition of using the bushfires for political point scoring). Dutton accused Palaszczuk of taking information from a confidential health briefing and using it for political gain: It\u2019s important to point out that premier Palaszczuk, having heard the recommendation from the expert medical committee, where her chief medical officer in Queensland was part of the discussion, knew that recommendation was coming to the PM and went out there gratuitously, calling for us to stop incoming flights from China, knowing frankly that was probably the decision we were going to make. So we need to move quickly, particularly when there\u2019s been that sort of breach, pretty egregious breach of the committee\u2019s work and premier Palaszczuk still hasn\u2019t apologised for that. Palaszczuk was asked about Dutton\u2019s comments on ABC Breakfast this morning: That\u2019s absolutely rubbish. That is absolutely rubbish. I stand up for what I believe is right. I won\u2019t be silenced by the federal government. And what I say to you and your listeners is this is a public health emergency. And my focus has been on the containment and to make sure the virus is contained and does not spread. These are big issues. And I just believed at the time that the federal government was acting too slow. So, we\u2019ve taken measures. Other states have taken measures. But it\u2019s a national issue, it\u2019s a national health emergency, and my clear message is we all need to work together. The Queensland election is in October, in case anyone was wondering. It seems Bridget McKenzie made another statement to the Senate late last night about some other memberships she had neglected to declare. Here is her statement in full (minus the sound of her phone making cricket noises): As it\u2019s been widely reported I resigned from my ministry on Sunday February the 2nd due to breaches of the prime minister\u2019s statement of ministerial standards. I\u2019ve publicly apologised for this and today I wish to further apologise to the Senate, so it\u2019s lovely we actually had a vote so that we could all be here. I do not believe the gifted membership of the Australian Clay Target Association or my paid membership to Field and Game Australia contributed any real or apparent conflict of interest. However, I acknowledge my mistake in failing to declare these as required in the statement of ministerial standards in a timely way. I\u2019ve also updated my Senate statement of interests, which states that senators much declare being an office holder or where they\u2019ve contributed more than $300 to an organisation. I am a member, a proud member, of Field and Game Australia, Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Australian Deer Association, and the Country Women\u2019s Association. I\u2019m not an office holder of any of these organisations, nor have I provided them with any donations, which is a declarable requirement under the Senate\u2019s statement of interests. I\u2019m no longer a member of the Australian Clay Target Association and therefore Wangaratta Clay Target Club, which commenced on the 29th of January 2019 and ceased on December 30 2019. Having reviewed all my memberships in the recent weeks, I\u2019ve become aware that I was a member of the Victorian Farmers Federation Ag-Force Country Connection, the Melbourne Cricket Club and Yarrawonga-Mulwala, a fabulous golf club, during 2019. All of these memberships have since ceased. None of my memberships have caused real or apparent conflicts of interest to my role, either as minister or as senator for Victoria. However, I\u2019ve chosen to fully disclose all my memberships to the Senate on this day to ensure complete transparency both to the Senate and the broader Australian community. I\u2019ve been a senator for nine years and have the deepest respect for this chamber of parliament, which is so important to our democracy. I regret any confusion caused concerning my declaration of interests, and I apologise to each and every one of my fellow senators, for my transgression with regard to the register of interest. Thank you. In case you missed it, Sarah Martin had this story late yesterday: The new Liberal MP Katie Allen has canvassed the need for the government to appoint a dedicated climate change minister as the Coalition splits on how best to \u201cevolve\u201d its policy response. Allen, who was elected for the seat of Higgins in May, is one of a number of Liberal MPs who have been arguing internally for the government to increase its ambition on climate change against resistance from conservatives in the Coalition. Allen\u2019s suggestion for a climate change portfolio was made in a group chat of MPs in a discussion about how the government\u2019s policies could be better communicated, sources have confirmed. She did not advocate in the group that the government needed to do more, but suggested there was frustration that voters were not hearing the government\u2019s message. She argued that the \u201csignificant investment\u201d being made by the government did not appear to be acknowledged in the community. Allen proposed that her fellow Victorian MP Tim Wilson would be a good advocate to communicate the government\u2019s policies. That comes on top of John Alexander publicly pushing for the government to do more on climate policy. But there are still some very loud voices who are pushing for more coal-fired power stations. And climate action now! apparently means more dams and hazard reduction burns, and no actual climate action, so don\u2019t hold your breath. This is also something which will come up today: I\u2019ve often mistakenly donated $165,000. It\u2019s a real problem and my 2020 new year\u2019s resolution was to stop doing it. Chris Knaus has a story on someone else who apparently had that problem: The Liberal party is refusing to say why it scrubbed records of a $165,000 donation from a company run by Scott Briggs, a key Scott Morrison ally who is currently vying to win the government\u2019s $1bn visa privatisation contract. On Monday, the Liberal party declared it had received $165,000 from a company named Southern Strategy, a largely inactive political consultancy business Briggs started four years ago. Briggs is a close friend and confidant of Morrison, a former New South Wales Liberal party deputy state director, a former colleague of immigration minister David Coleman, and a director of the Cronulla Sharks, where the prime minister is the number one ticket holder. He is also leading a bid to win a highly lucrative but controversial contract to privatise Australia\u2019s visa processing system on behalf of a consortium named Australian Visa Processing Pty Ltd \u2026 When the Guardian queried the $165,000 donation, Briggs said Southern Strategy had never made it and that the Liberal party had made a mistake. The Liberal party also said the disclosure was a mistake. You\u2019ll find the whole story, here. The Australian has an interesting story on a NSW Liberal branch president acting in \u2013well, read it for yourself. A NSW Liberal Party branch president is under investigation and faces sanctions after launching a controversial website that ridicules his own side of politics, accuses senior figures of heresy, and mocks the sexual orientations of former cabinet ministers. The website, launched by Sean Burke, the NSW Liberal Party\u2019s Freshwater branch president, bills itself as \u201cunapologetically biased\u201d in its coverage of centre-left politics and nerve-point issues that have occupied the NSW and federal parliaments. Party officials told The Australian on Wednesday that while some of Mr Burke\u2019s content appeared benign, some content appeared to cross the lines of basic decency, and in other cases seemed deliberately malicious. You can read the whole story, here. Josh Frydenberg has started the day on a somewhat sombre note, admitting that the impact of the coronavirus on the economy will be \u201csignificant\u201d, with the Treasury saying it\u2019s too early to say what the outcome will be. The treasurer told Sky News: It will have a significant impact because China is our No 1 trading partner. While the epidemic of Sars back in 2003 had an impact on our economy and provides us with a bit of a guide, we\u2019re more integrated economically with China today than we were back then. In fact, the Chinese economy is four times bigger today than it was in 2003, so that means that what happens in China has a larger effect on the global economy too. With the drought, the bushfires and shifting trading economies, things aren\u2019t looking quite as rosy as the budget predictions, and Scott Morrison and Frydenberg have already started talking down the promised surplus. Morrison was on the Sydney radio 2GB early this morning also talking about coronavirus: The nature of its virus and how it spreads across the global economy is a bit of an unknown at the moment. At this stage, it hasn\u2019t demonstrated the same sort of severe outcomes that the previous viruses \u2013 Sars and Mers \u2013 did but the rates of transmission are much higher. The Reserve Bank governor, Phil Lowe, warned of much the same thing in his address to the National Press Club in Sydney yesterday. As Ben Butler reported: Sectors including tourism and education are likely to suffer billions of dollars worth of damage if the Morrison government keeps travel bans in place for more than six months, while the price of another key export to China, iron ore, has fallen by more than 10% in a month. The RBA expects the ongoing drought to cut 0.25 percentage points from growth this year. So keep an eye on that. We\u2019ll also have the parliament shenanigans, as well as everything else that happens in the hallways and beyond. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp are your team today, with a half-coffee Amy on the blog. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

I hope you enjoy today\u2019s briefing.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson would need two full terms as prime minister to fulfil his pledge to \u201clevel up\u201d the British economy in the wake of Brexit, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In a warning before next month\u2019s budget, Britain\u2019s oldest economic thinktank says the government\u2019s plan to raise investment in infrastructure projects by about \u00a320bn a year can have only a modest impact on the UK\u2019s dismal productivity levels. Johnson has pledged to invest in new transport projects and other large public works but NIESR says the positive impact on the economy will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/06/economists-warning-boris-johnson-election-pledge-output\">less than 0.5% of GDP over the long run, compared with an estimated 3-4% cost of Brexit</a>.</p> \n<p>In a blow to the chancellor, NIESR says Sajid Javid will fall short of achieving his growth target of 2.8% per year while his new budget rules will probably be trashed by public spending at the levels promised in the election campaign. The Bank of England has already warned that Brexit will strike a blow to British productivity as higher trade barriers harm efficiency gains, while growth can only run at 1.1% on average until 2023 without driving up inflation.

Eighty per cent involved abusive behaviour, such as verbal abuse, graffiti or abuse via social media.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Johnson\u2019s plan will only have modest impact Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray here. I hope you enjoy today\u2019s briefing. Boris Johnson would need two full terms as prime minister to fulfil his pledge to \u201clevel up\u201d the British economy in the wake of Brexit, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In a warning before next month\u2019s budget, Britain\u2019s oldest economic thinktank says the government\u2019s plan to raise investment in infrastructure projects by about \u00a320bn a year can have only a modest impact on the UK\u2019s dismal productivity levels. Johnson has pledged to invest in new transport projects and other large public works but NIESR says the positive impact on the economy will be less than 0.5% of GDP over the long run, compared with an estimated 3-4% cost of Brexit. In a blow to the chancellor, NIESR says Sajid Javid will fall short of achieving his growth target of 2.8% per year while his new budget rules will probably be trashed by public spending at the levels promised in the election campaign. The Bank of England has already warned that Brexit will strike a blow to British productivity as higher trade barriers harm efficiency gains, while growth can only run at 1.1% on average until 2023 without driving up inflation. The number of new homes registered to be built in the UK in 2019 rose to 161,022 \u2013 the highest in 13 years \u2013 but it remains well below the government\u2019s target of 300,000 a year by 2025. * * * Death of screen colossus \u2013 Kirk Douglas, the last great star of Hollywood\u2019s golden age, has died at the age of 103. Michael Douglas announced the news in a statement last night. \u201cTo the world, he was a legend, an actor from the golden age of movies who lived well into his golden years,\u201d the statement said. \u201cBut to me and my brothers Joel and Peter he was simply Dad, to Catherine, a wonderful father-in-law, to his grandchildren and great grandchild their loving grandfather, and to his wife Anne, a wonderful husband.\u201d Born Issur Danielovitch Demsky to impoverished Russian-Jewish immigrants, Douglas went on as an actor to earn a reputation as a tough customer \u2013 both on screen and off \u2013 known for his rugged handsomeness. His production company, Bryna Productions, developed two of his arguably greatest pictures: Paths of Glory and Spartacus, both directed by Stanley Kubrick. Revisit some of his career in clips. * * * Trump survives on party lines \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s entirely expected acquittal was nonetheless a moment of gravity, whatever his claims of exoneration, David Smith writes. Mitt Romney, the onetime presidential candidate, proved the only Republican in the Senate (which they control) to vote for the president\u2019s dismissal, explaining: \u201cCorrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one\u2019s oath of office that I can imagine.\u201d Nancy Pelosi emphasised that while not removed, Trump would remain \u201cimpeached forever\u201d. Smith, our bureau chief in DC, notes that Trump\u2019s latest Gallup poll approval rating stands at 49% \u2013 the highest since he took office and better than Bill Clinton or Barack Obama at this stage in their re-election years: \u201cSomehow he is becoming stronger rather than weaker.\u201d * * * \u2018Scourge on us all\u2019 \u2013 A record number of 1,805 antisemitic incidents were logged in the UK in 2019, the fourth year in a row figures have hit an all-time high, according to monitoring group the Community Security Trust (CST). Eighty per cent involved abusive behaviour, such as verbal abuse, graffiti or abuse via social media. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said that 75 years after the end of the Holocaust the figure was a \u201cscourge on us all\u201d. Almost half of antisemitic violent assaults were in Barnet and Hackney in London, and Salford in the north-west. David Delew, the CST\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cIt is clear that both social media and mainstream politics are places where antisemitism and racism need to be driven out, if things are to improve in the future.\u201d * * * Newborn has coronavirus \u2013 The death toll from coronavirus has risen to at least 563, as Chinese media reported that a baby had been diagnosed with the virus 30 hours after birth, the youngest case recorded so far. The baby\u2019s mother had tested positive before giving birth. More than 28,000 people have been infected globally. Martin Farrer writes that Hong Kong\u2019s economy, already hit by civil unrest, risks being plunged deeper into recession as the coronavirus outbreak wreaks havoc, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights. The territory\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has stepped up preventative measures, with all people entering from the mainland to be required to undergo 14 days of quarantine. In mainland China, police are flying around drones that shout at people not wearing masks to go home and get one \u2013 this and other updates at our live blog. * * * Not so choice \u2013 Sellers on Amazon are gaming the system to get an \u201cAmazon Choice\u201d badge on their products regardless of whether the item is actually any good, research by Which? has found. The label is given out automatically based on reviews, price, shipping and other factors. If unscrupulous sellers are able to generate good reviews for mediocre, unsuitable or dangerous products, they can succeed in getting their items the coveted label, Which? says. It found a car dashcam had at least 24 written reviews mentioning the offer of a free SD card in exchange for a positive review; while a pair of wireless headphones had close to 2,000 reviews that, via a feature called \u201cproduct merging\u201d, were about unrelated products including acne cream and razor blades. Today in Focus podcast: Will HS2 really benefit the north? As the government prepares to give the green light to a new high-speed rail line between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds, Helen Pidd looks at the dire state of transport links in the north of England. Plus: Annabel Dixon argues that Britain should follow the lead of other European countries on assisted dying legislation.

Sport The deal to sell a 15% stake in the Six Nations to the private equity company CVC is being held up over the home unions\u2019 insistence that the tournament should remain live on terrestrial television, the Guardian has learned.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Researchers have identified a time lag of reporting infections of one to two weeks, while estimating a doubling in the number of infections roughly every six days, making the real figure at least 75,000.</p> \n<p>Dr Nathalie MacDermott, a clinical lecturer at King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cThe mortality rate is literally the number of people dying as a proportion of cases of the disease. It is currently likely to be an overestimate, based on milder cases of the disease not being identified. But it is not accurate. What\u2019s missing is the number of people with a milder form.\u201d</p> \n<p>For example, if 400 deaths and 20,000 cases are reported, the mortality rate is 2%, she said. \u201cBut if you divide the deaths by 75,000, you would get a rate of 0.5%.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mild cases have the potential for making containment more difficult, she said.</p> \n<p>Asked if measures taken in China to contain the virus were effective, she said it was too early to tell, particularly because of the time lag, which also might change.<br> \u201cWe are not clearly seeing an impact at the moment. We would need to monitor for a month or so.\u201d</p> \n<p>Exponential spread of the virus in other cities outside China was unlikely, added MacDermott. \u201cWe haven\u2019t so far seen a significant spread in cities outside China. In cases outside China we are still watching. So we could get a shock. But we probably won\u2019t see a Wuhan situation in other countries.

      "bodyText": "Australia \u201cneeds action on several fronts\u201d following a catastrophic bushfire season, including leading international efforts against climate change and cutting emissions beyond the electricity sector, Julie Bishop has said. Bishop, the incoming chancellor of the Australian National University, made the comments to Guardian Australia, offering to put the university\u2019s disaster management experts and more than 300 climate scientists at the federal government\u2019s disposal to provide \u201cevidence-based\u201d responses to the bushfires. The former foreign minister and deputy Liberal leader started the ANU role in January but has postponed an event marking her appointment as the university responds to the outbreak of coronavirus and extreme weather including bushfires in the Australian Capital Territory and damage from a hailstorm. Bishop said that \u201cclearly there have been some missteps\u201d in the federal government\u2019s handling of the bushfires, adding she is \u201ccertain the government will reflect on recent events and learn from any missteps\u201d. \u201cI as chancellor \u2026 have offered to assist the federal government in its bushfire recovery response,\u201d she said. Bishop said the university was preparing to provide expertise in disaster recovery, public health, biodiversity, engineering, and climate science. \u201cANU has climate change expertise, we have expertise in bushfire recovery, 300 climate scientists across seven colleges and 25 schools. \u201cWe have the climate change institute, headed up by Mark Howden who\u2019s on the intergovernmental climate change panel. \u201cAs a national university we have a responsibility to the Australian community to deliver evidence-based solutions \u2026 to the myriad consequences from these catastrophic events.\u201d The government has come under fire for its handling of climate change because the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has argued Australia contributes just 1.3% of global emissions, while lobbying to lower global ambition by including carryover credits in 2030 Paris targets. Liberal senator Jim Molan said on Monday his stance on climate change was not based on evidence, while the new deputy Nationals leader, David Littleproud, has explained he had professed doubt \u2013 but now accepts \u2013 climate science because he is not \u201cgifted academically\u201d and lacks a scientific background. Bishop praised Britain for being \u201cambitious and a leading voice in calling for greater standards to deal with climate change\u201d after Boris Johnson urged major economies to go carbon neutral by 2050. \u201cI\u2019ve always been of the view that Australia, as a leading industrialised and developed nation, with one of the best standards of living in the world, needs to be a leader in the international response to climate change,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a responsibility. The extreme weather events, the horrific fires, that take such a terrible toll on our communities and wildlife place us at the frontline of the impact \u2013 and so Australia has a direct interest in leading international debate on this topic. \u201cI certainly look forward to our government taking on that role.\u201d Asked how Morrison should balance Nationals and Liberal conservatives wanting more coal-fired power with moderate Liberals\u2019 calls to do more to fight global heating, Bishop responded that Morrison \u201cdoesn\u2019t need my advice\u201d. \u201cWe need action on several fronts: disaster response, including the resourcing of emergency fire services; climate change mitigation [and] adaptation; and reducing our own emissions is obviously vital \u2013 but we have to focus on all areas, not just the electricity sector,\u201d she said. Despite Morrison claiming the government has set out how it will reduce emissions by 26% to 28% by 2030, critics have noted it is yet to set vehicle emissions standards or a plan to reduce emissions in the transport and agriculture sectors. Bishop backed the Morrison government on its handling of the coronavirus, despite criticism from Universities Australia that Australian Border Force had overreacted by reportedly detaining Chinese students returning to Australia after the travel ban. Bishop said she assumed all measures were taken after \u201cconsultation with national and international health bodies\u201d. ANU, like many other universities, has offered flexible arrangements to help its students affected by virus-related travel bans including online delivery of courses, intensive courses and deferral without penalty. Bishop said she was \u201cnot aware of any evidence\u201d that Australia\u2019s relationship with China had slowed evacuations from Wuhan or had suffered as a result of travel bans. Bishop listed among other priorities for the ANU to equip students and graduates for the fourth industrial revolution and disruption of traditional work, and to gain greater international recognition for the university. Since retiring from politics at the 2019 election Bishop has also taken a role on the board of foreign aid contractor Palladium which she insists is not a breach of ministerial standards, which ban ministers lobbying on \u201cany matters on which they have had official dealings\u201d in the previous 18 months.",

      "body": "<p>With cases of coronavirus reported on four continents, health experts are concerned it could become a pandemic. The world is currently in the grip of two others \u2013 Aids and tuberculosis \u2013 while measles is on the rise again and polio stubbornly resists eradication. When smallpox was wiped out, some in the medical community were so high on their success they thought other infectious diseases would soon be licked. Fifty years later, this triumph remains unique.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/11/spillover-animal-infections-pandemic-quammen-review\" title=\"\">David Quammen\u2019s <strong>Spillover</strong></a> serves as a rousing wake-up call, because he conjures up the complex web of microbial ecosystems through which humanity stumbles blindly. Mostly the microbes mind their own business, but occasionally we blunder into their finely tuned arrangements for survival and provoke the spillover of a pathogen from its usual animal host to us. It takes time for them to find a sustainable way to colonise their new host, or hosts, so the initial fallout can be carnage \u2013 a trail of gorilla carcasses in an African forest, for example, that heralds an outbreak of Ebola in people.</p> <p>Not all pathogens acquire the ability to spread easily between humans, but if they do, then a pandemic \u2013 an epidemic that encompasses several countries or continents \u2013 becomes possible. In the 14th century, long before people connected infection with germs, one or more varieties of plague reduced the population of Europe by as much as half. Philip Ziegler\u2019s classic account of that disaster, <strong>The Black Death</strong>, shines a light into the medieval mind, revealing how mystical and often paranoid explanations produced cults of self-flagellation and the burning of Jews.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"08034a8b63f78b045eb848c0596b51462b82a1fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/08034a8b63f78b045eb848c0596b51462b82a1fe/0_89_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A patient at a hospital in Port-a-Piment, Haiti.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A patient at a hospital in Port-a-Piment, Haiti.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Stigmatisation of the other has always accompanied pandemics, but so have compassion and heroism.

      "bodyText": "With cases of coronavirus reported on four continents, health experts are concerned it could become a pandemic. The world is currently in the grip of two others \u2013 Aids and tuberculosis \u2013 while measles is on the rise again and polio stubbornly resists eradication. When smallpox was wiped out, some in the medical community were so high on their success they thought other infectious diseases would soon be licked. Fifty years later, this triumph remains unique. David Quammen\u2019s Spillover serves as a rousing wake-up call, because he conjures up the complex web of microbial ecosystems through which humanity stumbles blindly. Mostly the microbes mind their own business, but occasionally we blunder into their finely tuned arrangements for survival and provoke the spillover of a pathogen from its usual animal host to us. It takes time for them to find a sustainable way to colonise their new host, or hosts, so the initial fallout can be carnage \u2013 a trail of gorilla carcasses in an African forest, for example, that heralds an outbreak of Ebola in people. Not all pathogens acquire the ability to spread easily between humans, but if they do, then a pandemic \u2013 an epidemic that encompasses several countries or continents \u2013 becomes possible. In the 14th century, long before people connected infection with germs, one or more varieties of plague reduced the population of Europe by as much as half. Philip Ziegler\u2019s classic account of that disaster, The Black Death, shines a light into the medieval mind, revealing how mystical and often paranoid explanations produced cults of self-flagellation and the burning of Jews. Stigmatisation of the other has always accompanied pandemics, but so have compassion and heroism. A literary sub-genre is dedicated to the doctors and scientists who have ventured to the centre of pandemics to take on the invisible enemy, and in this category Tracy Kidder\u2019s Mountains Beyond Mountains stands out. It is the story of Paul Farmer, a Harvard professor of health who finds his vocation fighting Aids and TB in impoverished communities in Haiti, and who sleeps no more than a couple of hours a night because, as he tells Kidder, while he\u2019s sleeping, people are dying. The curious thing about pandemics is that novelists don\u2019t seem to know what to do with them. You would think they would find rich material in a menace that brings out the best and worst in people, and that makes a mockery of all the ways we divide ourselves up \u2013 by colour, faith or postcode. But when they have written memorably about them, it tends to have been as allegories for something else \u2013 fascism, say, or war. There are exceptions, and Philip Roth\u2019s novel Nemesis is one. Polio is on the prowl in Newark in the summer of 1944, and teacher Bucky Cantor\u2019s girlfriend begs him to leave the city for the polio-free summer camp where she is working. Duty obliges him to stay with the kids in his charge, however, and when he finally does reach the camp, the disease follows him. Another exception is Pale Horse, Pale Rider, Katherine Anne Porter\u2019s jewel of a novel based on her experience of falling ill during the 1918 flu pandemic. Fifty million died \u2013 but she did her writerly duty, and gave us a glimpse of the suffering behind that number.

      "bodyText": "A quick roundup of what\u2019s happened so far today: China cuts tariffs on 1,717 US goods worth billions of dollars, helping to boost market confidence amid the coronavirus outbreak European shares hit a new record high in the wake of the announcement But Royal Mail shares fell to a new record low after warning it may not be able to meet its three year targets, and said 2020 would be a \u201cchallenging year\u201d Carmaker Toyota raised its profit forecasts \u2013 but hasn\u2019t factored the impact of the coronavirus into its earnings projections The UK government launched a consultation on Britain\u2019s post-Brexit tariff schedules. There are plans to remove levies on products that are used by key manufacturing industries and those where the UK has no domestic production Twitter shares jumped in pre-market trading after ite quarterly revenues breached $1bn for the first time Twitter shares are up 6% in pre-market trading after releasing fourth quarter and annual earnings figures for 2019. Some highlights: Revenue was up 14% at $3.46bn, year-on-year Fourth quarter revenue also pushed past the $1bn mark for the first time Annual net income increased to $1.47bn, up from $1.21bn a year earlier The company also said it\u2019s continuing to expand and will grow headcount by 20% or more in 2020. They ended the year with 4,800 employees so that would be roughly 960 new staff. The FTSE 100 is still holding above 7,500 (at least by 13 points or so). It\u2019s being helped in part by the weaker pound which is down 0.3% against both the euro and US dollar. The FCA\u2019s letter to investment platforms CEOs can be read in full here. The Financial Conduct Authority has written to CEOs of investment platforms, warning that they must be \u201cimpartial\u201d when putting together Best Buy lists for customers. The \u201cDear CEO\u201d letter touches on a number of issues including conflicts of interest: If not appropriately identified and managed, conflicts of interest can lead to customers receiving poor value for money and / or products and services that are unsuitable for their needs. We expect you to identify all potential conflicts of interest and to have processes in place to effectively manage them. Firms operating Best Buy lists must construct them impartially and manage conflicts e.g. preference for funds offering discounts over formal and objective criteria, lack of independence of research teams and associated governance. Processes for clear selection, monitoring and deselection of funds on lists should be documented, understood and followed. You may remember how much criticism Hargreaves Lansdown attracted for having listed Neil Woodford\u2019s flagship Equity Income Fund on its Wealth 50 list of favourite investments, despite concerns about the size of his investments in smaller and unlisted companies, which are harder to sell. Hargreaves said in the months later said it was aware of the fund\u2019s underperformance but kept it on the list in the hope it would bounce back. The Woodford Equity Income Fund is now being liquidated, but the whole debacle has focused minds on regulation of the fund industry and investment platforms that promote them to retail investors. A quick catch-up on Christine Lagarde, who was speaking in the European parliament. Nothing ground-breaking. The European Central Bank boss said that growth remains modest but there are tentative signs of stabilisation, even if the coronavirus outbreak in China clouds the horizon, she said. ViaReuters: The ECB has maintained ultra-easy policies for years to boost growth and Lagarde said this support was still needed to shield the currency bloc from global headwinds. While uncertainties surrounding the global economic environment remain elevated, those related to trade tensions between the United States and China are receding. The Scottish government\u2019s budget will take place after midday, and will be led by Kate Forbes, the Scottish public finance minister. She replaces Derek Mackay, who resigned this morning as finance minister over texts to a 16-year-old boy. At mid-morning the European stock rally has lost some of its momentum. The FTSE 100 and the mid-cap FTSE 250 are both up by about 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 have gained about 0.6% apiece. That has weighted down the Euro Stoxx 600, which has fallen back from the record highs. Some good news for 70,000 customers of Nationwide, the UK\u2019s largest building society, which has failed to warn customers of impending charges for the second time in six months. Nationwide will pay back \u00a3900,000 to 70,000 customers after it failed to warn them about unarranged overdrafts, breaching banking rules. It did send text alerts, but these did not contain a warning that customers would be charged. The majority of customers will be refunded by 27th March, with the rest completed by 29th May, according to a letter sent out by the Competition and Markets Authority. Trade wonk news: the government has launched its consultation on Britain\u2019s post-Brexit tariff schedules, with plans to remove levies on products that are used by key manufacturing industries and those where the UK has no domestic production. The four-week consultation (to close on 5 March) will likely be the target of intense lobbying, as manufacturing industries in particular try to secure cheaper materials and components. The new tariff schedule will kick in on 1 January 2021, confirming a move away from the EU\u2019s common external tariff, the Department for International Trade said. Among the plans outlined in a brief consultation document are removing \u201cnuisance\u201d tariffs of less than 2.5%, having standardised bands, as well as the industry-specific cuts. And watch out on the farming front: there are plans for \u201csteps towards agricultural tariffs that are applied as single percentages\u201d. And that oil price data for you: Brent crude futures have gained 0.6% to reach $55.60 per barrel \u2013 although they have retreated somewhat from the levels above $56.50 hit in the early morning. The price of futures for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, have held on to more of their gains: one option will set you back $51.39, a gain of 1.3% for Thursday. Oil prices have continued to rally from lows hit earlier in the week, as investors weigh whether the hit to demand has been fully priced in, and producers near agreement on output cuts. A meeting of Opec as well as Russia could result in a deal today to cut back on production, sustaining prices, Reuters reports: An Opec+ technical committee may reach consensus on Thursday on the need to further cut oil output by at least 500,000 barrels per day in response to the coronavirus\u2019 impact on energy demand and global economic growth, two sources told Reuters. The so-called JTC panel has extended its meeting for a third day into Thursday after Russia voiced its opposition to a deeper supply cut and was instead suggesting an extension of current cuts. Carmaker Toyota has bucked the recent trend and raised its profits forecasts \u2013 but the Japanese carmaker acknowledged that coronavirus had not yet been factored in on its earnings. Toyota raised its annual operating profit forecast by 4.2% on favourable currency rates and better-than-expected vehicle sales, despite warning that there would be an impact on sales for the world\u2019s second largest carmaker. Carmakers are among the hardest-hit companies because Wuhan, the city where the outbreak is believed to have originated, is a key automotive hub. Supply chains stretching around the world have been affected, and sales are expected to fall off a cliff until the epidemic stops. Toyota operating officer Masayoshi Shirayanagi told a news conference (via Reuters): We are looking very closely at inventories of components which are made in China and used in other countries, including Japan, and at the possibility of alternative production. *Refresh your page to see a correction to a previous post. Derek Mackay, Scotland\u2019s finance secretary, has resigned only hours before he was due to deliver next year\u2019s budget after revelations that he texted a 16-year-old boy. Quite a scoop from the Scottish Sun, which published a long list of text messages Mackay, 42, sent the teenager, calling him \u201ccute\u201d, discussing his new haircut and inviting him to dinner and to accompany him to a parliamentary event as his guest. We\u2019ll bring any updates we can about what will happen to that budget. You can read the full story here: Another bad day in the torrid tale of Royal Mail since privatisation: shares hit a new record low after it warned that 2020 will be \u201cchallenging\u201d. It\u2019s down by 8%. Royal Mail said its outlook for the next fiscal year is \u201cchallenging\u201d and the threat of a strike in late 2019 hurt parcel revenue growth during the Christmas period as customers opted to use other carriers. Unless we are able to make significant progress in delivering our transformation plan, our ability to meet the year three targets of our Journey 2024 plan will be compromised. Last May, it pledged to invest \u00a31.8bn in a five-year turnaround plan as it tries to adapt to a world reliant on online parcel deliveries, amid declining use of letters. Today\u2019s low was 168.05p for a share, compared to a 330p float price back in 2013. The privatisation was criticised for not achieving a good enough price for the taxpayer, with shares hitting 632p at one point. Since that high in 2018 the decline has been a precipitous 72%. *This post has been corrected. Royal Mail\u2019s float price was 330p, not 420p as previously stated. Shares opened at 420p on its first day of trading. Apologies for the error. JJ And European shares follow their Asian counterparts in rising, setting a new record for the Euro Stoxx 600 index. The index, which tracks the largest companies in the UK and European stock exchanges The FTSE 100 is up 0.6% in the very opening exchanges, with no standout individual performers. The FTSE 250 has gained 0.7%. France\u2019s Cac 40 gained 0.8% at the open, while Germany\u2019s Dax gained 0.7%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. China has said it would halve additional tariffs levied against 1,717 US goods last year, in a move that has boosted markets in Asia that have been under pressure since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. The products benefiting are part of $75bn of goods on which China imposed tariffs worth between 5% and 10% in September as part of a tit-for-tat trade war with the Trump administration. Analysts said that the tariff cut is partly a move by Beijing to boost confidence amid an outbreak that has disrupted businesses in China\u2019s core manufacturing regions and hit investor sentiment. 560 deaths had been reported so far on Thursday morning in China. And the reaction was strong on Asian markets, with the CSI 300 index, which measures the biggest stocks on Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, rising by 1.86%. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite index rose by 1.72%, stocks in Hong Kong rose by 2.4%, and the Japanese Topix index gained 2%. The tariff cuts, that will come into effect on 14 February, Valentine\u2019s Day, come after the signing of a Phase 1 trade deal that brought a truce to a bruising trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Craig Nicol said: It shouldn\u2019t be surprising news as this comes after both nations had agreed in Phase 1 negotiations that they would reduce tariffs on each other\u2019s goods as part of the deal Deutsche Bank\u2019s forecasters predict Chinese GDP growth will be 5.8% this year, 0.3 percentage points lower than previously forecast. The virus will also knock 0.2 percentage points off global GDP this year, they estimate. Elsewhere, German factory orders slumped much more than expected in December. Data published this morning showed that orders declined by 2.1%, compared to the 0.6% rise expected by economists. And of course this is before the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, which is almost certain to dent the profits of major exporters such as Germany\u2019s premium carmakers who sell a large proportion of their products to China. The implications are not pretty for carmakers anywhere, in fact. For instance, it comes at just the wrong time for struggling Aston Martin, even after a bailout deal was agreed...

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>As well as concerns over the spread of the virus, staff numbers on the ground in China were thought to be a factor.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s ambassador to the UK has condemned the British authorities for sowing panic over the coronavirus with its advice for all British citizens to leave the country. On Tuesday the British government became the first in the world to advise all citizens to leave China if they could, although unlike the US, Australia and several other countries, it has not banned entry for travellers who have recently visited mainland China. Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said the UK position was an overreaction that ignored World Heath Organization advice against sweeping travel restrictions, which he claimed UK officials had privately acknowledged was correct. \u201cI am not accusing, I would just like to see their words match their actions,\u201d Liu said at a press conference in London about China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. \u201cWe asked them to take the advice of the WHO, to make a reasonable reaction. \u201cWe don\u2019t think there should be such a panic. We were given notice before they [the UK] made a formal announcement, we advised them we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. We believe the epidemic is controllable, preventable and curable.\u201d The UK has three confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, two connected to the University of York and one diagnosed in Brighton on Thursday. The new patient did not contract the disease in the UK, the chief medical officer said. In China the disease still shows no sign of being brought under control, despite massive government mobilisation to try to contain it. There are now over 28,000 people infected, the vast majority in Hubei province, which is the centre of the outbreak, and over 560 people have died. Liu said the Chinese government had asked London to review its decision, but otherwise praised ties between the two countries. He said the Chinese and British governments had \u201cmaintained very close contact\u201d since the outbreak began, and praised collaboration between scientists from the two countries who are working in areas including tracing the origin of the coronavirus and the race to develop a vaccine. He declined to comment on why he thought London had brought in the hardline policy, saying that was for the Foreign Office to answer. As well as concerns over the spread of the virus, staff numbers on the ground in China were thought to be a factor. The British embassy has evacuated all non-essential staff and already warned that the support it could offer citizens would be reduced. Most UK citizens who were stranded in the quarantined centre of the outbreak have been evacuated on special flights, but tens of thousands more live in cities across China, often with Chinese relatives or dependents. Liu also raised concerns about \u201chatred and discrimination\u201d towards Chinese citizens and people of Chinese heritage in the UK, as fears about the virus grew. He said the embassy had had reports of discrimination from schools and universities, and had issued warning advice. He admitted that the country had not been fully prepared for an epidemic on the scale it was now battling. \u201cI can\u2019t say China is prepared for this outbreak, we don\u2019t have enough beds, hospitals,\u201d he said, adding that was why two new hospitals had been thrown up in Hubei in as many weeks. \u201cWe try our best to take as many patients as possible,\u201d he added.",

      "bodyText": "The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has reached 563, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine and Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined outside Yokohama. Chinese authorities said on Thursday the death toll had risen by 73 in the previous 24 hours \u2013 the third record daily rise in a row \u2013 with 70 of the deaths recorded in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. Hospitals in Wuhan, the Hubei city where the virus is thought to have originated, said they were struggling to find enough beds for thousands of newly infected patients. China\u2019s national health commission said that, as of midnight Wednesday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases throughout the country \u2013 a rise of 3,694 and the biggest 24-hour rise \u2013 as well as 24,702 suspected cases. The youngest patient is a baby born on Saturday in Wuhan and confirmed positive just 36 hours after birth. The baby was immediately separated from the mother after the birth and has been under artificial feeding. Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two fatalities, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. On Thursday the UK confirmed a third case, while Japan confirmed another 10 infections among 3,700 passengers and crew stuck onboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship moored off the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo. Ten people had tested positive for the illness on Wednesday. Japanese health officials now have the results of 102 tests conducted on 273 passengers and crew who complained of feeling unwell or had been in close contact with a man in his 80s who disembarked late last month and tested positive on his return home to Hong Kong. The 20 cases recorded so far onboard the ship bring the number of infections in Japan to 45 \u2013 the highest total outside mainland China. The 10 new cases involve four people from Japan, two each from the US and Canada, and one each from New Zealand and Taiwan, the health ministry said, adding that five were in their 70s, four in their 60s and one in their 50s. TV footage showed the vessel arriving at Yokohama port to take on food and other supplies and hand over the infected patients, who are being treated at hospitals in the Yokohama area. Port officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, face masks and helmets. Hundreds of experts will gather in Geneva early next week in an attempt to find a way to fight back against the outbreak by speeding up research into drugs and vaccines, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, while playing down speculation that the search for a treatment was making progress. The WHO\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Wednesday asked for $675m to help countries address the expected spread of the virus. He acknowledged that the sum was large, but said it was \u201cmuch less than the bill we will face if we do not invest in preparedness now\u201d. In Wuhan, a new, 1,500-bed hospital specially built for virus patients opened days after a 1,000-bed hospital with prefabricated wards and isolation rooms began taking patients. Nevertheless, Hu Lishan, a senior official in Wuhan, said the city with a population of 11 million was facing a \u201csevere\u201d shortage of beds. Hu said 8,182 patients had been admitted to 28 hospitals that have a total of 8,254 beds, adding that the city also had inadequate supplies of equipment and materials. \u2018Little bit more nervous now\u2019 Passengers onboard the Diamond Princess, meanwhile, faced another 12 full days quarantined inside their cabins. Vera Koslova, an Australian passenger, told the ABC that frustration amongst passengers was rising: \u201cThere\u2019s been no announcements made as yet by the captain to let us know that there has been more cases,\u201d she said on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m quite patient and have a very positive attitude and know that the Australian government is trying to do everything possible as well as Japan. But, um, just getting just a little bit more nervous now.\u201d David Abel, a British passenger, said in a Facebook post that the crew were responding to requests to make their quarantine more bearable, including offering a wider selection of food. Thursday\u2019s lunch menu included a smoked turkey salad appetiser and a choice of stir fried chicken, shrimp or tofu \u2013 all with vegetables \u2013 and, for dinner, a choice of vegetable lasagna, beef stew or pasta gratin. \u201cThat\u2019s not like prison food, it\u2019ll be good,\u201d said Abel, who is with his wife, Sally, celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary Gay Courter, a 75-year-old American, said her biggest worry was that she had been infected without being aware of it. \u201cWe are hopeful that the US government will be sending transport for the Americans on board. It\u2019s better for us to travel while healthy and also if we get sick to be treated in American hospitals.\u201d A cruise ship off Hong Kong with 3,600 passengers and crew was quarantined for a second day on Thursday pending testing after three positive cases onboard. Authorities said 33 crew members on the World Dream had developed respiratory tract infection symptoms and three had been sent to a hospital for isolation and management after developing fevers. All but one of the 33 tested negative for the coronavirus, with the remaining test pending, the city\u2019s health department said. Agencies contributed to this report.",

It is helpful to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and favourite in the contest, although perhaps only up to a point. Here are the main findings.</p> <p><strong>1) Among the public at large, Starmer has a clear lead over his three rivals on who is seen as having what it takes to be a good prime minister. </strong>Some 32% of people view him this way, the poll suggests. Rebecca Long-Bailey, his main rival, comes last, with only 14% of people seeing her as having what it takes to be a good PM, and 42% saying she doesn\u2019t.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b38c5c27689ef0c98791e1841c72b0512a9d317\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b38c5c27689ef0c98791e1841c72b0512a9d317/0_0_1257_693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - amongst public as a whole.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"551\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - among public as a whole.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos Mori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Assuming that Labour members would like to elect a leader who can win an election (which is broadly, but not wholly, true), a clear lead on this measure is a strong advantage.</p> <p><strong>2) Starmer also has a clear lead amongst Labour supporters on \u2018having what it takes to be a good prime minster\u2019</strong>. Again, Long-Bailey is last on this measure and, as in the chart above, Starmer\u2019s lead over Long-Bailey here amounts to 18 points (although, proportionally, that counts for less on these figures). Starmer may be moderately encouraged by this.

And, although members would like a leader seen as having what it takes to be a good PM, separate polling of Labour members published recently showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/16/labour-leadership-contest-nandy-praised-for-neil-interview-as-poll-suggests-long-bailey-in-lead-live-news?page=with:block-5e206d508f088d80a182c0a7#block-5e206d508f088d80a182c0a7\">they rank having strong political convictions as being a more important trait in a leader than appealing to average voters.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6652ad28a88f414c0caf60df78471796eca9950f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6652ad28a88f414c0caf60df78471796eca9950f/0_0_1253_692/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling - amongst Labour supporters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"552\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling - among Labour supporters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ipsos Mori</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>3) People are more likely to say they would vote Labour at the next election with Starmer leading the party than with any of his rivals - but on this measure his lead over Emily Thornberry, Lisa Nandy and Long-Bailey is more modest.</strong> These figures suggest that Labour will still start well behind the Tories whoever wins the leadership.

Now the first review (of sorts) is in, and it is not complimentary. In a highly unusual move, the <strong>House of Commons</strong> has issued a statement condemning Bercow for naming members of staff. Commons officials, like civil servants, would normally expect not to be identified or criticised by name in a book like this because they are deemed not to have a right of reply. </p> <p>In a statement described as \u201cregarding publication of the former Speaker\u2019s autobiography\u201d, a House of Commons spokesman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>House of Commons staff work incredibly hard to enable the effective functioning of our democracy and have a right to expect that their privacy be respected. It is unacceptable to publicly name current or former staff without their prior knowledge or authority, especially for the purpose of financial gain or commercial success. A crucial element of the work of House of Commons staff is to provide confidential, impartial advice to MPs. Breaking this confidentiality undermines this important principle and also places staff in a position from which they are unable to respond.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The statement goes on to say that Commons staff who have suffered bullying should report it. (Bercow has been accused of bullying his staff by several senior figures, although he strongly denies it.) The Commons spokesman said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Parliament\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/privileges/UKParliamentBehaviourCode.pdf\"><em>Behaviour Code</em></a><em> makes clear the standards of behaviour expected of everyone in parliament, whether staff, members of the House of Lords, MPs or visitors.

She made the claim as she announced <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-consults-on-new-global-tariff-policy\">the Department for International Trade\u2019s consultation on what it describes as the \u201cUK global tariff\u201d</a> - the tariff schedule that will apply to all countries exporting to the UK that do not have a free trade agreement.</p> <p>In a statement Truss says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The UK has left the EU and it is time for us to look forward to our future as an independent, global champion of free trade.</p> <p>It is vitally important that we now move away from complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union.</p> <p>High tariffs impinge on businesses and raise costs for consumers. This is our opportunity to set our own tariff strategy that is right for UK consumers and businesses across our country.</p> <p>I am calling on people, businesses and civil society groups to seize this opportunity to take part in our consultation and tell us what would work best for them.</p> </blockquote> <p>Currently the UK has to apply EU tariffs, but from next year it will be free to apply its own \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d (MFN) tariff schedule. MFN is a standard term in trade, but it can be misleading. Although it sounds as if countries getting MFN tariffs are getting special treatment, in fact it means they are getting the same treatment as everyone else - apart from countries who are getting special treatment because of a free trade deal.</p> <p>In its news release DIT says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This bespoke regime, known as the UK Global Tariff, will ensure UK businesses compete on fair terms with the rest of the world whilst benefitting households through greater choice and lower prices. Ultimately, this will also help to make it easier to trade, drive up investment, and deliver more quality jobs across the UK.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also explains some of the plans that feature in the consultation.</p> <p>As part of the consultation, the government is seeking views on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>simplifying and tailoring the tariff to suit UK businesses and households, such as removing tariffs of less than 2.5% and rounding tariffs down to the nearest 2.5%, 5% or 10% band; </p> <p>removing tariffs on key inputs to production which could reduce costs for UK manufacturers; and</p> <p>removing tariffs where the UK has zero or limited domestic production which could help to lower prices for consumers.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1225355102732652549\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As an independent trading nation, we will have a new UK Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff schedule which will enter into force on 1st January 2021.<br><br>The UK Global Tariff will be simpler and suit \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 priorities.<br><br>Contribute here\ud83d\udc47<a href=\"https://t.co/29YENHsJMG\">https://t.co/29YENHsJMG</a></p>&mdash; Liz Truss (@trussliz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1225355102732652549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1225360576072867841\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">As we take back control of our trade policy for the first time in almost 50 years - we will champion free trade.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tradegovuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TradeGovUK</a> is ready to start negotiating FTAs with the rest of the \ud83c\udf0e that will create opportunities across \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7.<br><br>Read my WMS on our plans \ud83d\udc47 <a href=\"https://t.co/GOdnZfMVQb\">https://t.co/GOdnZfMVQb</a></p>&mdash; Liz Truss (@trussliz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/trussliz/status/1225360576072867841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T10:56:13.201Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3be8408f08e1332473e227\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T10:20:10.947Z\">10.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This is from <strong>Children 1st</strong>, a Scottish children\u2019s charity, on Derek Mackay.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/children1st/status/1225357280037818368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Children 1st comment on Derek Mackay&#39;s resignation from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/margl43?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@margl43</a>: <a href=\"https://t.co/DeDluY5I2C\">https://t.co/DeDluY5I2C</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Iu7at6I4Kp\">pic.twitter.com/Iu7at6I4Kp</a></p>&mdash; Children 1st (@children1st) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/children1st/status/1225357280037818368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3be4ba8f08e1332473e208\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T10:17:36.518Z\">10.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Derek Mackay should resign as MSP, not just as minister, Scottish Tory leader suggests</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jackson Carlaw,</strong> the acting Scottish Conservative leader, has suggested that Derek Mackay should stand down as an MSP not just as finance secretary.

In normal circumstances there would be nothing unusual about a former chancellor going to the Lords - it is more or less automatic, if an ex-chancellor wants a peerage - but these nominations did not look likely last year when Johnson was purging rebel pro-Europeans from his party. These moves will be seen as a sign that Johnson is serious about healing leave/remain divisions.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51389602\">the BBC report,</a> Downing Street is also nominating the two former Labour MPs Ian Austen and John Woodcock for peerages. Austen and Woodcock both quit Labour in the last parliament strongly criticising Jeremy Corbyn (although Woodcock was also subject to disciplinary proceedings at the time). At the election both men urged voters to back the Tories on the grounds that they thought Corbyn unfit to be prime minister.</p> <p>And No 10 is also expected to nominate Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, for a peerage too, the BBC reports. In the past there has been speculation about Davidson becoming an MP and standing for the Tory leadership one day, but going to the Lords would suggest she has given up on that ambition.</p> <p>These nominations have not been officially confirmed, and the BBC report stresses that final appointments will be subject to candidates clearing the vetting process.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdb89f2a81b1666a8980cf0e2ec96d5b6190a59a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdb89f2a81b1666a8980cf0e2ec96d5b6190a59a/0_160_2620_1572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Philip Hammond.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Philip Hammond.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mazen Mahdi/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e3bdc0a8f08e1332473e1d3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T09:28:28.272Z\">9.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast is out.

      "bodyText": "Scotland\u2019s finance secretary, Derek Mackay, has resigned and been suspended as a member of the Scottish National party hours before he was due to deliver next year\u2019s budget after it emerged he had been sending messages to a 16-year-old boy. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s bid for the Labour leadership has received a boost from polling that suggests he would be more likely than any of his rivals to attract new voters to Labour at the next general election. (See 4.06pm.) A key ally of Jeremy Corbyn has said failing to elect Rebecca Long-Bailey to be the Labour party\u2019s next leader risks turning the clock back to 2015 and the leadership of Ed Miliband. Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy has criticised Richard Burgon over his controversial proposal to ballot members before backing military action, which he put forward as part of his campaign to be the party\u2019s deputy leader. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has launched a consultation on the UK\u2019s post-Brexit tariff policy, claiming the new system could lead to lower prices for consumers. (See 10.37am.) A flood of senior German politicians visiting the UK this week have been left confused and unnerved by the hardline rhetoric set out by Boris Johnson on trade talks, prompting warnings that the risk of a breakdown, or a no-deal Brexit, is as high as it has ever been. European countries that fish in British waters are pushing for a tougher stance to protect their fishing crews before trade talks with the UK. As Jennifer Rankin reports, western coastal states made the call at a meeting of European Union ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday evening, the first high-level diplomatic talks on chief negotiator Michel Barnier\u2019s draft negotiating mandate since its publication on Monday. EU sources said western coastal states with a strong fishing interest wanted Barnier\u2019s text to be clearer that the EU would seek to maintain the same access to British waters, and the same quota shares for 100 types of fish that swim in shared seas. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, has said that Labour is minded to support the emergency government legislation ending automatic early release for terrorist offenders when MPs vote on it next week. (See 11.17am.) The Scottish government has published its budget for 2020-21, saying that no Scottish taxpayer will pay more income tax on their current income under the plans and that \u201cfor the third consecutive year, more than half of Scottish income taxpayers will pay less tax than if they lived anywhere else in the UK.\u201d The full details are here. A \u00a3170m government fund to improve bus services will not be nearly enough to plug a \u00a3700m funding gap in bus provision, Labour and local authorities have said. The House of Commons has severely criticised John Bercow after he named staff members without their prior knowledge in his autobiography. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. From Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge The Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski, who was widely-condemned for speaking alongside far-right politicians at a conference, has been reprimanded by the party but has avoided a suspension, the Press Association reports. Kawczynski defied critics to speak at an event in Rome as part of a line-up that included Hungary\u2019s prime minister Viktor Orban and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini. The MP was condemned by the Board of Deputies of British Jews and the Muslim Council of Britain. A Conservative party spokeswoman said today that Kawczynski\u2019s appearance at the event was unacceptable and that the MP had been reprimanded. She said: Daniel Kawczynski has been formally warned that his attendance at this event was not acceptable, particularly in light of the views of some of those in attendance, which we utterly condemn, and that he is expected to hold himself to higher standards. Daniel has accepted this and apologised. Ipsos Mori has released some interesting polling today (pdf) about the Labour leadership candidates. It is helpful to Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and favourite in the contest, although perhaps only up to a point. Here are the main findings. 1) Among the public at large, Starmer has a clear lead over his three rivals on who is seen as having what it takes to be a good prime minister. Some 32% of people view him this way, the poll suggests. Rebecca Long-Bailey, his main rival, comes last, with only 14% of people seeing her as having what it takes to be a good PM, and 42% saying she doesn\u2019t. Assuming that Labour members would like to elect a leader who can win an election (which is broadly, but not wholly, true), a clear lead on this measure is a strong advantage. 2) Starmer also has a clear lead amongst Labour supporters on \u2018having what it takes to be a good prime minster\u2019. Again, Long-Bailey is last on this measure and, as in the chart above, Starmer\u2019s lead over Long-Bailey here amounts to 18 points (although, proportionally, that counts for less on these figures). Starmer may be moderately encouraged by this. But Labour supporters are not the same as the Labour members who (along with registered supporters and affiliate members) will be deciding the next leader. And, although members would like a leader seen as having what it takes to be a good PM, separate polling of Labour members published recently showed that they rank having strong political convictions as being a more important trait in a leader than appealing to average voters. 3) People are more likely to say they would vote Labour at the next election with Starmer leading the party than with any of his rivals - but on this measure his lead over Emily Thornberry, Lisa Nandy and Long-Bailey is more modest. These figures suggest that Labour will still start well behind the Tories whoever wins the leadership. (The same Ipsos Mori poll today puts the Conservatives on 47% and Labour on 30% on voting intention - a 17-point lead.) 4) And Starmer would be better at getting non-Labour supporters to consider voting Labour at the next election, the poll suggests - although most non-Labour supporters say they would still be unlikely to back the party even with Starmer in charge. Only 20% of non-Labour supporters say Starmer would make them likely to back the party. For Long-Bailey, the figure is 12%. There is one other important point to make about the polling. Almost half of those asked about the four Labour leadership candidates either said that they did not know whether or not they had what it takes to be a good PM, or said that they did not have a view either way (which might just be another way of saying they did not know). Here are the detailed figures amongst all respondents, but the figures from Labour supporters are very similar, as you can see on this chart (pdf). This does not stop Starmer being able to say he is the candidate who seems most likely to be able to win over new voters are the next election. According to these figures, he is. But it does mean that any assessment of that kind is shrouded in uncertainty. A spokesman for John Bercow has defended the former Speaker\u2019s decision to name House of Commons officials in his memoir. (See 12.55pm.) The spokesman said: Given there is a small but highly vocal group of people consistently seeking to blacken his name, it would be odd if Mr Bercow did not comment on their unfounded allegations and the reasons behind them. He was advised by Speaker\u2019s counsel not to do so in detail while he was in office. He is therefore doing so now. If the book had not addressed these issues, he would rightly have been accused of serious omission. Critics are entitled to air their views. What they are not entitled to do is to make unfounded allegations and expect Mr Bercow to say nothing in return. Here is Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson\u2019s main rival for the Tory leadership last year, on the reports that Ken Clarke is getting a peerage. (See 9.55am.) This is from the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, is unhappy about the reports saying Boris Johnson is offering peerages to Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond. (See 9.55am.) In a statement, the Institute of Directors welcomes the fact that the government is consulting on its post-Brexit tariff schedule (see 10.37am and 11.55am), but says \u201cbusinesses also need a much clearer understanding of how the new tariff regime would intersect with our upcoming trade negotiations and the continuity agreements [the Department for International Trade] is trying to roll over\u201d. Labour has now released the figures for the ballot in which Liam Byrne was selected as the party\u2019s candidate for West Midlands mayor. (See 11.24am and 12.23pm.) This is from PoliticsHome\u2019s Matt Honeycombe-Foster. Richard Burgon, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, has received a mixed response to his suggestion that Labour should not support the use of military action without members first voting in favour (unless the UN has given its approval, or the country faces a national emergency). Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, has backed the idea. Damian McBride, Gordon Brown\u2019s former communications chief, who now advises Emily Thornberry, has offered qualified critique on Twitter. But, as my colleague Kate Proctor reports, Lisa Nandy, a candidate for the Labour leadership, has said she could not disagree with the plan more. The Labour MP Neil Coyle has described the idea as \u201chorse shit\u201d. And this is from Anna Turley, who was a Labour MP until she lost her seat at the election. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Yesterday John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, held the launch party for his memoir, Unspeakable. Now the first review (of sorts) is in, and it is not complimentary. In a highly unusual move, the House of Commons has issued a statement condemning Bercow for naming members of staff. Commons officials, like civil servants, would normally expect not to be identified or criticised by name in a book like this because they are deemed not to have a right of reply. In a statement described as \u201cregarding publication of the former Speaker\u2019s autobiography\u201d, a House of Commons spokesman said: House of Commons staff work incredibly hard to enable the effective functioning of our democracy and have a right to expect that their privacy be respected. It is unacceptable to publicly name current or former staff without their prior knowledge or authority, especially for the purpose of financial gain or commercial success. A crucial element of the work of House of Commons staff is to provide confidential, impartial advice to MPs. Breaking this confidentiality undermines this important principle and also places staff in a position from which they are unable to respond. The statement goes on to say that Commons staff who have suffered bullying should report it. (Bercow has been accused of bullying his staff by several senior figures, although he strongly denies it.) The Commons spokesman said: Parliament\u2019s Behaviour Code makes clear the standards of behaviour expected of everyone in parliament, whether staff, members of the House of Lords, MPs or visitors. There is zero tolerance for abuse or harassment. We strongly encourage anyone who has experienced bullying or harassment in parliament to submit a complaint via the independent complaints and grievance scheme. In addition, all current and former staff can access the employee assistance programme for emotional support. At first minister\u2019s questions MSPs are now raising other issues, but here is a clip of Jackson Carlaw asking about Derek Mackay a few minutes ago. These are from the Birmingham Post and Mail\u2019s Jonathan Walker on Liam Byrne winning the Labour nomination for mayor of West Midlands. (See 11.24am.) @LabourPete is Pete Lowe. Richard Leonard, the Scottish Labour leader, is asking questions now. He says Derek Mackay described his actions as \u201cfoolish\u201d. (See 9.09am.) But they were \u201cbeyond foolish\u201d, he says; they were \u201can abuse of power\u201d and \u201cnothing short of predatory\u201d. He welcomes the SNP\u2019s decision to suspend Mackay, but he says he should also stand down as an MSP. Carlaw reads out the NSPCC definition of grooming, and suggests it implies in this case. Sturgeon says she does not want to minimise what happened at all. But she repeats her point about the need for due process. During first minister\u2019s questions Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative leader, says Derek Mackay has 26,000 followers on Twitter. He asks Nicola Sturgeon if Derek Mackay has contacted other boys. And he asks what support has been offered to the boy\u2019s family. Sturgeon says until last night she was not aware of Mackay\u2019s contacts with the boy. She does not condone what he did at all, she says. She says she is not aware of the details of the family. But if they wanted to speak to her, she would be happy to speak to them, she says. She says all parties have faced allegations about party members. They all should apply high standards, she says. Carlaw asks if the reputation of the parliament can be maintained if Mackay remains an MSP. Sturgeon says she oversees the ministerial code. It was clear to her that he could not stay a minister, she says. She says, no matter how upset and shocked people are, there is a need for due process. She says there are matters Mackay will have to reflect on. In the Scottish parliament Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has just made a statement about Derek Mackay. She said he has been suspended from the SNP and from the SNP\u2019s parliamentary group. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has issued two written statements today: one covering the global tariff consultation (see 10.37am); and the other covering the government\u2019s plans for free trade agreements with countries outside the EU. David Henig, the former civil servant who now heads the UK Trade Policy Project, has posted some provisional analysis on Twitter. CPTPP is the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership is an Asian trade agreement that succeeded the TPP one (trans-Pacific partnership) that was nixed by President Trump. From my colleague Rowena Mason, who has been at this morning\u2019s Downing Street lobby briefing This morning\u2019s Sun splashed on a story saying councils have been told to fly the union jack for Prince Andrew\u2019s 60th birthday on 19 February. Given the scandal about his friendship with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the proposal has triggered fierce protests. Labour has chosen MP Liam Byrne to be its candidate in May\u2019s mayoral elections in West Midlands, beating former Respect party leader Salma Yaqoob in a bitter contest. The Conservatives will no doubt now spend the next few months reminding voters that it was Byrne who left the note after Labour lost power in 2010, telling his successor as chief secretary to the Treasury \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is no money\u201d. Byrne has apologised multiple times for the letter, saying he will regret it forever. Byrne, MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill since 2004, will go up against Andy Street, former managing director of John lewis, who took a surprise win for the Conservatives in the inaugural elections in 2017. Labour should invite council leaders to attend its shadow cabinet as it tries to rebuild the party following the general election, leadership contender Lisa Nandy has said. My colleague Kate Proctor has the full story here. In the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, has just announced next week\u2019s business. He did not name a day for the debate on the emergency terror legislation proposed by the government, but he said the government wanted to introduce it \u201cat the earliest opportunity\u201d and he said that he might make an emergency business statement next week to announce the timetable for the legislation. As Kate Proctor reported yesterday, Whitehall officials have said the bill will go through the Commons next week, before clearing the Lords in the week beginning 24 February, after the February half-term recess. The government wants the bill on the statute book by 27 February - just one day before a convicted terrorist who disseminated Islamic State propaganda via Twitter is due for automatic release. Responding to Rees-Mogg, Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, signalled that Labour would vote for the emergency legislation. She told MPs: We on this side say that terrorist prisoners should not be automatically released, but should be subject to parole board assessment before release during their sentences. So the opposition will look carefully at what the government has to say, and work with the government on a cross-party basis in the national interest, and to protect our citizens. Vaz also said she hoped the opposition would be given sufficient time to look at the legislation. More than 3 million EU citizens have applied to live and work in the UK after Brexit, according to the Home Office. As the Press Association reports, the department has announced the latest up-to-date internal figures of how many people have applied for the EU settlement scheme. More than 2.7 million applicants have been granted permission to remain in the UK so far, according to the announcement. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, claims that British consumers and businesses could benefit from lower prices under plans for new UK tariffs that will apply from 1 January 2021, when the UK\u2019s post-Brexit transition period is over. She made the claim as she announced the Department for International Trade\u2019s consultation on what it describes as the \u201cUK global tariff\u201d - the tariff schedule that will apply to all countries exporting to the UK that do not have a free trade agreement. In a statement Truss says: The UK has left the EU and it is time for us to look forward to our future as an independent, global champion of free trade. It is vitally important that we now move away from complex tariff schedule imposed on us by the European Union. High tariffs impinge on businesses and raise costs for consumers. This is our opportunity to set our own tariff strategy that is right for UK consumers and businesses across our country. I am calling on people, businesses and civil society groups to seize this opportunity to take part in our consultation and tell us what would work best for them. Currently the UK has to apply EU tariffs, but from next year it will be free to apply its own \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d (MFN) tariff schedule. MFN is a standard term in trade, but it can be misleading. Although it sounds as if countries getting MFN tariffs are getting special treatment, in fact it means they are getting the same treatment as everyone else - apart from countries who are getting special treatment because of a free trade deal. In its news release DIT says: This bespoke regime, known as the UK Global Tariff, will ensure UK businesses compete on fair terms with the rest of the world whilst benefitting households through greater choice and lower prices. Ultimately, this will also help to make it easier to trade, drive up investment, and deliver more quality jobs across the UK. It also explains some of the plans that feature in the consultation. As part of the consultation, the government is seeking views on: simplifying and tailoring the tariff to suit UK businesses and households, such as removing tariffs of less than 2.5% and rounding tariffs down to the nearest 2.5%, 5% or 10% band; removing tariffs on key inputs to production which could reduce costs for UK manufacturers; and removing tariffs where the UK has zero or limited domestic production which could help to lower prices for consumers. This is from Children 1st, a Scottish children\u2019s charity, on Derek Mackay. Jackson Carlaw, the acting Scottish Conservative leader, has suggested that Derek Mackay should stand down as an MSP not just as finance secretary. Carlaw told Sky News: I think the whole parliament will be in shock. I think we are all bewildered that Derek could have undertaken such a colossal act of judgment. The first minister is going to be making a statement before first minister\u2019s questions this morning. I don\u2019t think if she believes that simply accepting his resignation from government is an end to the matter - I think there will be huge questions to be asked. Parents will be concerned. And I think many colleagues in parliament will wonder how on earth Mr Mackay could continue to enjoy the confidence of his constituents, or parliament. It is a huge blow to politics. Boris Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley, acted as an unlikely diplomatic backchannel to No 10, expressing Chinese concern that the prime minister had not offered China a personal message of support about the coronavirus outbreak, my colleague Patrick Wintour reports. Yesterday Radio 4 broadcast a documentary by Nick Robinson exploring what Boris Johnson really believes. It included an interview with Philip Hammond, the former chancellor, who was surprisingly positive about the prime minister given that Johnson deprived him of the Tory whip after a Brexit rebellion, effectively ending Hammond\u2019s career because it meant Hammond could not stand at the election as a Conservative candidate. Despite all this Hammond told the programme: We clashed on one issue and one issue only really, which was Brexit. On almost all other policy areas we\u2019ve always agreed. And I\u2019ve always seen Boris as a big tent, centrist Conservative politician. Hammond\u2019s comments make a lot more sense in the light of the report from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg that Downing Street is nominating Hammond for a peerage. Ken Clarke, another former Tory chancellor who had the whip removed after rebelling over Brexit, is also on the list, Kuenssberg reports. In normal circumstances there would be nothing unusual about a former chancellor going to the Lords - it is more or less automatic, if an ex-chancellor wants a peerage - but these nominations did not look likely last year when Johnson was purging rebel pro-Europeans from his party. These moves will be seen as a sign that Johnson is serious about healing leave/remain divisions. According to the BBC report, Downing Street is also nominating the two former Labour MPs Ian Austen and John Woodcock for peerages. Austen and Woodcock both quit Labour in the last parliament strongly criticising Jeremy Corbyn (although Woodcock was also subject to disciplinary proceedings at the time). At the election both men urged voters to back the Tories on the grounds that they thought Corbyn unfit to be prime minister. And No 10 is also expected to nominate Ruth Davidson, the former Scottish Conservative leader, for a peerage too, the BBC reports. In the past there has been speculation about Davidson becoming an MP and standing for the Tory leadership one day, but going to the Lords would suggest she has given up on that ambition. These nominations have not been officially confirmed, and the BBC report stresses that final appointments will be subject to candidates clearing the vetting process. The Guardian\u2019s Politics Weekly podcast is out. Rowena Mason and the panel discuss the launch of the COP 26 global climate change conference, the pledge for Labour party reform from leadership candidates and this week\u2019s press boycott at No 10. Plus: Paul Owen on the chaos for the Democrats in Iowa. And these are from Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 finance spokesman in the Scottish parliament. This is from the Labour MP Jess Phillips on Derek Mackay. Boris Johnson is planning a major cabinet reshuffle this week, but in Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, is being forced into an extremely unwelcome mini-reshuffle following the resignation of her finance secretary, Derek Mackay, who had been seen as a potential future SNP leader. Last night the Scottish Sun revealed that Mackay had been sending multiple online messages to a schoolboy. Within the last hour Mackay announced his resignation. The timing is particularly awkward because he was due to deliver the Scottish government\u2019s budget later today. A junior minister will give the budget speech instead. Here is my colleague Severin Carrell\u2019s story. And here is Mackay\u2019s statement. I take full responsibility for my actions. I have behaved foolishly and I am truly sorry. I apologise unreservedly to the individual involved and his family. I spoke last night with the first minister and tendered my resignation with immediate effect. Serving in government has been a huge privilege and I am sorry to have let colleagues and supporters down. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.15am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 10am: Lisa Nandy, the Labour leadership candidate, gives a speech on local government. 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, takes questions in the Commons on next week\u2019s business. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 12pm: Kate Forbes, the Scottish public finance minister, delivers the Scottish government\u2019s budget in the Scottish parliament, replacing Derek Mackay, who resigned this morning as finance minister over texts to a 16-year-old boy. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Among those stranded are Canadian permanent residents Danni Luo and her eight-year-old daughter Qinlin Li, who travelled to Wuhan on 19 January to celebrate Chinese lunar new year with family.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re not on that airplane.

The carmaker, one of Europe\u2019s largest, joined Virgin Atlantic and Nintendo in adding its name to the list of affected companies on Thursday. Fiat said it could be forced to halt production at one of four European plants if the supply of parts from China continued to be affected. Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began, is a major centre for China\u2019s automotive industry and a key source of components used by carmakers around the world. Companies such as Toyota and Peugeot-Citroen have said their supply chains may be affected but neither expects to close UK plants as a result. Toyota said it had yet to factor the impact into its financial predictions, after it raised profit forecasts. The coronavirus outbreak is having a damaging economic and business impact on sectors from tourism to technology to aviation. Virgin Atlantic has extended the suspension of its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai until 28 March. The airline said all passengers booked to travel could claim a refund and should contact the customer care team via their SMS messaging system on +44 (0)7481 339184.

Forty-one projects secured funding, including a grant of $25m for a new pool in the marginal Western Australian seat of the attorney general, Christian Porter, and other marginal electorates including Corangamite, Swan and Gilmore also scored. An inquiry into the original $100m community sport infrastructure program, which was overseen by Bridget McKenzie, has been announced by the Senate.</p> \n<p><strong>Donald Trump has been acquitted of </strong><strong> abusing his power and obstructing Congress</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/05/donald-trump-acquitted-senate-impeachment-trial\">bringing the impeachment process to a close</a>. Mitt Romney crossed the aisle and became the first senator in history to vote to remove a president from his own party in an impeachment trial, but the vote was carried otherwise along party lines 52-48 and 53-47 on the respective charges. Trump immediately went on the offensive on Friday morning, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/feb/06/donald-trump-speech-impeachment-verdict-romney-buttigieg-sanders-biden-live-latest-news\">calling the process \u201cevil\u201d</a> \u2013 saying it had been drummed up by \u201cdirty cops\u201d, \u201cleakers\u201d and \u201cliars\u201d. The international press has been scathing in its reaction, with France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration calling the impeachment process a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/06/hollow-pretence-justice-global-press-trump-impeachment-acquittal\">\u201chollow pretence of justice\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 7 February. Top stories The federal government spent an additional $150m on community sport infrastructure outside its controversial sport grant scheme, with the Department of Health confirming that the money was committed in the lead-up to the 2019 election campaign, and administrated under the female facilities and water safety stream program. Forty-one projects secured funding, including a grant of $25m for a new pool in the marginal Western Australian seat of the attorney general, Christian Porter, and other marginal electorates including Corangamite, Swan and Gilmore also scored. An inquiry into the original $100m community sport infrastructure program, which was overseen by Bridget McKenzie, has been announced by the Senate. Donald Trump has been acquitted of abusing his power and obstructing Congress, bringing the impeachment process to a close. Mitt Romney crossed the aisle and became the first senator in history to vote to remove a president from his own party in an impeachment trial, but the vote was carried otherwise along party lines 52-48 and 53-47 on the respective charges. Trump immediately went on the offensive on Friday morning, calling the process \u201cevil\u201d \u2013 saying it had been drummed up by \u201cdirty cops\u201d, \u201cleakers\u201d and \u201cliars\u201d. The international press has been scathing in its reaction, with France\u2019s Lib\u00e9ration calling the impeachment process a \u201chollow pretence of justice\u201d. Meanwhile in the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders has claimed a \u201cstrong victory\u201d in the Iowa caucuses, even though he is trailing Pete Buttigieg in the first voting state. A Chinese doctor who was among the first to raise concerns about the spread of the coronavirus is critically ill, after becoming infected treating early cases of the then undiagnosed respiratory infection. Le Wenliang, 34, was accused by authorities of \u201cmaking false comments\u201d and \u201cspreading rumours\u201d after posting a warning on social media in late December about a cluster of cases of a flu-like disease at his hospital. The official death toll has risen to 563, with more than 28,000 reported cases. The World Health Organization has called for $675m to stop the outbreak, cautioning that the bill will be much larger \u201cif we do not invest in preparedness now\u201d. Australia Public health officials have fought back tears at an emotional parliamentary hearing in NSW, urging the state government to drop proposed laws that aim to curtail planning authorities\u2019 ability to block projects based on their climate emissions. A 44-year-old Australian national and two Chinese have been stabbed in the Maldives, in an attack claimed by Islamic State sympathisers. Three people have been arrested. The incoming chancellor of the Australian National University, Julie Bishop, has counselled the federal government to lead the world on climate despite \u201cmissteps\u201d, offering the \u201cevidence-based\u201d work of her university\u2019s 300-plus climate scientists and disaster management experts to inform any bushfires response. Labor has asked the Australian Electoral Commission to investigate why the Liberal party declared and then removed a $165,000 donation from the company of a Scott Morrison ally and key bidder for a $1bn government contract. The world A tiny piece of fashioned glass discovered on Lindisfarne is being hailed as a rare archeological treasure, linking the Northumbrian island with the Vikings around the time of the AD793 raids that heralded three centuries of destruction and occupation. Protected Indigenous lands could be subject to commercial mining under a controversial new bill from Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro. The far-right leader has long alleged that Indigenous land ownership has held back economic development. The FBI has warned that Chinese theft of corporate intellectual property constitutes the biggest law enforcement threat to the US, with one agency director alleging trade secrets worth \u201c$300bn to $600bn\u201d a year are being stolen. Christina Koch has returned to Earth after 328 days aboard the International Space Station, hoping her protracted mission can help promote gender equity within a traditionally male-dominated field. Recommended reads With the election of a new leader, Adam Bandt, for the first time in the Australian Greens\u2019 history, its leader will sit in the House of Representatives, not the Senate.

Listen They\u2019re the characters that make us fall in love with TV shows \u2013 so why do writers keep killing them off? Continuing Guardian Australia\u2019s focus on unforgettable moments in Australian TV, on this episode of Full Story, Laura Murphy-Oates discusses with our culture editor, Steph Harmon, why fictional deaths move us so much.

Former coach Pep Guardiola\u2019s presence at Manchester City makes the English club a likely suitor, after a situation that, as Sid Lowe explains, grows more untenable by the week.

Media roundup Barnaby Joyce has warned Scott Morrison that a rebel group within the Nationals could block Coalition legislation as payback for leader Michael McCormack\u2019s failure to promote any of Joyce\u2019s supporters, the Australian is reporting. The coronavirus has stopped a Hong Kong-based company from taking out an $880m share in James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts, claims the Financial Review, due to a predicted downturn in Asian tourism.

      "bodyText": "A whistleblowing Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak has died, a Communist party-controlled newspaper has confirmed. Li Wenliang, 34, was declared dead at 2.58am local time on Friday morning after \u201cemergency treatment\u201d at a hospital in Wuhan, the Global Times reported, following hours of confusion over his fate. Earlier reports of Li\u2019s death had triggered an outpouring of grief and anger on Chinese social media, with many hailing his decision to speak out over the virus despite the risks of doing so in his authoritarian country. The Global Times was among the heavily controlled state-run newspapers that stepped back from their initial reports of the ophthalmologist\u2018s death on Thursday. \u201cWe profoundly regret and mourn this death,\u201d the Wuhan City central hospital said in a brief statement on its official social media account. Chinese police had targeted Li for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d in late December 2019 after he posted a warning on social media about a cluster of cases of a flu-like disease that had been treated at his hospital. Seven patients were in quarantine and the disease symptoms reminded him of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), he said. He urged colleagues to wear protective clothing at work. Four days later he was summoned to the local public security bureau, accused of \u201cmaking false comments\u201d and disturbing the social order. He was told that if he continued to talk about the disease, he would be \u201cbrought to justice\u201d. Li was one of eight people authorities targeted for \u201csharing false information\u201d, in a heavy-handed approach that China\u2019s supreme court later criticised. He agreed not to discuss his concerns in public again. But in early January he treated a woman with glaucoma without realising she was also a coronavirus patient; he appears to have been infected during the operation. On 10 January, when China was still insisting there had been no new cases for a week, he started coughing then developed a fever. Two days later he was in hospital; his parents also fell ill. Li broke his silence to give interviews from his hospital bed. \u201cIf the officials had disclosed information about the epidemic earlier, I think it would have been a lot better. There should be more openness and transparency,\u201d he told the New York Times. The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China reached 563 on Thursday, as health experts prepared to meet in Geneva next week in an attempt to develop a vaccine. Chinese authorities said the death toll had risen by 73 in the previous 24 hours \u2013 the third record daily rise in a row \u2013 with 70 of the deaths recorded in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. There are more than 28,000 cases in China, according to health officials. The youngest patient is a baby born on Saturday in Wuhan and confirmed positive just 36 hours after birth. The baby was immediately separated from the mother after the birth. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, said on Thursday that while it was too early to say that China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak was peaking, Wednesday was the first day that the overall number of new cases in China had dropped. WHO official Mike Ryan said there had been a constant increase in cases in Hubei province but that had not been seen in other provinces. In Wuhan, the largest city in Hubei, hospitals were struggling to find enough beds for patients. A 1,500-bed hospital opened on Thursday, just days after a 1,000-bed hospital with prefabricated wards and isolation rooms began taking patients, but senior officials said the city of 11 million was close to capacity with only 8,254 beds for 8,182 coronavirus patients. Outside mainland China, at least 230 cases have been confirmed, including two deaths, one in Hong Kong and another in the Philippines. On Thursday the UK confirmed a third case, while Japan confirmed another 10 infections among 3,700 passengers and crew stuck onboard the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship moored off the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo. The 10 new cases involved four people from Japan, two each from the US and Canada, and one each from New Zealand and Taiwan, the health ministry said, adding that five were in their 70s, four in their 60s and one in their 50s. Japanese health officials now have the results of 102 tests conducted on 273 passengers and crew who complained of feeling unwell or had been in close contact with a man in his 80s who disembarked late last month and tested positive on his return home to Hong Kong. TV footage showed the vessel arriving at Yokohama port to take on food and other supplies and hand over the infected patients, who are being treated at hospitals in the Yokohama area. Port officials could be seen dressed in white full-body protective suits, face masks and helmets. The WHO is asking for $675m to stop the outbreak. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, acknowledged that the sum was large, but said it was \u201cmuch less than the bill we will face if we do not invest in preparedness now\u201d. Li\u2019s fate has echoes of Carlo Urbani, an Italian doctor who in 2003 played a crucial role in identifying Sars and raising the international alarm, but was eventually killed by it. Working for the WHO in Hanoi, Vietnam, he was called to a hospital when a patient arrived from Hong Kong with unusual pneumonia symptoms. He recognised the disease was highly contagious, brought in strict controls and called in international health authorities. His action led to the WHO raising a worldwide alert about the disease and halted its spread in Vietnam.",

Late on Thursday, after state-controlled media outlets reported that he had died days earlier, the news was met with an extraordinary nationwide outpouring of grief and anger on social media. The response was an indication of how powerfully his story had resonated around the country as hundreds of millions of people faced the threat of a new disease, of still unknown lethality. Li tried to warn fellow doctors in the early days of the outbreak, posting a message alerting them to a mystery new disease at his hospital in late December.

      "bodyText": "Melco Resorts, the casino group controlled by the Hong Kong magnate Lawrence Ho, says it has abandoned its plans to buy shares in James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts because of the coronavirus outbreak. The move, which leaves Melco with its existing 10% stake in Crown, comes as the former New South Wales supreme court judge Patricia Bergin prepares for public hearings into Crown that are set to investigate the original Melco deal. In May last year Melco agreed to buy almost 20% of Crown from the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, Packer, in a transaction spread across two tranches. The first 10% was transferred in July but in August Ho and Packer pressed pause on the transfer of the remaining shares until after the end of the Bergin inquiry, which was prompted by a series of media reports making allegations including money laundering at Crown casinos and organised crime involvement in running junkets. Crown denies all the allegations. Melco\u2019s decision means it will no longer seek a seat on the Crown board, a move that will avoid scrutiny of its nominee under Australian casino regulator probity rules. According to research by the ratings agency S&amp;P, Melco faces more danger from the coronavirus outbreak than Crown because it operates casinos in the Chinese territory of Macau, a former Portuguese colony close to Hong Kong. S&amp;P said Melco \u201chas limited flexibility to absorb a prolonged and severe decline in its cash flow\u201d because it needs money to build an expansion to its Studio City casino in Macau, where casinos have been closed due to the virus. In a statement released late on Thursday, Melco said that \u201cdue to the impact of the coronavirus epidemic, including the severe drop in tourism in Asia to Integrated Resort (IR) facilities in the region, and the recent decision by the Macau SAR government to close all casinos in Macau, Melco has taken the decision to reassess all non-core investments to be made in 2020\u201d. \u201cAs a result of this decision, Melco will not pursue its planned investment in Australia for the second tranche of shares in Crown Resorts Limited. \u201cWhile Melco believes Crown has world-class assets that are complementary to its global business, it is Melco\u2019s belief that, at this time, its capital needs to be deployed on its core assets.\u201d The company said it would focus its resources on projects including extending Studio City and building its City of Dreams Mediterranean casino in Cyprus. \u201cManagement attention will remain focused on these critical areas of Melco\u2019s business until such time as operations and business throughout Asia have returned to normal,\u201d Melco said.",

Brazil\u2019s state-run news agency, Agencia Brasil, says the planes are currently in Poland waiting for clearance from Chinese authorities to continue their flight to Wuhan. The delay is reportedly the result of the high number of international repatriation missions trying to fly into the Chinese city.</p> \n  <p>Once back in Brazil those being evacuated from Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 18 days at a military base in the city of An\u00e1polis, in Brazil\u2019s midwest. According to the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, Argentina has asked Brazil for help in evacuating 15 of its citizens.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e3c659f8f08e1332473e81d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-06T19:35:27.446Z\">7.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague Mario Koran in Oakland reports that four of the 167 passengers aboard a quarantine flight from Wuhan to a Marine Corps air station near San Diego were sent to local hospitals shortly after their plane touched down yesterday morning. <br></p> \n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/health/story/2020-02-05/coronavirus-quarantine-starts-in-san-diego\">San Diego Union-Tribune said </a>that none of the American citizens returning to the US showed any symptoms when they boarded the flight, but medical screenings done after their arrival revealed that four people (three adults and one child) showed symptoms that may have been caused by the coronavirus that has caused 25,000 people worldwide to fall ill and killed nearly 500 in China. </p> \n  <p>So far there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus infection among the passengers; the most recent tally of confirmed cases includes six in California and 11 nationwide. <br></p> \n  <p>The San Diego air station is one of three military bases in California being used as a quarantine site. Three additional bases outside California are also designated quarantine locations. <br></p> \n  <p>While the common flu remains a more significant threat to public health in the United States, the novel nature of the coronavirus has fuelled global attention, writes the Union-Tribune. <br></p> \n  <p>Earlier this week, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/coronavirus-us-quarantine-travel-ban-response\">Guardian reported</a> that experts are warning the travel restrictions issued by the Trump administration and quarantine of roughly 200 people in California \u2014 the first mass quarantine in the US in more than 50 years \u2014 may backfire. <br></p> \n  <p>A quarantine can be counterproductive if it appears to be overly strict and broad and diminishes the public\u2019s trust in authorities, one expert told Sam Levin, adding that the government should use the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d options available and not \u201climit people\u2019s rights and liberty to a greater extent than is necessary\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWe should do the utmost to protect public health.

Early reports of the death of Li Wenliang were retracted, only for the doctor to succumb later in the day - More than 28,000 people have now contracted the virus. The vast majority of cases are in China. Chinese state television today reported the death toll to have risen by 69 to 618 people. All deaths from the virus have so far been in mainland China with the exception of one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. - The number of cases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, is now 22,112 - President Xi Jinping declared a \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d against the virus as companies worldwide warned of the impact on business - Two docked cruise ships with thousands of passengers and crew members remained under 14-day quarantines in Hong Kong and Japan. Japan reported 10 more infections among passengers aboard the luxury cruise liner Diamond Princess, which is quarantined outside Yokohama - Hospitals in Wuhan said they were struggling to find enough beds for thousands of newly infected patients - There were warnings that Hong Kong\u2019s economy risked being plunged deeper into recession as the virus wrought havoc in the territory, with consumers panic-buying staple goods and airlines stopping flights - China\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, warned against \u201crumours and panic\u201d and called on the UK government to support. It is understood that police officers were used to seal off a section of the hospital in Derry tonight where a suspected case of coronavirus is being investigated. A mother and baby have been put into quarantine where they have been tested for symptoms of the virus. The hospital however remains open to all other patients with no one being discouraged to turn up to Altnagelvin. An Italian citizen has tested positive for coronavirus. The 29-year-old man was among the 56 Italians repatriated from Wuhan on Monday and quarantined at a military facility near Rome. Italy\u2019s higher health council confirmed that the man had tested positive for the virus and is being treated at Rome\u2019s Lazzaro Spallanzani institute for infectious diseases. This is the third confirmed coronavirus case in Italy. A Chinese couple, who arrived in Italy on 23 January, are also being treated at the Spallanzani hospital. An investigation at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, Northern Ireland, is under way tonight over a suspected case of coronavirus involving a mother and baby. It is understood that the mother and child recently returned to the city from Hong Kong and reported to Derry\u2019s main hospital A&amp;E department earlier today. Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Health Agency said they \u201care not commenting on individual cases at the moment\u201d. A spokesperson for the PHA said no cases had yet been diagnosed in Northern Ireland. As millions of Brazilians prepare to take to the streets for their country\u2019s annual carnival, Brazil\u2019s health minister has said his country currently has no specific plans for a coronavirus awareness campaign. But Luiz Henrique Mandetta has called on Brazilian revellers to exercise \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d when the festivities kick off later this month. \u201cWhat we are suggesting is respiratory etiquette,\u201d he told reporters, according to the Valor Econ\u00f4mico newspaper, Brazil\u2019s answer to the FT. \u201cWash your hands several times a day; if you sneeze, put your elbow out in front.\u201d So far there have been no confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil, but health authorities are preparing themselves for its arrival. On what has been a day of fast-moving developments, here is a round-up of the key events from the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Boseley, Denis Campbell and Simon Murphy. My colleague Emma Graham-Harrison has written this profile of Li Wenliang and his role in raising the alarm about coronavirus. The whistleblowing Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak died in the early hours of Friday, a Communist party-controlled newspaper has now confirmed. Li Wenliang, 34, was declared dead at 2.58am on Friday after \u201cemergency treatment\u201d at a hospital in Wuhan, the Global Times reported, following hours of confusion over the ill doctor\u2019s fate. Earlier reports of his death had triggered an outpouring of grief and anger in Chinese social media, with many hailing Li\u2019s decision to speak out over the virus despite the risks of doing so in his authoritarian country. The Global Times was among the heavily controlled state-run newspapers that stepped back from their initial reports of the ophthalmologist\u2018s death on Thursday. \u201cWe profoundly regret and mourn this death,\u201d the Wuhan City central hospital said in a brief statement on its official social media account. Tom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent, reports that two Brazilian air force jets are on their way to China to rescue a group of about 34 Brazilian citizens from the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. Brazil\u2019s state-run news agency, Agencia Brasil, says the planes are currently in Poland waiting for clearance from Chinese authorities to continue their flight to Wuhan. The delay is reportedly the result of the high number of international repatriation missions trying to fly into the Chinese city. Once back in Brazil those being evacuated from Wuhan will be placed in quarantine for 18 days at a military base in the city of An\u00e1polis, in Brazil\u2019s midwest. According to the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, Argentina has asked Brazil for help in evacuating 15 of its citizens. My colleague Mario Koran in Oakland reports that four of the 167 passengers aboard a quarantine flight from Wuhan to a Marine Corps air station near San Diego were sent to local hospitals shortly after their plane touched down yesterday morning. The San Diego Union-Tribune said that none of the American citizens returning to the US showed any symptoms when they boarded the flight, but medical screenings done after their arrival revealed that four people (three adults and one child) showed symptoms that may have been caused by the coronavirus that has caused 25,000 people worldwide to fall ill and killed nearly 500 in China. So far there have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus infection among the passengers; the most recent tally of confirmed cases includes six in California and 11 nationwide. The San Diego air station is one of three military bases in California being used as a quarantine site. Three additional bases outside California are also designated quarantine locations. While the common flu remains a more significant threat to public health in the United States, the novel nature of the coronavirus has fuelled global attention, writes the Union-Tribune. Earlier this week, the Guardian reported that experts are warning the travel restrictions issued by the Trump administration and quarantine of roughly 200 people in California \u2014 the first mass quarantine in the US in more than 50 years \u2014 may backfire. A quarantine can be counterproductive if it appears to be overly strict and broad and diminishes the public\u2019s trust in authorities, one expert told Sam Levin, adding that the government should use the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d options available and not \u201climit people\u2019s rights and liberty to a greater extent than is necessary\u201d. \u201cWe should do the utmost to protect public health. But we have to make sure the measures we\u2019re implementing aren\u2019t worse than the virus itself,\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo, the senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Levin. Good evening all. Hannah Mays here signing on. We have now updated our piece on Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about coronavirus and later contracted the disease. State media said earlier today that he had died, before backtracking on those reports. Travellers who have returned to the UK from a series of Asian countries in the last two weeks and are showing coronavirus symptoms should self-isolate and seek medical advice over the phone, the country\u2019s chief medical officer has warned in updated advice. People who have returned from locations including mainland China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia or Macau and are experiencing a cough, shortness of breath or fever are being advised to stay indoors and contact NHS 111. The Government advice says: \u201cThe UK chief medical officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and is experiencing cough or fever or shortness of breath, to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if symptoms are mild. \u201cThese countries have been identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases. This list will be kept under review.\u201d The circumstances of how or where the British national caught coronavirus in Singapore remain unknown. However, it does follow concerns being raised about at least three Asian businessmen catching the disease after attending a meeting of more than 100 international delegates at a hotel in the country. Other attendees are also showing symptoms of the disease, according to Reuters. The first British national has tested positive for coronavirus after travelling back to the UK from Singapore, according to government sources. It emerged earlier that a third case of the disease had been confirmed in the UK but England\u2019s chief medical officer refused to disclose the patient\u2019s nationality or specify which country in Asia they caught the disease. But the Guardian understands that the individual is British and contracted the coronavirus in Singapore. It comes after Downing Street indicated the patient was British, with a spokesman saying earlier they \u201cbelieved they are, yes\u201d. It follows an unnamed Chinese student from York University and his mother being diagnosed with the disease this week. The pair are being treated in Newcastle. There is now confusion surrounding earlier reports that Li Wenliang, the Chinese doctor who tried to raise the alarm about the coronavirus outbreak, had died. A Communist party-controlled newspaper, the Global Times, reported that Li had died earlier today \u2013 prompting outrage among many Chinese citizens. But the state-run newspaper subsequently deleted the report from its official Twitter account and has now claimed Li is still alive. \u201cLi Wenliang is currently in critical condition,\u201d the Global Times claimed in the early hours of Friday, local time. \u201cHis heart reportedly stopped beating at around 21:30. He was then given treatment with ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation],\u201d it added. A post on the official Weibo account of the hospital where Li was reportedly being treated also said he was \u201ccurrently in critical condition\u201d. The Department of Health and Social Care is yet to release its list of Asian countries where it is now advising people who have travelled to and developed symptoms on their return to the UK to immediately self-isolate and call NHS 111 for advice. Asked by the Guardian, the department says it is aiming to do so this evening. The list could include Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Cambodia, Philippines, Thailand, Nepal and Sri Lanka, where cases of coronavirus have been confirmed. According to the latest World Health Organzation figures, Japan, Thailand and Singapore all have the most number of cases in Asia outside China. Asked by the Guardian earlier whether the third confirmed case of coronavirus in the UK related to a British national, England\u2019s chief medical officer remained tight-lipped. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re all doctors, we have a pretty strong view on this and we\u2019re not going to do anything that\u2019s in any way going to identify people ... once you start, you don\u2019t stop,\u201d Prof Chris Whitty said. He was also challenged by another journalist who argued it was in the public interest to name the country in Asia where the patient had contracted the disease. Whitty replied: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the public interest is obviously for us to release the list of countries where we think there is actually potentially slightly greater risk than the rest of the world. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be doing later today.\u201d It\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the live blog after hot-footing it back from the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s press conference, at which England\u2019s chief medical officer revealed that the third person to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK caught the disease outside of China. Prof Chris Whitty also said the government was now advising people who had travelled to a number of as yet unspecified Asian countries and had returned to the UK and developed symptoms to immediately self-isolate and call NHS 111 for advice. Anyone displaying symptoms will be tested for the disease. The advice previously only related to those returning from Wuhan. Whitty said: \u201cWe knew this ratchet-up might well happen and this is the moment where we feel it\u2019s prudent, getting ahead of the epidemiology, to make this shift.\u201d He added: What we have got is a situation where very high risk remains in Wuhan and Hubei, a high risk in the rest of China, but much lower than in Wuhan and Hubei and then a much smaller risk in a number of countries, and unsurprisingly countries where the greatest risk is in terms of new cases are the ones which have the greatest international traffic with China, and that is exactly as you would expect.\u201d The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Dr Mike Ryan, the executive director of WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, answered some questions from the press. When asked to comment on the doctors and nurses striking in Hong Kong to protest the government\u2019s decision not to close its borders with mainland China, Ghebreyesus said: \u201cThis is a time of solidarity. There is a common enemy now. A very unknown virus. And I advise all of us to focus on the virus \u2013 the common enemy. \u201cI can understand the pressure on health workers and that\u2019s why Mike said they\u2019re the heroes. I fully agree and I want them to continue being like that.\u201d When asked if the world was nearing the peak of the outbreak, Ghebreyesus said: \u201cIt\u2019s too early right now to make predictions on numbers, although we are pleased it is the first day in which the overall numbers of new confirmed cases reported in China have dropped.\u201d He added: \u201cWe are still in the middle of an intense outbreak and we need to be very careful on making any predictions.\u201d The WHO press conference on the coronavirus has ended. Here are some key takeaways: As of 0500 GMT today, there are 28,060 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in China and 564 deaths. Outside China, there are 225 cases in 24 countries and one death. WHO is asking for $675m to stop the outbreak. The organisation doesn\u2019t know the source of the outbreak, doesn\u2019t know what its natural reservoir is, nor does it properly understand its transmissibility or severity. There is also no vaccine to prevent infections nor antibiotics to treat patients. In the meantime, there are simple things everyone can do \u2013 such as washing hands regularly and covering your nose or your mouth with your elbow when you sneeze or cough \u2013 to help contain the outbreak. WHO called on countries to invest in prevention and research. The World Health Organization is bringing together global scientists to tackle the coronavirus. On 11 and 12 February the WHO is convening a global research and innovation forum to identify research priorities and coordinate an international effort into developing vaccines and medicines for the disease. WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced the event at a press conference on Thursday: \u201cWe\u2019re shadow boxing, we need to bring this virus out into the light so we can attack it properly.\u201d He also announced that Japan has donated $10m USD to go towards tackling the outbreak. The third person to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK contracted the disease outside of China, it has emerged. The patient, who it is understood was diagnosed in Brighton but is being transferred to a London hospital, did not contract the disease in the UK or mainland China but another country in Asia. The details have been confirmed by England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, who refused to disclose whether the individual was a British national or which specific country they contracted the disease in. Speaking about the new case, Whitty said: The person who caught this did not catch it in China, they caught it elsewhere in Asia. That\u2019s an important point from an epidemiological point of view because [...] there is now evidence of some limited transmission in a number of Asian countries. NHS doctors are being advised to widen the pool of countries to look out for returning individuals who display symptoms. Whitty explained: \u201cIf a doctor in the NHS sees a patient who has travelled from Asia, now they will start thinking about testing from a wider geographical area than would have been the case before. So we are shifting geography for NHS doctors to test.\u201d The countries will be confirmed later on Thursday. The Chinese doctor who tried to warn other medics about the coronavirus has been reported dead after contracting the infection in Wuhan. According to local media, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, died from the virus on Thursday. Li was summoned by police when he tried to warn others about the virus in December. He sent a message to fellow medics in a group chat on 30 December, and days later was summoned to the Public Security Bureau to sign a letter in which he was accused of making \u201cfalse comments\u201d. Li was one of eight people being investigated by police for \u201crumour-mongering\u201d. A virus expert has said it is \u201cnot surprising\u201d that a third case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the UK, as the infection has spread across China and could infect more people returning from the country. Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said: It isn\u2019t surprising that a third case has been identified. Whilst most infections are focused in Wuhan and the Hubei province, the virus has spread to all regions of China and therefore the likelihood of someone returning or visiting the UK with an infection has been real. He said the overall number of infections in the UK was still low and crucially therehad not been any significant human-to-human transmission. He added: We are at a key juncture in this outbreak and it is difficult to tell if the control efforts in China will be enough to bring this outbreak to an end. If not, we can expect to see the virus cropping up in many parts of the world, including here. Meanwhile, Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, said: The important thing is that it did not arise within the country. It didn\u2019t come from the two cases that are already here but came from outside. It has been identified quickly, it has been isolated, and in all probability, it will not lead to any further cases generally. Two more coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 30. One of the new patients is a close contact of one of those previously confirmed to have the virus, while the other has no recent travel history to mainland China and does not appear to be linked with previous cases, the Straits Times reports. The previously confirmed cases were all either Chinese nationals from Hubei, or individuals with links to travellers who are Chinese nationals. All UK hospitals have been told to prepare secure coronavirus zones to \u201cavoid a surge\u201d in emergency departments, a leaked NHS letter has shown. The letter, dated 31 January, tells hospitals to set up \u201ccoronavirus priority assessment pods\u201d, which can be decontaminated after each use. All chief executives and medical directors are instructed to have the pods up and running by Friday 7 February. Prof Keith Willett, who is leading the NHS\u2019s response to coronavirus, told NHS bosses in the letter: \u201cPlans have been developed to avoid a surge in emergency departments due to coronavirus. Although the risk level in this country remains moderate, and so far there have been only two confirmed cases, the NHS is putting in place appropriate measures to ensure business as usual services remain unaffected by any further cases or tests of coronavirus. Trusts are being asked to organise a coronavirus priority assessment pod, which will mean people with symptoms indicative of infection will get quick assessment, while other patients also continue to get appropriate care.\u201d Since the letter was written a third coronavirus case has been confirmed in the UK. A third person in the UK has tested positive for the coronavirus, it has been confirmed. The patient was diagnosed in Brighton, the Guardian understands, and is being transferred to an infectious diseases unit in a London hospital. Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said: A further patient has tested positive for coronavirus bringing the total number of cases in the UK to three. The individual did not acquire this in the UK. The patient is being transferred to a specialist NHS centre, and we are using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus. The NHS is well prepared to manage these cases and we are now working quickly to identify any contacts the patient has had. There have been two other confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK - an unnamed Chinese student from York University and his mother, who are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. The University of York has said the student confirmed to have contracted the virus did not come into contact with other students. China is not prepared for the scale of the coronavirus outbreak it is facing, but has mobilised the entire country to tackle the epidemic, Beijing\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, has said. Answering questions from the media this morning, Liu said: I can\u2019t say China is prepared for this outbreak, we don\u2019t have enough beds or hospitals. That\u2019s why we have built two emergency hospitals in just ten days. He added that the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had held a meeting yesterday in which he had instructed medical personnel to work \u201caround the clock\u201d to treat patients. Liu said he could understand the complaints of some residents in locked-down Wuhan, but said it would take some time for them to understand the urgency of the situation. He offered reassurances that all residents\u2019 basic necessities were being provided for. He stressed the rest of China was not in the same locked-down state as the Hubei province, but said some local authorities might have overreacted in their responses to the outbreak. Finally, he said that communication between Xi and Boris Johnson was good, contrary to reports this morning which suggested there were concerns the prime minister had not sent a personal message of support over the coronavirus outbreak. The Chinese ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, warned against \u201crumours and panic\u201d and called on the UK government to support to support China in its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. It is of hope that governments of all countries, including the UK, should understand and support China\u2019s efforts, avoid overreaction, avoid creating panic, and ensure normal cooperation and exchanges between countries. Some [media] reports are biased and even maintain malicious slander and disinformation. Rumours and panic are more frightening than the virus itself. He defended China\u2019s handling of the outbreak, saying the country had been \u201copen, transparent and responsible with its cooperation with the world\u201d. He emphasised that any impact on China\u2019s economy would be temporary and said the country disapproved of some travel and trade restrictions that had been imposed by other nations. Finally he condemned \u201cinsulting and discriminatory behaviour targeting the overseas Chinese community\u201d fed by panic over the virus. Virgin Atlantic has extended the suspension of its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai due to the coronavirus until 28 March. A spokesman for the airline said: We continue to monitor the coronavirus situation very carefully, including the latest guidance from the World Health Organization and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), which on Tuesday issued new guidance to UK citizens to leave China if they are able to do so. Given this new FCO advice, the increasing entry restrictions on recent visitors to mainland China, and our rigorous focus on safety, Virgin Atlantic has opted to extend the suspension of Heathrow-Shanghai operations until 28 March 2020. They said all passengers booked to travel would receive the option of a refund. They should contact the customer care team via their SMS messaging system on +44 (0)7481 339184. Countries across the globe, including the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, continue to impose travel restrictions to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Saudi Arabia has announced it is banning its citizens from visiting China, and said expatriates will not be allowed to return to the country if they violate the travel restriction. The kingdom\u2019s General Directorate of Passports also said regulatory provisions on travel documents would be applied to citizens who travel to the coronavirus-hit country. The US is temporarily barring entry to foreign nationals who have travelled to China within the last 14 days, while Japan is refusing entry to foreign nationals who have been to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak, within the past fortnight. More than 140 Russians have been evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, to a medical facility in Siberia guarded by members of Russia\u2019s National Guard. Inside, many have taken to Instagram to blog their time in quarantine, snapping photos of their dinner and exercise routines. Pavel Lichman, a model who was evacuated from Wuhan, told the Guardian: The quarantine is pretty hands-off and easy. The only thing is that we\u2019re not allowed to come into contact with the people who are in the neighbouring rooms. We don\u2019t leave our rooms. They bring us food. Doctors come in to test us: check our temperatures, inspect our throats, and measure the amount of oxygen in our blood. If the evacuees leave their rooms, doctors warned, the two-week countdown starts again. In the other rooms, Russians took stock of the bizarre turn of events and planned out their time in lockdown. \u201cPlans for the next two weeks,\u201d one young woman wrote, while firing up a Netflix documentary about the rapper Travis Scott. Another modelled her striped pyjamas on a balcony overlooking a snowy forest of birch. Student Marina Zaitseva was visiting Wuhan when the outbreak occurred. In an interview with the Fontanka.ru website, she described a difficult evacuation from China aboard a military plane with little idea of where they were headed. When they arrived at the medical facility, they were told to give up their clothing for disinfecting. She said: In the hall we were met by people not just in masks, but in full bodysuits. They met us as though we were radiating this virus. The US is continuing to fly hundreds of its citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, in what it anticipates to be the last of its chartered flights. On Wednesday, two planes flew 350 citizens back to an air force base in California, and two more flights will arrive from Wuhan this week. The US does not anticipate any further chartered flights after this. Other countries are also airlifting their nationals from the area, including Singapore, which is arranging a second evacuation flight for later this week. The Britons who were evacuated from Wuhan last week have been told they can leave the quarantine facility in the Wirral next Thursday. Matt Raw, who was one of 83 British nationals airlifted out of Wuhan on the first evacuation flight, received the news last night: We have just been advised that we are permitted to leave here on Thursday 13 February. We\u2019ve basically done half our time and as long as the status quo remains and nobody gets sick, then we should be able to leave in a week\u2019s time from now. It\u2019s excellent news to have an end date in sight. Another 11 Britons were evacuated on a French-chartered flight on Sunday, after many failed to make it to the airport in time for the first flight. They are being kept in quarantine separately from those on the first. Chinese officials are reportedly \u201cconcerned\u201d that Boris Johnson has not yet sent a personal message of support to the country over the coronavirus outbreak. Stanley Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s father, met the Chinese ambassador Liu Xiaoming on Tuesday, and reported back to UK officials \u2013 and accidentally copied in the BBC. The email, to the environment minister Zac Goldsmith and other UK officials, said: Re the outbreak of coronavirus, Mr Liu obviously was concerned that there had not yet \u2013 so he asserted \u2013 been direct contact between the PM and Chinese head of state or government in terms of a personal message or telephone call. A government spokesman said the UK had been in close contact with the Chinese authorities since the outbreak. A former special adviser to the World Health Organization has said he thinks researchers are \u201cweeks away\u201d from testing a coronavirus vaccine on animals, but it could be months before human trials. Speaking on Sky News this morning, David Harper said: \u201cThe researchers around the world are working very hard. \u201cWe feel that we\u2019re within a matter of weeks of the animal tests that are necessary before we go into the trials of the vaccine in humans, which could take some months of course, but still very much shorter than we would normally expect for a vaccine of this type.\u201d A former World Health Organization official who helped lead the response to SARS has said \u201cthe full potential\u201d of the coronavirus is not yet known. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, David Heyman, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene, said: The full potential of this virus is not yet known. Will this virus become a virus which is endemic in humans and continue to transmit in the coming years? We don\u2019t understand the spectrum of the disease. We don\u2019t know how many infections are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms like cold, so it is impossible to identify all cases. He said the disease is spread via droplets, when people are in a close enough area that they can cough on each other, and there is no evidence to suggest it is transmissible over longer distances. A British man who is among 3,700 people under a coronavirus quarantine on a cruise ship in Japan has voiced concerns over ongoing monitoring for the disease on board. David Abel, from Northamptonshire, has praised Princess Cruises for its handling of the situation so far, but said fears remain about efforts to fight the disease on the ship. \u201cWhat health checks have we had in the last three or four days, or since the health check when the quarantine officers came on board? None whatsoever,\u201d Abel said in a Facebook video post. There has been no health check, so we do not know whether there are people on board still who have got symptoms that may have the virus. We do not know. So I am now getting a fraction concerned about the health checks that I believe should be taking place, because if there are more infected people on board they should be taken off. We want a virus-free ship. Health workers in the port city of Yokohama said on Thursday that 10 more people on the Diamond Princess had tested positive to the disease, in addition to 10 others on Wednesday when the ship was first isolated. Those 20 people are receiving treatment at nearby hospitals while the remaining passengers are confined to their cabins. Abel, who along with his wife are believed to be the only two Britons on board, added: \u201cAnd what happens when we finally get back to the UK? Are we going to be put in quarantine yet again for another 14 days?\u201d It is thought the Foreign Office has offered support, but is letting cruise ship staff manage the situation. China has announced it will halve tariffs on $75bn worth of US goods, as the country\u2019s economy comes under additional pressure amid the coronavirus outbreak. Tariffs on some goods will be cut from to from 10% to 5%, and from 5% to 2.5% on others. The announcement is part of a partial resolution of the long-running trade war between the US and China agreed last month, and the US will also roll back some tariffs as part of the agreement. The cuts will take effect on 14 February, but tariffs will remain on $35bn worth of US goods. China\u2019s economy has suffered as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, with factories across the country closed and its manufacturing sector seeing a drop in production. This is Jessica Murray taking over from Alison to track the latest developments with the coronavirus outbreak throughout the day. Global health experts have warned that \u201chidden\u201d coronavirus cases mean that we could just be seeing the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. Tom Frieden, a former director at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there could be \u201cvastly more cases\u201d than previously thought. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that containment is very unlikely,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t worth giving up, but trying to contain Wuhan coronavirus like Sars and Mers is very unlikely, just because of the number of cases and the number of [Chinese] provinces and the ease with which it is ease spreading in families.\u201d He added: It\u2019s a fog of war reality, which is what makes me suspect that what are seeing is the tip of the iceberg. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far today about the spread of the coronavirus. China\u2019s death toll grew to 563, with 28,018 confirmed cases Ten more people have been diagnosed with the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, moored at Yokohama in Japan Canada has told its citizens to leave China by commercial means if their presence in the country is \u201cnot essential\u201d Taiwan has banned all international cruise ships from docking Adidas has closed China stores over virus outbreak Virgin Australia has announced it will cease flying to Hong Kong Shares have risen strongly again on Asian markets Here\u2019s the latest tracker image from Johns Hopkins University on the spread of the coronavirus. If you want to check in on the tracker, you can find it here. A 28-year-old doctor in Hunan province has died after working for 10 days on the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese state media is reporting. As we have reported today, the death doll in China for the coronavirus has passed 560. You can find our latest full report on the story here. For a further exploration of why stock markets are surging ahead despite the prospect of a marked slowdown in China (see this blog post), look no further than this piece by our economics editor Larry Elliott. But he asks whether the outbreak is the kind of freakish, unforeseen event that could yet spark a global economic crisis \u2013 a \u201cblack swan\u201d event in the market parlance. Hong Kong\u2019s economy faces a deepening recession as a result of the virus outbreak. Businesses in the territory have already been hit hard by months of sometimes violent street protests that have forced shops to close and transport to shut down. The economy shrank 1.2% last year and economists at Fitch Solutions reckon it will contract by 2.6% this year with the vital retail sector brought ot its knees as the lucrative flow of Chinese tourists dries up thanks to the government\u2019s new quarantine rules and airlines suspend flights in and out. The sense of crisis has been heightened by panic buying in shops and supermarkets. Read my full report here: China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily is reporting the drug Remdesivir is \u201cofficially\u201d in clinical trial stage on coronavirus patients in Wuhan\u2019s Jinyintan hospital. \u201cThe trial will include 453 critically ill patients and 308 with less severe symptoms, a medical expert said,\u201d the China Daily reported. A couple of Canadian readers in China have got in touch with me to say the Canadian consular service in Beijing is advising Canadians to leave China at their own cost if their presence is not essential. \u201cPlease note that the Travel Advice and Advisory for China has recently been updated to indicate: If your presence in China isn\u2019t essential, you should consider leaving by commercial means,\u201d the advisory says, dated 6 February. The government previously chartered a flight from Wuhan to Canada for Canadian citizens looking to return to Canada. The coronavirus is having a significant impact on sports events. Last week the Chinese Football Association cancelled all domestic games at all levels. Many other events are also being affected: Athletics: The World Athletics Indoor Championships, which had been scheduled for Nanjing from March 13-15, were postponed until next year The Asian Athletics Association cancelled its 12-13 February indoor championships in Hangzhou. Football: Asian Champions League matches involving Chinese clubs Guangzhou Evergrande, Shanghai Shenhua and Shanghai SIPG have been postponed. Guangzhou and the Shanghai clubs will join the competition in April, with their group matches due to be played in May. Shanghai Shenhua and Shanghai SIPG were due to play away at Perth Glory and Sydney FC but Australian officials sought to reschedule matches after their government imposed a travel ban on foreign nationals arriving from China. A four-team women\u2019s Olympic qualifying tournament involving China, Australia, Taiwan and Thailand was moved from Wuhan and rearranged to be held in Australia by the AFC. Vietnam\u2019s government said it would not allow the country to host sporting events in February, meaning home AFC Cup group stage matches for Ho Chi Minh City and Than Quang Ninh will have to be switched to away fixtures. Ho Chi Minh City will now face Yangon United in Myanmar on 11 February while Than Quang Ninh meet Ceres Negros on 25 February in the Philippines. Car racing: The all-electric Formula E motor racing series abandoned plans for a race in Sanya on 21 March. The move puts Formula One in the spotlight, with Shanghai due to host the Chinese Grand Prix on 19 April, now looking in doubt. Badminton: The China Masters tournament in Hainan due to take place 25 February-1 March, was postponed after several players withdrew. The BWF said it hoped the flagship Badminton Asia Championships could still go ahead in Wuhan from 21-26 April. Boxing The International Olympic Committee announced Jordan as hosts of the boxing qualifiers for Asia and Oceania after an event in Wuhan was cancelled. It will now take place in Amman, 3-11 March. Basketball The International Basketball Federation moved the 6-9 February Tokyo Olympics qualifiers to be held in Foshan to Belgrade. The FIBA Asia Cup 2021 qualifying match between China and Malaysia, to be held in Foshan on 24 February, will be rescheduled. Golf The elite women\u2019s LPGA golf tour cancelled the 5-8 March Blue Bay tournament to be held on Hainan. The PGA Tour Series-China moved its 25-28 February global qualifying tournament to Lagoi, Indonesia, from Haikou. Stock markets continue to shrug off the deepening crisis with the Nikkei up a whopping 2.6% with less than an hour of trading to go while Seoul had also gained a healthy 2.55%. Hong Kong was even better, up 2.71%, and Shanghai was up 1.3%. In Sydney, the Australian bourse rallying to its second highest close of all time. The ASX200 was paused at 7,047 points, a rise of 1% on the day and only 43 points off the record high set back in January. Nguyen Trinh, senior economist for emerging Asia at the investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, said investors were obviously expecting that the disruption seen across China would be temporary and that the policy response by China and Asian central banks would be enough to inject into markets much-needed liquidity. However, she noted that commodities had seen a more turbulent few weeks with oil, for example, down more than 10% for the year. She said: The commodity market is much more aggressive in pricing in a reduction of activity with iron ore, copper, oil, soy beans all dropping more than double digits. Reuters is reporting that a small town in central Canada is preparing to for the arrival of some 200 evacuees from Wuhan. Canada plans to fly the evacuees to the base in Trenton, Ontario, the country\u2019s main military hub for air transport, and hold them in quarantine for two weeks. The evacuees, who are expected to arrive from China on Friday, will be separated from each other and from others on the base, although family units will be kept together, the government has said. They will all stay at Yukon Lodge, a new facility on the base which resembles a small chain hotel. Individuals will only be moved to a hospital if they require acute care, said the local health authority, but local hospitals were prepared, with 21 negative-pressure rooms at four of them. \u201cI was in the military, I know how it works,\u201d said resident Joyce Aucoin, 81. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be people upset about it but once they\u2019re here and once they\u2019re settled and they see what\u2019s going on, I think it will all pass.\u201d Lynn Cao, 60, who owns a tobacco shop in the town, had been concerned about the plane arriving until she received reassuring emails from friends on the base. Cao said she was more anxious about her mother and sister, who live near the Chinese capital Beijing, and had sent them a large number of face masks to limit their chances of infection. The Chinese CGTN network has reported the criteria for patients being admitted to Wuhan\u2019s three new temporary hospitals, including at the city\u2019s international convention centre. They include: People infected with #coronavirus Clinical manifestation that is mild Patients aged 18-65 who are able to take care of themselves Patients with no respiratory diseases, no cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and no psychosis Influenza-virus tested negative The Chinese state tabloid Global Times has published a video showing police monitoring people who are not wearing face masks and telling them to go home and get their masks. The outlet is also reporting that a new laboratory has been built in five days that will have the capacity to carry out 10,000 coronavirus tests per day. In case you missed it yesterday, schools in China\u2019s financial hub of Shanghai have been ordered to stay shut until at least the end of February. Taiwan\u2019s health authority banned all international cruise ships from docking at the island from Thursday amid increasing threat of the coronavirus outbreak, after 10 more people were tested positive for the virus on a quarantined cruise liner in Japan, Reuters is reporting. Taiwan has also said it will suspend entry for all Chinese citizens who live in mainland China from Thursday. Reuters has reported that the Shanghai sports authorities have recommended the suspension of all sporting events in the city due to the coronavirus outbreak, casting further doubt on whether the Chinese Formula One Grand Prix will take place. The fourth grand prix of the season is scheduled for 19 April. The race was expected to be on the agenda at a Formula One Strategy Group meeting on Wednesday amid increasing speculation that it could join the growing list of sports events already postponed or cancelled. The Shanghai Sports General Association called on sports organisers to \u201cstrictly abide by the requirement of the Shanghai Sports Bureau to stop organising sports events during the epidemic.\u201d It said, in a statement translated by Reuters, that all sports events should be suspended \u201cuntil the epidemic is over.\u201d Some Formula One insiders hold out little hope of the race happening. I\u2019ve done a number of posts about the cruise ship in Japan, but passengers on the World Dream, quarantined in Hong Kong\u2019s Kai Tak terminal, with 3,600 people aboard, are also being screened for the virus after three passengers on a previous voyage were diagnosed with the virus. Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has announced that the Ocean and Kai Tak cruise liner terminals, will be closed. Lam has also ordered that anyone arriving from mainland China from Saturday, will be forced to face \u201ccompulsory quarantine\u201d for 14 days in Hong Kong. Associated Press have just published a list of global infections from the virus. Macau: 10 Taiwan: 11 Hong Kong: 21 Japan: 45 Singapore: 28 Thailand: 25 South Korea: 23 Australia: 14 Germany: 12 United States: 11 Malaysia: 10 Vietnam: 10 France: 6 United Arab Emirates: 5 Canada: 4 India: 3 Philippines: 3 cases, including 1 death Russia: 2 Italy: 2 Britain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Spain: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 In the United States, another 350 American evacuees from Wuhan have been placed under quarantine at two military bases in California, Reuters reports. It brings to nearly 400 the number of people subject to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s first public health quarantine in 50 years. \u201cWe are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary to try to prevent the spread here,\u201d said Dr Christopher Braden, deputy director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases. There were long queues in supermarket across Hong Kong last night, with people panic buying toilet rolls and tissues, largely due to a rumour spreading online saying China will stop manufacturing toilet paper for the next two weeks. There was also a run on vitamins, rice and packet noodles, leaving supermarket shelves empty. Adidas has announced it is closing a \u201csignificant\u201d number of its stores in China over the deadly new coronavirus, and warned it expects further impacts on its operations in the country. It follows a similar move by its US rival Nike, Agence France Presse reports. Adidas has around 500 of its own stores in China and some 11,500 outlets in franchise stores. The German sports wear giant said many of its franchise stores were also closing. \u201cWe can confirm that we are currently experiencing a negative impact on our operations in China,\u201d the statement added. \u201cHowever, at this point in time it is too early to assess the magnitude of this impact.\u201d Nike on Tuesday also said it expected the worsening outbreak of the virus to have \u201ca material impact\u201d on its Chinese business. Here are some of the pictures emerging from the operation to hospitalise infected passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The Chinese city of Nanchang, capital of Jiangxi province, will strictly monitor the entry and exit of residents from villages and residential compounds as it steps up its efforts to control the spread of a coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. The city, which has a population of 5 million people, said on its official Weibo social media account that each family should assign one member to go out once every two days, and that people running fevers must go to a medical facility. Jiangxi province is separated from the virus epicentre of Hubei by the Yangtze river. It had reported 600 infections of the coronavirus by the end of Wednesday, with no fatalities. We are getting confirmation of the nationalities of the 10 new cases of coronavirus on the stricken cruise ship on Japan. The Guardian\u2019s Tokyo correspondent, Justin McCurry, says there are four Japanese, two each from the US and Canada, and one each from New Zealand and Taiwan. Virgin Australia has announced it will cease flights from Australia to Hong Kong because the route was \u201cno longer a commercially viable\u201d Sydney-Hong Kong flights will stop on 2 March. In November, the airline announced the Melbourne-Hong Kong route would stop on 11 February. The airline said growing uncertainty over the coronavirus outbreak and the decline due to civil unrest associated with the pro-democracy protests had prompted the move. Virgin Australia Group chief commercial officer, John MacLeod said: \u201cHong Kong has continued to be a challenging market. With a decline in demand following ongoing civil unrest, and growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in the wider region, we have made the decision to withdraw services. \u201cWhile the decision to withdraw from the Hong Kong market has been a difficult one, it demonstrates our strong focus on driving greater financial discipline through our network. \u201cCurrent circumstances demonstrate that Hong Kong is no longer a commercially viable route for Virgin Australia to continue operating, however international tourism remains an important part of our strategy through our other international routes and partner airlines,\u201d MacLeod said. Still in Australia, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison has said a further 36 citizens and residents who left Wuhan on the Air New Zealand flight have now been transferred to Christmas Island, where other Australian evacuees from Wuhan are being held in quarantine for 14 days. You can read our full report on evacuees on Christmas Island below. Australia\u2019s universities are going to come under financial pressure in coming weeks when classes start but Chinese students are unable to attend due to the coronavirus crisis, ratings agency S&amp;P says. Students from mainland China are about 38% of tertiary enrolments, S&amp;P says. International students are worth $11.3bn a year in fees, so that puts as much as $4.3bn in revenue at risk. S&amp;P says universities can\u2019t easily cut costs, such as staff wages and building maintenance, to offset the potential revenue plunge. \u201cThe health crisis underscores the risks that stem from the sector\u2019s growing dependence on the lucrative international market, which has flourished against a backdrop of stagnant government funding and heavy investment in the pursuit of higher rankings,\u201d the agency said. S&amp;P also says German carmaker Volkswagen stands to take the biggest hit from factory shutdowns in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus outbreak, because it makes almost 40% of its cars and components in China. \u201cWhile the Chinese market maintains its long-term attraction for most global auto manufacturers and suppliers, recent developments may contribute to turning 2020 into an ever more challenging year for global automakers and suppliers than we originally expected,\u201d analyst Vittoria Ferraris said. One Guardian reader in Shandong province, who is a teacher, has got in touch with me to say there\u2019s confusion among UK citizens there about the British foreign office\u2019s advice to leave China if they can. \u201cMy main hesitation with leaving China is I feel I would be more likely to contract the virus whilst in transit to the UK than if I stay in my apartment and wait for things to calm down here. \u201cMy school is closed until at least the 17th of February (our classes have moved online) and I leave the apartment only for supplies and some exercise / fresh air. Whereas travelling to the UK would mean having to go on a train, tube and through at least two airports,\u201d she says. The 10 newly diagnosed Diamond Princess passengers include four Japanese nationals, the health ministry said on Thursday morning. The nationalities of the other six were not immediately available. The 10 patients comprise five people in their 70s, four in their 60s and one in his or her 50s, the ministry said. Shares have risen strongly again on Asian markets where there appears to be more confidence \u2013 helped by another strong day on Wall Street \u2013 that the economic impact of the new coronavirus will not be too damaging. The ASX200 is up 0.55% in Sydney, the Nikkei has surged 1.6% in Tokyo and Seoul has gained 1.27%. Brent crude rose $1.32 yesterday to $55.28 a barrel. On the other side of the ledger, there is more evidence of how companies are being affected by the spread of the virus. Cathay Pacific has asked its entire workforce of 27,000 to take up to three weeks of unpaid leave. It said on Tuesday that it was cutting 30% of its capacity in the coming weeks. Adidas has announced that it is shutting a \u201csignificant\u201d number of its 500 stores in China. Foxconn, which manufactures the Apple iPhone, said it had applied to the Chinese authorities to restart operations at factories in China next week but it could take one to two weeks from then to resume full production due to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reported, quoting a source with knowledge of the matter. However, a full resumption was not possible until late February due to various travel restrictions imposed to curb the virus. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has just interviewed an Australian passenger on the stranded Diamond Princess cruise liner in Yokohama, where 10 more people were diagnosed with coronavirus on the ship (in addition to 10 diagnosed on Wednesday). Vera Koslova said frustration amongst passengers was rising: \u201cThere\u2019s been no announcements made as yet by the captain to let us know that there has been more cases.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m quite patient and have a very positive attitude and know that the Australian government is trying to do everything possible as well as Japan. But, um, just getting a just a little bit more nervous now,\u201d she said. Qantas says it\u2019s suspended a union delegate for telling employees it\u2019s not safe to work on flights from China amid the coronavirus outbreak, Australian Associated Press reports (below). Qantas says an employee has been stood down for spreading misinformation about the safety of working on flights from China amid the coronavirus outbreak, but the Transport Workers\u2019 Union (TWU) says the man was simply providing advice to colleagues on their rights. The airline on Saturday announced it would suspend its two direct services to mainland China from 9 February due to travel restrictions imposed by other countries in the wake of the health crisis. A Qantas employee \u2013 who is also a delegate of the TWU \u2013 was on Sunday stood down pending an investigation. A source has told AAP the worker told other employees it was not safe to work on flights arriving from China \u2013 going against the advice of health authorities. Employees have been provided with additional safety equipment. Qantas Medical\u2019s Dr Russell Brown said the airline would never ask employees to work in unsafe conditions. \u201cThe TWU knows full well that the risk of aviation workers contracting coronavirus as a result of working on an aircraft originating from China is very low,\u201d Dr Brown said in a statement on Thursday. Just back to the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Yokohama ... the Guardian\u2019s Justin McCurry in Tokyo says health officials now have the results of 102 tests conducted on 273 passengers. A total of twenty were positive. He says the second group of patients found to have been infected will be taken to hospitals in Kanagawa prefecture, where Yokohama is located, according to the health ministry. Just while we are on Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific announced on Wednesday that all 27,000 employees would be asked to take three weeks of unpaid leave over the coming months. The CEO, Augustus Tang, said the airline was facing a crisis in the wake of the virus outbreak. \u201cI am hoping all of you will participate, from our frontline employees to our senior leaders, and share in our current challenges,\u201d Tang said in a video message posted online. Months of pro-democracy protests, including sit-ins at Hong Kong\u2019s international airport, had already taken a toll on the airline. In his video message to employees, Tang warned Cathay was experiencing \u201cone of the most difficult Chinese New Year holidays we have ever had\u201d because of the virus. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t know how long it will last,\u201d he added. \u201cWith such an uncertain outlook, preserving our cash is now the key to protecting our business.\u201d He also warned that further steps may need to be taken. The airline has already reduced its flights to the Chinese mainland by 90%. This week United Airlines announced it was suspending all flights to Hong Kong from 8-20 February, days after it cut its flights to mainland China. American airlines also announced it was suspending its flights to Hong Kong form Dallas/Fort Worth and and Los Angeles until 20 February. Given the speed at which this story is moving, keeping track of global figures for the virus is quite a challenge. The Hong Kong government has set up a tracker of cases there \u2013 you can find it here, and I have put a snapshot below, which shows 1 death, 21 confirmed cases, 154 cases hospitalised under investigation and 868 cases ruled out. Interestingly the tracker also gives a geographic location for all cases. Australian evacuees from Wuhan have arrived on Christmas Island where they will be quarantined before being allowed to return to their homes. One of our reporters, Ben Doherty, is on Christmas Island and he has filed this on the arrival of the evacuees. The national health commissions figures for China with regards to the virus have now been released and the headline figures are that as of midnight Wednesday into Thursday, there were 28,018 confirmed cases and 563 deaths in China. It says there are 24,702 suspected cases. A total of 282,813 close contacts have been traced, and 186,354 close contacts are still in medical observation. Of the deaths in the past 24 hours, of the 73 new deaths recorded, 70 were in Hubei Province, and one each in Tianjin, Heilongjiang, and Guizhou. The vast majority of new infections were also in (Hubei 2,987 out of 3,694). The Japanese broadcaster NHK is citing the health ministry saying there are 10 new cases of coronavirus on the Diamond Princess, moored off Yokohama. If the new infections are confirmed, that would bring the total number of coronavirus patients in Japan to 45, Reuters says. The ship was caught up in the global coronavirus epidemic after an 80-year-old Hong Kong man tested positive for the virus after disembarking the ship late last month. Passengers and their relatives took to social media to detail their predicament and conditions on the cruise ship. One passenger has tweeted a number of photos below. We\u2019re getting reports that another 10 people have tested positive for coronavirus onboard the cruise ship that is currently moored off Japan. On Wednesday, it was confirmed that 10 people on board the Diamond Princess had tested positive, prompting authorities to instruct all passengers to remain inside their cabins. Thousands of people on the Diamond Princess face spending the next fortnight stuck off the Japanese port of Yokohama, as officials attempt to prevent further infection. I\u2019ll bring you more details on this as soon as they come in. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me Alison Rourke. New death toll figures are beginning to emerge from Hubei on the latest death toll from the coronavirus. The province has reported 70 new deaths, taking fatalities there to 549. It also reported 2,987 new confirmed cases taking cases in Hubei to 19,665. These figures will be updated again when the national total is announced, but for the moment that brings the the death toll in China to 563. Total numbers of confirmed infections in China are over 28,000. Here\u2019s summary of the other key points so far: Chinese authorities say they face a \u201csevere\u201d shortage of hospital beds Global cases have been reported in 20 countries Tokyo\u2019s Olympics chief executive said organisers were \u201cextremely worried about how the virus could affect this year\u2019s games All arrivals to Hong Kong from mainland China will face \u201ccompulsory quarantine\u201d You can get up to date with all our latest coverage here and guide to how to protect yourself from the virus here.
