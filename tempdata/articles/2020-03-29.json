      "bodyText": "A group of British manufacturers will begin producing medical ventilators for the NHS this week, under the twin codenames Project Oyster and Project Penguin, after the government ordered 10,000 of the devices to treat coronavirus patients. Ventilator Challenge UK, a consortium of 14 firms including Airbus and Rolls-Royce, is expected to say that it has secured a formal order for two types of machine. The government has 8,175 ventilators but has turned to British industry to help produce 30,000 in a matter of weeks, to combat an expected surge in new cases. The engineer Dyson became the first to reveal it had signed a formal contract last week, when it announced an order for 10,000 of its CoVent prototype, which was designed in about a fortnight. While the CoVent is yet to secure final regulatory approval \u2013 and may not reach production for weeks \u2013 Ventilator Challenge UK\u2019s plans, set to be unveiled on Monday, are more advanced because they use two existing designs. One model, understood to be government clinicians\u2019 first choice, goes by the codename Project Oyster and involves slight tweaks to an existing design by a little-known Oxfordshire firm called Penlon. Production is scheduled to begin this week, with approval from the government\u2019s Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) likely to prove straightforward. A parallel effort by the same consortium, nicknamed Project Penguin, will involve scaling up production of a model made by medical equipment firm Smiths Medical at its factory in Luton. Both projects have progressed under the oversight of the MHRA, to ensure the devices meet specifications laid down by clinicians. The Ventilator Challenge UK consortium has a formal order for 10,000, matching the number that Dyson will provide if it secures regulatory approval for its CoVent prototype. But it expects to deliver many thousands more if required, harnessing the combined manufacturing muscle of firms including Airbus, Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, Ford, McLaren, GKN, Meggitt, Renishaw, Thales, Siemens and Ultra Electronics. As well as lending factory floor space and logistical know-how, the companies have redeployed some of their most skilled engineers from key company projects to work on the ventilator effort. The government has been considering at least 13 separate proposals from companies offering to plug an expected shortfall of the medical devices. No 10 said on Friday that it had narrowed the options down to seven. The shortlist includes companies proposing to design and build machines from scratch, such as the partnership between Dyson and Cambridge-based The Technology Partnership. Defence company Babcock is also building its own machine, working with an unnamed firm specialising in medical equipment. On Friday evening, a consortium of seven Formula One teams including Aston Martin, Mercedes-AMG and Renault said they were working on multiple ventilator projects, under the banner Project Pitlane. Companies that already make ventilators are also scaling up production. Breas UK, the British arm of a Swedish company, has tripled capacity and moved to a seven-day working week to increase production at its Stratford-upon-Avon site. Crawley-based Inspiration Healthcare signed a \u00a34m contract with the government to import devices from Israel and the US, although the order is understood to be for fewer than 500, likely to help bridge any gaps until new machines become available. Ventilator Challenge UK has made the fastest progress and expects to begin production this week. The arrival of the first batch could ease pressure on Boris Johnson, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, after it emerged that the government missed an opportunity to take part in four EU ventilator procurement schemes, because of a \u201ccommunications problem\u201d.",

It said a further cut could follow as it kept the rating on negative outlook.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe downgrade reflects a significant weakening of the UK\u2019s public finances caused by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and a fiscal loosening stance that was instigated before the scale of the crisis became apparent,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cThe downgrade also reflects the deep near-term damage to the UK economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak and the lingering uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit UK-EU trade relationship.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Fitch said the coronavirus shutdown was likely to shrink Britain\u2019s economy by nearly 4% in 2020, assuming the drastic containment measures could be relaxed in the second half of the year, leading to a 3% bounce in growth in 2021.

Northern Ireland has announced a wave of new restrictive measures which came into force an hour ago, including a ban on gatherings and leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Spain has announced further restrictions on movement to stem the flow of the virus, with all non-essential workers being told to stay home. Panama\u2019s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal, after passengers got stuck on board when authorities refused to grant access. The cruise ship has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said Cases in the US have passed 120,000. A letter from UK prime minister Boris Johnson will be sent to every household in Britain, warning them that the worst of the virus is yet to come. Thanks for joining me for these updates. I hope you\u2019re all staying well, wherever you\u2019re reading from. Britons stranded in New Zealand are facing costs of \u00a340,000 to return home, my colleague Mark Townsend reported. Those stranded say they have been left without guidance or assistance after the UK embassy and consular services in New Zealand abruptly closed their doors last week. Flight prices to return to the UK have hiked, with one Qatari Airlines flight from Auckland to London on 31 March priced at NZ$83,534 (\u00a340,096). Read more here: Destination of stricken cruise liner remains unclear My colleagues Erin McCormick and Patrick Greenfield report on the future of the Zaandam cruise ship, which had been stranded off the coast of Panama but has now been allowed to pass through the Panama canal. The Zaandam cruise liner might have been given permission to pass through the Panama canal but the question of where the coronavirus-stricken ship will be allowed to dock remains unclear. Holland America Line, the boat\u2019s owners, have previously said they planned to try to dock in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. But the Broward County Commissioner told the Guardian that he did not know if the cruise liner will be allowed to dock. Four people have died on board so far. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten anything,\u201d said Broward county commissioner Michael Udine, who had voiced his strong concerns about the ship coming into South Florida. \u201cThat\u2019s something that would have to go through Unified Command at the port first,\u201d referencing a group which includes the US Centers for Disease Control, the US Coast Guard and the Florida Department of Health. \u201cI\u2019m still very concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this ship arrives here, it\u2019s going to put a lot of pressure on our local health system.\u201d Panamanian officials did not confirm whether the Rotterdam, another Holland America Line that has been sent to help with the rescue operation of asymptomatic passengers, would be allowed to pass through the canal. New allegations have been made about an outsourcing firm running NHS 111 services making staff work \u201cdesk to desk\u201d, in an apparent breach of coronavirus social distancing rules. Labour has written to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, with \u201curgent concerns\u201d about a call centre operated by Sitel in Plymouth. MP Luke Pollard said numerous workers at the site told him that up to 200 staff are working \u201cdesk to desk\u201d in close proximity on one floor of the building, with allegedly no deep cleaning. Pollard said he had been told people are required to go to work or risk their employment even if they are closely associated with people who are self-isolating. David Lloyd health clubs could be turned into emergency hospitals in response to the Covid-19 outbreak. According to ITV News, the chain is in talks with the government about converting a \u201chandful\u201d of its largest gyms into emergency medical facilities in an attempt to prevent the NHS becoming overwhelmed during the pandemic. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has described Trump\u2019s idea of a lockdown in the state as \u201canti-American\u201d. Earlier, Trump told reporters that he was considering imposing a quarantine in New York, and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut. However, Cuomo has said that the travel ban would be \u201ccounter-productive\u201d, telling CNN: \u201cIf you started walling off areas all across the country it would be totally bizarre, counter-productive, anti-American\u201d. \u201cIt makes absolutely no sense and I don\u2019t think any serious governmental personality or professional would support it,\u201d he added. The United States now has more than 120,000 confirmed cases, the highest figure in the world, with New York the national epicentre of the virus. Panama\u2019s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal. No one from the ship will be allowed to disembark in Panama, however. It comes after a stalemate, in which Panama\u2019s authorities had not given approval to let the ship pass through the canal, leaving passengers stuck on board. They are reportedly allowing the ship to pass for \u201chumanitarian reasons\u201d. The Zaandam cruise ship, currently in Panama, has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. This will allow the ship to try and dock in Florida. My colleagues Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick will have more information shortly. Boris Johnson, the UK\u2019s prime minister, is set to warn British citizens that the worst of coronavirus is yet to come, and that tougher measures may be necessary. The country\u2019s 30m households will receive a letter from the prime minister including the warning, along with details of the government\u2019s orders on social distancing, symptoms and handwashing. It comes as the UK braces for a surge in coronavirus cases. Read more here: Two new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Libya. The two cases were discovered in Tripoli and Misrata, the National Centre for Disease Control said, without giving any further details. The first, confirmed on Monday, was a man who had recently returned to Libya from overseas. Libya has been embroiled in war since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and is split between two warring administrations. The conflict has wrecked the economy, fuelled migrant smuggling and militancy, and disrupted oil supplies. Due to the volatile domestic situation, international aid agencies have warned of a disaster if coronavirus spreads. Gatherings of more than two people have been banned in Northern Ireland, and anyone who can work from home must do so, authorities have announced. Authorities will have the power to enforce restriction of movement and social distancing in Northern Ireland, in a deal agreed by Stormont executive. The measures will come into force at 11pm on Saturday night, and enable authorities to hand out fines up to \u00a35,000. The regulations also give the authorities the power to close certain premises and prohibit anyone from leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Mali has recorded its first coronavirus death hours just before its election. The first patient died of coronavirus on Saturday, a day before the West African country voted in a long-delayed parliamentary election threatened by both the pandemic and security concerns. The leader of the main opposition party was kidnapped earlier in the week, with a security source saying he is \u201clikely\u201d in the hands of a jihadist group, according to Reuters. Several opposition parties on Saturday called for the vote to be postponed due to the pandemic. So far, 18 people have tested positive in Mali, with the first diagnosis on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia is indefinitely extending the suspension of international passenger flights and workplace attendance in both public and private sectors, as part of ongoing efforts to tackle the spread of coronavirus. Domestic flights, trains, buses and taxis also remain suspended, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. Airbnb has announced it will offer frontline healthcare workers free places to stay during the coronavirus outbreak. The accommodation company announced it has teamed up with the NHS to create a global programme which aims to house 100,000 frontline healthcare staff fighting the coronavirus pandemic around the world. This will include healthcare professionals, relief workers and first responders. Homeowners who list their properties through Airbnb are able to opt in to the programme and offer an entire home, with Airbnb waiving all fees for the stays. So far, nearly 1,500 places to stay have been offered in the UK. Patrick Robinson, director of public policy at Airbnb, said: The entire country is behind our heroic NHS and medical staff as they battle the coronavirus outbreak. We have made it our priority to stand with the Airbnb community to do what we can to help. By working together, we can ensure that frontline workers can find a free and convenient place to stay as they continue their critical work. We thank our doctors and nurses across the country from the bottom of our hearts and are grateful to hosts who have already opened their homes during these difficult times. The initiative builds on programmes already launched in Italy and France where Airbnb and local partners, including the French Government, announced that doctors, nurses, care-givers and other medical support staff who are responding to the outbreak in the country can access accommodation on Airbnb. Here\u2019s an update of the top twenty countries for number of coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker: US: 116,505 cases, 1,925 deaths Italy: 92,572 cases, 10,023 deaths China: 81,999 cases, 3,299 deaths Spain: 72,248 cases, 5,812 deaths Germany: 56,202 cases, 203 deaths France: 38,105 cases, 2,317 deaths Iran: 36,408 cases, 2,517 deaths UK: 17,312 cases, 1,021 deaths Switzerland: 14,076 cases, 264 deaths Netherlands: 9,819 cases, 640 deaths South Korea: 9,478 cases, 144 deaths Belgium: 9,134 cases, 353 deaths Austria: 8,188 cases, 68 deaths Turkey: 7,402 cases, 108 deaths Canada: 5,448 cases, 61 deaths Portugal: 5,170 cases, 100 deaths Norway: 3,981 cases, 23 deaths Australia: 3,640 cases, 14 deaths Israel: 3,619 cases, 12 deaths Brazil: 3,477 cases, 111 deaths You can get the full list here. There have been 649,904 confirmed cases, with 30,249 fatalities. An organ transplant consultant volunteering for the NHS frontline fight against coronavirus has died from the disease, it has been reported. Dr Adil El Tayar, a working surgeon, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex University Hospital in Isleworth, west London, his family told the BBC. Dr El Tayar, 63, had volunteered to help in the A&amp;E and general department of a hospital in the Midlands, his cousin said in a report for Radio 4\u2019s From Our Own Correspondent programme. Dr El Tayar was a father of four, two of whom were NHS doctors. Two weeks ago he became unwell and did not return to work, eventually having to be taken to hospital where he died, his cousin said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, has had her leave from prison extended by two weeks, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife\u2019s father had been told that her temporary release from Evin prison in Tehran will now continue until 18 April. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s father was also notified that his daughter\u2019s file had been put forward to the Iranian Prosecutor General for consideration for clemency, Richard Ratcliffe said. A crowdfunder to raise money for personal protective equipment in British hospitals has reached \u00a3400,000. The fundraising effort was launched by a group of NHS doctors and a GP to source PPE \u201cfor those who need it the most\u201d. The group originally set a \u00a3200,000 target, but this was met in 48 hours. According to the crowdfunder, actor James McAvoy made a large contribution, with the group behind the fundraiser thanking him for his \u201cextraordinary generosity\u201d. The next two weeks will be the toughest yet in the fight against coronavirus in France, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has warned. Doctors in the greater Paris region have warned their intensive care units will be full by the end of the weekend, whilst healthcare services in the east of France are already struggling to cope. \u201cWe are fighting a battle that will take time,\u201d Philippe said in a televised address. \u201cThe first two weeks of April will be harder than the two we have just lived through.\u201d The army and emergency workers were this weekend stepping up the transfer of patients to less-affected regions, using a military helicopter and a specially-adapted TGV train, in an attempt to free up intensive care beds in worst-hit areas. By Saturday, the death toll in France was 2,314, with more than 37,575 confirmed cases, according to official figures. However, the government tally only accounts for those dying in hospital, so the figure is likely to be much higher. Authorities say they will be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes from next week, which is likely to result in an increase in the official death toll. Hundreds of passengers stuck on a cruise ship where coronavirus has spread will be transferred to another ship. The Zaandam cruise ship, currently in Panama, has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. \u201cThe ship which could not dock at any port in South America will remain in Panamanian waters 8 nautical miles from the coast, since it did not receive approval from Panamanian health authorities to cross the (Panama) Canal,\u201d Panama\u2019s maritime authority said. It said 401 asymptomatic passengers will be transferred from cruise operator Holland America Line\u2019s 238-meter (781-foot) MS Zaandam vessel to the Rotterdam, a sister ship. There are 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board the Zaandam, as well as four doctors and four nurses, the cruise operator has said. About 70 healthy passengers on the Zaandam have already been boarded onto tenders pulled up on the port side of the ship for transfer to the Rotterdam, according to a passenger. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has surpassed the 1,000 mark in Greece after a further 95 people tested positive overnight. The country\u2019s health ministry spokesman, professor Sotiris Tsiodras, said 1,061 cases had now been recorded, up from 966 yesterday, with the vast majority in Athens. The death toll had also risen from 28 to 32 (25 are men). The average age of those who had succumbed to the virus was 73, he said. Although almost 1,000 more people had been tested for the virus in the last 24 hours, testing in Greece remains low (14,363 in total), fuelling fears that the real number of those with the novel virus is higher. Addressing reporters, Tsiodras said the country, thus far, had managed to avert \u201cthe bad scenario of the type [we have seen] in Italy.\u201d But Greek experts also insist that the coming weeks are crucial. Earlier, the minister of development and investment, Adonis Georgiadis, acknowledged that restrictive measures on movement, for several weeks among the most stringent in Europe, were likely to be extended way beyond the original end date of April 6th. Further curbs are not excluded. Tellingly, the government announced it would be cutting air links to the Netherlands in addition to severing flights to Italy, Spain, the UK and Turkey. Greeks abroad would only be repatriated if they had \u201ca serious reason\u201d to be returned to the country. \u201cWe are not implementing a general repatriation. That would be devastating for the country,\u201d the deputy minister for civil protection Nikos Hardalias also told reporters. Some 2,850 Greeks have requested to be repatriated from the UK but only pregnant women or those with health problems or who had nowhere to stay would be brought back to Greece, he said. Here\u2019s some more detail on Spain\u2019s announcement from my colleague Sam Jones in Madrid: The Spanish government has tightened up its national lockdown, ordering all non-essential workers to stay at home for the next two weeks in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus and relieve pressure on the country\u2019s overstretched hospitals. The measure, which comes two weeks after the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, declared a state of emergency, was announced hours after Spanish health authorities said the outbreak appeared to be peaking in parts of the country. In a televised address on Saturday evening, S\u00e1nchez ordered all those in non-key jobs to stay at home from Monday, saying the \u201cextraordinarily tough\u201d measures were needed as the county intensified its efforts to contain the pandemic. \u201cThis measure will reduce people\u2019s movement even further [but] it will reduce the risk of contagion and allow us to unblock out intensive care units,\u201d the prime minister said. S\u00e1nchez also warned that the EU needed to react to the global health crisis in a united and decisive fashion to safeguard its own future. \u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d he said. You can read the full article here: South Africa\u2019s confirmed cases of coronavirus increased at a slower rate on Saturday, up by 17 to 1,187 people, the health ministry said. The country is in its second day of a national lockdown. In a statement the Ministry of Health however stressed that the slower rate of reported infections did not indicate a reduction in the speed of the outbreak. \u201cWe must outrightly state that these numbers do not indicate a reduction in the number of infections. It is merely a reflection of positive results that were received, verified and ready for today\u2019s reporting,\u201d the ministry said in a statement. Since the first positive case was reported on March 5 the rate of infections in South Africa has been exponential, rising from less than 20 two weeks ago to over 1,000, leading President Cyril Ramaphosa to announce a 21-day lockdown to slow the outbreak. Only one death has been reported in South Africa so far. Italian PM is approving new legislation to make \u20ac4.7bn available to cities in Italy affected by coronavirus, Sky News have just announced. Meanwhile, the Italian economic minister says Europe will need a package like that of the Marshall plan after the Second World War. The United Arab Emirates has extended its nightly curfew to April 5 in an attempt to combat the spread of coronavirus. It came as neighbouring Qatar reported its first death from the disease. The UAE\u2019s deep clean campaign, being implemented between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. each day, began on March 26 and had been due to end on the morning of March 29. \u201cWe are all hoping that everybody - citizens, residents and visitors - will stay at home during this period,\u201d Farida Al- Hosani, a health ministry spokeswoman, told a news conference. Qatar became the latest Gulf state to report its first virus-related death, a Bangladeshi resident. The majority of the 590 cases in Qatar are among migrant labourers, where foreigners make up most of the work force. Thanks to all those getting in touch on Twitter. I won\u2019t be able to answer all questions directly but will try and fill in any gaps in information here on the blog. If you spot something I miss, you can drop me a message @mollyblackall. Hubei province in China, where the outbreak originated, has removed all outbound traffic highway checkpoints, the Chinese media outlet Global Times reports. The city of Wuhan, where the wet market thought to have been the source of coronavirus was located, is the only exception. This signals another lifting of restrictions, as the rate of coronavirus spread in China slows. All remaining checkpoints in Wuhan will be removed on April 8. Germany conducts 500,000 tests in a week, Sky News reports. The British government is aiming to be testing 10,000 per day by tomorrow. Coronavirus is not an airborne infection. Here\u2019s a fact check from the World Health Organization: Six people in the Vatican have tested positive for coronavirus, but the Pope and his aids are not among them. Tests were done on 170 people in the Vatican and six showed positive, including one of the several dozen permanent residents of the Santa Marta guesthouse on the Vatican grounds, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement. The person who tested positive works in the Secretariat of State and is in a Rome hospital. \u201cI can confirm that neither the Holy Father nor his closest aides are among these,\u201d he said. Tests showed one other person who had been in contact with the priest also came up positive but that person did not live in the papal residence. The modern residence, which has 130 rooms and suites and a staff of about 30 people, is home to dozens of priests who work in key Vatican departments. Bruni said the entire residence, which is run like a hotel but has not been accepting temporary guests for the past few weeks, was sanitised. Francis appears to be in generally good health but part of one of his lungs was removed following an illness when he was a young man. Canada will prevent anyone with symptoms of coronavirus board domestic flights or inter-city passenger trains, prime minister Justin Trudeau has said. The measures will come into effect on Monday at noon EDT. Asked how screening would be different, Trudeau said the government was giving new tools to airlines and railways. Transport Canada later said airline and rail company staff would ask health questions of passengers and look for visible symptoms. Even enhanced screening offers \u201cno guarantee\u201d that sick people will not board, as they can hide symptoms, Howard Njoo, Canada\u2019s deputy chief public health officer, said in a separate press conference. Canada has confirmed 5,153 cases of coronavirus, and 55 deaths. You can read the full report on the developments in Italy from my colleague Lorenzo Tondo in Italy here: The 47 countries of the WHO Africa region now has 2,650 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 49 deaths, the head of the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros made the announcement in a tweet: Coronavirus patients in intensive care units in the UK have a 50% survival rate, a report has revealed. Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) showed that of 165 patients treated in critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since the end of February, 79 died, while 86 survived and were discharged. The figures were taken from an audit of 775 people who have been or are in critical care with the disease, across 285 intensive care units. The remaining 610 patients continue to receive intensive care. You can read the rest of the article from my colleagues Denis Campbell and Toby Helm here: The death toll in France has risen to 2,314, up from 1,995 on Friday, French health authorities have said. French health authorities reported 319 new deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday, up 16% on the previous day. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in France has reached 37,575, compared to 32,964 on Friday. The daily government tally only accounts for those dying in hospital but authorities say they will be able to compile data on deaths in retirement homes from next week, which is likely to result in a big increase in registered fatalities. Ireland hopes to lift or tweak restrictive measures in a fortnight, Health Minister Simon Harris said. This will only be possible if the country can slow the rate of admissions to intensive care units, however. Ireland\u2019s prime minister ordered citizens on Friday to stay home until April 12, with people only allowed to leave to shop for groceries, for brief individual physical exercise or to make essential family visits. Ireland reported 14 deaths on Saturday, the most on a single day. The death toll has reached 36. A further 294 cases brought the number of infections to 2,415, slightly down on the 302 new cases reported on Friday. The British government has chartered three more flights to bring Britons trapped in Peru back to the UK, the British Ambassador has announced. The flights are set to leave Lima on Sunday and Monday, and are being operated by British Airways, ambassador Kate Harrisson said in a video posted on Twitter. The government are also bringing in flights from other regions to connect to those flights out of Lima, and are organising bus routes across the country which will begin tomorrow morning. To reach more remote destinations, the government is working with international partners to bring British nationals, along with other nationals, back to Lima, Europe, or the UK. Harrisson said that coronavirus cases have been confirmed in hostels where UK nationals are staying. She said consulate staff are providing those nationals with support. There are around 1,000 British nationals in Peru at the moment, Harrisson said. On Wednesday, the government brought around 200 Britons back from Peru. Trump contacted UK prime minister Boris Johnson last night, who apparently said \u201cthe UK needs ventilators\u201d as soon as Trump picked up the phone. Trump was speaking outside the US naval hospital ship Comfort, which will now head to New York to treat patients suffering from emergency conditions other than coronavirus, to free up healthcare workers and resources to treat the virus. All non-essential workers must stay home over the next two weeks, in an attempt to stem the spread of coronavirus, the Spanish prime minister has announced. They will be paid a full salary, PM Pedro Sanchez says. The measure are set to last from March 30 to April 9. The number of confirmed cases in Ireland has reached 2,415, up from 2,121 on Friday. Trump is speaking now, and confirms he is considering a quarantine in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Trump says he\u2019ll announce either way soon, but says this won\u2019t apply to truckers, and won\u2019t affect trade. He also says that four hospitals have been completed in \u201crecord time\u201d. He adds that reserves are being activated to boost healthcare supplies. Using his catchphrase, he says he has \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of new supplies in process. Iran has allocated 20% of its annual state budget to fighting the coronavirus outbreak in the country, President Hassan Rouhani said. Iran is one of the worst-hit countries in the world, with the death toll from coronavirus rising to 2,517 on Saturday. It had 139 fatalities in the past 24 hours, and cases rose by 3,076 to 35,408. \u201cWe are in difficult conditions, in conditions of sanctions but we have allocated 20% of our budget this year to corona ... and this might be surprising for the world from a country under sanctions,\u201d Rouhani told state TV. The budget allocation, amounting to about 1,000tn rials, would include grants and low-interest loans to those affected by Covid-19, Rouhani said. France has ordered 1bn face masks, mostly from China, the French health minister has said. Health Minister Olivier Veran said the country was using 40 million face masks each week, and currently has three weeks worth of supplies. Here\u2019s some more information from my colleague Lorenzo Tondo in Italy, on the announcement that the Italian death toll has now passed 10,000: The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has passed 10,000 while the number of total cases is now over 90,000. On Saturday, Italy announced 889 new deaths from Covid-19, as total fatalities leapt to 10,023. Another 5,974 have tested positive with coronavirus, 470 less than Friday. Some 70,065 people across the country are currently infected with Covid-19. The total number of contagions in Italy, including the deceased and those who have recovered, is 92,472. Yesterday, the country recorded its highest daily rise in Covid-19 deaths, with 969 new fatalities. On 31 March, flags will be flown at half-mast in cities across Italy to commemorate the victims of the pandemic. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, warned on Saturday that the EU could lose its purpose if it failed to come up with a strong response to the coronavirus threat and accused other member states of a timid response to an unprecedented economic shock. \u201cIf Europe does not rise to this unprecedented challenge, the whole European structure loses its raison d\u2019\u00eatre to the people,\u201d Conte told the Il Sole 24 Ore financial newspaper. \u201cWe are at a critical point in European history,\u201d Conte added, \u201cI represent a country that is suffering a lot and I cannot afford to procrastinate.\u201d The national government is said to be considering plans to extend a country-wide lockdown to mid-April. The Higher Health Institute (ISS) said that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy was approaching. \u201cWe have seen an apparent reduction in the infection curve since 20 March but we are not yet in a downward phase,\u201d said ISS president Silvio Brusaferro. As the spread of coronavirus in Italy continues to soar, the Vatican has confirmed the Pope and his aids do not have coronavirus. The EU has granted Tunisia \u20ac250m in aid to help it cope with the economic and social effects of the coronavirus outbreak, EU ambassador Patrice Bergamini said in a tweet. Tunisia has limited healthcare infrastructure, leading to concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Currently, the country has 227 confirmed Covid-19 cases and six deaths. In Italy, 10,023 people have now died from coronavirus, after rising by 889 since Friday. The number of confirmed cases in the country increased to 92,472 from 86,498. The death toll in Turkey has risen from 16 to 108, the health minister has announced. The country now has 7,402 cases, an increase of 1,704. Cuomo said that the cost of ventilators had increased from $25,000 to $45,000 because of demand. Despite Donald Trump telling reporters earlier that there was a possibility of an enforced quarantine in New York, the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said he hadn\u2019t been told anything about this. Cuomo added that Trump had not consulted him about a quarantine, saying \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means\u201d. New York governor Andrew Cuomo has announced that cases in the state have increased to 52,318, and the death toll has risen to 728. He warns that coronavirus efforts are a \u201cmarathon not a sprint\u201d, admitting that it feels like a \u201clifetime\u201d since schools closed just 10 days ago. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Greece has risen to 1,061. It comes after Greece confirmed 95 new cases on Saturday. So far, 32 people have died due to coronavirus in the country. This is Molly Blackall, taking over the blog for the next few hours. I\u2019ll be keeping you up to date with all of the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter, @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything, but will try to read it all. Thanks in advance! Earlier we reported that thousands of migrant workers in India had been forced to trek back to their homes after the government shut down trains to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Here are some pictures from the sub-continent. The Covid-19 death toll in Lombardy, Italy, has risen by 542 since Friday, Reuters reports. The agency says it learned the figure, which brings the total in the region worst hit by Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak to 5,944, from a source \u201cfamiliar with the data\u201d. Official figures are not due to be published until later. The number of deaths was in line with Friday\u2019s tally of 541, which was the second highest since the outbreak began on 21 February, the agency said. The number of cases in the region increased by 2,117 to 39,415, the source said. Nationwide figures will be released at around 6pm local time (1700 GMT). The country\u2019s death toll stood at 9,134 on Friday, the highest in the world. More than 11 million people tuned in to watch Pope Francis deliver a blessing in an empty Saint Peter\u2019s Square, Lorenzo Tondo reports television bosses as saying. The pope\u2019s blessing, Urbi et Orbi - to the city and the world - is usually reserved for Christmas Day and Easter Sunday, when many thousands of people gather to hear it. Images of the cloudy sky and glistening square with the pope praying alone on a platform illuminated by the faint light of six candelabras, were beamed across the world. He said: For weeks now it has been evening. Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities. It has taken over our lives. Panama\u2019s maritime authority has shared images of a boat-to-boat rescue operation from a cruise liner with a Covid-19 outbreak on board near the entrance to the Panama canal. A small number of symptomless passengers are being moved from the Zaandam to its sister ship, the Rotterdam, after dozens of people reported flu-like symptoms and four people died. The ship was carrying 1,243 guests and 586 crew before the operation, of whom 53 guests and 85 crew have fallen ill so far. Several Latin American countries refused to let the Zaandam dock and there are fears that hundreds of ill and elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during the global pandemic. Passengers contacted by the Guardian on Friday issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after Panama refused to let the ship pass through the canal, citing safety concerns to their staff. China has sent a plane loaded with medical personnel and supplies to Pakistan to help fight the spread of the coronavirus in one of the world\u2019s most populous countries, the Associated Press reports. The foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureishi, met the plane at Islamabad airport on Saturday and greeted the Chinese doctors and officials on board. Pakistan is a key link in Beijing\u2019s ambitious One Road project linking south and central Asia with China. Beijing is also an important military supplier the the country, which is a nuclear power, and supplied it with missiles capable of carrying atomic weapons. Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, has 1,408 confirmed cases of the virus, and has recorded 11 deaths. Most of the infected people were travellers returning from neighbouring Iran, which is in the grip of one of the worst outbreaks. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has refused to impose a countrywide lockdown, saying it would devastate the country\u2019s poor. He has, however, ordered non-essential businesses, including restaurants, money changers and wedding halls, to close. Thousands of migrant workers in India, left jobless and penniless by the full shutdown of the country, are walking long distances back to their home villages after all transport was stopped except for essential services, AFP reports. Huge numbers had crammed onto trains and buses before the country of 1.3 billion people ground to a halt for three weeks, but many others were left stranded. \u201cRather than die hungry, we decided to walk,\u201d said Dilipji Thakor, who worked at a now-shuttered shopping centre in Ahmedabad in Gujarat state, as he trudged along a road. In Italy they are singing and sharing recipes. In France humour is saving the day. In Spain communal staircases have become the new running tracks, and in Germany ordinarily disorderly hackers are busy coding corona-busting apps. As hundreds of millions of Europeans languish in lockdown, people are finding increasingly inventive ways to keep themselves entertained and counter what the continent\u2019s psychologists warning are the very real risks of confinement. The Guardian\u2019s correspondents across the continent report. The first official train to disembark passengers in Wuhan since it was put under lockdown arrived in the Chinese city on Saturday, as it began to reopen after more than two months of almost total isolation, Peter Beaumont reports. The easing of the quarantine, allowing people to enter the city of 11 million and ground zero of the global coronavirus outbreak, comes as China plans measures to kickstart its economy. Trains have been fully booked for over a week in advance. Chinese state media showed crowds of passengers arriving at Wuhan station on Saturday, many wheeling suitcases. Some people had managed to slip back into the city a day earlier on rail services that were stopping in the city, but had nominally banned passengers from disembarking. A 1,000 bed US navy hospital ship is to head to New York City to aid Covid-19 healthcare efforts in the what has become the United States\u2019 worst affected region, the Associated Press reports. The USNS Comfort was undergoing maintenance but has been pressed back into service and rushed to the city. It is expected to arrive at Manhattan pier on Monday - a week after its sister ship, the USNS Mercy arrived in Los Angeles to preform similar duty on the west coast. The ship has 12 operating rooms as well as radiology suites and a CT scanner. It also has intensive care beds, a laboratory and a pharmacy. The 1,100 or so medical staff on board are mostly active duty service members from the U.S. Navy, and some reservists, who serve on the East Coast. All migrants in Portugal will be treated as permanent residents until 1 July to ensure they have access to public services during the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. Claudia Veloso, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, told the news agency: People should not be deprived of their rights to health and public service just because their application has not yet been processed. In these exceptional times, the rights of migrants must be guaranteed. The policy is also intended to reduce contagion risk by minimising contact between border control staff and applicants, the statement said. Portugal has reported 5,170 cases of the virus and 100 deaths, far fewer than in neighbouring Spain. Health authorities expect cases to peak at the end of May. It is not known how many people have ongoing residency applications, but government statistics show that a record 580,000 immigrants were living in Portugal in 2019 and 135,000 people were granted residency. The Department of Health said another 260 people across the UK had been reported dead in the last 24 hours, a significant one-day rise from 759 and by far the largest since the outbreak began. The latest total is 34% higher than the equivalent figure yesterday, the largest day-on-day percentage increase since 18 March, when there was a 46% jump. In England, a further 246 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths there to 935, NHS England said. \u201cPatients were aged between 33 and 100 years old and all but 13 - aged between 63 and 99 years old - had underlying health conditions,\u201d it said in a statement. A further four people died from coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total to 38, health officials have said. The country also reported 172 new confirmed cases, bringing the total to 1,093. Dr Robin Howe, the Covid-19 incident director at Public Health Wales, said the true number of cases was likely to be higher: Coronavirus is now circulating in every part of Wales. The single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives. We know that staying at home can be hard, and we want to thank each and every person across Wales for doing their bit to help slow the spread of the virus. In Scotland, a further seven people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total there to 40, the Scottish government announced. Two further people with Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland, taking the toll to 15, the nation\u2019s Public Health Agency said. There were also 49 new positive cases of coronavirus confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of known cases there to 324. Across the UK, a total of 120,776 people have been tested for coronavirus as of 9am on March 28, with 17,089 positive results. As of 5pm on Friday, of those threated in hospital in the UK, 1,019 have died. Russia will close its borders on Monday, a government order published on Saturday said. The measure will come into force at all vehicle, rail and pedestrian checkpoints, and will also apply to Russia\u2019s maritime borders. The country, which has already grounded all international flights, has reported 1,264 coronavirus cases. Russian diplomats and drivers of freight trucks, among others, will be exempt from the ban. The coronavirus outbreak may be peaking in parts of Spain, the country\u2019s health authorities said on Saturday as they announced another record single-day death toll of 832, Sam Jones reports from Madrid. The number of cases in the country rose from 64,059 on Friday to 72,248 on Saturday, and the number of dead now stands at 5,69o. Between Thursday and Friday, 769 people died from the disease. Despite the figures, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies said that the situation was improving in certain places. Fernando Sim\u00f3n told a press conference on Saturday afternoon: We don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll get confirmation, but we\u2019re getting close to the peak of the curve that we\u2019re studying so anxiously. In some parts of the country, they probably may even have passed it \u2013 but we need to be cautious with preliminary information ... The increase in cases is coming down in comparison with previous weeks, but it could be that there are cases that aren\u2019t being detected in some regions. But Sim\u00f3n also warned that reaching a peak would not ease the pressure on Spain\u2019s overstretched intensive care units (ICUs), adding they were predicted to pass beyond full capacity in less than a week\u2019s time. We still have a big problem when it comes to the overloading of our ICUs Patients who pick up the disease today may need a bed in an ICU in seven to 10 days. That means that we\u2019re still seeing a lag between the control of transmission and the saturation of ICUs. It also means they\u2019re going to be overloaded by the end of next week or the beginning of the following week. France\u2019s supermarkets have pledged to engage in \u201cfood patriotism\u201d to boost the country\u2019s hard-hit farmers and producers during the coronavirus crisis, Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, reports. Fruit and vegetable growers have been severely hit by a government decree banning open air markets. Now major stores have said they will shun foreign imports in favour of national produce. The French Federation of Business and Distribution said all the country\u2019s major supermarket chains, including Carrefour, Leclerc and Intermarch\u00e9 had agreed. They are in the process of moving to French supplies. Foreign products on the shelves will be sold, but there will be no resupplying from outside France. Local prefects and mayors have been given the power to allow local markets if they are essential to farmers and shoppers and on the condition that they ensure strict distancing and health safety measures are enforced. In a message to customers, Carrefour promised that \u201c100% of our strawberries, cucumbers, and asparagus (white and violet) are from now on 100% French\u201d, adding:. To support French production, we have decided to stop the sale of fruit and vegetables from abroad where there is a French alternative available. French farmers have also put out an appeal for 200,000 volunteers to help them harvest fruit and vegetables. The sector normally relies on foreign workers for two thirds of its workforce, but with restrictions on movement and border closures, there is a shortage. The Latin American populists Jair Bolsonaro and Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador have faced intense criticism for their lackadaisical reaction to the coronavirus crisis. Critics accuse the leaders of Brazil and Mexico of playing down the risk posed by the pandemic, Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro. But L\u00f3pez Obrador, or Amlo as he is known, appears to be changing tack as the regional death toll rises. In a 14-minute \u201cmessage to the Mexican people\u201d on Friday, he declared: \u201cWe need to stay in our homes. We need to keep a healthy distance from each other. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stay inside our homes the number of infection cases could shoot up, and it would saturate our hospitals. It would be overwhelming.\u201d Bolsonaro shows no sign of a similar change in approach. He has been actively undermining efforts to keep Brazil\u2019s 210 million citizens at home in recent days. His son, supporters and the federal government have backed a campaign called Brazil Can\u2019t Stop. \u201cSome people are going to die,\u201d Bolsonaro said on Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s life ... You can\u2019t shut down a car factory because people die in traffic accidents.\u201d A number of people who attended \u201clockdown parties\u201d in Belgium are now gravely ill, Daniel Boffey in Brussels reports the country\u2019s prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, as saying She announced an extension of the country\u2019s lockdown measures until 19 April and urged everyone to take the crisis more seriously. Many young people do not feel concerned. You feel invincible when you are young. Among the young people who partied in cafes a fortnight ago, there are some who are today in intensive care. Residents in Belgium are only allowed to leave their homes for exercise, essential shopping and work that cannot be done remotely. Large gatherings are banned and police have been told to be active in fining those found to be flouting the rules. A total of 353 people have died in Belgium of Covid-19 infection, including 64 in the past 24 hours. There are 3,717 patients in hospital, including 789 in intensive care. Singapore reported 70 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, the health ministry said, taking the city-state\u2019s total number of infections to 802. Of the new cases, 41 were imported and 29 were local cases who had no recent history of travel abroad, the ministry said in a press release. Singapore is still carrying out extensive contact tracing of patients confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus. More than half of its confirmed cases have been in patients arriving from overseas. A little something to lighten the mood ... Outrage is growing in Kenya after police fired teargas at a crowd of ferry commuters and mobile phone footage captured officers hitting people with batons as they enforced the country\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown. Amnesty International Kenya and 19 other human rights groups said in a statement: We were horrified by excessive use of police force ahead of the curfew that began Friday night. We continue to receive testimonies from victims, eyewitnesses and video footage showing police gleefully assaulting members of the public in other parts of the country. The teargas caused hundreds of people trying to reach a ferry in the port city of Mombasa ahead of the curfew to touch their faces as they vomited, spat and wiped away tears, increasing the chance of the virus spreading, the statement said. The Associated Press reported Kenya\u2019s interior ministry on Saturday as saying in a statement that the curfew \u201cis meant to guard against an apparent threat to public health. Breaking it is not only irresponsible but also puts others in harms way.\u201d Kenya\u2019s government has not said how many people have been arrested. Six new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the West Bank, raising the total in Palestine to 97, the Wafa news agency reports. West Bank government spokesman Ibrahim Milhem said in a daily briefing on Saturday that three new cases were confirmed in Irtas, a village near Bethlehem, one in nearby Beit Iskaria, and two in villages near Jerusalem. Milhem urged Palestinians to stay at home and avoid socialising with family members. Social visits appear to have been the main cause of transmission so far. Nine of Palestine\u2019s confirmed cases are in Gaza. Officials from the Israeli civil administration in the West Bank confiscated tents on Thursday intended as a field clinic and emergency housing for Palestinians affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, the Israeli human rights organisation B\u2019Tselem reported. The group said in a statement: As the whole world battles an unprecedented and paralysing healthcare crisis, Israel\u2019s military is devoting time and resources to harassing the most vulnerable Palestinian communities in the West Bank, that Israel has attempted to drive out of the area for decades. Shutting down a first-aid community initiative during a health crisis is an especially cruel example of the regular abuse inflicted on these communities, and it goes against basic human and humanitarian principles during an emergency. There are plans in India to turn some railway coaches into isolation wards for patients with the coronavirus, as authorities prepare the country\u2019s health infrastructure for an expected surge in cases. The country\u2019s 1.3 billion people were this week ordered to stay indoors for three weeks in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown, leaving the country\u2019s trains lying idle. One train coach has been turned into a prototype quarantine facility, the state-owned Indian Railways said in a statement on Saturday. Once they receive clearance, the plan is for each of India\u2019s 16 railway zones to convert 10 coaches into such wards every week, the company added. Saudi Arabian airlines will begin exceptional commercial flights this week to bring British nationals and their families back to the UK, and similar flights are being arranged for American citizens to return home, both countries said. All international passenger flights in and out of the Arab country were suspended for two weeks starting March 14 to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus , but there is no indication normal travel will resume on Sunday. However, flights to London Heathrow will begin on Sunday from Riyadh and later in the week from Jeddah and Dammam, according to the British embassy. The US embassy said on Saturday it was working with the Saudi authorities to arrange repatriation flights on a commercial airline, but no flights had been confirmed yet. The kingdom recorded 99 new confirmed cases on Saturday, taking its total to more than 1,200 \u2013 the most in the Gulf Arab region \u2013 with four fatalities. Another 38 people have died in Switzerland from coronavirus over the past 24 hours, the health ministry has said. The Alpine country\u2019s death toll is now 235 people, and the number of cases has also increased to 13,213 from 12,161. Army medical units have been deployed at hospitals to help in crisis regions like Ticino, which borders Italy, and it is drawing upon its strategic stockpile of pharmaceuticals to cover rising demand, Reuters reported. Like other European countries, Switzerland is pumping money into its crisis-hit economy, and state-backed loans worth 20bn Swiss francs (\u00a316.9bn) became available on Thursday. Finance minister Ueli Maurer made clear on Saturday the government was happy to help with state-backed loans worth more than $20bn, but that it needed the money back and could not compensate for income losses. He told SRF radio: We are not distributing federal money, but taxpayers\u2019 money. Many of those who pay taxes are now partially unemployed, their jobs are in question, and now we take the money away from them and distribute it somewhere where there are also problems. Greeks should brace themselves for the long haul and prepare for lockdown to continue for some time yet, the country\u2019s development and investment minister warned today. In the first hint of government thinking on the issue, Adonis Georgiadis said measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus will be in place \u201cuntil scientists tell us we have beaten the virus.\u201d Restrictions on movement in Greece \u2013 already some of the most stringent in Europe \u2013 have extended to citizens being forced, with few exceptions, to remain at home. The controls have turned cities across the country into ghost towns after prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced the measures last Sunday. But Georgiadis said there was no prospect of the restrictions being relaxed by April 6 \u2013 the original cut-off date. \u201cThe measures prohibiting circulation in our country will last much longer than April 6th,\u201d he told Open TV. Officials are privately voicing fears that April will be the most difficult month yet. Transmission rates and fatalities, as a result of Covid-19, are both expected to rise even if the spread of the disease has, so far, been kept under relative control. Latest figures show the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases jumping to 966, according to the government, with 28 fatalities recorded as of Friday. But experts believe in the absence of widespread testing \u2013 only 13,477 people to date have been tested for the virus \u2013 the real number is almost certainly higher. Media reports on Saturday suggested that the centre-right government is considering enforcing even stricter measures, including a ban on all flights in and out of the country, and perhaps even clamping down further on movement. People are currently allowed to venture out of their homes for exercise, upon the condition they stay in the vicinity of their immediate neighbourhood and inform authorities beforehand. China has sent medical personnel and supplies on a plane to Pakistan to help stop the spread of coronavirus, the Pakistani foreign ministry said on Saturday. The plane carrying aid to Pakistan was met at the capital\u2019s airport on Saturday by its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureishi, who greeted the arriving Chinese doctors and officials, the Associated Press reported. China has already sent ventilators, masks and other medical equipment to the South Asian country. Pakistan, with a population of 220 million, currently has 1,408 confirmed cases of Covid-19 \u2013 including 11 deaths. It has closed its borders with both Iran and Afghanistan, but has been criticised for its initial lax response to the virus. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has refused to impose a countrywide lockdown saying it would devastate the country\u2019s poor people, but non-essential businesses have been ordered to close, including restaurants, money-changers and wedding halls. According to Pakistan\u2019s federal health authorities, the outbreak has been largely concentrated in the Punjab \u2013 which borders India \u2013 with 490 confirmed cases there, and Sindh, which has 457 confirmed infections. Other cases are spread throughout several other regions, including the capital, Islamabad. On Saturday a woman in the north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province became the latest person in Pakistan to die from coronavirus-related symptoms. Health authorities said the woman fell sick after returning from a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, before dying in a government hospital where she tested positive for coronavirus. A group of teenagers in the north of England who claimed to have coronavirus and deliberately coughed at NHS staff will be prosecuted, police have said. Details of the incident were released on the Facebook page of Warrington police. Sgt Hillyard of Cheshire police wrote: We have attended reports of a group of youths coughing at NHS staff stating they have coronavirus. The youths will be prosecuted as will their parental guardians. This is an absolutely abhorrent incident involving abuse of our NHS heroes. I will once again urge all parents and persons with parental responsibility to make sure that their children stay inside. You too can and will be prosecuted if you fail to keep your children inside. A man in Manchester has also been charged with assault after allegedly coughing at a police officer and claiming to have the coronavirus. Greater Manchester police said Mateusz Rejewski, 33, of no fixed abode, has been charged with one count of common assault on an emergency service worker and one count of breaching a dispersal notice. The officer is self-isolating as a precaution, and Rejewski has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester magistrates court on Tuesday. More than 5,000 medics from countries around Europe have appealed to governments and the EU to urgently ensure the safety of refugees and migrants in overcrowded camps on the Greek islands, where they warn of an impending medical disaster. The pandemic that threatens to overwhelm the camps will have \u201ccatastrophic consequences for the refugees, Greek inhabitants and the rest of European society,\u201d says the petition, launched last week by Dutch medical professors and public health experts. It is an illusion to think that a COVID-19 outbreak in these camps could be kept under control: 40,000 people are living on a few square kilometres, and there are only a handful of doctors present. Many children and adults are already ravaged by physical and mental traumas. If Europe looks away now, this situation could escalate to become a medical disaster, which would represent a serious violation of the norms and values of European healthcare. It is our duty to prevent this from happening. The signatories called on EU member state governments to comply with their 2016 agreement to take in a fixed number of refugees to prevent \u201ca medical disaster on European territory\u201d. The European parliament\u2019s civil liberties, justice and home affairs committee called last week for the evacuation of the 42,000 people on the Greek islands as an urgent preventive measure to avoid \u201cmany deaths\u201d. Holding facilities on all five Aegean islands opposite the Turkish coast, widely considered particularly high-risk environments for the spread of the virus, are currently six times over capacity. The first case of Covid-19 on the islands was confirmed earlier this month when a Greek woman on Lesbos, the island long on the frontline of the refugee crisis, tested positive. A doctor in Uzbekistan has died after attempting to treat a coronavirus infection that the patient had kept secret, according the country\u2019s health authorities. The 39-year-old man had been in contact with Uzbekistan\u2019s \u201cpatient zero\u201d. The doctor was admitted to hospital in a critical condition on 26 March and died two days later. He is the second person known to have died of the coronavirus in the country, according to Reuters. Uzbekistan has 104 confirmed cases of the virus. It has locked down all of its provinces and barred citizens from leaving their homes except for work and essential shopping. Here are the latest major developments in the global coronavirus pandemic so far on Saturday. The number of confirmed cases globally has passed 600,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true extent of infections is likely to be much greater. A sixth of those infections are in a single country, after the number of cases in the US passed 100,000, making it the worst affected country in the world, followed by Italy and China. Spain, the fourth-worst affected country, reported a record single-day rise of 832 in the number of people to die Covid-19 deaths in a single day. The country now has confirmed 72,248 infections. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain\u2019s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government increases its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy. Moody\u2019s downgraded South Africa\u2019s sovereign credit rating to junk status, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and facing a further steep contraction. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world\u2019s biggest manufacturer said coronavirus lockdowns had forced it to shut down production. Iranian doctors say hundreds of people have died after ingesting toxic methanol and thousands more have fallen ill after a rumour spread that it killed the coronavirus. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board. Lockdowns around the world have triggered a rise in domestic violence. From Brazil to Germany and from Italy to China, activists say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. Afghanistan has reported 15 new Coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 110. The figure includes four Nato soldiers and two foreign diplomats, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports. Eleven of the new cases have been confirmed in western province of Herat, raising the total number of infections in Afghanistan\u2019s worst-affected province to 76. Herat borders Iran, where the authorities have been struggling to control one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. Three cases were also reported in Farah province, which also has a border with Iran. Another was confirmed in Ghazni province, which is related to travel to Iran, health ministry said. The Afghan government has a partial curfew in place in all cities that border Iran, and a three-week curfew was also announced on Friday for Kabul, a city of around 6 million people. The curfew went into effect on Saturday morning. The Taliban announced that it had established a coronavirus treatment and isolation centre in an area of the the northern province of Kunduz it controls. Three coronavirus deaths and four recoveries have been reported across Afghanistan, but testing is limited and experts fear the true scale of outbreak is unknown. This tweet from the air traffic tracking service Flightradar24, showing the number of planes in the air on Friday evening compared to four weeks earlier, shows the remarkable impact of travel restrictions across Europe. Spain has recorded a record single-day death toll for the second day in succession after 832 people died between Friday and Saturday, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones. The total number of people to have lost their lives to the coronavirus now stands at 5,69o. Spain also has 72,248 confirmed cases of the virus, up from 64,059 on Friday. Between Thursday and Friday, 769 people died from the disease. The Spanish government has already extended the nationwide lockdown declared a fortnight ago to 11 April and does not rule out introducing stricter controls. Speaking to the Guardian earlier this week, Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, said: We have done what was required at every moment and we will continue down that path. Iran has reported 139 new coronavirus deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total for the country to 2,517, Reuters reports. Kianoush Jahanpour, a health ministry spokesman, said on state TV that the total number of cases diagnosed had rised by 3,076 to 35,408, and that 3,206 people were in a critical condition. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, earlier reassured the public that the country, one of the most affected by the pandemic, has a strong healthcare system able to cope should the disease spread rapidly. In comments broadcast on state TV, he said his government had allocated 20% of the budget to fighting the outbreak. The tycoon Richard Branson is trending on Twitter after news broke that his airline, Virgin Atlantic, is applying for hundreds of millions of pounds in state aid. Twitter users, by and large, are not impressed. Branson\u2019s carrier has been hit hard by the travel bans and does not have the cash reserves of larger rivals such as British Airways or easyJet, my colleague Gwyn Topham, transport correspondent, reported yesterday. Spain has reported 832 deaths from Covid-19 since Friday, bringing the total for the country to 5,690. The health ministry also reported 8,189 new confirmed infections, bringing the total to 72,248. Spain has the second-highest Covid-19 death toll, and the fourth highest number of confirmed cases. Saudi Arabian Airlines has agreed to operate exceptional commercial flights to repatriate British nationals, Reuters reports. They will take place in the week starting 29 March from Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam to London\u2019s Heathrow airport. Additional flights will be put on if required, according to a British embassy email sent late on Friday. Authorities in Finland have restricted movement out of Uusimaa, the region that includes the capital, Helsinki, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Restrictions came into force at midnight and are expected to remain in force until 19 April, Yle Uutiset reports. They prevent people from entering or leaving Uusimaa, except to work, return home or care for a vulnerable person. Uusimaa has most of Finland\u2019s 1,025 confirmed coronavirus cases. The Finnish parliament approved the measures unanimously on Friday night. Feeling brave? Scientists at Oxford University are recruiting volunteers to take part in the UK\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine trial. Police enforcing the coronavirus lockdown in South Africa fired rubber bullets at shoppers queuing outside a supermarket in Johannesburg, according to an Agence France-Presse photographer. The agency said about 10 police vehicles had arrived in Yeoville, a poor part of the city\u2019s central business district, where several hundred people who had gathered outside a Shoprite supermarket were failing to observe physical distancing rules. Startled shoppers trampled on each other and a woman with a baby on her back fell to the ground, the report said. Police later used whips to get the shoppers into line. South Africa, which has 1,170 confirmed coronavirus cases, recorded its first death from the virus on Friday. The country\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has ordered the population of 57 million to stay at home for 21 days, and has deployed the security forces to enforce the lockdown. The number of people on Jersey confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus has reached 52, and one person is confirmed to have died. There are 83 tests still pending and 601 people have tested negative, according to an update the island\u2019s government published on Facebook on Friday evening. For readers more interested in the latest coronavirus news from the UK, my colleague Lucy Campbell has just published our UK-focused live blog. That means I will only be taking the top UK news lines for this blog, which from now on will focus on global developments. Health officials in the Philippines reported 14 new coronavirus deaths and 272 new cases on Saturday, according to Reuters. The numbers reported represent the country\u2019s largest daily increase in deaths and infections since the outbreak began . The total number of confirmed infections in the Philippines is now 1,075, of whom 68 have died, the health ministry said. Four patients have recovered, bringing the number of recoveries to 35. In a sign of the wider impact of the crisis now enveloping the world, wildlife rescue centres around the world are struggling to treat endangered species, Gloria Dickie reports. As the coronavirus spreads from country to country, disrupting global travel and the economy, the centres are struggling to make ends meet. The Centre for Orangutan Protection in Kalimantan in Indonesia\u2019s section of Borneo has temporarily shut down to minimise the spread of the virus. Others such as Merazonia in Ecuador rely on tourism dollars to care for their animals. Since China\u2019s shutdown of Wuhan in January, visitor numbers have also plummeted at Asia\u2019s wildlife centres. Derbyshire police in the north of England made headlines this week after using a drone to shame dog walkers who had driven into the Peak District National park during the lockdown. Now, the Guardian\u2019s north of England editor Helen Pidd reports, police officers have been pouring black dye into a reservoir near Buxton known locally as \u201cthe blue lagoon\u201d to make it less appealing to swimmers. The Buxton Safer Neighbourhoods Team wrote in a Facebook past that it taken the measure after receiving reports people were congregating there: No doubt this is due to the picturesque location and the lovely weather (for once!) in Buxton. However, the location is dangerous and this type of gathering is in contravention of the current instruction of the UK government. With this in mind, we have attended the location this morning and used water dye to make the water look less appealing. This is a regular tactic that we use to reduce ASB and we work in partnership with HPBC and Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. However, as things stand, it has never been so important to discourage these types of gatherings. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has now passed 600,000, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. With many countries, including the UK, now only testing the most serious cases, however, the true extent of infections is likely to be much greater. According to the university\u2019s interactive map, 601,478 people had been confirmed as infected with Covid-19, and 27,862 deaths attributed to the disease. At least 131,826 people have recovered after falling ill. The US has the highest number of confirmed infections with 104,837, followed by Italy with 86,498 and China with 81,948. The lockdown implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus is disrupting UK government plans to recruit 20,000 new police officers - a key manifesto pledge of the Conservative party at the December election. Assessment centres have been hit by sweeping closures of premises, PA Media reports. Katy Bourne, the chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), who also serves as PCC for Sussex told the agency: We began a big recruitment drive and along comes this virus. We don\u2019t want to stop that recruitment. The national call has a lot of officers who are in the pipeline who have been through the assessment centres and are still waiting to come out to forces and so on. The assessment centres nationally where you expect people to turn up to classrooms, obviously those can\u2019t function because we are all isolated, we have got to stay at home. So, it\u2019s keeping those officers warm or those potential officers warm in the system. It\u2019s really how do forces deal with the numbers that they have got. Bourne also said it was critical that police officers get the equipment they need to stay safe during the pandemic. The personal protective equipment (PPE) has been a big issue nationally. The police are out and about in the country they need protection. I know from Sussex\u2019s point of view they have managed to secure some. I know some police forces in other areas of the country have really struggled. The supplies are there but it\u2019s getting it out to those forces. After a week in which France\u2019s government has come under increasing criticism for perceived lack of transparency, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, and the health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, are holding a press conference on Saturday to outline the situation in detail and answer questions, Kim Willsher reports from Paris. We will have the usual announcement of the daily update figures early evening. The controversial hospital professor Didier Raoult from Marseille released new research late on Friday on 80 patients conducted over six to 10 days, which apparently shows that hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin is effective in treating Covid-19 patients. Let\u2019s begin with the latest from the UK. In Wales, teachers have been urged to keep schools open for NHS staff and carers during the two-week Easter holidays, PA Media reports. The education minister, Kirsty Williams, who described school workers as national heroes for keeping more than 700 schools open during the coronavirus epidemic, said: It takes a community to raise a child and that statement has never been more true. In this time of national need, our school community has stepped up and met the challenge. More than 700 schools have stayed open to look after the children of NHS staff, carers, people who are saving lives. I am now asking you to do more and keep schools open during what would have been school holidays. It has never been more important for our children and young people to be surrounded by the people they know and trust. I am asking you to be flexible, and to offer up some time during the Easter period to continue to support both vulnerable children and the families of our critical workers. Williams also confirmed that the families of children who get free school meals would continue to be assisted during the break. She said: Wales has a strong tradition of supporting communities and I can confirm that the funding announced last week to support children in receipt of free school meals can be used to carry on providing free school meals over the Easter holiday. This will allow local authorities to continue with their local arrangements while we establish a national scheme to support children in receipt of free school meals. In devising a national scheme I will ensure that local authorities will still be able to maintain their own approaches, should they want to do so. They will have the discretion to opt into a national scheme or continue to provide flexible support if that is their preference, such as direct payments or deliveries to families who are unable to leave their homes, due to isolation requirements. I believe this will be a sustainable approach, that will enable families to budget and plan their spend according to their needs. Hello everybody, this is Damien Gayle taking the reins of the live blog from London. As usual I will be bringing you the latest coronavirus updates from our network of correspondents around the world, from the news wires and anywhere else I can find it. And as usual I will need the help of the Guardian\u2019s global readership. Please send any coronavirus news from your part of the world to me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via a direct message to my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. Let me know what we\u2019re missing. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan on this Saturday in what I can\u2019t believe is still March. It\u2019s been a long month. I leave you now with my colleague Damien Gayle. I\u2019ll be moving to a different room to watch an entire continent isolate itself from incoming flights. And who said self isolation wasn\u2019t fun? Here are the latest key coronavirus pandemic developments from around the world: US cases passed 100,000. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known US infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain\u2019s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government ramps up its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of coronavirus. Italy overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Italy also recorded the highest daily rise in deaths anywhere since the outbreak began, with 969 fatalities. Chinese authorities reverse planned re-openings of movie theatres. China\u2019s official media also told people to stay on guard against the coronavirus on Saturday, and restrictions on foreigners entering went into effect, as the country reported no new locally transmitted infections and a small drop in imported cases. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday. In an attempt to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, states across the country implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. More than 100 Australian doctors and dentists returned to Australia after being stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile. Moody\u2019s downgraded South Africa\u2019s sovereign credit rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status on Friday, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and now staring down the barrel of a steep contraction over the global coronavirus pandemic. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world\u2019s biggest producer or condoms warned of a global shortage after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Iranian doctors say \u2018hundreds\u2019 have died after ingesting toxic methanol. An Iranian doctor said hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus. Passengers on cruise ship stranded off Panama coast issue desperate plea. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board. Argentina saw a record jump in cases. Despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20, the country reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. South Korea reports highest new cases in a week. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. Lockdowns around the world bring rise in domestic violence. Women and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. A shorter summary is available here: The NHS could have prevented \u201cchaos and panic\u201d had the system not been left \u201cwholly unprepared for this pandemic\u201d, the editor of a British medical journal has said. Numerous warnings were issued but these were not heeded, Richard Horton wrote in The Lancet. He cited an example from his journal on 20 January, pointing to a global epidemic: \u201cPreparedness plans should be readied for deployment at short notice, including securing supply chains of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, hospital supplies and the necessary human resources to deal with the consequences of a global outbreak of this magnitude.\u201d Dr Horton wrote that the government\u2019s Contain-Delay-Mitigate-Research plan had failed. \u201cIt failed, in part, because ministers didn\u2019t follow WHO\u2019s advice to \u2018test, test, test\u2019 every suspected case. They didn\u2019t isolate and quarantine. They didn\u2019t contact trace. \u201cThese basic principles of public health and infectious disease control were ignored, for reasons that remain opaque. \u201cThe result has been chaos and panic across the NHS.\u201d Dr Horton\u2019s warning came as the UK saw its biggest day-on-day rise in deaths since the Covid-19 outbreak began, while Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock said they had tested positive for the virus and frontline testing of NHS workers was set to begin. The ratings agency Fitch has cut Britain\u2019s sovereign debt rating to AA-, saying debt levels will jump as the government ramps up its spending to offset the near shutdown of the economy in the face of coronavirus. Fitch downgraded the country by one notch to the same level as its rating for Belgium and the Czech Republic. It said a further cut could follow as it kept the rating on negative outlook. \u201cThe downgrade reflects a significant weakening of the UK\u2019s public finances caused by the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and a fiscal loosening stance that was instigated before the scale of the crisis became apparent,\u201d Fitch said. \u201cThe downgrade also reflects the deep near-term damage to the UK economy caused by the coronavirus outbreak and the lingering uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit UK-EU trade relationship.\u201d Fitch said the coronavirus shutdown was likely to shrink Britain\u2019s economy by nearly 4% in 2020, assuming the drastic containment measures could be relaxed in the second half of the year, leading to a 3% bounce in growth in 2021. But doubts about Britain\u2019s future trading ties with the European Union posed a further risk, Fitch said. Here\u2019s the wrap of coronavirus pandemic news from the last few hours: The US has become the first country to exceed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as Donald Trump signed into law the largest economic stimulus package in US history, a $2.2tn bill designed to rush federal assistance to workers and businesses. The number of confirmed US cases rose by 15,000 on Friday, fewer than the 16,000 reported on Thursday. By Friday night there were more than 6,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in New York with almost 1,600 in intensive care while the state had logged 519 deaths, the most in the US, and more than 44,000 infections. Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hotspots have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff. In California a navy hospital ship, the Mercy, has docked at the Port of Los Angeles to provide 1,000 beds and full medical facilities \u2013 freeing up hospitals on land for seriously ill coronavirus patients, as the state braces for an outbreak potentially on New York\u2019s scale. The president on Friday invoked a national security law compelling General Motors (GM) to mass produce ventilators \u2013 accompanied by barbs that the carmaker had not been acting quickly enough. Some saw it as partly an act of spite amid Trump\u2019s continuing feud with the company \u2013 GM said it had already been working around the clock for more than a week to help build more ventilators. Italy became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching more than 86,000 cases. Its latest 969 deaths represent the highest national one-day figure anywhere since the outbreak began, seemingly dashing hopes that Italy might be flattening its rate of infection. The US Navy is the military service hit hardest by the coronavirus, as it scrambles to contain its first at-sea outbreak, with at least two dozen infected aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, one of 11 active aircraft carriers whose mission is central to the Pentagon\u2019s strategy for deterring war with China and Iran. The Roosevelt and its contingent of warplanes may be sidelined for days, sitting pier side in Guam as the entire crew more than 5,000 is tested, Reuters reports. Navy leaders say the carrier could return to duty at any time if required, but the sudden setback is seen as a harbinger of more trouble to come. The carrier, like other Navy ships, is vulnerable to infectious disease spread given its close quarters. The massive ship is more than 1,000 feet long; sailors are spread out across a labyrinth of decks linked by steep ladder-like stairs and narrow corridors. Enlisted sailors and officers have separate living quarters, but they routinely grab their food from crowded buffet lines and eat at tables joined end-to-end. Although the US Navy is much smaller than the US Army, it accounts for at least one-third of all reported Covid-19 cases in the military. None has been reported among Navy submarine crews, which are widely deployed and include subs armed with long-range nuclear missiles on constant patrol. The US embassy in Riyadh said on Saturday it was working with the Saudi authorities to arrange repatriation flights to the United States on a commercial airline. \u201cNo flights or departure/arrival locations have been confirmed at this time,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cIt is likely that flights will be scheduled with little advance notice.\u201d Meanwhile a video shared on Twitter claims to shows a father crying after coming home to his son. The doctor is heard saying \u201cNo, no,\u201d in Arabic as his son rushes to greet him. There are 1,104 reported cases in the country, and three deaths. Coronavirus latest: at a glance A summary of big developments in the global coronavirus outbreak: What happens to people\u2019s lungs when they get coronavirus? What became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause. The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus \u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19. Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms. WHO says about 80% of people with Covid-19 recover without needing any specialist treatment. Only about one person in six becomes seriously ill \u201cand develops difficulty breathing\u201d. So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? The UK Ambassador to Madagascar and Comoros Phil Boyle pointed out on Twitter a few hours ago how few flights are going to and from Africa at the moment, as countries across the continent respond to the coronavirus pandemic. The latest data, from FlightRadar24, still shows the continent as having close to zero aircraft leaving or arriving: The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison and Angela Giuffrida report from Rome with Helena Smith in Athens and Liz Ford in London. Around the world, as cities have gone into lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus, the mass efforts to save lives have put one vulnerable group more at risk. Women and children who live with domestic violence have no escape from their abusers during quarantine, and from Brazil to Germany, Italy to China, activists and survivors say they are already seeing an alarming rise in abuse. In Hubei province, the heart of the initial coronavirus outbreak, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled in one county alone during the lockdown in February, from 47 last year to 162 this year, activists told local media. \u201cThe epidemic has had a huge impact on domestic violence,\u201d Wan Fei, a retired police officer who founded a charity campaigning against abuse, told Sixth Tone website. \u201cAccording to our statistics, 90% of the causes of violence [in this period] are related to the Covid-19 epidemic.\u201d It is a pattern being repeated globally. In Brazil a state-run drop-in centre has already seen a surge in cases it attributes to coronavirus isolation, the Brazilian broadcaster Globo said. \u201cWe think there has been a rise of 40% or 50%, and there was already really big demand,\u201d said Adriana Mello, a Rio de Janeiro judge specialising in domestic violence. \u201cWe need to stay calm in order to tackle this difficulty we are now facing.\u201d The Catalan regional government said that calls to its helpline had risen by 20% in the first few days of the confinement period; in Cyprus, calls to a similar hotline rose 30% in the week after 9 March, when the island had its first confirmed case of coronavirus. Hong Kong has brought in new restrictions on gatherings and nightlife venues after a recent rise in imported cases and a cluster of 43 infections connected to live music venues. Another 19 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday who are connected to the cluster. The venues are in Tsim Sha Tsui, Wan Chai, and Lan Kwai Fong. Musicians from bands manage by one company are among those infected. Last week Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam flagged suspending the liquor licences of 8,600 venues, reasoning that people get intimate when they\u2019re drinking. However that was later withdrawn, and restrictions on the number of patrons brought in instead. Britons go on shopping spree to ease grind of Covid-19 confinement In more British retail and manufacturing news, the prospect of weeks trapped at home has seen Britons embark on unlikely shopping sprees as they create home offices and gyms but also embrace hobbies ranging from dressmaking to jigsaw puzzling and growing their own veg, Zoe Wood and Joanna Partridge report for the Guardian. With all non-essential high street shops and some websites now closed, what is left of high street trade is online as households hunker down and seek ways to keep themselves and their children entertained. During week one of the government\u2019s new home isolation rules, online sales were \u201cfairly flat\u201d on a year ago, according to the IMRG Capgemini online retail index. However, that measure, based on the web sales of 200 retailers, masked seesawing demand: while sales of electricals and DIY products were up 42% and 14% respectively, sales of clothing fell 27% and demand for footwear slumped 38%. British retailers and manufacturers in \u2018wartime effort\u2019 to fight Covid-19 British industry has thrown its weight behind the fight against Covid-19 in a wartime-style effort to churn out protective masks, hand sanitiser and medical ventilators. While most retailers have been forced to shut down to contain the pandemic, a raft of firms across the country, in sectors from manufacturing to fashion, are setting up emergency operations that often involve striking out into unfamiliar territory. The most high-profile example has been the effort by industrial powerhouses to manufacture 30,000 medical ventilators, with household names such as Airbus, Dyson, Ford and Rolls-Royce all pitching in with expertise and resources. The banking group HSBC moved to help ventilator manufacturers by offering fast-track loan applications, cheaper interest rates and extended repayment terms. A host of companies are focusing on limiting contagion and protecting NHS workers. In Australia, retailers Country Road, Mimco, Politix, Trenery and Witchery will close their doors as the spread of coronavirus leaves many shoppers confined to their homes. The stable of retailers, owned by South African company Woolworths Holdings, announced the temporary closure of stores until further notice on Saturday. Department store David Jones, which is also owned by Woolworths, will continue to operate its larger stores. \u201cAs a heritage Australian brand, we recognise that we have an important role to play in slowing the spread of COVID-19,\u201d Country Road said in a statement posted online. \u201cThis is a decision that has not been made lightly, and one we feel is necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of our team, customers and wider community.\u201d All the brands will continue to trade online. The closures follow an announcement by competitor Myer on Friday that it would shut its shops from Sunday night. Have questions, news tips, or jokes you think our readers would enjoy? I\u2019m on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Thailand reported 109 new coronavirus cases and one death on Saturday, bringing the total to 1,245 infections and 6 deaths, the spokesman of the government\u2019s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said. The new cases are higher than the 91 reported on Friday. The latest death is of a patient with some prior health complication, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, the CCSA spokesman said. The Thai government on Friday ordered the closing down of more public facilities and businesses to curb the spread of coronavirus, and has extended existing closures until the end of April. The provinces of Narathiwat and Pattani in southern Thailand are in lockdown while several other provinces have issued orders to restrict the opening and closing times of 24-hour convenience stores. People in greater Tokyo and the Osaka area in western Japan hunkered down on Saturday as officials urged citizens to stay indoors to prevent a potential emergency, but some were carrying on as normal, Reuters reports. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike\u2019s plea for the tens of millions of people in the capital and surrounding regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until 12 April, and particularly this weekend, followed a surge in coronavirus infections this week that she said put Tokyo on the brink of an emergency. Koike urged the public to avoid the national pastime of congregating to drink and watch the cherry blossoms as they hit their peak in the capital, saying on Friday, \u201cThe cherry blossoms will bloom again next year.\u201d Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,400, with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month. Hit early by the coronavirus in its initial spread from China, Japan had seen a more gradual rise than the recent surge in much of Europe and the United States. This week, however, saw an acceleration that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called \u201ca national crisis\u201d. Infections on Friday rose by a daily record 102, said public broadcaster NHK. Tokyo reported 40 new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 299. Moody\u2019s downgraded South Africa\u2019s sovereign credit rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status on Friday, heaping more pain on an economy already in recession and now staring down the barrel of a steep contraction over the global coronavirus pandemic. The ratings firm downgraded the rating one notch to \u2018Ba1\u2019 from \u2018Baa3\u2019 and maintained a negative outlook, meaning another downgrade could follow if the economy performs worse or government debt rises faster than expected. An annual budget in February showed a worsening of the fiscal picture, and the country entered a 21-day nationwide lockdown on Friday that will dent output as workers have been told to stay at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The local Eye Witness News channel reported that homeless people living in the city of Durban said they had been taken to a reception centre against their will: South Africa\u2019s finance ministry said the downgrade would add to prevailing financial market stress. Moody\u2019s said the main driver behind the downgrade was \u201cthe continuing deterioration in fiscal strength and structurally very weak growth\u201d. \u201cThe rapid spread of the coronavirus outbreak will exacerbate South Africa\u2019s economic and fiscal challenges and will complicate the emergence of effective policy responses,\u201d it added. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said the government was not \u201ctrembling in our boots\u201d and was committed to reforms to address weak growth and ailing state-owned companies. The agency is the last of the big three agencies to downgrade Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy to sub-investment grade, after S&amp;P Global and Fitch moved there in 2017. Moody\u2019s left South Africa on the brink of junk in November after it revised the outlook on its rating to negative following a bleak mid-term budget. NSW Health have also revealed that more than 100 Australian doctors and dentists, who were stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile, have today returned to Australia. Last week, we reported the doctors were on board as part of a medical convention when Chile banned cruise vessels from docking. Today NSW Health confirmed they had returned and none were identified as being \u201cunwell\u201d. \u201cTwo international flights arrived in Sydney overnight and this morning with 245 passengers...These passengers include numerous doctors and nurses who had been attending a health convention on-board who had not been able to berth off the South American coast,\u201d the departmnet said. \u201cAirport screening was immediately commenced, including symptom assessment and temperature, and no passengers were identified as being unwell. \u201cAll passengers are subject to the requirement for 14 day isolation under ministerial direction. This includes those who were able to safety return to their place of residence as well as around 150 people who are in quarantine in two Sydney hotels.\u201d China\u2019s official media told people to stay on guard against the coronavirus on Saturday, and restrictions on foreigners entering went into effect, as the country reported no new locally transmitted infections and a small drop in imported cases. \u201cAt this time, we must be extremely vigilant and cautious, and we must prevent the post-epidemic relaxation from coming too soon, leading to the loss of all our achievements,\u201d the Communist Party\u2019s official People\u2019s Daily newspaper said in a front-page editorial. The authorities also reversed planned re-openings of movie theatres, the state-owned China Securities Journal reported, citing sources. Reuters could not verify the existence of the National Film Administration\u2019s order to extend cinema closures, but a man answering the phone at a Wanda Cinemas theatre in Shanghai confirmed it had been ordered to close again. Theatres in major cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chongqing, remained closed, searches on an online ticketing platform showed. Effective Saturday, China has suspended the entry of foreign nationals with valid Chinese visas and residence permits. Beijing has also ordered airlines to sharply cut international flights from Sunday. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier, one of which was transmitted locally. The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,394, with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said. A reminder that UK prime minister Boris Johnson became the first major world leader to test positive for Covid-19 in Friday night. On 3 March, Johnson boasted that he was continuing to shake hands with \u2018everybody\u2019, including people who had tested positive for Covid-19. On another day of rapid growth in the number of deaths caused by the virus, Johnson issued a video message revealing that he had developed \u201cmild symptoms\u201d,write Heather Stewart, Matthew Weaver and Kate Proctor write for the Guardian. But he added: \u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus.\u201d Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, was subsequently spotted running out of No 10 and along Downing Street, apparently hoping not to be noticed. Not long afterwards, Hancock issued his own statement saying he too had tested positive, and would be working from home. And later in the day, Prof Whitty, who had advised the prime minister to get tested, said he too was displaying symptoms. In other news: US cases passed 100,000. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known US infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead. Italy overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Italy also recorded the highest daily rise in deaths on Friday. With 969 fatalities, it was the highest one-day increase anywhere so far since the outbreak began, AFP reports. The new fatalities took the country\u2019s total to 9,134. The number of cases topped 86,498 according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The head of the country\u2019s national health institute warned that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday. In an attempt to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, states across the country implemented fines, closed beaches and threatened stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home. The death toll from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive for the virus, according to NSW health officials. A global shortage of condoms is looming. The world\u2019s biggest producer or condoms warned of a global shortage after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Malaysia\u2019s Karex Bhd makes one in every five condoms globally, normally marketed internationally by brands such as Durex, supplied to state healthcare systems such as Britain\u2019s NHS or distributed by aid programmes such as the UN Population Fund, Reuters reports. Iranian doctors say \u2018hundreds\u2019 have died after ingesting toxic methanol. An Iranian doctor said hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus. Passengers on cruise ship stranded off Panama coast issue desperate plea. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick report. Argentina saw a record jump in cases. Despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20, the country reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. South Korea reports highest new cases in a week. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. No new domestic infections in China. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. Just a reminder that you can get in touch with me, Helen Sullivan, any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Australia stepped up enforcement of social distancing rules on Saturday to contain community transmission of the novel coronavirus, implementing fines, closing beaches and threatening stricter measures if people defy pleas to stay at home, Reuters reports. The death toll from the virus rose to 14 after an elderly woman died in an aged-care facility in New South Wales, where several residents and employees have tested positive for the virus, according to NSW health officials. The country\u2019s total number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 212 to 3,378 early on Saturday, two-thirds of them in NSW and Victoria states, according to the federal heath ministry. The infection rate in Australia remains slower than in many other countries, although it is accelerating, especially in the most populous states of NSW and Victoria where more than half of the country\u2019s 25.5 million people live. As of midnight on Saturday, all returning citizens from abroad will be put into compulsory quarantine in hotels for two weeks at the government\u2019s expense. Military personnel will help ensure travellers comply with the new rules. Australia\u2019s state and federal governments have sent some mixed messages about social distancing and other containment measures, leading to widespread confusion. While there is no national order to stay home, entertainment and other mass-gathering venues have been shut and authorities have urged people to cancel house parties and other social gatherings. In Victoria, police closed beaches on Saturday after hundreds of people flocked to the waterside a day earlier in a repeat of scenes the previous weekend at Sydney\u2019s Bondi beach. Police raided a party at a backpacker hostel at Bondi on Friday night, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported. In Queensland state more than one million people headed to polling stations on Saturday for council elections, and were asked to bring their own pens and maintain distances of 1.5 metres (5 feet), the state government said. A global shortage of condoms is looming, the world\u2019s biggest producer said, after a coronavirus lockdown forced it to shut down production. Malaysia\u2019s Karex Bhd makes one in every five condoms globally. It has not produced a single condom from its three Malaysian factories for more than a week due to a lockdown imposed by the government to halt the spread of the virus. That\u2019s already a shortfall of 100 million condoms, normally marketed internationally by brands such as Durex, supplied to state healthcare systems such as Britain\u2019s NHS or distributed by aid programmes such as the UN Population Fund. The company was given permission to restart production on Friday, but with only 50% of its workforce, under a special exemption for critical industries. \u201cIt will take time to jumpstart factories and we will struggle to keep up with demand at half capacity,\u201d Chief Executive Goh Miah Kiat told Reuters. \u201cWe are going to see a global shortage of condoms everywhere, which is going to be scary,\u201d he said. Malaysia is Southeast Asia\u2019s worst affected country, with 2,161 coronavirus infections and 26 deaths. The lockdown is due to remain in place at least until April 14. There are already more than 6,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients in New York, with almost 1,600 in intensive care, AP reports. The state has logged a nation-high of 519 deaths, and has more than 44,000 confirmed cases. An Iranian doctor says hundreds have died and thousands have been sickened from ingesting toxic methanol across the Islamic Republic out of the false belief it kills the new coronavirus, AP reports. Iranian media report nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. An Iranian doctor helping the country\u2019s Health Ministry told The Associated Press on Friday the problem was even greater, giving a death toll of around 480 with 2,850 people sickened. The poisonings come as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country. \u201cOther countries have only one problem, which is the new coronavirus pandemic. But we are fighting on two fronts here,\u201d said Dr. Hossein Hassanian, an adviser to Iran\u2019s Health Ministry who gave the higher figures to the AP. \u201cWe have to both cure the people with alcohol poisoning and also fight the coronavirus.\u201d Brunei reported its first coronavirus death on Saturday, that of a 64-year-old man. Brunei has reported 115 cases of the virus so far, some of which were linked to a religious gathering in Malaysia that authorities said had been attended by about 16,000 people. The man who died had not attended the gathering but had a history of travel to Malaysia and Cambodia. The director of one of Haiti\u2019s top hospitals was kidnapped on Friday, prompting staff to refuse to take in new patients in protest, as the impoverished country battles an outbreak of the novel coronavirus amid a spike in gang violence. Dr. Jerry Bitar, a surgeon, was kidnapped shortly after leaving for work at Hospital Bernard Mevs from his home in an upmarket neighborhood of the capital, hospital administrative assistant Carla Puzo told Reuters. \u201cThe relevant authorities are following the case,\u201d a Health Ministry spokesman said. \u201cThe Bernard Mevs hospital is a trauma and critical care center and is not treating coronavirus cases currently, but could need to if the disease spreads substantially in the country, where healthcare services and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate.\u201d Kidnappings for ransom have sharply increased this year amid a political and economic crisis in Haiti, which according to the World Bank is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Police confirmed 15 kidnapping cases in January alone. Gangs appear to strike indiscriminately, with victims ranging from Haitian schoolchildren, lawmakers and businessmen to foreign aid workers. \u201cHospital staff decided not to take any new cases for the time being,\u201d Puzo said. \u201cWe will continue to look after those already here.\u201d A crowd gathered outside the facility in solidarity with Bitar, who runs the hospital together with his twin brother, while staff chanted in unison calls for his release. Haitian media outlets also pleaded for bandits to free Bitar. Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson returned to Los Angeles on Friday after spending more than two weeks in quarantine in Australia after testing positive for the coronavirus. Hanks, a double Oscar winner and one of America\u2019s most beloved stars, and Wilson were the first big celebrities to announce they had tested positive for the disease. They were treated in hospital in Australia and isolated themselves for a further period after leaving. Hanks\u2019 last post on his Twitter account on Sunday said it had been two weeks since their first symptoms and that they were feeling better. Hanks was in Australia working on a movie about Elvis Presley when he announced on 11 March that he and Wilson had tested positive for the disease. Filming has since been shut down on the movie, and on hundreds of other film and television productions worldwide. A chilling video from New York records the wails of ambulance sirens on Friday night, as patients are rushed to buckling hospitals amid the coronavirus pandemic. The US has become the worst-affected country on earth, with more than 104,000 confirmed cases. New York state accounts for 44,000 of these. The video was posted to Twitter minutes ago by Pulitzer prize-winning science journalist Laurie Garrett: In the US, congress ensured that the legislation for the US$2.2tn rescue plan for American businesses creates multiple layers of accountability, despite president Donald Trump\u2019s declaration tat \u201cI\u2019ll be the oversight,\u201d when lawmakers were in the final days of drafting the plan, AP reports. The House passed the bill by voice vote on Friday and Trump immediately signed it. The new oversight system will test the relationship between the White House and Congress, which frayed after Democrats won the House and deteriorated severely during Trump\u2019s impeachment as officials flouted requests for witnesses and documents. Trump immediately threw the oversight provisions into question, writing in a signing statement Friday night that the new law contains several provisions that raise constitutional concerns.\u2019\u2019 Trump said a new inspector general intended to monitor spending under the law would not be bound by requirements to report to the Congress without delay. His administration will continue the practice of treating provisions like these as \u201cadvisory and non-binding,\u201d Trump said. Italy on Friday recorded the most daily deaths of any country since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. Italy showed a continuing downward trend in infection rates, however. The country overtook China to become the second-worst affected country after the US. Six of the 10 countries with the highest number of infections are in Europe, including the UK, according to Johns Hopkins University figures: US: 103,942 Italy: 86,498 China: 81,897 Spain: 65,719 Germany: 50,871 France: 33,402 Iran: 32,332 United Kingdom: 14,745 Switzerland: 12,928 South Korea: 9,332 There are 597,072 cases confirmed worldwide and 27,360 deaths. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said on Saturday, with the country suffering a rise in imported cases from Europe and the United States during recent days. Aid groups warn that without measures millions could die in low-income countries and war zones such as Syria and Yemen, where hygiene conditions are already dire, AFP reports. Across Africa, the official numbers are still relatively low with 83 deaths and over 3,200 confirmed cases on Friday, according to the African Union. But aid groups are sounding the alarm on the potentially devastating consequences of a severe outbreak in low-income and conflict-ridden countries, where healthcare systems are in tatters and hygiene conditions poor. Around the world three billion people lack access to running water and soap, which are the most basic weapons of protection against the virus, UN experts said. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres issued a stark warning last week: \u201cIf we let coronavirus spread like wildfire - especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world - it would kill millions of people.\u201d The UN chief announced a humanitarian relief plan on Wednesday, featuring an appeal for US$2bn dollars to help the world\u2019s poorest and most vulnerable people. As India and other South Asian nations work to stop the spread of the virus, they face another battle: reams of misinformation, AP reports. On Tuesday, Indians were ordered to stay indoors for three weeks in the worlds biggest coronavirus lockdown. In announcing the move, Modi reiterated the danger of misinformation. \u201cI appeal to you to beware of any kind of rumours or superstitions,\u201d the prime minister said. With the pandemic starting to gain a foothold in the region, social media sites are rife with bogus remedies, tales of magic cures and potentially hazardous medical advice. Experts are urging caution and warning that the coronavirus infodemic could have disastrous consequences. It\u2019s a trend also seen elsewhere and governments around the world have been urging citizens not to listen to or spread rumors about the pandemic. As we continue to report on the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, we\u2019re looking for stories of how this unprecedented crisis has affected couples, families, friends and communities. If you\u2019ve been separated from a loved one by lockdowns, have had to cancel your wedding or miss an important family event, we\u2019d like to hear from you. We\u2019re always interested in hearing what you may have done in response, too, or how you and your loved ones (and neighbours) are supporting each other in these trying times. Please do include photographs if you can and are happy for us to use them. Send me a message on Twitter @helenrsullivan, tag me in a tweet of your own (if you\u2019re happy for us to include it in the blog), or email me: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. Here\u2019s the latest from Australia, which announced its 14th coronavirus-related death on Saturday. From midnight anyone arriving at an Australian airport from overseas will be taken straight to a hotel. The Victorian and NSW premiers have explained how this will work: travellers will be given health checks and taken straight by bus to hotel rooms. They will be monitored by authorities to ensure they are adhering to quarantine and so they can be given treatment if they become unwell. They will be provided with food. Another airline support package has been announced to support regional communities that depend on aviation for medical and food supplies. The additional $198m was announced by the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, with about 140 communities relying on regional aviation. Victoria and South Australia have followed NSW in introducing on-the-spot fines for businesses and individuals breaching social distancing restrictions. Total job losses across Australia have exceeded 75,000. Queenslanders are heading to the polls for local government elections and two state byelections, with the state\u2019s Covid-19 total now at 625. Pleas for safe harbour from stranded cruise ship near Panama Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued a desperate plea to be allowed to dock after four people died during a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the Guardian\u2019s Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick report. Two people have tested positive for the disease and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam luxury cruise liner, which has not been able to dock after several Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic. Hundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens are in isolation in their rooms and a boat-to-boat operation is underway to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, over the weekend. But there are fears that sick, elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during a global pandemic, with some on board isolating in small, humid cabins with no natural light or fresh air. The latest leap in coronavirus cases has set a new record in Argentina, as the country braces for an expected sharp increase in cases over the coming weeks \u2013 despite the full national lockdown declared on March 20. The total has reached 690 cases and 17 deaths so far, with 101 new cases and five deaths reported Friday. The capital city of Buenos Aires is the worst hit, with 223 cases, followed by the province of Buenos Aires with 193. The country locked its borders to its own citizens even more tightly Friday, closing the northern border crossing at Foz de Iguaz\u00fa to Argentinians trying to enter the country on land from Brazil. President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez ordered the halt of repatriation flights this week on the suspicion of persons hiding their symptoms by lying about their health and taking paracetamol to lower their fever before boarding planes. Some 15 thousand Argentinians have been left stranded abroad, mainly in Brazil, Cuba, Mexico, Peru, the US, Spain, Italy and the UK. Repatriations will be considered on a case by case basis, with travelers who left the country after March 13, when the government had already put in place its first measures against the pandemic, to be awarded the lowest priority, authorities said. A line of cheap credit for small and medium-sized companies having trouble paying wages during the lockdown was announced by Argentina\u2019s national bank, Banco Naci\u00f3n, Friday. The loans carry a yearly interest rate of 24%, high by international standards, but still less than half the country\u2019s annual inflation rate of 50%. In the US, Donuts Delite in Rochester is selling doughnuts featuring the face of Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s \u2013 the doctor leading the US battle with coronavirus \u2013 surrounded by white frosting and topped off with patriotic sprinkles. The exclusive treats have been selling \u201clike crazy\u201d since the store put them on display Monday, according to Nick Semeraro, franchisee of the caf\u00e9, AP reports. It appears the city of Los Angeles inadvertently notified more than 200 people about their Covid-19 results in a mass email that included the names of all recipients, according to LA Times reporter Soumya Karlamangla: The mass email, which reportedly failed to blind copy the recipients, was informing them of negative results, according to a screenshot posted by Karlamangla, who noted this was a major privacy violation: The email came from someone listed as a contract specialist for the mayor\u2019s office of public safety, writing on behalf of the health department\u2019s Covid-19 response team. Spokespeople for the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment this afternoon. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said Friday he will maintain his busy travel schedule dedicating infrastructure projects around Mexico in spite of growing restrictions prompted by the coronavirus, including a shutdown of most federal government operations, the Associated Press reports. L\u00f3pez Obrador took a commercial flight to the western state of Nayarit and then was heading to the northern border state of Baja California before finishing the weekend in Sinaloa. However, the president said he doesn\u2019t want people gathering in airports to see him like they usually do to shake hands and request selfies with him. He was criticized last weekend on a similar swing in the southern state of Oaxaca for stopping to eat in a local restaurant and for urging Mexicans to continue to eat out in spite of the virus. He said Friday he would continue to evaluate the situation, but for now planned to continue travelling. Mexico reported 717 cases of the coronavirus and 12 deaths as of Friday night. And here is a tweet about Boris Johnson testing positive for coronavirus: Here\u2019s the clip of US president Donald Trump saying on Friday that he had a conversation with UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for coronavirus, and \u201cthe first thing he said to me is: \u2018We need ventilators\u2019\u201d. Trump mentioned Johnson \u201casking for ventilators today\u201d twice during the Coronavirus Task Force briefing. Thirty-nine Australians who were on board the Costa Luminosa, and are now trapped in quarantine in Rome, have gotten word that at least two of their international shipmates have died, Matilda Boseley reports for the Guardian. Italian authorities demanded the group isolated for two weeks before returning to Australia after Coronavruis infections broke out on board their cruise ship. They may soon be joined by 200 Australian\u2019s on the Costa Victoria. The Australian state of New South Wales has confirmed 212 new cases of the virus since yesterday, bringing the state total to 1,617 confirmed cases. The state is the worst-affected by the virus. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said 84,907 people have been tested and excluded. Of those infected, 22 are in intensive care. There was a death overnight: a 91 year-old woman who was a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility. The death toll in the state is now eight. Australia has the 19th-highest number of cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The total number of cases is 3,378, according to the health department. From midnight on Saturday all people arriving in Australia will be put into a mandatory 14 day quarantine in hotels and other accommodation. Hospital ship arrives in LA as California braces for crisis on par with New York The Mercy hospital ship docked on Friday morning at the Port of Los Angeles, joining California\u2019s battle against the coronavirus as the state prepares to meet New York City levels of demand on hospitals, possibly within days. The Mercy is one of two supertankers the navy converted to a floating hospital. Typically deployed to provide disaster relief, the ship has fully equipped operating rooms, a 1,000-bed hospital facility, a medical laboratory, a pharmacy, and a landing deck for military helicopters. Speaking from an afternoon press conference, with navy ships as a backdrop, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said the Mercy was fully staffed and operational with 800 medical staffers and 12 operating rooms. It would be ready to start taking patients as early as tomorrow, Newsom said. Today, at the end of that contentious and partially accurate White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter asked Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2013 who has become a trusted figure for many Americans overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 whether over the course of his career he had experienced anything like the past month in the United States? While the HIV/AIDS epidemic was incredibly devastating, the suffering and deaths unfolded more slowly than what people around the world are experiencing now, Fauci said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now, in actual real time, is something that\u2019s unprecedented. This is something we have never seen before, at least in our generation. They\u2019ve seen maybe something like this 100 years ago.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really being challenged to not only learn in real time, to be able to respond in a way that\u2019s helpful an effective, we\u2019re also in uncharted waters. That is the thing that I find different...\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t as if we have an example of how to do it.\u201d During briefing, Trump feuds with state governors, makes false claims Two key moments from Trump\u2019s coronavirus briefing earlier today. Trump tossed out barbs at state governors he said have been insufficiently gracious to him, and said he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, just not to return their calls. (But added that Pence called them anyway.) And asked if his administration\u2019s belated push to manufacture or obtain 100,000 ventilators meant that everyone who needed a ventilator will be able to get one, he lashed out at the reporter asking the question, calling him a \u201cwise guy\u201d and complaining about all the problems he had inherited. A British man has described the \u2018gut-wrenching pain\u2019 of losing his mother to coronavirus. Stuart Hamlin urges people to stay inside in an emotional video filmed hours after his mother died from the coronavirus. He describes his pain just four days after Tracy was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. \u201cWe can\u2019t grieve. We can\u2019t comfort each other. We can\u2019t hold each other. Losing someone is hard enough, but not being able to hold your family close when you do is the most gut-wrenching pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life,\u201d he says. Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the US coronavirus crisis pleaded on Friday for more protective gear and equipment to treat waves of patients expected to overwhelm hospitals as the number of known U.S. infections surpassed 100,000, with more than 1,600 dead, Reuters reports. Physicians have called particular attention to a desperate need for additional ventilators, machines that help patients breathe and are widely needed for those suffering from Covid-19, the respiratory ailment caused by the highly contagious novel coronavirus. Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hot spots also have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff while the number of confirmed US cases rose by 15,000 on Friday to just over 100,000. That was down slightly from more than 16,000 new cases reported on Thursday, the largest one-day US surge to date, but kept the United States as the world leader in the number of known infections, having surpassed China and Italy on Thursday. In the US, Gizmodo is reporting that a 17-year-old boy has become the first coronavirus patient to die after being denied treatment because he lacked private health insurance. The Guardian is working to verify this story. Gizmodo reports: A 17-year-old boy in Los Angeles County who became the first teen believed to have died from complications with covid-19 in the U.S. was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn\u2019t have health insurance, according to R. Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, California. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have insurance, so they did not treat him,\u201d Parris said in a video posted to YouTube: Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, tweeted about the news, calling it \u201cbarbaric\u201d. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,394, with the death toll rising by 3 to 3,295, it said. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be taking you through the next few hours of important updates and breaking new as the number of cases worldwide moves towards 600,000. Both the US and Italy now have more cases than China, with 101,657 and 86,498 respectively. You can get in touch with me on Twitter throughout the day @helenrsullivan. Before we kick off, here\u2019s a summary of the main points so far: US President Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to built ventilators for hospitals, he announced at the White House\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. The Irish government has announced sweeping restrictions that will put Ireland in a de facto lockdown. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. He added: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system. The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths. In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases. Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. In a video posted on Twitter, Johnson confirmed he had developed \u201ca temperature and persistent cough\u201d over the last 24 hours. The UK prime minister, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus. Matt Hancock, the UK\u2019s health secretary, also tested positive. Spain recorded a new record single-day death toll. There have been 769 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,858. The previous record was 738, between Tuesday and Wednesday this week. The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday. The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332, while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded. South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19. There are now more than 1000 cases in the country. Firefighters, retired police officers and former ambulance workers are being drafted in to help the NHS. It comes as one in five police officers are off sick or self-isolating in areas worst hit by the virus. Italy recorded the highest daily rise in deaths and has not yet reached peak, experts say. Italy had 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended. France extended its lockdown by a fortnight. France has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d. A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, said the head of the French Hospital Federation. Four died on a cruise ship after the outbreak. Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed. The US approved a $2.2tn economic stimulus package. Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will warn every household in Britain that the coronavirus outbreak is likely to worsen and that he is prepared to tighten the nation\u2019s lockdown, after the UK suffered the biggest daily increase in its death toll. The country\u2019s 30 million households will receive a letter from the prime minister cautioning them that the worst is still ahead, along with details of the government\u2019s orders on social distancing, symptoms and handwashing, as ministers battle to prepare the NHS for the coming surge in cases. \u201cFrom the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time,\u201d Johnson says in the letter, which will land on doorsteps this week. \u201cWe will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to level with you \u2013 we know things will get worse before they get better. But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal \u2026 That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.\u201d The stark warning came as health chiefs reiterated that Britain will do well to keep deaths below 20,000 and warned against complacency. It follows new research from Imperial College London, which suggested Britain could suffer 5,700 deaths \u2013 far lower than previous estimates \u2013 should it follow the same path as China. \u201cNow is not the time to be complacent,\u201d warned Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England. \u201cIf we do reduce the deaths to a level which is below what we initially thought, I want to be absolutely clear, that won\u2019t be because we are somehow lucky. It will be because every citizen of this country, the British public, has complied with the instructions that the government has given based on the best scientific evidence.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has written in the Telegraph that mass testing as used in South Korea and Germany is the fastest way to end the lockdown. \u201cThe restaurants are open in South Korea. You can go shopping in Taiwan. Offices are open in Singapore,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cThese countries learned the hard way how to deal with a pandemic after the deadly Sars virus. They now show us how we can emerge from lockdown.\u201d Germany has carried out four times as many tests as the UK and recorded only 342 deaths from the virus. \u201cWhere you find it, you can isolate and contain it,\u201d Hunt wrote. \u201cAnd where you don\u2019t [find the virus], vital services continue to function. With mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission.\u201d With the number of coronavirus cases around the world passing 600,000, it emerged that: The UK death toll increased by 260 people over the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,019 so far. It was the largest daily increase since the outbreak began and the largest day-on-day percentage increase since 18 March. Police signalled they would take robust action against acts of deliberate coughing over elderly or vulnerable people, as officers said they had been made aware of several such allegations. Spain recorded another record daily death toll of 832, though health officials said that the outbreak may be peaking in some parts of the country. Deaths in Italy rose by 889 to 10,023 people. President Trump said he was considering a two-week quarantine for New York, New Jersey and parts of Connecticut as the number of Covid-19 cases in those states continued to climb. Meanwhile the business secretary, Alok Sharma, insisted there were \u201cno gaps in government\u201d despite the prime minister being among several senior figures to have entered self-isolation. Officials said that Boris Johnson still had only mild symptoms, after revealing on Friday that he had contracted the virus. He was working from 11 Downing Street on Saturday and will today chair a meeting of the Covid-19 war cabinet. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, is the latest cabinet minister to be self-isolating after he developed mild symptoms. A poll for the Observer shows the majority of the British public want even stricter measures put in place to combat the spread of the virus and believe that the government was too slow in responding to the pandemic. The latest Opinium poll suggested 57% of the public think the lockdown measures should go even further, while a third (33%) think there should be a ban placed on all public transport. A majority (56%) also think the government did not act fast enough. However, the vast majority of voters (92%) back the current lockdown measures and approval for the government\u2019s handling of the crisis is also growing. Ministers remain under pressure over the preparedness of the NHS. It has prioritised the testing and approval of new protective equipment amid continued complaints from NHS and care workers that they do not have access to the right protection. Coronavirus tests are also now being rolled out for NHS staff, with more test centres set to be opened in the next few days. Concerns remain over the number of ventilators and the speed at which more can be purchased. There are currently 8,000 available and another 8,000 said to be arriving in the next few weeks. Stefan Dr\u00e4ger, the head of ventilator manufacturer Dr\u00e4gerwerk, told German magazine Der Spiegel that the number of intensive care beds in England per capita was lower than Italy and five times lower than in Germany. \u201cThe challenge in England will be greater than in Spain,\u201d he warned. Downing Street officials have also said they are prepared to use the RAF to repatriate British nationals stuck overseas if commercial flights cannot be found. \u201cOur priority is commercial flights, but we do not rule out exceptional means if necessary,\u201d said one.",

Dr Habib Zaidi was a community GP in Essex who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-52040991\">died from suspected Covid-19</a> symptoms last Wednesday. Dr <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-52064450\">Adil El Tayar<del>lar</del></a> was a London-based organ transplant surgeon who believed he contracted the illness while working in hospitals in the West Midlands. There will very likely be more doctors, nurses and support staff who also lose their lives as a result of their critical work in treating patients with the virus. It is an appalling reminder that, every day, NHS and social care staff are putting their own lives at risk in order to save the lives of others.</p> <p>In recent days, the effort to ramp up the NHS\u2019s critical care capacity has been incredible. Work is well under way to build a new hospital at London\u2019s Excel centre: from next week, <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/03/new-nhs-nightingale-hospital-to-fight-coronavirus/\">NHS Nightingale</a> will provide 500 beds, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/excel-coronavirus-hospital-will-be-by-far-the-largest-in-the-uk\">space to expand to 4,000</a>; an incredible 27-fold increase in the capital\u2019s critical care beds. Similar hospital expansion programmes are getting under way in Birmingham and Manchester.</p> <p>It will, however, take an immense human effort from doctors, nurses and support staff to keep the NHS on its feet. Medical professionals will be drafted in from around the country to staff these extra beds; many will live on site and work physically and emotionally exhausting shifts in barely tolerable conditions. Up and down the country, doctors and nurses have said goodbye to their nearest and dearest, moving out of their family homes, or are sending children to live with relatives, potentially for months, in order to avoid putting them at risk. It is utterly awe-inspiring, and we salute their dedication to service. It will not be forgotten.</p> <p>But the dedication of medical professionals contrasts sharply with the lack of government preparedness \u2013 for example in procuring extra stocks of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and virus testing kits. It should have been clear from the evidence coming out of China from February onwards that the risks of a global pandemic, requiring significant additional medical resources, were very high indeed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A health system driven to the absolute limits of its capacity will inevitably be less resilient</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Yet it was only two weeks ago that the health minister, Matt Hancock, issued a public call for companies to contact the government and assist in ventilator production. Since then, extremely worrying details have emerged that suggest there was a lack of procurement competence within the government. Britain has not taken part in an EU joint procurement scheme for ventilators, which could have used the bloc\u2019s collective purchasing power to increase the stock of ventilators that the NHS has access to.</p> <p>At first, government sources claimed the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/no-10-boris-johnson-accused-of-putting-brexit-over-breathing-in-covid-19-ventilator-row\">decided not to participate because we are no longer a member of the EU</a>, and that the UK was \u201cmaking its own efforts\u201d to source extra ventilators. Then we were told that the government had accidentally missed the deadline; this was put down to \u201can initial communication problem\u201d. But Brussels publicly announced plans for a joint procurement process \u2013 widely reported in the press \u2013 weeks ago, and it has made clear that UK representatives were present at meetings where joint procurement was discussed.</p> <p>This oversight does nothing to allay fears that the government may have passed up on the opportunity to take part in an EU initiative to procure life-saving equipment for ideological reasons. Moreover, existing ventilator manufacturers in the UK say that, despite contacting the government with offers to ramp up their production, they have had little response. One company, Direct Access, contacted the Department for Business after sourcing 5,000 ventilators but heard nothing back, and after a few days the supplies were directed elsewhere.

Last week it emerged that in 2016 the Department of Health <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/advice-on-protective-gear-for-nhs-staff-was-rejected-owing-to-cost\">rejected expert advice</a> to increase PPE stockpiles against the risk of an influenza pandemic on the grounds of cost. This decision has had consequences: medical professionals continue to report that there are still shortages of equipment at the frontline. Some NHS trusts have been asking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/25/schools-asked-donate-science-goggles-nhs-use-face-shields\">schools to donate science goggles</a>; and some doctors report that they have sourced and paid for their own protective masks. Staff remain concerned that the reason that the UK advice on protective equipment diverges from that of the World Health Organization in some instances is to preserve limited supplies, rather than set out best practice.</p> <p>This is the sign of a health system that has been put under extreme pressure by inadequate levels of funding since 2010. A pandemic of this sort would always place intolerable strain on the NHS. But its impact will be worse as a result of a decade of underfunding that has left hospital bed occupancy rates regularly exceeding safe levels; elective operations cancelled due to capacity issues; critical care capacity at lower levels than most European countries; and a staffing crisis that has depleted the morale of frontline staff.</p> <p>A health system driven to the absolute limits of its capacity will inevitably be less resilient to this sort of extraordinary crisis than one that has a little breathing room. There will be unnecessary and avoidable deaths as a result. Today, we should applaud the extraordinary efforts being made by many across government to ready the NHS for the tsunami that is about to hit it. But the time will come to hold accountable those politicians who were so keen to wield unnecessary budget cuts as a badge of their Conservative credentials, while paying little heed to the consequences of their actions.</p>",

Mevalco of Avonmouth is delivering Spanish meats, sausages, beans and pulses. Henrietta Green Food Lover\u2019s Guide To Britain editor, founder of British Charcuterie Live I\u2019m isolating, so I\u2019m doing everything I can to support food business from indoors. I\u2019m trying to collect names of all independent charcuterie producers to help them sell online, so e-mail salami@britishcharcuterie.live if that helps you. Mac and Wild in the Scottish Highlands, which works with small, independent producers, is delivering nationwide. In London, Notting Hill Fish Supermarket has just set up a website, and is delivering to places nearby, while Crazy Baker in Kensal Green is getting bread to people that can\u2019t go out. Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy is also doing a great job getting out its cheese. Tips for a safe online delivery Do not open your door to the driver but instead make it clear when you place an order where your parcel can be safely left. Leave a tip if you can. Many drivers are on low wages and will only get statutory sick pay if they fall ill. Ideally, tip electronically online, in the app you ordered. from or over the phone, to avoid the risk of contamination via notes and coins. Wash your hands before opening goods, then dispose of packaging and wash again. If you are able to express your gratitude to your driver from a safe distance, do. Small gestures matter.",

We don\u2019t knock on doors and hand parcels over. If we can, we avoid all contact. Many couriers know the safe places where customers are happy for us to leave packages. If it needs a signature we knock, put the parcel down and step right back. </p> <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p> <p>Some might feel we shouldn\u2019t be out delivering packages but we are keeping people supplied with what they need. Normally you don\u2019t find out what\u2019s in the parcels but customers have started telling us. I\u2019ve been delivering to some families in Whitby for years and this is the first time I\u2019ve actually spoken to them.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p> <p>Some drivers are reporting peak volumes like they usually see at Christmas. I delivered a pair of warm joggers to an 82-year-old lady. She was worried about her heating bills going up with all the time she was spending indoors. I delivered some toys to a mother stuck at home. She told me I had saved her life because her kids were driving her up the wall. </p> <p><strong>Thursday</strong></p> <p>Rishi Sunak offers to cover 80% of the average monthly earnings for the self-employed. Then we get a real fright when Next announces that it will not be taking any more orders. If other suppliers close too, our jobs could be at risk. We are paid per parcel. If you are doing 100 parcels a day, that\u2019s, say, \u00a3100 a day \u2013 but if a major client shuts down then you might only deliver 50.</p> <p><strong>Friday</strong></p> <p>Today I only had 45 parcels. Normally it\u2019s 70 to 80 \u2013 it has almost halved. There are couriers who will be on the breadline if they lose work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><br><strong>Steve Avery, </strong><strong>supermarket worker, Essex</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce2f5d32fbe35e05e8997dafb212eb11e5321763\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce2f5d32fbe35e05e8997dafb212eb11e5321763/0_103_1600_961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Avery on duty in his store.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Avery on duty in his store.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Steve Avery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Monday</strong></p> <p>For the last few weeks I\u2019ve been coming into contact with hundreds of people each day at work. It makes me feel apprehensive and worries my wife. We\u2019ve had lots of people abusing staff and panic-buying.

If we can, we avoid all contact. Many couriers know the safe places where customers are happy for us to leave packages. If it needs a signature we knock, put the parcel down and step right back. Tuesday Some might feel we shouldn\u2019t be out delivering packages but we are keeping people supplied with what they need. Normally you don\u2019t find out what\u2019s in the parcels but customers have started telling us. I\u2019ve been delivering to some families in Whitby for years and this is the first time I\u2019ve actually spoken to them. Wednesday Some drivers are reporting peak volumes like they usually see at Christmas. I delivered a pair of warm joggers to an 82-year-old lady. She was worried about her heating bills going up with all the time she was spending indoors. I delivered some toys to a mother stuck at home. She told me I had saved her life because her kids were driving her up the wall. Thursday Rishi Sunak offers to cover 80% of the average monthly earnings for the self-employed. Then we get a real fright when Next announces that it will not be taking any more orders. If other suppliers close too, our jobs could be at risk. We are paid per parcel. If you are doing 100 parcels a day, that\u2019s, say, \u00a3100 a day \u2013 but if a major client shuts down then you might only deliver 50. Friday Today I only had 45 parcels. Normally it\u2019s 70 to 80 \u2013 it has almost halved. There are couriers who will be on the breadline if they lose work. Steve Avery, supermarket worker, Essex Monday For the last few weeks I\u2019ve been coming into contact with hundreds of people each day at work. It makes me feel apprehensive and worries my wife. We\u2019ve had lots of people abusing staff and panic-buying. I spend the evening hoping everything will get a bit calmer during the lockdown. Tuesday When I arrive at work at 5.40am there is already a queue of between 100 and 200 people outside. I spend most of the day restocking the shelves.

      "body": "<p>Capitalist orthodoxies fail in the face of \u201ca crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity\u201d, writes Andrew Rawnsley (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-crisis-ignites-bonfire-of-conservative-orthodoxies\" title=\"\">Comment</a>). Precisely, and this is why a similar approach is needed to confront the climate emergency \u2013 and why rightwing governments will fail to do so unless they adopt a leftwing approach that does not prioritise market and profit and instead sees the merits of massive state intervention. And the coronavirus crisis rather pointedly undermines Philip Cerny\u2019s remark that the nation state cannot have a key role in this (\u201cMy solution to the climate crisis\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/letters-give-boris-johnson-his-moment-for-now\" title=\"\">Letters</a>). What we are learning now is the importance, yes, of individual responsibility and local initiatives but also of decisive governmental action to enforce the suspension of business as usual, and of international cooperation. The only other essential element is a recognition that the climate emergency is just as pressing and very much more of a mortal threat than even the current pandemic.<br><strong>Jem Whiteley</strong><br>Oxford<br></p> <p>I read with interest the interview with Professor Tim Lang with its important messages and mention of Covid-19 (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis\" title=\"\">Why our food supply system doesn\u2019t work</a>\u201d, Focus). I too am concerned about the UK\u2019s food supply chains, given it imports at least half of its food. If imports of food, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables, decline because countries like Spain and Italy are going to struggle to feed themselves because of this pandemic, this would affect the diet of the UK\u2019s population, particularly the elderly, young and disadvantaged. It would be reassuring to know what the UK government\u2019s contingency plans are.</p> <p>Furthermore, given the likely longer-term nature of the pandemic, we should also instigate the free distribution of these foods and vitamins for the elderly in our care homes and similar institutions throughout the UK, as a matter of urgency. Vulnerable elderly people have been told to self-isolate, possibly for many months, which will reduce their exposure to sunshine, which is essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin D. <br><strong>Dr Laurence Harbige</strong><br>London E4<br></p> <p>Your Sport section detailed two sums of \u00a350,000 being donated by each of Manchester\u2019s richest clubs, United and City, to their local food bank (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/united-and-city-donate-combined-100000-to-manchester-food-banks\" title=\"\">United and City donate combined \u00a3100,000 to Manchester food banks</a>\u201d). An act to be applauded. However, you omitted to mention that Stockport County, playing in the league\u2019s fifth tier, and with a somewhat lower financial income, has donated the sum of \u00a375,000 to its local NHS foundation trust charitable fund to help support the staff looking after local people in these troubled times. Perhaps a mention of this fact might be worthy of consideration.<br><strong>Dave Johnson</strong><br>Hayfield, High Peak<br>Derbyshire<br></p> <h2>Good move, BBC<br></h2> <p>I gave up watching <em>Question Time </em>(\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/22/bbc-question-time-far-right-audience\" title=\"\">BBC\u2019s <em>Question Time</em> accused of giving platform to far right</a>\u201d, last week) several years ago, when questions and comments from the audience persistently ran the full gamut from neo-Nazism to proactive idiocy, laced with an occasional smattering of common sense and decency. While audience applause would often imply a more balanced composition, spoken emphasis was consistently on the right, and had a nasty ring to it. Last week\u2019s <em>QT</em> was great \u2013 I found politicians I thought I loathed rather nuanced and interesting, the discussion became constructive and illuminating, and we could at last see why the BBC chose Fiona Bruce. Good move, BBC! Fiona, Keep it up! <br><strong>Marcia Saunders</strong><br>London N10</p> <h2>Keep challenging, Lucy<br></h2> <p>I\u2019m writing with regard to the article about <em>University Challenge</em> by Lucy Clarke from Jesus College, Oxford (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/22/university-challenge-social-media-abuse-lucy-clarke\" title=\"\">I loved appearing on University Challenge. Then I went on Twitter\u2026</a>\u201d, Viewpoint). It saddens me greatly that, since her appearance, Lucy has received such vile and ignorant comments on social media. I would like to assure Lucy that there are many of us men out there who do not judge the contestants (of whatever gender) by their appearance, nor indeed by the sounds of their voices. I do take note of who is, and who is not, answering questions, but this is certainly not gender-related; it is simply a reflection of the comparative ability of contestants. I advise Lucy to ignore puerile and prejudicial comments, because they are just not worth your time and energy. They are written by people who probably can\u2019t even operate a Biro, never mind answer a question on <em>University Challenge</em>.<br><strong>Jon Gruffydd</strong><br>Crughywel<br>Powys<br></p> <h2>Disastrous Lib Dems<br></h2> <p>Barbara Ellen defends the Liberals\u2019 claims during their disastrous 2019 election campaign as a tactic to \u201cdistance the Liberals from Labour\u201d in Tory seats (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/reese-witherspoon-metoo-death-penalty-india-liberal-democrats\" title=\"\">A shout-out to the Lib Dems, who at least were an option</a>\u201d, Comment). What a pity that the rest of us can\u2019t distance ourselves from the consequences of the 2010-15 rundown of the NHS and social care which Liberals voted for under Nick Clegg, or the Liberals\u2019 2015 endorsement of absurd Tory claims that it was Labour\u2019s investment in public services including the NHS \u2013 not the recklessness of the bankers \u2013 which was the cause of the global banking crisis, thereby legitimising the continued Tory rundown of the NHS in 2015-20.<br><strong>Christopher Clayton</strong><br>Waverton, Chester<br></p> <h2>Right trees in the right places<br></h2> <p>Your article, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/conifer-oak-britain-forest-change-to-meet-climate-targets\" title=\"\">Fewer oaks, more conifers: Britain\u2019s forests must change to meet climate targets</a>\u201d (News), is a prime example of not seeing the wood for the trees. Yes, there are trade-offs between the types of woodland we create: exotic conifers suck carbon out of the atmosphere faster, whilst native broadleaved species grow more slowly but tend to support more species of wildlife. But endless infighting between foresters and conservationists risks obscuring the bigger picture.</p> <p>We face a dual ecological crisis \u2013 the climate emergency and the breakdown of nature. Friends of the Earth\u2019s analysis shows we easily have enough land to double UK tree cover.

      "bodyText": "Capitalist orthodoxies fail in the face of \u201ca crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity\u201d, writes Andrew Rawnsley (Comment). Precisely, and this is why a similar approach is needed to confront the climate emergency \u2013 and why rightwing governments will fail to do so unless they adopt a leftwing approach that does not prioritise market and profit and instead sees the merits of massive state intervention. And the coronavirus crisis rather pointedly undermines Philip Cerny\u2019s remark that the nation state cannot have a key role in this (\u201cMy solution to the climate crisis\u201d, Letters). What we are learning now is the importance, yes, of individual responsibility and local initiatives but also of decisive governmental action to enforce the suspension of business as usual, and of international cooperation. The only other essential element is a recognition that the climate emergency is just as pressing and very much more of a mortal threat than even the current pandemic. Jem Whiteley Oxford I read with interest the interview with Professor Tim Lang with its important messages and mention of Covid-19 (\u201cWhy our food supply system doesn\u2019t work\u201d, Focus). I too am concerned about the UK\u2019s food supply chains, given it imports at least half of its food. If imports of food, particularly fresh fruit and vegetables, decline because countries like Spain and Italy are going to struggle to feed themselves because of this pandemic, this would affect the diet of the UK\u2019s population, particularly the elderly, young and disadvantaged. It would be reassuring to know what the UK government\u2019s contingency plans are. Furthermore, given the likely longer-term nature of the pandemic, we should also instigate the free distribution of these foods and vitamins for the elderly in our care homes and similar institutions throughout the UK, as a matter of urgency. Vulnerable elderly people have been told to self-isolate, possibly for many months, which will reduce their exposure to sunshine, which is essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin D. Dr Laurence Harbige London E4 Your Sport section detailed two sums of \u00a350,000 being donated by each of Manchester\u2019s richest clubs, United and City, to their local food bank (\u201cUnited and City donate combined \u00a3100,000 to Manchester food banks\u201d). An act to be applauded. However, you omitted to mention that Stockport County, playing in the league\u2019s fifth tier, and with a somewhat lower financial income, has donated the sum of \u00a375,000 to its local NHS foundation trust charitable fund to help support the staff looking after local people in these troubled times. Perhaps a mention of this fact might be worthy of consideration. Dave Johnson Hayfield, High Peak Derbyshire Good move, BBC I gave up watching Question Time (\u201cBBC\u2019s Question Time accused of giving platform to far right\u201d, last week) several years ago, when questions and comments from the audience persistently ran the full gamut from neo-Nazism to proactive idiocy, laced with an occasional smattering of common sense and decency. While audience applause would often imply a more balanced composition, spoken emphasis was consistently on the right, and had a nasty ring to it. Last week\u2019s QT was great \u2013 I found politicians I thought I loathed rather nuanced and interesting, the discussion became constructive and illuminating, and we could at last see why the BBC chose Fiona Bruce. Good move, BBC! Fiona, Keep it up! Marcia Saunders London N10 Keep challenging, Lucy I\u2019m writing with regard to the article about University Challenge by Lucy Clarke from Jesus College, Oxford (\u201cI loved appearing on University Challenge. Then I went on Twitter\u2026\u201d, Viewpoint). It saddens me greatly that, since her appearance, Lucy has received such vile and ignorant comments on social media. I would like to assure Lucy that there are many of us men out there who do not judge the contestants (of whatever gender) by their appearance, nor indeed by the sounds of their voices. I do take note of who is, and who is not, answering questions, but this is certainly not gender-related; it is simply a reflection of the comparative ability of contestants. I advise Lucy to ignore puerile and prejudicial comments, because they are just not worth your time and energy. They are written by people who probably can\u2019t even operate a Biro, never mind answer a question on University Challenge. Jon Gruffydd Crughywel Powys Disastrous Lib Dems Barbara Ellen defends the Liberals\u2019 claims during their disastrous 2019 election campaign as a tactic to \u201cdistance the Liberals from Labour\u201d in Tory seats (\u201cA shout-out to the Lib Dems, who at least were an option\u201d, Comment). What a pity that the rest of us can\u2019t distance ourselves from the consequences of the 2010-15 rundown of the NHS and social care which Liberals voted for under Nick Clegg, or the Liberals\u2019 2015 endorsement of absurd Tory claims that it was Labour\u2019s investment in public services including the NHS \u2013 not the recklessness of the bankers \u2013 which was the cause of the global banking crisis, thereby legitimising the continued Tory rundown of the NHS in 2015-20. Christopher Clayton Waverton, Chester Right trees in the right places Your article, \u201cFewer oaks, more conifers: Britain\u2019s forests must change to meet climate targets\u201d (News), is a prime example of not seeing the wood for the trees. Yes, there are trade-offs between the types of woodland we create: exotic conifers suck carbon out of the atmosphere faster, whilst native broadleaved species grow more slowly but tend to support more species of wildlife. But endless infighting between foresters and conservationists risks obscuring the bigger picture. We face a dual ecological crisis \u2013 the climate emergency and the breakdown of nature. Friends of the Earth\u2019s analysis shows we easily have enough land to double UK tree cover. By growing the right trees in the right place, we can help lock up millions of tonnes of carbon and create much more space for wildlife. To achieve this we need a diverse group of approaches, including rewilded woods, sensitively planted commercial forests, bigger hedgerows, and agroforestry on farms. Rather than squabble over the details, let\u2019s collaborate to make this broader vision a reality. Guy Shrubsole, Friends of the Earth London SW9 What goes up\u2026 David Head asserts that science and technology have made little impact on the metaphors that we use in everyday life (\u201cMetaphorically speaking\u201d, Letters). Really?

      "bodyText": "I\u2019ve spent the last 22 years delving into the murkier corners of big business for my Your Problems column. It can be dispiriting work. The daily laments from customers have persuaded me that if corporate Britain has a conscience, it\u2019s been smothered by terms and conditions that stack the odds in favour of traders. When companies have bestirred themselves to right a wrong, it\u2019s because the prospect of a headline persuaded them. The coronavirus crisis has exposed the essence behind the glossy PR. While some firms \u2013 such as Sports Direct and Wetherspoons \u2013 may appear to have been ruthless in attempts to safeguard their profits, big-name brands from fashion labels to distilleries have diverted stocks and skills to helping combat the pandemic. And while insurance companies have raced to rewrite their terms and conditions to avoid payouts, small traders, whose income has dried up, are finding inventive ways to support local communities. When I put out a call for examples of altruism in adversity, my inbox was transformed from protests to plaudits. Here are some of the heroes who are turning a crisis into an opportunity to serve. Transport Companies from airlines to boat hire have seen business evaporate in the space of a fortnight, but some are deploying their idle fleets at their own expense to provide relief and respite. Tour operator Barnes Coaches has mobilised its eight minibuses to run free errands for those self isolating. The firm, which faces a dismal 100th birthday this year, will dispatch drivers anywhere within its usual pick-up area, which stretches 50 miles from Cirencester to Aldermaston, to deliver food and prescriptions. \u201cOur income has gone to zero almost overnight, but we\u2019re a family firm and we always put people first,\u201d says manager Ross McKay. \u201cOur first call was from a lady with cancer who needed urgent medicine. The pharmacy had shut, so her prescription needed to be transferred to another one, which involved a lot of phoning. But we got it to her within the hour.\u201d When bookings for canal boat holidays vanished, Norbury Wharf, near Stafford, decided to offer its boats for free to key workers needing to self-isolate. \u201cNobody needs that sort of break more than the people trying to keep us safe \u2013 doctors, nurses and ambulance staff especially. And if they have to isolate, it makes sense to get away from everything for a time,\u201d says director David Ray. \u201cIt is probably easier on a boat than anywhere else and you\u2019ll be seeing the countryside like never before. All anyone has to do is call our office and we will happily book them in, subject to availability, even the next day.\u201d Weddings The wedding industry has taken one of the biggest hits as it nears its peak season. Those businesses that have insurance are unlikely to be covered for a pandemic and some face ruin. However, a number are still trying to help couples who have had to postpone or downsize their nuptials. Holly Winter, a bridal and prom dress designer, is offering to lend struggling brides sample dresses for free. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last year creating samples for the new season and invested thousands of pounds in advertising, photoshoots and exhibitions which will now come to nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cTo make something positive from this, brides can borrow my samples. Contact me and we can chat about what might fit. I can post it to them and they send it back afterwards.\u201d Anna Lewis specialises in wedding cakes. Faced with surplus ingredients after last-minute cancellations, she is baking cupcakes and macaroons to send to key workers and strangers who are self-isolating. \u201cI started the business last year and this was going to be my big year, with 15 weddings booked, but it\u2019s all collapsed overnight and my cash flow is gone,\u201d she says. \u201cI took cupcakes to the local paramedic station and to Sainsbury\u2019s staff after seeing how downtrodden and broken they are by the rudeness of some customers. I baked cakes for two people self-isolating on their birthdays. Now butter\u2019s hard to get hold of I\u2019m using my sugar stocks to make macaroons for three local hospitals.\u201d Wedding photographer Berni Palumbo has also seen her new business collapse. She is now giving free interactive photography tutorials for beginners on Facebook, and more than 100 are taking part. She has prepared a calendar of themes and delivers lessons in English and Italian. \u201cI work from home and suffer from depression, so I know what it\u2019s like to struggle,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a time to give and it\u2019s giving me motivation.\u201d Fashion When the British footwear and accessories brand Kurt Geiger was forced to close its 70 UK stores it pledged 55 gift cards worth \u00a3100 each to every intensive care unit in cities where it has a shop. It has also asked its 2,500 store staff to volunteer for community initiatives run by Age UK while they remain on the payroll. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that community life and extra acts of kindness will help build invaluable support in this unprecedented time, particularly for the vulnerable and isolated,\u201d says chief executive Neil Clifford, who is suspending his salary until the stores reopen. \u201cWe will be actively helping our teams to play their part in supporting those most in need within their local areas.\u201d The company will gift a pair of shoes daily to customers who are demonstrating kindness in their community via its Instagram channel @kurtgeiger and give NHS workers a 50% discount when lockdown is lifted. Food and drink A graduate startup that produces an energy drink is sending free crates to those in critical roles across the country and donating profits from its online sales to NHS charities. XITE Energy has delivered nearly 2,000 cans. \u201cWe have the Bristol Royal infirmary just down the road, so dropped some crates of XITE to them,\u201d says co-founder Oliver Bennett. \u201cIt got us thinking \u2013 we should send crates to as many key workers as we can across the UK to give them a pick-me-up.\u201d Meanwhile, farmer Jerome Challen, who runs a mail order company, Challen\u2019s Chicks, is supplying staff at his local hospital with 600 free eggs each week. \u201cDoctors and nurses were coming off long shifts to find supermarket shelves stripped so I thought I\u2019d give them something nutritious to take home and cook,\u201d he says. London-based restaurant group Berber &amp; Q decided to keep their employees in jobs by raising funds to cook meals for staff at two local hospitals. Their GoFundMe appeal has so far raised more than \u00a335,000, which funds labour and ingredients. While pubs have closed, brewer Wadworth has opened an online local to keep community spirits up. The Henry streams live music from local musicians, a weekly quiz, and workouts and cooking sessions. Private parking operators Parking companies are possibly the most reviled sector in my postbag, issuing enormous bills for tiny infringements. Even they are showing signs of a soul, however, by pledging free parking to NHS workers. Private parking enforcement agents, those traditional bogeymen, are to help marshal traffic and manage queues at supermarkets and other essential outlets. Meanwhile, NHS workers who register with the parking platform YourParkingSpace will be given a unique code enabling them to reserve spaces in nearly 950 car parks throughout the country. There are plans to extend the scheme to other key services workers, and the number of participating car parks should increase. Hopefully, I won\u2019t be hearing from doctors and nurses who have, nonetheless, been nabbed by parking enforcement vigilantes.",

Nothing to disturb except birdsong. \u2022 Sleeps 6, from \u00a3628 a week, qualitycottages.co.uk Hutty, Pembrokeshire For those aiming to get away from human contact and stay deep in nature, then Hutty, a two-person cabin, could be perfect. It sits in a 14-acre private nature reserve under the Preseli Hills, which the owners maintain alongside an organic farm and, to be truly perfectionist about this lack of human contact, there is no electricity but for the solar supply provided by an adapted boat switchboard. The loo and shower are a few steps away in the trees. The hand-built cabin itself is a compact ergonomic gem of rustic creativity: recycled timber, a woodburner and a massive bed with windows all around for a bit of stargazing or nature-watching. There\u2019s a small deck for eating outside with views down to the meadows by the Cleddau Wen river. There are plenty of walks along the steep-sided rocky valley with various neolithic monuments to explore (this is the area where, 5,000 years ago, the builders of Stonehenge sourced their three-tonne bluestones). \u2022 Sleeps 2, from \u00a385 a night, qualityunearthed.co.uk Tigh Anndra, Isle of Skye For a cottage with an epic mountain challenge on its doorstep, Tigh Anndra is the one. The Trotternish peninsula, a 19-mile finger of basalt that juts off the jagged northern coast of Skye, is home to the Trotternish Ridge walk, a gargantuan 23-mile trek through some of Scotland\u2019s most magnificent scenery. Fortunately, there are shorter alternatives: anyone staying here will want to see the nearby Old Man of Storr, a famous pillar of rock, and the Quiraing, an area of strange rock formations created by an ancient landslip. The house was once a shepherd\u2019s cottage and is a snug, stone-built retreat with a great patio view towards the hills. There\u2019s a logburner in the kitchen-diner-living room plus a TV and DVD, but no one would come here wanting to be indoors. The location is everything Access is by the bus from Portree, \u2013 just ask the driver to drop you at the door.. \u2022 Sleeps 2, from \u00a3279.50 for 3 nights in winter, \u00a3389 a week at other times, ihcottages.com Signal Box, Newtonmore, the Highlands My commitment to public transport access reaches its ultimate destination: a cottage that looks like a railway signalbox. It has essential tongue-and-groove cladding and first-floor windows overlooking a working railway line: the north-south route through the Cairngorms. Sad to say guests can\u2019t operate levers and signals from the bed, but it does mean this accommodation has the shortest walk of all our selections \u2013 the length of platform one, to be precise. Old signalmen would no doubt approve of its library, logburner and regular train noises, but they\u2019d find some surprises too \u2013 a sauna being one. Local walks include Creag Dubh, a magnificent 756m peak with a north-east ridge that rises up from the village of Newtonmore, as well as the 10km Wildcat Trail. \u2022 Sleeps 2, from \u00a3555 a week, sykescottages.co.uk",

As Spain becomes an increasingly worrying hotspot of the global pandemic, the Ifema centre has been turned, with help from the military, into one of the country\u2019s largest hospitals. Inside are thousands of beds, in row after precisely spaced row. Spain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll last week surpassed that of China, and is now second only to Italy\u2019s. Yesterday the number of deaths surged to a new record for the country, with 832 people dying in 24 hours. The virus has so far claimed 5,690 lives.

The revelation was a blow to a country that has long prided itself on good treatment of its elders. \u201cThis is the generation that lived through a horrendous civil war and post-war era,\u201d said Cumia. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re dying alone.\u201d As the country enters its third week of near-total lockdown, the number of confirmed cases has rocketed to 72,248. The actual figure is likely to be much higher, as people with mild symptoms have been told to self-isolate rather than seek testing. In some cities the surge in cases has left the country\u2019s healthcare system \u2013 ranked among the top 20 in the world \u2013 on the edge of collapse, its defences already weakened by austerity measures that shaved billions from its budget. \u201cMine is supposed to be a 265-bed hospital, and today it has 700 patients,\u201d said doctor Ana Gim\u00e9nez of Madrid\u2019s Infanta Leonor hospital. \u201cHundreds of people are sitting in chairs or lying on the floor\u2026 all of the hospitals in Madrid are absolutely overwhelmed.\u201d The situation is exacerbated by a lack of protective gear. \u201cWe don\u2019t have anything.

The experience I share with everyone else \u2013 trying to adjust to working from home, in my case alongside my husband and two children, aged 12 and 10 \u2013 now runs side-by-side with the experience of being one of the vulnerable, who cannot take a daily walk outside, who must keep their children three footsteps away at all times, and who would be stuck inside my house for 12 weeks even if other restrictions were lifted.</p> \n<p>In truth, my coronavirus paranoia had been raging for some time.</p> \n<p>One of the strangest aspects is that no matter how terrible my situation seemed, I never entirely thought I was going to die.</p> \n<p>There was always hope.

Checks and balances, different regimes and possible trials.

Oh, but before that could I come in on Friday, have a scan and give blood, just so they could see how my tumours were behaving?</p> \n<p>On Friday I went to Charing Cross Hospital in west London.

My PET scan was straightforward (and quicker than it can be). My bloods were taken, my injection given. I went home having touched nothing and followed my oncologist\u2019s advice to wash everything I was wearing and have a shower.</p> \n<p>Then the bad news. The scan suggested the cancer, subdued for so long, is growing. The oral chemo may not hold it. Weekly intravenous chemo could be the only answer. But what of the surge? My oncologist stressed again as she had at the beginning of the week that there would be no ICU bed if I caught coronavirus. This time I wasn\u2019t confused.</p> \n<p>So here we are.

      "body": "<p>Strange things happen in a crisis. For one, it can dawn on Mike Ashley that pretending that a sports shop is an essential public service is absurd. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/27/sports-direct-mike-ashley-apologises-for-poor-covid-19-actions\" title=\"\">Friday\u2019s apology from the Sports Direct founder</a> seemed to be more about communication \u2013 \u201cill-judged and poorly timed\u201d emails to overworked government ministers \u2013 than his original ludicrous attempt to keep his shops open, but it was still an uncharacteristic climbdown.</p> <p>Even JD Wetherspoon\u2019s Tim Martin, who has never previously appeared to give a damn what anyone thinks, paused to consider he may have made a mistake. Having announced staff would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/24/wetherspoons-denies-abandoning-staff-in-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">only be paid until the moment the pubs were shut</a>, he then said they would get their wages at the next payroll date provided the government agreed a reimbursement scheme in time.</p> <p>Can anything be read into these examples? Perhaps not. It is possible that freewheeling entrepreneurs, and British business in general, will revert to pre-crisis ways when the coronavirus emergency passes. There will, after all, be huge pressure from investors to recover lost revenues and restore battered share prices in the recovery phase.</p> <p>But, equally, this period of intense public scrutiny of business behaviour \u2013 where companies have been divided into heroes and villains \u2013 may produce lasting changes. One can speculate on a few.</p> <p>First, tolerance for corporate tax minimisation tactics will be roughly zero. The government will be facing a towering increase in public debt, plus a demand that more cash be spent on the NHS. It will need money from somewhere and could feel emboldened to chase perceived underpayers and financial engineers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07620e0e9e366caff937ef5b839c0838859ea28a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07620e0e9e366caff937ef5b839c0838859ea28a/0_68_4567_2740/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Martin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Martin: given pause.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So look out, private equity: a tactic of loading companies with debt to minimise tax payments may no longer be tolerated. Corporate Britain has been running too lightly on its shock absorbers. A tax system that rewards well-capitalised firms that can withstand a crisis would be an obvious improvement.</p> <p>Second, appetite for state interventions will increase. Train operating companies\u2019 franchises have been suspended for six months, but one doubts that rotten system will ever be restored. There is a strong case for seeing what the state can achieve instead. Privatised social care also looks ripe for a state takeover.</p> <p>Third, the balance of power could shift in the eternal battle over pay differentials. Will it still be considered acceptable for a chief executive to collect 100 times what the median worker in a firm is paid? Bosses at some firms have already volunteered for salary cuts during the crisis phase. Pressure to re-set pay arrangements permanently will be intense. Unions in the supermarket sector, for instance, would be well-advised to use the crisis to press for more for their members.</p> <p>Fourth, big companies\u2019 treatment of suppliers may come under the microscope. The crisis has exposed the fragile position of small firms that trade with the giants of their industry.

      "bodyText": "Strange things happen in a crisis. For one, it can dawn on Mike Ashley that pretending that a sports shop is an essential public service is absurd. Friday\u2019s apology from the Sports Direct founder seemed to be more about communication \u2013 \u201cill-judged and poorly timed\u201d emails to overworked government ministers \u2013 than his original ludicrous attempt to keep his shops open, but it was still an uncharacteristic climbdown. Even JD Wetherspoon\u2019s Tim Martin, who has never previously appeared to give a damn what anyone thinks, paused to consider he may have made a mistake. Having announced staff would only be paid until the moment the pubs were shut, he then said they would get their wages at the next payroll date provided the government agreed a reimbursement scheme in time. Can anything be read into these examples? Perhaps not. It is possible that freewheeling entrepreneurs, and British business in general, will revert to pre-crisis ways when the coronavirus emergency passes. There will, after all, be huge pressure from investors to recover lost revenues and restore battered share prices in the recovery phase. But, equally, this period of intense public scrutiny of business behaviour \u2013 where companies have been divided into heroes and villains \u2013 may produce lasting changes. One can speculate on a few. First, tolerance for corporate tax minimisation tactics will be roughly zero. The government will be facing a towering increase in public debt, plus a demand that more cash be spent on the NHS. It will need money from somewhere and could feel emboldened to chase perceived underpayers and financial engineers. So look out, private equity: a tactic of loading companies with debt to minimise tax payments may no longer be tolerated. Corporate Britain has been running too lightly on its shock absorbers. A tax system that rewards well-capitalised firms that can withstand a crisis would be an obvious improvement. Second, appetite for state interventions will increase. Train operating companies\u2019 franchises have been suspended for six months, but one doubts that rotten system will ever be restored. There is a strong case for seeing what the state can achieve instead. Privatised social care also looks ripe for a state takeover. Third, the balance of power could shift in the eternal battle over pay differentials. Will it still be considered acceptable for a chief executive to collect 100 times what the median worker in a firm is paid? Bosses at some firms have already volunteered for salary cuts during the crisis phase. Pressure to re-set pay arrangements permanently will be intense. Unions in the supermarket sector, for instance, would be well-advised to use the crisis to press for more for their members. Fourth, big companies\u2019 treatment of suppliers may come under the microscope. The crisis has exposed the fragile position of small firms that trade with the giants of their industry. Supermarkets have generally behaved honourably by accelerating payments, but Wetherspoons\u2019 refusal to pay suppliers until pubs reopen was as shocking as its approach to staff. The government now has an opportunity to change the rules of the payments game. Finally, the big unknown is how, or if, consumers\u2019 behaviour will change. Cheap trainers and cheap beer have perennial appeal, so it\u2019s probably fanciful to think that Sports Direct and Wetherspoons will suffer a backlash that causes them real difficulty. All the same, shoppers have had a rapid education in how companies behave when it matters most. Ethical radars have become more finely tuned. Companies that treat their workers and suppliers well should shout about it. They may find they are rewarded. In future, state aid must only go to firms making green commitments The economic contagion of the Covid-19 virus threatens to claim green investment as another casualty. Disruption to the environmental agenda is inevitable; the key question is whether the outbreak will slow the pace of clean energy developers for a few months only, or whether the renewable energy industry \u2013 and general progress towards green goals such as the Paris agreement \u2013 will be derailed for years. Last year was a record year forBritain\u2019s renewable energy generation in Britain: the UK\u2019s wind turbines, solar panels and bioenergy plants contributed more than a third of the nation\u2019s electricity. But if records are to continue being set in the UK, and across the world, then global leaders will need to make explicitly green policy choices. At the most basic level, the clean energy industry will face the same hurdles as many other sectors in the wake of the pandemic: a reduced workforce; a reliance on vulnerable, concentrated manufacturing hubs; and a greater struggle to access finance. But even as restrictions ease, deeper challenges will remain. The companies that the world relies on to meet our green ambitions will be financially battered by this sudden crash and the collapse of commodity prices. Governments too will be stretched by demands for bailouts to keep economies afloat. The answer must be to incentivise the progress of the clean energy industry by offering government support only to companies which promise to meet green targets. Airlines could commit to emissions reductions, carmakers to accelerating the shift to electric vehicles, and all companies should be sourcing at least some of their electricity from renewable generators. No company should be offered access to taxpayer life-support without proof that they can help find the green shoots in the rubble of the global economy. More US jobs will be lost if employers can\u2019t trust the White House The shocking US unemployment figures reported last week only look like getting worse as March draws to a close. Jobless claims surged to almost 3.3 million in the week ending 21 March. This week, the workers who could not previously contact state agencies to register for unemployment will join those more recently laid off, potentially pushing the increase nearer to 6 million or 7 million. The prospect of several months out of work will leave scars on a country where workers are expected to fund their skills training and education as much as their healthcare and housing. A $2 trillion bailout agreed by Congress that includes $250bn of cash to be paid directly to households is expected to limit the economic impact of Covid-19. It may also restrict the growth in unemployment if companies cut wages in the light of the government handout in order to keep staff on the payroll. What it won\u2019t do is leave workers in a position to simply pick up where they left off whenever the lockdown is lifted. Their employers may no longer exist.

Though primarily addressed to Conservatives, it is a thought-provoking read for those who are not. Since some of his analysis is shared within the Johnson government, it also offers some clues about their philosophy and intentions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This book is at its best when it challenges conventional right-wing thinking.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His diagnosis of what is wrong with Britain accurately includes corporate bureaucrats who have vastly enriched themselves while the real incomes of many of their workers have been stagnant.

      "bodyText": "What Dominic Cummings, the teacosy-wearing consigliere of Boris Johnson, is to the current regime at No 10, Nick Timothy was to Theresa May. He even had a svengalian beard. During that brief, and now largely forgotten, period when May appeared to be wildly popular, Timothy was her domineering co-chief of staff. In so much as there was anything you might call Mayism, he was the author of it. Then she fought her disastrous 2017 election campaign, in part at his urging and with a manifesto he co-authored, and the Tories lost their majority. \u201cMy phone rang. It was Theresa ... I could hear the disappointment and hurt and anger in her voice. There was terror, too. I had seen or heard her cry before, but this was different. She was sobbing. I remember thinking she sounded like a child who wanted to be told everything was just fine.\u201d He was thrown out of his job as May frantically struggled to cling on to her own. In a brisk opening chapter, he accepts some of the blame for what he calls \u201ca catastrophe\u201d while settling a few scores along the way. \u201cThis is bullshit,\u201d spits Lynton Crosby, the Australian campaign consultant, when the exit poll accurately forecasts a hung parliament. Philip Hammond was never on board for ending austerity and improving the life chances of the less privileged. Timothy reports the then chancellor sneering: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to actually do any of this stuff. You\u2019re miles ahead in the polls just talking about it.\u201d Though the author is describing quite recent events, this now reads like an account from a very distant time. This was the era before the 2019 election when Johnson won the Tory majority that May couldn\u2019t. Before we\u2019d left the EU. Before the coronavirus crisis, the scale of which makes all other politics look exceedingly small and gives a petty flavour to tales of past personality clashes. That said, there is continuing relevance to this book, the greater part of which is an attempt to diagnose what Timothy calls a \u201cpolitical and cultural crisis\u201d in the democracies. Though primarily addressed to Conservatives, it is a thought-provoking read for those who are not. Since some of his analysis is shared within the Johnson government, it also offers some clues about their philosophy and intentions. His diagnosis of what is wrong with Britain accurately includes corporate bureaucrats who have vastly enriched themselves while the real incomes of many of their workers have been stagnant. A fixation with driving up the number of young people going to university has seen the woeful neglect of vocational education. Prosperity has been far too concentrated, leaving many sections of society to feel that it has passed them by. Much political discourse has been toxified. All this and more he blames on what he calls the \u201cultra-liberals\u201d who \u201chave taken community and nation for granted\u201d. In its rightwing form, this has led to an over-reverence of free markets and an unthinking embrace of globalisation. In its leftwing form, it has corrupted classic liberalism (representative government, pluralism, checks and balances, free speech) into an obsession with \u201cgroup rights\u201d, a \u201cno-platforming\u201d intolerance of contrary opinions, and a neglect of the importance of place. He strikes home with some of his criticisms, but his attack on \u201cideological ultra-liberals\u201d, a category so baggy that it could include George Osborne, Nick Clegg and Jeremy Corbyn, is too bludgeoning and sweeping to be persuasive.

Some have been applauded for their actions \u2013 making donations to health workers, for instance \u2013 while others have quickly fallen foul of politicians, the public and their own workers. Here is a list of those who deserve plaudits and brickbats so far. Plaudits \u2013 retail Co-op The food retailer is taking on 5,000 extra store workers to cope with increased demand, offering temporary employment to hospitality workers who have lost their jobs. People can apply for jobs directly in their local branch. And the 6,500 pupils at 25 Co-op Academy schools who receive free school meals are being given a \u00a320 weekly voucher while schools remain shut. Timpson The retail chain, which provides shoe repair, dry cleaning and key-cutting services, says it will keep its 5,500 employees on full pay while its shops remain closed. Lloyds Pharmacy The chain is hiring 1,500 staff so that it can continue delivering prescriptions and healthcare services. The company has also recruited 406 pharmacy students to bolster its staff. Plaudits \u2013 hospitality Fullers The pub and hotel chain with over 400 sites has said it will not seek rent payments from its tenanted pubs. Whitbread The owner of the Premier Inn chain and restaurants including Beefeater and Brewers Fayre is putting some employees on a temporary furlough while its sites remain closed. But it will keep them on full pay by topping up the extra 20% of their wages not covered by the government scheme. Whitbread says it is in discussions with the government about providing rooms in its hotels, located near hospitals, to key workers. Leon The restaurant chain is keeping certain branches open to NHS employees and other key workers, and providing takeaway and delivery meals to NHS workers with a 50% discount. It is also bringing together other restaurants, food distributors and suppliers to deliver free daily hot meals to NHS critical care staff. FeedNHS \u2013 also backed by the Wasabi, Abokado and Franco Manca chains \u2013 will deliver 5,600 meals a day to five major hospitals belonging to two London healthcare trusts. Pret a Manger Before the chain was ordered to close, it was offering free hot drinks and a 50% discount on all other purchases for all NHS workers. Plaudits \u2013 banks Lloyds The bank has suspended 780 planned job cuts across its bank branches, amid a surge in demand and uncertainty over how many staff may need to self-isolate. An internal letter explained it was \u201cnot the right time, either for colleagues or for customers\u201d. Britain\u2019s biggest high street bank said it had granted mortgage holidays to over 70,000 customers in just over a week. The lender also confirmed that it would waive interest on arranged overdrafts up to \u00a3300 for all customers across its Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland branches from 6 April. HSBC The UK division donated \u00a31m to the National Emergencies Trust Coronavirus Appeal and British Red Cross to help support vulnerable people affected by Covid-19. Barclays The bank is automatically waiving interest on all overdrafts from 27 March to 30 April. It has also set up an online form for mortgage holiday applications to speed up the process.

The London-headquartered firm is adapting manufacturing lines to produce sanitiser for use in institutions such as hospitals. It has also pledged to pay its small- and medium-sized suppliers early to help their cashflow.

A private jet owned by Jingye landed at Doncaster Sheffield airport containing equipment including face masks, goggles, thermometers and medical gloves, destined for workers at the Scunthorpe blast furnace steelworks and the nearby hospital. McCarthy &amp; Stone The company, the biggest builder of retirement properties in the UK, has offered government and local authorities more than 300 newly completed apartments in unoccupied developments to house older people recovering from Covid-19 or NHS key workers. Brompton Bicycles The folding bicycle maker is providing 200 bikes to hire, free of charge, to NHS key workers. NCP The parking company extended its offer of free parking to NHS workers to all key workers. British Land The business, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall, has said it will scrap rent for three months for small and medium-sized companies renting its space, and will allow larger tenants to spread their second-quarter rents payments over an 18 month window. Brickbats \u2013 retail Frasers Group Mike Ashley\u2019s business, which owns the Sports Direct chain, gave in to government pressure and closed all their shops after previously informing staff that branches should remain open, as selling sporting and fitness equipment was \u201cextremely important\u201d.

      "body": "<p>In the early stages of the crisis, one of those at the heart of government decision-making told me: \u201cWe are all going to get it.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t wish a positive test for the coronavirus on anyone, but there is this to be said for the news that the prime minister, the Prince of Wales, and the health secretary now number among the infected, while the chief medical officer is self-isolating. There couldn\u2019t be a more vivid illustration that this is an equal-opportunity virus that couldn\u2019t care less about your status. A VIP protection squad of police officers is no defence from the invisible terrorist. It can get to you whether you are the leader of the country or the heir to its throne.</p> <p>The penetration of the coronavirus within the high black gates of Downing Street takes us into another situation that is unprecedented. After e-cabinet meetings and virtual news conferences and an online emergency summit of the G20, we have now witnessed the extraordinary first of the prime minister addressing the nation via Twitter video from quarantine. The breezy \u201chi folks\u201d with which he began was intended to damp down any public fright that might be triggered by the virus reaching the highest levels of government.</p> <p>In an earlier era, Number 10 might have sought to conceal that the country\u2019s leader had fallen ill and at such a critical juncture. During the Second World War, the British public weren\u2019t told that Winston Churchill had had a heart attack while at the White House shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Two years later, Churchill contracted pneumonia, which was also kept from the country. That would be impossible now. In a crisis playing out in the era of 24/7 media, when daily bulletins are demanded of the nation\u2019s leaders, concealment was never an option.</p> <p>\u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,\u201d the prime minister declared. This reassurance about the functioning of the chain of command was extra necessary because there has been some unedifying background bickering within the cabinet about who is in charge of what.</p> <p>The spread of infection into the apex of the state does add dramatic heft to the ministerial mantra that \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d. It is hoped within government that this will be persuasive on the stubborn minority of the population who have been putting themselves and others in potential danger by resisting the new rules on social distancing. If the infection of the head of government and the next head of state won\u2019t persuade the irresponsible minority to take this menace seriously, it is a bit hard to know what will.</p> <p>There might have been fewer issues with securing comprehensive public compliance with social distancing had there not been too many days when the government issued advice that was confusing and contradictory. The prime minister himself has been particularly wanting in this respect. He urged people to stay away from at-risk relatives only then to tell reporters that he would be going to see his mother on Mother\u2019s Day. Only on Monday did government messaging start to achieve the necessary clarity when Mr Johnson gave his television address, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/boris-johnsons-covid-19-address-is-one-of-most-watched-tv-programmes-ever\">one watched live</a> by 27 million people, ordering the national lockdown. If there is one further silver lining to his own infection, it is this. He was offered another opportunity to make amends for earlier chaotic messaging by reinforcing the \u201cstay at home\u201d injunction to the nation.</p> <p>There have been personal brickbats tossed at Mr Johnson since his infection was revealed, with some suggesting that he exposed himself to the virus by being cavalier about following his own government\u2019s advice on social distancing. More significantly, there has been serious criticism of the government\u2019s shifts in approach, and some fierce complaint from doctors and nurses about shortages of vital resources, especially protective equipment for health workers dealing with the infected and testing kits for frontline staff. Yet this has so far not come at any evident political cost to the government. Our Opinium poll today suggests that 92% of the public back the lockdown. Reflecting similar results from other survey organisations, the poll also indicates that trust in the prime minister has gone up.</p> <p>This probably has little to do with how the prime minister is objectively performing. Leaders of wildly varying characters presiding over differing responses to the pandemic are seeing a similar coronavirus popularity dividend. Emmanuel Macron has become better regarded among the French. Germans are more appreciative of Angela Merkel. Despite the grim state of affairs in Italy, Giuseppe Conte, the leader of its strange coalition government, has seen his approval rating leap from 44% in February to more than 70%. Donald \u201cit\u2019s going to disappear\u201d Trump\u2019s sensationally reckless responses to the crisis have been accompanied by a rise in his ratings. Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, has never been more popular.</p> <p>The Americans have a phrase for the impulse of people to want to unite behind their leaders at a time of emergency, especially when the threat comes with an existential dimension. They call it \u201crallying round the flag\u201d. George W Bush saw a massive surge in his approval ratings in the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks on the Twin Towers. John F Kennedy\u2019s ratings soared during the Cuban missile crisis and in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs misadventure. About the latter, he quipped to friends: \u201cThe worse I do, the more popular I get.\u201d</p> <p>We British lack an agreed term for this effect: \u201cHang on to nurse\u201d would be particularly appropriate to the coronavirus crisis. Gordon Brown, generally a deeply unpopular prime minister, enjoyed a big surge in his ratings during the Great Crash in 2008. The more severe the emergency, the more the instinctive response of the public is to want to get behind its government.</p> <p>Fearful people need the comfort of thinking they are in the hands of capable leaders. In benign times, there is not much psychological cost to ourselves to regard politicians as useless knaves. In an emergency, many of us need to believe that there are smart people at the top who know what to do. This is accompanied by a desire for national solidarity, that yearning made manifest on Thursday night when so many people stood at their doors and windows to clap their salutations and thanks to NHS workers. The urge to pull together has also been demonstrated by the 700,000 applications to join the new NHS volunteers organisation.</p> <p>Shrewd opposition politicians understand this mood and grasp that the public are likely to react badly to anything that smells of petty point-scoring. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had every right to articulate legitimate anxieties about allowing construction projects to continue in the capital, but he was careful to use his voice in a tempered way. Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, made a fool of himself during the election, but has found redemption with a carefully calibrated, non-hyperbolic approach towards criticising the government.</p> <p>This means that, politically speaking, we are in the phoney war period of the crisis. Even when the government has made egregious blunders, such as over the procurement of additional ventilators, the opposition isn\u2019t being very aggressive about it. Much of the public is willing to defer to authority and extend to the government a benefit of the doubt that it would not normally receive. This will not last for ever. The surge in approval enjoyed by Gordon Brown during the initial phases of the financial crisis faded away as national debate turned to issues about his stewardship of the financial system over the previous decade. There will one day be a great reckoning about the coronavirus, its origins, its spread and how it was tackled. Why wasn\u2019t Britain better prepared for a pandemic? Was the health service inadequately staffed and equipped? Did the government initially underestimate the virulence of the disease and what that meant for the NHS? Was the prime minister too slow to order the lockdown and other critical steps? These are some of the questions that will preoccupy the inevitable inquiry the other side of this crisis. Boris Johnson\u2019s currently buoyant approval ratings tell us nothing about what the public will think of him by the time this is over.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</em></p>",

The Royal College of Midwives is urging NHS leaders to ringfence maternity services as midwives are redeployed to care for people with Covid-19, fall sick themselves or are forced to self-isolate because of illness within their household. Gill Walton, chief executive of the RCM, said: \u201cWhile other areas of the health service can postpone and cancel procedures, there is still an ongoing need for maternity services. Women are still pregnant, still having babies, and they need the care and support of properly resourced maternity services. \u201cWe have to ensure that midwives and maternity support workers are ringfenced from any redeployment to ensure that women continue to receive safe care.\u201d A survey carried out last week by the RCM, and covering every region of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, found the 10% vacancy rate in midwifery posts before the crisis had doubled to 20%. More than a fifth \u2013 22% \u2013 of survey respondents also reported that local midwife-led maternity units had closed. Almost a third (32%) had stopped offering home births, and a further 4% were limiting the option of giving birth at home. In 11 cases, midwife-led maternity units had closed in order to increase facilities for assessing or caring for coronavirus patients. The vast majority (78%) of midwifery leaders who responded to the survey said routine face-to-face antenatal and postnatal visits had ended, with a further 9% restricting face-to-face postnatal visits. A number of NHS trusts have suspended home births as the crisis has escalated, amid reports that a growing number of pregnant women are seeking to avoid giving birth in hospital due to pressures on the health service and the perceived risks of exposure to Covid-19. Private Midwives, a UK-based nationwide private midwifery service, said the number of inquiries it has received about home births has doubled in the past few weeks. The Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, said last week it could no longer offer home births because it could not rely on the London Ambulance Service to provide backup. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde suspended home births \u201cto allow us to concentrate our maternity staff in our hospitals to cover those who are absent from work because they are either self-isolating or symptomatic\u201d. Walton said: \u201cWhat this survey shows is that coronavirus is exposing the gaps that already exist in maternity services.

      "bodyText": "Fears that many of Britain\u2019s high street shops will be forced to close down permanently despite the government\u2019s emergency support were fuelled yesterday after a string of retailers said the coronavirus outbreak could make their businesses unviable. As the Restaurant Group said it would shut the majority of its Tex-Mex Chiquito restaurants for good, Swedish fashion retailer H&amp;M threatened landlords that it would walk away from its 300-plus store leases if sales fail to match pre-coronavirus levels once the pandemic passes. Analysts said the likelihood that ministers would need to extend shop closures through the vital Easter trading period would push more retailers into handing back the keys to their shops. Business groups warned that without extra government support, including an extension of the business rates holiday to the end of the year, financial pressures were growing on town and city centre shop owners. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said he was worried that town high streets were especially vulnerable to an extended shutdown. \u201cMy biggest concern is about secondary high streets [smaller retail areas] and those in towns that were already facing huge difficulties,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is going to need to act quickly to extend the business rates holiday to save retailers from going under, and many other service business threatened by the current shutdown.\u201d A survey by analyst Retail Economicsof 2,000 consumers, due to be published next week, found that two-thirds of shoppers said they had switched to purchasing products online that they have always previously purchased in-store. Britain\u2019s high streets have become blighted by shop closures over the last three years in response to rising costs and the increasing volume of sales over the internet. A total of 143,100 jobs were lost in 2019, up by more than a fifth on 2018\u2019s 117,400 job losses, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). Retail casualties include Mothercare and Bonmarch\u00e9, which filed for administration, while Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group and Debenhams were among the firms to shed loss-making stores following deals with creditors. Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard Research, said: \u201cI fear for the independent sector, which is dominated by family-run businesses that are often subsistence operations. \u201cTheir ability to survive with no income is going to be challenging when they have little working capital reserves and are based in small towns.\u201d Springboard\u2019s latest retail monitor found that footfall across all destinations dropped by 70.1% last week on the same week last year. The drop in footfall on the previous week was 60%. H&amp;M, which has expanded rapidly in recent years and ranks as an anchor on many high streets, wrote to landlords last week asking them to agree to terms that could see the retailer break a store lease with one month\u2019s notice if trading conditions did not return to pre-outbreak levels. In a separate letter, seen by industry magazine Retail Week, the fashion retailer also pushed landlords to agree to a variety of rent-free periods , a reduction in service charges to reflect drops in footfall and a change to paying rents monthly in arrears. The letter said: \u201cIn all of the above scenarios, H&amp;M is to have the right to close stores immediately without being in breach of the keep open clause\u201d and \u201cpersonal concessions are to remain and fixed rents will not be payable\u201d. A spokesman for Usdaw, the shopworkers\u2019 union, said a shift to online shopping, which was likely to be accelerated by the Covid-19 outbreak, meant the government needed to go further than a business rates holiday and bring forward reforms that shifted the tax burden to online operators. \u201cThere needs to be a rebalancing between bricks and mortar shops and online operations, or we will see fewer shops opening up again after the lockdown has eased,\u201d he said. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said rent demands by landlords could leave childcare provision \u201cin tatters\u201d. Access to childcare will be crucial to allowing other workers to return to employment, but Leitch warned the pandemic risks causing permanent damage to an industry that was already struggling to meet costs. While help is available to them through business rate holidays and government scheme to pay the wages of staff, many have reported that they still face demands for rent. Meanwhile, largely self-employed childminders face waiting until June for financial help. Childcare places had already been declining. More than 500 nurseries, pre-schools and childminders closed every month on average between April 2018 and March 2019, according to Ofsted figures. The government is honouring funding for free childcare places. However, childcare providers have long relied on private feepayers to make the sums add up.",

He says: \u201cIt was four years\u2019 work, I wanted to make a museum-sized statement and, ironically, the gallery delayed it a few months so it would get a longer slot. I\u2019m gutted it closed, but I spoke to my neighbour who is a postman, and his situation is infinitely worse. I\u2019ve spent years learning how to survive as an artist and, to be honest, I feel like I have been in isolation for decades.\u201d</p> <p>Every contemporary gallery with the money has pulled together an online experience, where you\u2019re invited to tour and roam.

Hans Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery, believes galleries must take the lead. He says: \u201cIt will be our collective role to support artists at this time. When we avail our platforms to artists, the direst problems of the world can be understood with honesty and hope.

Twitter rumours that the virus first jumped species here in the UK after a certain Wetherspoon\u2019s regular had sex with a Wetherspoon\u2019s Steak &amp; Kidney Pudding \u2122 \u00ae in the toilets at the William Withering in Wellington are similarly imaginary.</p> <p>But even as a diehard Remoaner, I have some sympathy for the Wetherspoon\u2019s project. In many areas of the country, Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s cheerful outlets are the only plug for the yawning social chasms left by his friends the Conservatives\u2019 gradual closure of various community hubs over the past decade. And they are warm. And dry.</p> <p>Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s booze palaces are pie-and-a-pint flophouses for the daytime diaspora of the austerity era, where inexpensively nourished customers are hypnotised by bespoke and quite brilliant regionally specific carpet designs and beguiling guest ales, before being seduced by slogan-strewn anti-EU beermats while at their most mentally pliable.</p> <p>One can hardly blame Tim Wetherspoon for making the scientifically unverified claim, on <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-wetherspoons-boss-says-over-the-top-to-shut-pubs-11960778\">Sky News on Friday 20 March</a>, that there had \u201cbeen hardly any transmission in pubs\u201d. If, like me, you have contentedly spent entire days in Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s premises, you will know they are magical environments where the laws of science are routinely defied, leaving customers unsure of how they got home, which kind of pie they ate, or even of who they are. And Tim Wetherspoon himself fronted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/10/wetherspoon-tim-martin-brexit-leave-agm-corporate-governance\">factually fluid Brexit campaign</a>, endorsed and abetted by our current prime minister, that eschewed evidence and experts as if they were the sort of things only traitors valued.</p> <p>But experts are suddenly back in fashion with a vengeance, emerging blinking from the hidden priest holes of the academic institutions that sheltered them during the public book-burnings of the Brexit campaign, waving their statistics and their strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!!</p> <p>In a strange synchronicity, the people who encouraged distrust in experts are quietly disappeared. Michael Gove is rarely seen, and the results of recent wastewater tests in London, which suggest cocaine use in the capital has fallen by a third, can be attributed solely to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\u2019s absence from Notting Hill street corners.</p> <p>Jacob Rees-Mogg is also silenced, presumably in case he suggests the victims of Covid-19 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/06/rees-mogg-keeps-low-profile-after-grenfell-comments-outrage\">brought their suffering</a> on themselves, by not having the common sense to stay inside their country mansions eating only food foraged from their private estates by their personal servants and their hounds.</p> <p>Our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-a-Bob-for-Big-Ben\u2019s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Spiritual-Worth Three-Men-and-a-Dog Whatever-It-Takes Johnson, however, is still afoot.</p> <p>But Turds is rarely seen these days without being flanked by the mitigatingly solemn countenances of informed experts, his public performance mode of flippant and deliberate dishonesty suddenly forced into an ill-fitting rubber mask of knowledgeable concern, like the wolf in <em>Little Red Riding Hood</em> pretending to be the grandmother by pulling the bedcovers up over his snout and speaking in a high voice.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Covid-19 doesn\u2019t just call the Brexit campaign\u2019s bluff. It questions the way we have allowed our society to be run</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You don\u2019t have to be able to go outside your front door to see that senior Conservatives\u2019 offer of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives\">Covid coalition</a>\u201d with Labour is a trap for Keir Starmer, the Conservatives\u2019 Labour leader of choice, and the Little Red Riding Hood of this lupine ruse. Starmer could share the blame for the pandemic\u2019s mismanagement, sparing Turds. It\u2019s a trick as transparent as the warm pat on the back David Cameron gave to the slaughtered lamb of Nick Clegg in the Downing Street rose garden 10 years ago, before spinning him round to use as a human shield in the ensuing hail of press-corps machine-gun fire.</p> <p>Is it any wonder that the British public haven\u2019t taken the social distancing advice of this gang of twats seriously when the whole thrust of their campaign this past half decade was that experts are not to be trusted, and that Blitz-spirit Britain could prosper whatever so-called facts were flung at it? But Covid-19 doesn\u2019t just call the Brexit campaign\u2019s bluff. It questions everything about the way we have allowed our society to be run.</p> <p>And as I write this, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/homeless-travelodge-residents-turned-out-on-to-street-coronavirus\">homeless people housed in Travelodges</a> have just been thrown out into the officially unsafe streets, and we don\u2019t know if kids whose only square meals come from their schools are even eatinge.</p> <p>I don\u2019t consider myself as someone with a significant network of friends, because I spent the past three decades pursuing antisocial evening entertainment work, and because I am arrogant and ill-tempered.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen the government closed the pubs, I said \u2013 I didn\u2019t mince my words, I said to them myself, HURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME.\u201d MS Toilets, The Wetherspoonland, 1922 A public health official friend tells me her colleagues now call the Covid-19 virus \u201cWetherspoon\u2019s Mumps\u201d, a darkly comic response to Wetherspoon boss Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s initial resistance to closing his pubs for the safety of his customers. It isn\u2019t for civilians to criticise the black humour our brave health professionals deploy to combat the traumatic stress of the war on the coronavirus, especially as I made up the phrase \u201cWetherspoon\u2019s Mumps\u201d myself out of my own head. Twitter rumours that the virus first jumped species here in the UK after a certain Wetherspoon\u2019s regular had sex with a Wetherspoon\u2019s Steak &amp; Kidney Pudding \u2122 \u00ae in the toilets at the William Withering in Wellington are similarly imaginary. But even as a diehard Remoaner, I have some sympathy for the Wetherspoon\u2019s project. In many areas of the country, Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s cheerful outlets are the only plug for the yawning social chasms left by his friends the Conservatives\u2019 gradual closure of various community hubs over the past decade. And they are warm. And dry. Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s booze palaces are pie-and-a-pint flophouses for the daytime diaspora of the austerity era, where inexpensively nourished customers are hypnotised by bespoke and quite brilliant regionally specific carpet designs and beguiling guest ales, before being seduced by slogan-strewn anti-EU beermats while at their most mentally pliable. One can hardly blame Tim Wetherspoon for making the scientifically unverified claim, on Sky News on Friday 20 March, that there had \u201cbeen hardly any transmission in pubs\u201d. If, like me, you have contentedly spent entire days in Tim Wetherspoon\u2019s premises, you will know they are magical environments where the laws of science are routinely defied, leaving customers unsure of how they got home, which kind of pie they ate, or even of who they are. And Tim Wetherspoon himself fronted a factually fluid Brexit campaign, endorsed and abetted by our current prime minister, that eschewed evidence and experts as if they were the sort of things only traitors valued. But experts are suddenly back in fashion with a vengeance, emerging blinking from the hidden priest holes of the academic institutions that sheltered them during the public book-burnings of the Brexit campaign, waving their statistics and their strategies like prayer flags. Help us, experts! We are sorry!! In a strange synchronicity, the people who encouraged distrust in experts are quietly disappeared. Michael Gove is rarely seen, and the results of recent wastewater tests in London, which suggest cocaine use in the capital has fallen by a third, can be attributed solely to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\u2019s absence from Notting Hill street corners. Jacob Rees-Mogg is also silenced, presumably in case he suggests the victims of Covid-19 had brought their suffering on themselves, by not having the common sense to stay inside their country mansions eating only food foraged from their private estates by their personal servants and their hounds. Our prime minister, Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-the-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Girly-Swot Big-Girl\u2019s-Blouse Chicken-frit Hulk-Smash Noseringed-Crusties Death-Humbug Technology-Lessons Surrender-Bullshit French-Turds Dog-Whistle Get-Stuffed FactcheckUK@CCHQ 88%-lies Get-Brexit-Done Bung-a-Bob-for-Big-Ben\u2019s-Bongs Cocaine-Event Spiritual-Worth Three-Men-and-a-Dog Whatever-It-Takes Johnson, however, is still afoot. But Turds is rarely seen these days without being flanked by the mitigatingly solemn countenances of informed experts, his public performance mode of flippant and deliberate dishonesty suddenly forced into an ill-fitting rubber mask of knowledgeable concern, like the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood pretending to be the grandmother by pulling the bedcovers up over his snout and speaking in a high voice. You don\u2019t have to be able to go outside your front door to see that senior Conservatives\u2019 offer of a \u201cCovid coalition\u201d with Labour is a trap for Keir Starmer, the Conservatives\u2019 Labour leader of choice, and the Little Red Riding Hood of this lupine ruse. Starmer could share the blame for the pandemic\u2019s mismanagement, sparing Turds. It\u2019s a trick as transparent as the warm pat on the back David Cameron gave to the slaughtered lamb of Nick Clegg in the Downing Street rose garden 10 years ago, before spinning him round to use as a human shield in the ensuing hail of press-corps machine-gun fire. Is it any wonder that the British public haven\u2019t taken the social distancing advice of this gang of twats seriously when the whole thrust of their campaign this past half decade was that experts are not to be trusted, and that Blitz-spirit Britain could prosper whatever so-called facts were flung at it? But Covid-19 doesn\u2019t just call the Brexit campaign\u2019s bluff. It questions everything about the way we have allowed our society to be run. And as I write this, homeless people housed in Travelodges have just been thrown out into the officially unsafe streets, and we don\u2019t know if kids whose only square meals come from their schools are even eatinge. I don\u2019t consider myself as someone with a significant network of friends, because I spent the past three decades pursuing antisocial evening entertainment work, and because I am arrogant and ill-tempered. But suddenly I find myself in the middle of a massive and mutually supportive email conversation between dozens of like-minded self-employed misfits worldwide, most of whom now have no obvious means of support. The secondhand bookseller touched me the most, who plies his wares from Word on the Water, a barge floating on the canal behind King\u2019s Cross station. He has headed north, unwaged and building a mail-order website, up the River Stort to an uncertain future, like Arrietty making her escape in a floating teapot. He writes: \u201cCapitalism itself is looking like the shiny-suited boyfriend that didn\u2019t bring a bottle.\u201d \u201cHURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME HURRY UP PLEASE IT\u2019S TIME Goonight Johnson. Goonight Gove. Goonight Raab. Goonight. Ta ta. Goonight. Goonight. Good night, ladies, good night, sweet ladies, good night, good night.\u201d",

Now, the latest coronavirus iteration has been intercepted by the internet security company Sophos.</p> <p>Research by the group has also found that the volume of coronavirus email scams nearly tripled in the past week, with almost 3% of all global spam now estimated to be Covid-19 related. Attackers are increasingly impersonating the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations, Sophos said.</p> <p>Chester Wisniewski, the firm\u2019s principal research scientist, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cCybercriminals are wasting no time in shifting their dirty, tried-and-true attack campaigns towards advantageous lures that prey on mounting virus fears. Criminals often dip a toe in the water when there is a new or sensational topic in the news.</p> <p>\u201c[In] one of the spam campaigns we tracked this week, there was evidence of exactly that \u2026 The main body of the email pretends to come from [a WHO email address] with \u2018health advice\u2019 in the attachment, but when we carefully inspect the plain text body, we see it matches a previous spam campaign from [a familiar] criminal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Criminals are also using HMRC branding to make spurious offers of financial support</p> <footer> <cite>Action Fraud</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The email spam campaigns are typically designed to obtain individuals\u2019 personal information, which can then be used by criminals to steal funds. However, the range of different scams is far wider than rogue emails.</p> <p>Neil Tyson, the director of the consultancy Fraud Management Resource Centre, said: \u201cCriminals will use the telephone, text messages, email, post or knock at the door. They will exploit all five of those. People will knock at doors selling fake test kits or fake cures. People will claim to be acting for the local authority, saying we need contact details in case of emergency. There are examples of that.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute is currently warning the public not to open their doors to bogus healthcare workers claiming to be offering \u201chome testing\u201d for the coronavirus.</p> <p>Its concerns have been mirrored at the Bank of England \u2013 where it is understood that senior figures have been expecting a rise in fraud because of the Covid-19 pandemic for weeks \u2013 as well as by similar warnings from a range of UK bodies including the Financial Conduct Authority, the National Cyber Security Centre, the National Crime Agency and Action Fraud.</p> <p>The latest figures from Action Fraud show there have been 105 coronavirus-related reports since 1 February 2020, with total losses reaching nearly \u00a3970,000.</p> <p>These figures do not include the email phishing scams \u2013 and, presumably, many other cases that have gone unreported \u2013 but the<strong> </strong>majority of the recorded cases concern online shopping scams where people have ordered protective face masks, hand sanitiser and other products that have never arrived.</p> <p>Other frauds being reported include ticket fraud, online dating fraud, charity fraud and lender loan fraud.</p> <p>An Action Fraud spokeswoman said: \u201cWhile fraud reporting levels into Action Fraud have not increased, we have seen a number of different scams circulating relating to Covid-19 \u2026 Criminals are also using government branding to try to trick people, including using HMRC branding to make spurious offers of financial support through unsolicited emails, phone calls and text messages.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This marks a new low in the abhorrent tactics we have seen fraudsters using</p> <footer> <cite>Adam French, Which?</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis situation is likely to continue, with criminals looking to take advantage of further consequences of the pandemic, such as exploiting people\u2019s financial concerns to ask for upfront fees [on] bogus loans; offering high-return investment scams; or targeting pensions.\u201d</p> <p>The lengths that some criminals will go to is proving quite extraordinary.</p> <p>Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-free-school-meals-guidance\">Department for Education warned of a scam email</a> asking parents of children eligible for free school meals for their bank details, so that their child could still receive meals during school closures.</p> <p>Adam French of the consumer rights magazine Which? said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThis marks a new low in the abhorrent tactics we have seen fraudsters using to exploit the ongoing coronavirus crisis, which has unfortunately created the perfect breeding ground for scams.</p> <p>\u201cThe best way for consumers to protect themselves is to remain vigilant and take extra precautions before clicking on any unsolicited emails, texts or answering calls. Make sure your computers, mobile phones and tablets are supported by the latest security updates, and consider installing antivirus software to minimise threats.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the frauds that are already in operation, others will undoubtedly emerge, as scams travel almost like a virus. Some fear that law-abiding people who have been plunged into financial difficulties because of the pandemic may also be tempted to try their luck.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Association of British Insurers warned: \u201cExperience shows us that \u2013 in times of austerity \u2013 insurance fraud (along with many other forms of fraud) tends to increase. This may lead to individuals \u2013 and owners of failing businesses \u2013 being tempted to commit fraud.</p> <p>\u201cWe are [also] aware of several insurance scams that are beginning to emerge in the US, including \u2026 bogus Covid-19 health insurance [where] scammers are pitching low-cost health insurance, promising full coverage at affordable prices.\u201d</p>",

Research by the group has also found that the volume of coronavirus email scams nearly tripled in the past week, with almost 3% of all global spam now estimated to be Covid-19 related. Attackers are increasingly impersonating the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations, Sophos said. Chester Wisniewski, the firm\u2019s principal research scientist, said: \u201cCybercriminals are wasting no time in shifting their dirty, tried-and-true attack campaigns towards advantageous lures that prey on mounting virus fears. Criminals often dip a toe in the water when there is a new or sensational topic in the news. \u201c[In] one of the spam campaigns we tracked this week, there was evidence of exactly that \u2026 The main body of the email pretends to come from [a WHO email address] with \u2018health advice\u2019 in the attachment, but when we carefully inspect the plain text body, we see it matches a previous spam campaign from [a familiar] criminal.\u201d The email spam campaigns are typically designed to obtain individuals\u2019 personal information, which can then be used by criminals to steal funds. However, the range of different scams is far wider than rogue emails. Neil Tyson, the director of the consultancy Fraud Management Resource Centre, said: \u201cCriminals will use the telephone, text messages, email, post or knock at the door. They will exploit all five of those. People will knock at doors selling fake test kits or fake cures. People will claim to be acting for the local authority, saying we need contact details in case of emergency. There are examples of that.\u201d Indeed, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute is currently warning the public not to open their doors to bogus healthcare workers claiming to be offering \u201chome testing\u201d for the coronavirus. Its concerns have been mirrored at the Bank of England \u2013 where it is understood that senior figures have been expecting a rise in fraud because of the Covid-19 pandemic for weeks \u2013 as well as by similar warnings from a range of UK bodies including the Financial Conduct Authority, the National Cyber Security Centre, the National Crime Agency and Action Fraud. The latest figures from Action Fraud show there have been 105 coronavirus-related reports since 1 February 2020, with total losses reaching nearly \u00a3970,000. These figures do not include the email phishing scams \u2013 and, presumably, many other cases that have gone unreported \u2013 but the majority of the recorded cases concern online shopping scams where people have ordered protective face masks, hand sanitiser and other products that have never arrived. Other frauds being reported include ticket fraud, online dating fraud, charity fraud and lender loan fraud. An Action Fraud spokeswoman said: \u201cWhile fraud reporting levels into Action Fraud have not increased, we have seen a number of different scams circulating relating to Covid-19 \u2026 Criminals are also using government branding to try to trick people, including using HMRC branding to make spurious offers of financial support through unsolicited emails, phone calls and text messages. \u201cThis situation is likely to continue, with criminals looking to take advantage of further consequences of the pandemic, such as exploiting people\u2019s financial concerns to ask for upfront fees [on] bogus loans; offering high-return investment scams; or targeting pensions.\u201d The lengths that some criminals will go to is proving quite extraordinary. Last week, the Department for Education warned of a scam email asking parents of children eligible for free school meals for their bank details, so that their child could still receive meals during school closures. Adam French of the consumer rights magazine Which? said: \u201cThis marks a new low in the abhorrent tactics we have seen fraudsters using to exploit the ongoing coronavirus crisis, which has unfortunately created the perfect breeding ground for scams. \u201cThe best way for consumers to protect themselves is to remain vigilant and take extra precautions before clicking on any unsolicited emails, texts or answering calls. Make sure your computers, mobile phones and tablets are supported by the latest security updates, and consider installing antivirus software to minimise threats.\u201d Aside from the frauds that are already in operation, others will undoubtedly emerge, as scams travel almost like a virus. Some fear that law-abiding people who have been plunged into financial difficulties because of the pandemic may also be tempted to try their luck. A spokeswoman for the Association of British Insurers warned: \u201cExperience shows us that \u2013 in times of austerity \u2013 insurance fraud (along with many other forms of fraud) tends to increase. This may lead to individuals \u2013 and owners of failing businesses \u2013 being tempted to commit fraud. \u201cWe are [also] aware of several insurance scams that are beginning to emerge in the US, including \u2026 bogus Covid-19 health insurance [where] scammers are pitching low-cost health insurance, promising full coverage at affordable prices.\u201d",

As the Morrison government continued work on Sunday night on the third economic stimulus package in as many weeks \u2013 which will include a wage guarantee allowing businesses to keep people on the payroll during a shutdown \u2013 the prime minister and the premiers signed off on regulatory measures to assist landlords and renters, while urging both parties to negotiate sensible commercial terms.

The federal government alone has the resources and authorities to lead the relevant public and private stakeholders to confront the foreseeable harms posed by the virus.

      "bodyText": "Last September, I met the vice-president for risk for a Fortune 100 company in Washington DC. I asked the executive \u2013 who previously had a long career as an intelligence analyst \u2013 the question you would ask any risk officer: \u201cWhat are you most worried about?\u201d Without pausing, this person replied, \u201cA highly contagious virus that begins somewhere in China and spreads rapidly.\u201d This vice-president, whose company has offices throughout east Asia, explained the preventive mitigating steps the company had subsequently adopted to counter this potential threat. Since the novel coronavirus has swept the world, I have often thought about this person\u2019s prescient risk calculus. Most leaders lack the discipline to do routine risk-based horizon scanning, and fewer still develop the requisite contingency plans. Even rarer is the leader who has the foresight to correctly identify the top threat far enough in advance to develop and implement those plans. Suffice it to say, the Trump administration has cumulatively failed, both in taking seriously the specific, repeated intelligence community warnings about a coronavirus outbreak and in vigorously pursuing the nationwide response initiatives commensurate with the predicted threat. The federal government alone has the resources and authorities to lead the relevant public and private stakeholders to confront the foreseeable harms posed by the virus. Unfortunately, Trump officials made a series of judgments (minimizing the hazards of Covid-19) and decisions (refusing to act with the urgency required) that have needlessly made Americans far less safe. In short, the Trump administration forced a catastrophic strategic surprise onto the American people.

The instructions say they should be used if a resident has symptoms of the virus or actually has it. But these masks are completely useless in those situations.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe government needs to take a reality check if they genuinely think otherwise. The hospitals are desperately trying to empty beds so they can take new people in, who have the virus, but we can\u2019t help them because they don\u2019t have the equipment to test those they\u2019re discharging.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/cumulative\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>NHS trusts have been trying to discharge patients to free up capacity. Testing for the virus is not a requirement under <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/874213/COVID-19_hospital_discharge_service_requirements.pdf\">discharge guidance</a> issued by the government last week.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019d be mad to let anyone into my home without a test showing they\u2019re free of the virus,\u201d Steedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to keep safe the hugely vulnerable residents who are in my care already. It would be dangerous foolishness on my part to accept any hospital discharges who might bring the virus into our home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, said Steedman and other care home managers he knew of who were also refusing to accept NHS discharges should be praised for their stance. \u201cCare homes simply can\u2019t afford to let anyone in unless they\u2019re confirmed not to be carrying the virus. The consequences of doing otherwise are just too awful to consider,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cCare homes are going into crisis mode because the second there\u2019s a symptom of the virus in the home, there are layers upon layers of failure from the state to support them. The state is failing to test residents or staff quickly enough and they\u2019re failing to issue suitable equipment.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThe failures are particularly shameful because not only are these people who have spent their lives paying into the system and deserve dignity, but the equipment is simple and straightforward and the state should be able to supply it.\u201d</p> \n<p>A senior director at a London acute trust, who asked not to be named, told the <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/news/nhs-told-to-up-its-game-in-helping-social-care-respond-to-crisis/7027193.article\">Health Service Journal</a>: \u201cThere\u2019s a real problem with private care homes refusing to take patients back unless they\u2019ve been tested for Covid-19. But [testing] is not the national guidance currently and there just aren\u2019t enough testing kits to do it.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m now on calls with commissioners about getting more people out of hospital and into the community, and they\u2019re saying: \u2018Yes, that\u2019ll be done in the next week,\u2019 and I\u2019m on the verge of screaming at them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another acute sector director in north-west England said: \u201cWe need care homes to be really robust. We\u2019ve been hearing from colleagues that nursing homes won\u2019t accept their residents back after they\u2019ve been discharged from hospital, unless they\u2019ve been fully swabbed for coronavirus. This is not the national guidance, and we aren\u2019t able to do that right now. This could cause a huge issue.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On Saturday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, wrote an open letter of thanks to social care workers. Hancock, who is in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, said the government was committed to doing \u201cwhatever is needed\u201d for social care and the NHS, including allowing workers from both sectors free parking in council-owned spaces.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhilst many people are now staying at home, I know that is not an option for most of you as your work caring for others cannot be done from home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will do all we can to make your lives easier during this period, including, for example, making parking on council-owned on-street spaces and car parks free for those who work in social care. </p> \n<p>\u201cWe are committed to doing whatever is needed; that promise applies just as much to social care as it does for the NHS.\u201d</p>",

Testing for the virus is not a requirement under discharge guidance issued by the government last week. \u201cI\u2019d be mad to let anyone into my home without a test showing they\u2019re free of the virus,\u201d Steedman said. \u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility to keep safe the hugely vulnerable residents who are in my care already. It would be dangerous foolishness on my part to accept any hospital discharges who might bring the virus into our home.\u201d Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for Hove, said Steedman and other care home managers he knew of who were also refusing to accept NHS discharges should be praised for their stance. \u201cCare homes simply can\u2019t afford to let anyone in unless they\u2019re confirmed not to be carrying the virus. The consequences of doing otherwise are just too awful to consider,\u201d he said. \u201cCare homes are going into crisis mode because the second there\u2019s a symptom of the virus in the home, there are layers upon layers of failure from the state to support them. The state is failing to test residents or staff quickly enough and they\u2019re failing to issue suitable equipment.\u201d He added: \u201cThe failures are particularly shameful because not only are these people who have spent their lives paying into the system and deserve dignity, but the equipment is simple and straightforward and the state should be able to supply it.\u201d A senior director at a London acute trust, who asked not to be named, told the Health Service Journal: \u201cThere\u2019s a real problem with private care homes refusing to take patients back unless they\u2019ve been tested for Covid-19. But [testing] is not the national guidance currently and there just aren\u2019t enough testing kits to do it. \u201cI\u2019m now on calls with commissioners about getting more people out of hospital and into the community, and they\u2019re saying: \u2018Yes, that\u2019ll be done in the next week,\u2019 and I\u2019m on the verge of screaming at them.\u201d Another acute sector director in north-west England said: \u201cWe need care homes to be really robust. We\u2019ve been hearing from colleagues that nursing homes won\u2019t accept their residents back after they\u2019ve been discharged from hospital, unless they\u2019ve been fully swabbed for coronavirus. This is not the national guidance, and we aren\u2019t able to do that right now. This could cause a huge issue.\u201d On Saturday the health secretary, Matt Hancock, wrote an open letter of thanks to social care workers. Hancock, who is in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, said the government was committed to doing \u201cwhatever is needed\u201d for social care and the NHS, including allowing workers from both sectors free parking in council-owned spaces. \u201cWhilst many people are now staying at home, I know that is not an option for most of you as your work caring for others cannot be done from home,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will do all we can to make your lives easier during this period, including, for example, making parking on council-owned on-street spaces and car parks free for those who work in social care. \u201cWe are committed to doing whatever is needed; that promise applies just as much to social care as it does for the NHS.\u201d",

The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle.

Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days.</p> \n  <p>And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke.</p> \n  <p>Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses.</p> \n  <p>People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills.<br>Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords.<br>A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem.<br><br>After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers.</p> \n  <p>This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works.</p> \n  <p>Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done.</p> \n  <p>On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew.</p> \n  <p>And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t.</p> \n  <p>Yes, these are hard problems to solve.

A moratorium on evictions from rental properties for the next six months on the basis of \u201cfinancial stress\u201d. People who are over 70, people with chronic illness over 60 and Indigenous people over 50 are strongly advised to stay home. Some new public areas \u2013 public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks \u2013 will be closed from tomorrow, and group boot camps will no longer be allowed. One-on-one personal training sessions are still permitted. New \u201cstrong advice\u201d for individuals is that people should stay home unless shopping for essentials; for medical care or compassionate needs; to exercise in compliance with the new two-person rules; to go to \u201cwork and education if you cannot work or learn remotely\u201d. 1,600 Australians arriving home from overseas have gone into mandatory quarantine in hotels today. Earlier today Morrison announced a $1.1bn package for health and family violence services, including $669m to expand Medicare-subsidised telehealth. Morrison also flagged a wage guarantee, which will include people who have already lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, but has yet to announce details of the policy. Two states recorded coronavirus-related deaths overnight. A 75-year-old woman died at Caboolture hospital after returning to Queensland from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. A man in his 80s also died in Victoria. It brings Australia\u2019s death toll from the virus to 16. New Zealand suffered its first coronavirus-related death, a woman in her 70s on the west coast of South Island. Thanks as always for reading. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. You can also follow our international live blog here. Here\u2019s Katharine Murphy\u2019s wrap-up after this afternoon\u2019s national cabinet: Now to some important news: the heads of both the National Rugby League and Rugby Australia will meet on Monday to work out a way forward through the Covid-19 crisis. Like the rest of the world, Australia\u2019s major sporting codes have gone into hibernation and with no broadcast revenue or a firm timeline on a return, many clubs are staring down potentially devastating financial consequences. At Rugby Australia\u2019s annual general meeting tomorrow, potential large player wage cuts and staff layoffs will be discussed, while AAP reports that the Australian Rugby League Commission chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, will tell clubs and the players he is still hopeful the season can resume by 1 July. AAP reports that player representatives from all 16 clubs also spoke with V\u2019landys and the NRL chief, Todd Greenberg, on Sunday, along with the South Sydney CEO, Blake Solly, and Brisbane counterpart Paul White. It\u2019s expected the players\u2019 pay cut for the remainder of the year will sit around 75%, after they have already been paid the first five months of their annual salary in full. There are still some questions coming out of that (much briefer than usual) press conference with Scott Morrison. Although he\u2019s been clear on the reasons we should stay home, there seem to be some inconsistencies. Hairdressers and barbers, for example, appear to still be able to operate. And if people should only leave their homes for essential reasons, but can still meet in groups of two, can people who live alone still visit one another? Morrison made clear it would be up to the various states to enforce these rules, and no doubt we\u2019ll hear more from state premiers on it tomorrow. Expect the states with the largest outbreaks \u2013 New South Wales and Victoria \u2013 to take the hardest line. Here\u2019s the key points that have come out of today\u2019s national cabinet press conference: Only two people should now gather in public spaces and \u201cother areas of gathering\u201d, but it will be up to states to enforce that limit. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said households could still gather together, but individual people can only meet with one other person. National cabinet resolved there should be a moratorium on evictions from rental properties for the next six months on the basis of \u201cfinancial stress\u201d. Morrison encouraged tenants and landlords, \u201cparticularly\u201d in commercial properties, to work out arrangements in cases of financial stress. Some new public areas \u2013 public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks \u2013 will be closed from tomorrow, and group boot camps will no longer be allowed. One-on-one personal training sessions are still permitted. New \u201cstrong advice\u201d for individuals is that people should stay home unless shopping for essentials; for medical care or compassionate needs; to exercise in compliance with the new two person rules; to go to \u201cwork and education if you cannot work or learn remotely\u201d. People who are over 70, people with chronic illness over 60 and Indigenous people over 50 are strongly advised to stay home. Morrison says vulnerable or elderly people who need help with shopping or other needs should try to access \u201csupport through their community or others and I\u2019m sure they could even ring their local MP\u201d. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, suggested the rate of infection in Australia was lower than predicted and there was \u201cevidence that the public health measures that we are putting in place and the social distancing measures are likely to be having some early effect\u201d. Morrison continues and flags possible future closures of retail outlets: When you are going out for shopping, you should be going for just stuff you need and do it and get home. It is not a time for browsing. It is not a time for catching up with friends or bumping into people and having a long conversation. No, you can\u2019t do that any more. That is what we have to stop doing. That is why we are trying to keep as much of these sorts of things open for people as possible so they can get what they need. But as time goes on the national cabinet will continue to look at a lot of these businesses and may have to make further decisions in these areas and in some cases that may not be too far from now. Asked why shopping centres remain open, Morrison says people should only shop for things \u201cthat you actually need\u201d. He uses the example of jigsaw puzzles. I will give you an example. Our kids are at home now, as are most kids, and Jenny went out yesterday and bought them a whole bunch of jigsaw puzzles. I can assure you over the next few months we will consider those jigsaw puzzles absolutely essential. It is important that parents and families and households can get the things that they need to completely change the way they are going to live for the next six months at least, and so what we have done is sought to be practical about these issues. I mean, people are buying sporting equipment at the moment \u2013 gym mats and things like that \u2013 so they can exercise at home. These are things they are going to need. Asked how people over 70 can access essentials such as groceries if the advice is for them to stay home, Morrison says it \u201cis not a strict rule\u201d. He also suggests they could ring their local MP for support if necessary. It is there for their own protection and so what we are encouraging elderly residents to do is to stay home as much as is practicable. Should they need support then I\u2019m sure they can get support through their community or others and I\u2019m sure they could even ring their local MP and I\u2019m sure their local MP would want to help them in any way they could at either a state or federal level, because I have seen that already happening through many of our electorate offices, but I\u2019m sure they could get support through our community. On gatherings, Morrison said a \u201chousehold\u201d can be together inside the home or outside. Otherwise, you can be \u201cwith one other person maximum\u201d. He says previous announcements about the number of people allowed at weddings and funerals will remain in place. Brendan Murphy continues: It is very simple. We need to all stay home unless we are going out to shop, to do personal exercise, to go to medical appointments, or to go to work or study if you can\u2019t work from home. So anyone who doesn\u2019t need to be out of their home should be in the home. This is radical. The vast majority of Australians have done the right thing in the last week. We have seen huge evidence of that but we have also seen some very silly behaviour of people who haven\u2019t complied with that, particularly outdoors and sometimes indoors. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is now speaking. He says Australia\u2019s rate of infection is \u201cmuch less than some people might have predicted some time ago without mitigation\u201d. So there is evidence that the public health measures that we are putting in place and the social distancing measures are likely to be having some early effect. I should say at the outset that we are not Italy, we are not the United States, we are not Spain. We have one of the highest rates of testing per head of population in the world and one of the lowest positive test rates, so we think, unlike countries unfortunately like Italy, Iran and even the US, that when they detected significant outbreaks they probably had much, much larger outbreaks in the community that were undetected. We feel reasonably confident that we are detecting a significant majority of the cases in Australia. That means that we can get on top of cases when they are detected. The prime minister says following national cabinet that there will be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months on the basis of \u201cfinancial stress\u201d. If they are unable to meet their commitments and so there would be a moratorium on evictions for the next six months under those rental arrangements. Now there is a lot more work to be done here and my message to tenants, particularly commercial tenants, and commercial landlords, is a very straightforward one \u2013 we need you to sit down, talk to each other and work this out, about looking at the businesses which have been closed, businesses that may have had a significant reduction in their revenues, and we need landlords and tenants to sit down and come up with arrangements that enable them to get through this crisis. Morrison says the \u201cstrong advice\u201d of national cabinet is for people aged over 70 to stay at home. \u201cThis is not a compulsion, this is strong advice \u2013 that people aged 70 and over should stay at home and self-isolate for their own protection. To the maximum extent practical. \u201cThese arrangements should also apply to those with chronic illness, over 60 and Indigenous persons over the age of 50.\u201d For individuals, Morrison says \u201cthe strong advice\u201d is people should stay home unless: shopping for essentials for medical care or compassionate needs to exercise \u201cin compliance with the public gathering rules that I have already outlined\u201d And \u201cfor work and education if you cannot work or learn remotely\u201d Further bans on outside gatherings: In addition, public areas \u2013 public playgrounds, outside gyms and skateparks \u2013 will be closed as from tomorrow and boot camps will be reduced to two, which doesn\u2019t really make it a boot camp, that makes it a private session with your trainer for those who are accessing those services. Morrison says only two people should gather in public spaces and \u201cother areas of gathering\u201d but it will be up to states to enforce that limit. The government\u2019s new Covid-19 coronavirus app has 482,000 downloads, he says. I want to encourage every Australian, if you have a phone, you need the app. Go on there and make sure you download that app and go on the internet browser and get access to that WhatsApp service so you can get the messages you need to support the decisions for you and your family. Morrison says 1,600 people have gone into mandatory quarantine today. \u201cI know this is a terrible inconvenience for you but it is necessary to save lives and we thank you for your cooperation this evening,\u201d he says. Morrison begins the press conference by acknowledging that it has been a \u201chard week\u201d for Australians, but says that the rate of increase has been falling. Towards this time last week the daily rate of increase was up around 30% and today\u2019s increase is around 9%. There are no guarantees about how that goes forward. We need to continue to do the things that we have committed ourselves to do to save lives and save livelihoods and I want to thank Australians for their strong support and growing support for the measures that are necessary to do just that. Scott Morrison is speaking now. My colleague Matilda Boseley has the latest on the more than 200 Australian cruise ship passengers currently stranded in Italy. They have been told they will be flown to Perth on Sunday evening, but those who test positive to Covid-19 will not be allowed on the plane. The Australian Public Service commissioner has updated work guidelines for public servants. They\u2019re now told working from home \u201cis a priority, wherever this is practicable\u201d. Public servants had previously expressed concern that they were still being asked to work from offices, despite the government urging as many people as possible to work from home to help slow the Covid-19 outbreak. Private hospital nurses in Perth are threatening industrial action if forced to treat suspected coronavirus patients from a German cruise ship, AAP reports. Up to 55 people feared to be infected on board the Artania liner in Fremantle are set to be transferred to private hospitals in Perth for treatment. Hollywood, Bethesda, Mount and Waikiki hospitals are all understood to have been called upon. The premier, Mark McGowan, negotiated the plan with the federal government to reduce the impact on the state\u2019s public health system. But doctors and nurses have slammed the arrangement, saying coronavirus patients should be kept in public hospitals. The Australian Nursing Federation on Sunday said nurses felt they lacked the training, equipment or confidence to treat the patients. \u201cThe ANF will back nurses completely with the full force of all existing occupational safety and health laws if they are confronted with an unsafe working environment,\u201d the ANF WA state secretary, Mark Olsen, said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t care what deals the state or federal governments make, we will not allow nurses, doctors or their patients to be put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d But Bethesda hospital said it would not be part of the initial passenger intake. \u201cBethesda at this stage is not taking any passengers from the Artania,\u201d a spokesperson told AAP. Remember Naomi Wolf? The US author who got involved in a protracted stoush with Australia\u2019s energy minister, Angus Taylor, over ... honestly I don\u2019t even remember what over. Anyway, she\u2019s decided to weigh in on Australian politics again, this time suggesting the decision to suspend parliament until August constitutes a \u201ccoup\u201d. A lot of people are spending a lot of time replying to her on this, including the ABC election analyst Antony Green who, it has to be said, has not explicitly stated that it is not a coup. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will hold a press conference at 6.30pm. A group of medical professionals who the New South Wales health minister, Brad Hazzard, slammed this morning for not going into mandatory quarantine after they arrived back in Australia in the early hours of this morning have told the Sydney Morning Herald they \u201cfollowed lawful direction at every point\u201d. The 33 medical professionals were among a group of 77 medical professionals who were returning from a health convention on board a cruise that was unable to berth in South America. Hazzard said this morning he was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d they had not followed instructions to enter mandatory quarantine in a hotel. But some of the doctors have told the Herald it was due to \u201cconfusion and misunderstanding\u201d between health officials and police. NSW Health has deployed more than 350 physiotherapists with previous experience in intensive care to help cope with the rising number of cases in the state. NSW\u2019s chief allied health officer, Andrew Davison, said the physiotherapists have been \u201cupskilled\u201d over the weekend via virtual training. They will help wean patients off much-needed ventilators, and improve patient positioning to \u201coptimise oxygenation and patient outcomes\u201d. \u201cPhysiotherapists, and all allied health clinicians, are an essential part of the multidisciplinary team and the collaborative response to treat and support patients with Covid-19,\u201d Davison said in a statement issued this afternoon. The NSW government previously announced a $2.3bn stimulus package, including $700m for the state\u2019s health department, to increase capacity in public hospitals, particularly within ICUs and emergency departments. While we have a bit of time before national cabinet breaks up, have a read of this piece by my colleague Amy Remeikis on a refugee who was denied the right to board a flight from Indonesia to Australia because of his visa status. Amir, a young Iranian refugee on an Australian safe haven visa, has been sent back to Turkey amid the coronavirus crisis, despite being granted permission to leave Australia to visit his mother in early February. A shot of the care pack issued to new arrivals before their mandatory quarantine. People are still being fed, of course. Spurrier says she is \u201cthrilled\u201d South Australia only recorded 12 new cases of the virus overnight. She cautions that it is only one day\u2019s worth of data, but is \u201ccertainly better than being told it was another 30 or 40\u201d. We have really put in place in South Australia measures that we have never seen before in the state. We have basically closed borders and we are now requesting anybody who is coming in internationally to be quarantined in hotels and that is being policed. [We are also] feeling the pain, closing a large number of all businesses, particularly restaurants and hotels and the like. We have even stopped AFL matches. South Australia has announced school closures in a number of towns in the wine growing region of the Barossa Valley after what the state\u2019s chief public health officer, Nicola Spurrier, called a \u201ccluster\u201d of positive cases in the region. Spurrier is speaking now, and has reported 12 new cases of Covid-19 in the state, bringing the total in South Australia to 299. There are six cases in ICU, four of which are critical. Spurrier has asked people living in a number of towns in that area not to leave if they can, and said other people in the state should \u201crethink\u201d travel to the Barossa Valley if they can. \u201cWe want to basically reduce as much travel in and out while my team is able to get on top of this cluster,\u201d she said. She said school closures in the area would not be permanent. \u201cAs many people know, I\u2019m an advocate of keeping schools open where we don\u2019t have evidence of transmission but this is a different circumstance and I think it is an indication that when we do need to recommend school closures, we will recommend them,\u201d she said. The head of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, has welcomed the government\u2019s commitment to expanding Medicare-covered health care, saying it will ease the burden on Australia\u2019s already stretched supplies of personal protective equipment. It\u2019s an important announcement because what it does is three things. Not only does it allow the usual access to care, to continual care, especially for those patients with chronic and complex disease, that have chronic managements plans, that need that access, but all the other members of the community that, for one reason or another, are not able to access the general practice or the other consulting rooms during this time because they\u2019re in self-isolation, or because indeed they are in a vulnerable group and fear being exposed to the risk of contracting Covid-19. But the third, most important reason for this is that it will significantly reduce the demands on personal protective equipment \u2013 PPE. We know PPE is in very much short supply. It\u2019s very scarce. And by allowing the ability to consult a number of patients in the comfort of their own room, in their own home, in their own isolation, will allow a significant reduction in the amount of PPE required by doctors, nurses and all other frontline healthcare workers that will be taking part in telehealth. In the past 24 hours Victorian police say they have conducted 1,430 checks that people are complying with quarantine rules. That included 139 checks on returned travellers. Of those, 11 were not at home. Police say they\u2019ve also checked 614 businesses, 210 \u201cpopulous places\u201d and 467 \u201cnon-essential services and businesses\u201d. \u201cAt this time, no one has been charged with refusing or failing to comply with the direction however a number of warnings were given to people found at populous gatherings,\u201d Victorian police say. As I mentioned, about 3,000 people are expected to arrive in Sydney today. That\u2019s not counting the rest of the country, of course. Those people will be put up in hotels for an enforced 14-day quarantine. A few people are tweeting about what that process has been like so far, including Dr Sharon Schembri who has just returned from the US. There\u2019s been reports around of long wait times, but Schembri writes that overall the process was handled well. Took a while to load those busses and geographically we travelled towards the city. Took hours for each bus to be unloaded one at a time. Finally, we arrived, five star quarantine! Again police (uniformed and not uniformed) along with army personnel facilitated the process Instead of checking into the hotel, a police officer took our name, flight, contact details. Another officer ushered us to the elevators, sending us to our allocated 25th floor, where we were met me with another two officers who opted to give myself and my son connecting rooms First meal has now been delivered and we have been informed that healthcare professionals will be monitoring us for symptoms. Multiple times we have been informed we are not to leave the room for any reason otherwise we will be penalised. So here we are for 14 days. I wonder how you\u2019d feel if you returned home a little earlier and had shelled out money for an Airbnb to quarantine in? (I don\u2019t wonder. I know a bunch of people who are filthy that they\u2019ve missed out on a fortnight stay in a five-star hotel.) Good afternoon. This is Michael McGowan, taking over from Josh Taylor for the evening shift. There\u2019s been no shortage of coronavirus-related news today, and with national cabinet meeting this afternoon we could have a busy night ahead. To recap, today we\u2019ve heard: The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a $1.1bn package for health and family violence services, including $669m to expand Medicare-subsidised telehealth. Morrison also flagged a wage guarantee, which will include people who have already lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, but has yet to announce details of the policy. Two states recorded coronavirus-related deaths overnight. A 75-year-old woman died at Caboolture hospital after returning to Queensland from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. A man in his 80s also died in Victoria. It brings Australia\u2019s death toll from the virus to 16. New Zealand suffered its first coronavirus-related death, a woman in her 70s on the west coast of South Island. Sunday marks the first day that Australians returning from overseas will be forced to quarantine in hotels. About 3,000 people are expected to arrive in Sydney today. Thanks for keeping me company as we head into the evening. So I\u2019m told Atlassian helped the government build its WhatsApp information sharing capability alongside Facebook because the company was keen to get information out as quickly as possible. One of the company\u2019s founders, Mike Cannon-Brookes, has said the company will not be paid any money for any of the work that went into it. Here\u2019s a chart on the age range of people who tested positive for coronavirus in NSW and the likely source of the transmission. Just a clarification on the Ruby Princess numbers, NSW Health sent out a correction that there are 189 confirmed coronavirus cases in New South Wales from the cruise ship. They accidentally included the 26 cases from people outside of the state who were on that cruise ship but then went home before testing positive. That means it is still correct to say there are 215 cases from that cruise ship in total. Some of the more than 400 Australians stranded in Peru have pleaded with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to help them escape on government-sponsored repatriation flights. Some are expected to leave on a commercial charter in the next 24 hours \u2013 although this is not certain \u2013 and it may be months before others are able to leave a country under a military-enforced lockdown. The oldest Australian stranded in Peru is 96, the youngest six months. One is pregnant, another is in hospital with a deteriorating medical condition. Another is living in an abandoned building with little food. An open letter written by Gus Higgins on behalf of the group has pleaded with the Australian government to launch government-sponsored repatriation flights, as other countries, such as Germany, Israel, Canada, Ireland and the US have done. \u201cWe have watched other governments act. We see foreigners leave each day through the repatriation efforts of their respective governments. Despite being told we are a \u2018top priority\u2019, honestly, honourable prime minister, we certainly do not feel so. \u201cWe request immediate repatriation that is accessible for all Australians stranded in Peru.\u201d The borders are shut in Peru until at least 12 April. Most commercial airlines now no longer operating, with the country in lockdown under military law. A commercial charter, organised by Chimu Adventures with Australian government assistance, will fly about 260 Australians out of Peru, likely on Sunday. The over-subscribed flight will retrieve passengers from Cusco and Lima. However, many Australians stuck in Peru could not afford the $5,000 being asked for an economy class seat on the flight or missed out on booking, while others are in remote parts of the locked-down country where all internal movement has been banned, putting airports out of reach. ABC is reporting that people arriving at Sydney airport are waiting between two and three hours on buses to be ferried from the airport to one of two hotels \u2013 the Ibis and the Novotel \u2013 where they\u2019ll be forced to quarantine for 14 days. This is the first day of the new regime, and it\u2019s expected around 3,000 people will be sent to hotels from Sydney airport today. Ahh, Richmond. And another update on the state and territory totals we have for confirmed coronavirus cases so far today: New South Wales: 1,791 (+174) Victoria: 769 (+84) Queensland: 656 (+31) ACT: 77 (+6) WA: 312 (+33) There are 16 deaths from people who tested positive for coronavirus reported so far. Western Australia has reported 33 confirmed new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to 312 in the state. The WA government is also going to bring in new legislation next week to fine people $1,000 (and $5,000 for business) for not complying with self-isolation and gathering directives. NSW Health has advised there are now 215 cases of coronavirus from passengers on the Ruby Princess, up from 172. There are now 59 confirmed cases in NSW from the Ovation of the Seas, and 23 cases from the second cruise of the Voyager of the Seas. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has welcomed the announced funding for telehealth. \u201cThe reason we have been pushing so hard for the telehealth expansion is because GPs on the frontline battling Covid-19 know that it will make a real difference in limiting the spread of the virus,\u201d president Dr Harry Nespolon said. Nespolon said telehealth doesn\u2019t mean doctors have to use Skype or Zoom or other video conferencing for their consultations, and the Medicare Benefits Scheme item covers phone calls, too. \u201cWe need to be technologically agnostic and not have the public or GPs think that this item is limited to video consultations; an old-fashioned phone will do just fine.\u201d A quick update on international developments: More than 30,000 people have died after contracting Covid-19, from more than 660,700 confirmed cases. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases, and the US has reported more than 120,000 cases. New Zealand reported its first death on Sunday. Spain, Northern Ireland and Timor-Leste are among countries to introduce new waves of restrictions. The US president, Donald Trump, earlier proposed an enforced regional quarantine on the state of New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, prompting an angry rebuke from the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo. Trump later said quarantine would not be necessary and he had asked the CDC to instead issue a serious travel warning for the areas. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 yesterday, has warned British households that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better. The Zandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama Canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19. And Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, the wife of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, said she has recovered from Covid-19. Her husband and their three children have been in isolation and haven\u2019t shown symptoms. NSW Health says a a staff member at Long Bay hospital has been diagnosed with Covid-19. Contact tracing is being undertaken with staff and patients, and those identified as close contacts are being placed in isolation and will undergo testing. Additionally, 245 passengers from the Roald Amundsen and Scenic Eclipse cruises who arrived on Friday night were screened for Covid-19 at the airport and were required to isolate for 14 days. This was before the new hotel isolation orders for every single arrival came into effect, but Nine newspapers reported 33 of those ordered into hotel quarantine by NSW Police attempted to depart on domestic flights. A total of 27 of those are believed to have left on those flights. There are three confirmed cases at Normanhurst West public school \u2013 two teachers and a student. Close contacts have been isolated and the school has been reopened. I\u2019ll hand back to my colleague Josh Taylor now but will be back with you later this afternoon. Following Scott Morrison\u2019s announcement of a $1bn boost to health and family violence services this morning, advocates say the package falls short of what\u2019s needed. As part of the package Morrison announced $150m for domestic violence services, but Renee Carr, the executive director of campaign group Fair Agenda, says more is needed. Critically, this package also doesn\u2019t reverse the dangerous cuts to vital work like WESNET\u2019s Safe Phones program or the work of the National FVPLS Forum \u2013 which means critical functions currently in place for women\u2019s safety will be ended in coming months; when their work will be absolutely vital in dealing with this escalating emergency. These cuts are unconscionable and must be immediately reversed. We already know that demand for service has jumped even in the early days of this pandemic. The risks facing women experiencing abuse and violence will be an escalating emergency during this crisis. It\u2019s vital that services are resourced to support everyone who needs them during this time. The mayors of Sydney\u2019s beachside suburbs are carefully monitoring crowds in their council areas today, in the hope that people will stay away and they will not be forced to shut down parks and public gardens as well as the beaches. Beaches in Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra, including the iconic Bondi Beach, have been shut indefinitely after large crowds gathered and ignored social distancing rules. Police have also had to break up parties in the beachside suburb, which is a magnet to backpackers and young people. The Waverley mayor, Paula Masselos, said she was hoping it would not be necessary to shut parks and public gardens as well, but it would depend on whether people respected the social distancing rules today. \u201cWe want to keep them open as much as possible for the sake of mental health of people, but if people are not doing the right thing we may need to close them,\u201d she said. Masselos said it was not feasible to try to control numbers on beaches as some councillors had suggested. \u201cI asked the general manager to look at options for keeping them open, including having a corridor to access the beaches, but it\u2019s just not possible,\u201d Masselos said. The Liberal councillor and former mayor Sally Betts has suggested using witches hats to divide the beach into areas and regulate numbers. Waverley was forced to shut the tiny Mackenzies beach after crowds gathered there, following the shutdowns of other beaches. Randwick has been forced to shut all of its beaches as well and Woollahra has shut the harbour beaches. Northern Beaches council closed the northside beaches last weekend but is endeavouring to keep them open where possible. The Inner west mayor, Darcy Byrne, has also urged people to follow social distancing in parks, saying crowded parks may need to be closed. This Twitter thread from Shiraz Maher, an expert on Islamic radicalisation from the UK, on his experience with the Covid-19 virus as an otherwise healthy 38-year-old is quite harrowing. Australians stranded on board the Costa Victoria cruise ship, docked in Civitavecchia, Italy, have been told to pack their bags and prepare for a chartered flight home. Passengers have posted on social media that they received a call to their cabin in the middle of the night, asking them to be packed and ready to go by 6am Italian time (3pm AEDT). Others have been told a flight has been arranged by Costa Cruises to deliver them from Rome to Perth. \u201cWe got woken up with a call to have our bags packed and out the door by 6am and we\u2019ll be departing by 9. When we asked \u2018where are we going\u2019 they said to the airport for a late afternoon flight. Why wouldn\u2019t the Australian ambassador know of this plan and communicate it to us?\u201d one passenger posted on Facebook. There are more than 300 Australians on board the ship. Without official confirmation from the Australian embassy in Rome or Dfat, passengers are unsure what to expect. Some Australians from the Costa Luminosa, which docked in Savona last week, said there were plenty of rumours of a charter flight. Instead, passengers were placed on buses and driven to Rome to self-isolate for two weeks in a hotel. For days, those on board the Costa Victoria have feared they will face the same fate, forced to spend more time in the country worst hit by the virus. Both the Costa Victoria and Luminosa have had confirmed cases of Covid-19 on board. Victoria passengers have been in strict lockdown for days and confirmed to their cabins. Guardian Australia has contacted Dfat. The shadow minister for industrial relations, Tony Burke, says any wage subsidy announced by the government should be conditional on keeping people in work, and large enough \u201cto give a real incentive to employers to keep people in their jobs\u201d. \u201cWe want people to keep their relationship with their employer,\u201d he says. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, is speaking in Sydney now. He\u2019s calling for the government to go ahead with changes to income support including lowering the threshold at which couples can receive income support if one person loses their job. We\u2019re expecting to hear more on this from the government in the coming days, but Labor wants the government to \u201curgently\u201d implement a wage subsidy. More state updates, this time from Victoria. The total number of coronavirus cases in Victoria is now 769, the state\u2019s health department has confirmed. That\u2019s an increase of 84 from yesterday. Victoria has now recorded four deaths related to the virus. Like Queensland, the state also recorded another death overnight \u2013 a man in his 80s died in a Melbourne hospital. The total number of cases includes 419 men and 346 women, with people aged from 3 to 88. There are 21 confirmed cases that may have been acquired through community transmission and more than 39,000 Victorians have been tested. Currently 26 people are in hospital, including four patients in intensive care, and 193 people have recovered. Thank you to the Tasmanians patiently explaining what their premier meant when he asked people not to travel between their home and shack earlier. It is apparently a reference to holiday homes dotted all over the state. \u201cUltimate permanent campsites, essentially, to the point that they are generational,\u201d reader Dean Sparkes tells me. So there you are. The Australian tennis star John Millman may have dodged the coronavirus, but he\u2019s still resigned to not playing again this year. Millman fears the global nature of his sport will leave it almost impossible for the respective men\u2019s and women\u2019s tours to reset again in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be pretty unified in terms of our recovery process before the tour can resume,\u201d Millman told AAP. \u201cMaybe the tournament location has got the Covid-19 situation under wraps and then manage to contain it, but if someone\u2019s flying in from South America, say, and their country hasn\u2019t got a hold of it, then the tournament can\u2019t exist. \u201cYou can\u2019t have the tournament going when only certain players can get there. I think that\u2019s where the problems lie. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we have to have a vaccine or the virus has to run its course before there\u2019ll be any let-up there.\u201d The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has updated media on the number of new Covid-19 cases in that state. She says there were 31 new cases overnight, bringing the total in Queensland to 656. She also confirms that a 75-year-old woman died overnight at Caboolture hospital. The woman was a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. Once again, I my extend condolences to her family members and as I said the other day, we know that we will continue to see these incidents that are happening and I think everyone needs to realise that this person has a family and friends and loved ones and it is indeed a tragedy. The Waverley councillor responsible for Bondi Beach in Sydney\u2019s east, John Wakefield, has called on the NSW government to do more to deal with hotspots of Covid-19 associated with backpacker facilities. Waverley council area has the largest number of Covid-19 cases in NSW \u2013 132 cases on Friday \u2013 and most have been among backpackers who have arrived from overseas and people who have come in contact with them. \u201cBackpacker facilities need to be locked down and every person there tested,\u201d Wakefield said. He said there were two clusters of 20-plus cases that were largely associated with two large backpacker premises. \u201cWe need to put a ring around these and then test everyone,\u201d Wakefield said. \u201cIt would probably only involve about 500 people. Maybe we should consider putting them into quarantine, rather than having them in dormitories where social distancing is difficult.\u201d He said many backpackers were living in dorms with four or more beds per room. Wakefield said it was wrong to expect council to bear the brunt of policing social distancing and that more help was needed from the state government. Randwick mayor Danny Said warned a similar situation could occur in Coogee, which also has several big backpacker hostels. \u201cWe\u2019re having a close look at it. Some of these places have 6-10 people to a room, so social distancing is very difficult,\u201d he said. Said called on the state government \u201chelp us out\u201d and to cisider whether its possible to provide testing and quarantine facilities for backpackers. Now to Tasmania, where the premier, Peter Gutwein, has confirmed the number of positive coronavirus cases in the state is now at 62. The state has taken a hard line on travellers entering the state. All non-essential travellers who arrive in Tasmania after midnight on Sunday will be placed into quarantine in a government facility. Tasmania will not be immune from the impacts. There will be, at some stage, community transmission. That is going to occur. I expect also, unfortunately, that there will be deaths. Let\u2019s be clear. People will die, unfortunately, as a result of this, and we need to ready ourselves for that. Gutwein also says the government does not want \u201cto see people traversing between their home and their shack\u201d. Which, I don\u2019t know, might need a Tasmanian to explain that one. We also heard quite a strong response earlier from the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, to reports that 33 medical professionals who returned to Australia last night did not go into the mandatory hotel quarantine announced by the government on Friday. They were among a group of 77 medical professionals who were returning from a health convention on board a cruise that was unable to berth in South America. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said he understood the mandatory hotel quarantine hadn\u2019t been served on those medical professionals and they\u2019re unlikely to face fines. But that didn\u2019t stop Hazzard giving them a strong serve. I actually don\u2019t know what to say about those doctors. They should know better ... It was bitterly disappointing that they chose to ignore what is a safety measure for themselves and for others. They are the people you would expect to know better than anyone else. Yes, bitterly disappointing. Stephen-Smith says there are six people in hospital with Covid-19 in the ACT, including two in ICU. There are two cases of possible community transition which are currently under investigation. \u201cIt is too early to say whether either of those is an early indication of community transmission in our community,\u201d she says. Good afternoon everyone. The ACT health minister, Rachel Stephen-Smith, is giving an update on the number of cases in the nation\u2019s capital. We\u2019ve already heard there are six new cases, which brings the total in the territory to 77. The new cases include four males and two females aged between 19 and 82. Three of the new cases are linked to overseas travel and two are linked to other confirmed cases. It is still unknown how the sixth case was contracted, but Stephen-Smith says there is still \u201cno clear evidence of community transmission\u201d. \u201cBut we have been saying for some time we expect this to change,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact it is inevitable this will change.\u201d I\u2019m heading on a break for a bit, but my colleague Michael McGowan will take you through the next hour. The ACT government has announced six more Covid-19 cases, three of which are from overseas travel and one a close contact of a confirmed case. That brings the territory up to 77 in total. A total of 4,230 tests have been conducted. The people being isolated after arriving back in Australia are currently being put in five-star hotels, Fuller says. They\u2019re provided food and drink and health support. They won\u2019t have any physical contact with hotel workers, who have PPE. There are also extra precautions being put in place, such as disinfecting the buses they are brought to the hotel in, and having only 12 people at a time on the buses. Police have handed out 11 tickets so far to people flouting the new rules, Fuller says. He has also urged local governments to plan to shut beaches and parks well ahead of time if it\u2019s going to be a hot day and people may be tempted to congregate there. \u201cLocal governments have an important role. You manage the beaches and the parks. If there is a 30C day coming, you need to close the beach three or four days out. You need to prepare, you need to plan for these things. It is no longer worth waiting for the day.\u201d The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, says around 3,300 Australians are expected to return via Sydney airport today who will go into isolation in hotels for 14 days, after being processed by border force officers and seen by health officials. So far 1,000 people have returned since the new isolation rules came into force, and 30 of those have gone into high-level isolation either due to feeling unwell or having symptoms that could potentially be coronavirus. Just a quick update on the state totals which we have been provided over the past hour: New South Wales: 1,791 (+174) Victoria: 769 (+84) Queensland: 656 (+31) Victoria and Queensland both reported deaths overnight, bringing the national total to 16. Hazzard urges people to be decent to each other, saying there had been reports of vital equipment being stolen from hospitals. \u201cI am mortified to hear that in some of our hospitals people are actually stealing hand cleaner and other items that will keep our frontline staff safe. I\u2019ve even heard reports of hand cleaner containers being ripped off the wall in hospitals.\u201d The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, says there are now 1,791 confirmed cases in NSW, up 174 in the past 24 hours. This is slightly down on yesterday\u2019s figures. There have now been over 91,000 tests in the state. There are 24 cases in intensive care units in NSW. More information on the Queensland numbers for today, from the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. There were 31 new cases overnight, for a total of 656 in the state. As we said before, a 75-year-old woman who had been on the Ruby Princess cruise ship has died in Caboolture after testing positive for coronavirus. The premier\u2019s press conference is being held in the Royal International Convention Centre at the RNA showgrounds, which had been used during the Spanish flu epidemic a century ago. Palaszczuk said this and a number of other venues in Brisbane could be used for overflow from hospitals arising from coronavirus. Morrison says national cabinet is meeting this afternoon, and he indicates that if further measures are agreed upon, there will be a press conference in the early evening. Will authorities in Australia be able to access phone data to contact-trace like the UK? Morrison says there are no plans for that. \u201cWhat I want to be clear about is the policies and measures that we will put in place for Australia will be right for Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go and cut and paste measures from other places, which have completely different societies.\u201d It is worth mentioning, the South Australian police have already said they have used metadata for contact-tracing earlier this year. The other states we have asked have said they have no plans to use phone data for contact-tracing at this stage. Is it a break from national cabinet if NSW and Victoria go further in closing down schools and retail in the next few days? Morrison says no. \u201cIt has been very clear that some states may have to take further measures sooner than other states. That is not a breakaway from the national cabinet. That is actually the national cabinet working,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a demonstration of the way the states can work together and so as much as some states can find themselves in a position to do a few more things, it should not be the view that these states who are not doing those things are not doing enough.\u201d Morrison is again asked whether he will release the government\u2019s modelling of the amount of cases and deaths they are projecting we may see in Australia. There is a long answer about how we can\u2019t compare our situation with the UK and other parts of the world (including that we are testing more and our positive result rate is lower), but he again doesn\u2019t say whether the government will release the modelling. Morrison is asked who the income support will apply to. He says it hasn\u2019t been finalised, so he won\u2019t go into the details because it isn\u2019t fair on Australians. \u201cThese are not simple things to do when you are talking about rolling out income support to millions of people.\u201d He says the principle is that the package will support people who have lost their job through recent closures that have already happened (so retrospectively), but further detail on the starting point will come out when it is announced later in the week. \u201cWe want to be sure that when we do it, we have covered the majority of the ground that needs to be covered to enable the program to be successfully implemented in partnership with the businesses, which will extend beyond what has been the level of coverage we have had to date.\u201d Scott Morrison says the income support package will be bigger than the previous two packages: \u201cThe next stage, which will be given bigger than anything you have so far seen, will go broader than that and ensure that we are working together with companies to keep people connected to companies. This is part of the hibernation strategy of ensuring we keep people connected with their businesses and with their jobs so that on the other side of this, Australia can bounce back stronger.\u201d A 75-year-old woman has reportedly died at Caboolture hospital, after returning to Queensland from the Ruby Princess. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the state has risen by 31 to 656. There are three press conferences going on at the moment \u2013 federal, Queensland and Victoria. We will bring you all the relevant information from the state ones when we can. Via AAP: New Zealand has suffered its first coronavirus-related death, a woman in her 70s on the west coast of South Island. The woman, who had underlying health conditions, was mis-diagnosed with influenza on admittance to hospital. New Zealand health officials confirmed 63 new cases on Sunday, a promising drop from the increase of the previous two days, leaving the country\u2019s overall tally of coronavirus cases at 514. The ABC is reporting a Melbourne man in his 80s has died in hospital, bringing the number of deaths in Victoria to four and the national total to 15. The health minister, Greg Hunt, says there will be universal telehealth from tomorrow. Those who are self-isolating will be able to call their GP, nurse, mental health practitioner or allied health professional. Morrison also flagged that, as has been widely reported, the government will bring in income support. \u201cWe will also be moving to provide further income support, the treasurer and I have been working together with Treasury and other officials night and day over recent days to ensure we can provide further boosted income support across the Australian economy,\u201d he says. As the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said earlier, they are trying to make it sound different to the UK model, which they had ruled out two days ago. \u201cWe are being very careful to ensure that income support can be delivered in a way that gets it to people as quickly as possible using the existing systems we have. \u201cWhen we do these things it is not a matter of just cutting and pasting ideas from other places. We need to have solutions that will work in Australia.\u201d This is the summary of the announcement from the prime minister today: $669m for telehealth so people can get support from GPs and health advice from home $74m for mental health support $150m for domestic violence services, including 1800 RESPECT and Mensline $200m for emergency relief support including Foodbank, Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare and other charities Morrison says thanks to Atlassian and Facebook, Australians can now go to WhatsApp to find information on coronavirus from the government. A new iOS app has also been launched today for Apple iPhones. My cursory glance at the app suggests it is a replica of the health department website, and it looks OK. I\u2019ll have a deeper look when this press conference is over. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is making the announcement around the $1.1bn support for health, mental health and domestic violence services that we flagged earlier. Morrison says the rate of increase in cases has gone from around 25% to 30% per day a week ago to around 13% to 15% today. In Australia, we can be thankful that the mild disputes between the federal government and the states over the best response to coronavirus are nothing compared to what\u2019s happening in the US at the moment. In addition to the fights between the states and the Trump administration over PPE, Trump\u2019s suggestion that New York could be quarantined for two weeks has been met with anger from the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. If we start walling off areas all across the country it would just be totally bizarre, counterproductive, anti-American, anti-social,\u201d Cuomo said. For the most part in Australia, it is the states (NSW and Victoria) pushing for a stronger lock down. The Australian government is working on getting hundreds of Australians stranded in Nepal back to Australia on a commercial flight that will cost nearly $3,000 per person. An email sent to Australians in Nepal from the embassy, seen by Guardian Australia, has revealed the Kathmandu to Sydney direct flight is currently being negotiated with an air carrier and will likely depart on April 1. The cost of the flight will be $US1800 (AU$2919) for economy and US$2300 (AU$3730) for business class. So far 175 passengers have registered, and 100 seats remain. Next Saturday, New Zealand nationals will also be offered access to this flight. People on the Australians stranded in Nepal Facebook page say they fear they will be trapped in the country because they cannot afford a ticket, or reach Kathmandu in time for the flight. Michael Bonner, an Australian aid worker with Three Angels Nepal, a non-government organisation, said between 80 and 100 people turned up at the embassy at 9am Saturday local time hoping to organise a ticket home. He said many more were stranded in the Himalayas and other parts of the country and unable to reach Kathmandu in time because roads were closed. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a couple of hundred people who will make this flight and another couple of hundred stranded as the situation in the country deteriorates,\u201d he said. He called on the government to delay the flight to give more Australians time to reach the capital. In response to concerns expressed on the Facebook page, the Australian ambassador to Nepal, Pete Budd, said he understood people were frustrated, and the embassy had tried to achieve economies of scale by securing the largest possible aircraft. \u201cMany Australians have been stretched financially having paid for bookings that were subsequently cancelled. The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote. \u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive. \u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle. This may have to be for an extended period.\u201d An infant who tested positive for coronavirus in Chicago has died, the New York Times is reporting. Finance minister Mathias Cormann\u2019s remarks on Insiders that the government is \u201cnot going to start shutting down businesses because we are under political pressure\u201d have more than a touch of unreality about them. When it comes to doing what is needed to make sure we have an economy that can spring back into action once the coronavirus crisis has passed, the government has consistently been too slow to take action, and the actions have been too small and too narrowly focused. Its inability to deal with the twin wages and rents crisis is a key problem. Businesses are already shutting down. Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days. And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke. Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses. People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills. Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords. A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem. After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d. And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d. From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers. This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events. It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works. Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done. On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew. And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t. Yes, these are hard problems to solve. But calling them \u201ccomplicated\u201d, which seems to be the Canberra consensus, won\u2019t make them any less urgent. Here\u2019s more on the announcement we are expecting from the prime minister in under an hour. This is what people returning to Australia now face: being put on a bus with supplies and ferried off to a hotel for 14 days of quarantine. On public servants still being forced to go to work, Cormann, says he is \u201cnot going to provide a directive\u201d on working from home on Insiders, but says if they can work from home they should. \u201cBut there is a lot of work that needs to be done right now by the federal public service to support the government\u2019s efforts in relation to protecting people\u2019s health.\u201d Should more businesses be closed to stop the spread, as NSW and Victoria are considering? Cormann says \u201cwe\u2019re not going to start shutting down businesses because we are under the political pressure. In the end, it is a war on two fronts, and shutting the economy down when there is no advice to do so would also have health consequences as well as social, and obvious economic consequences. So we\u2019ve got to continue to make sensible decisions here.\u201d He suggests it is not as simple as shutting down the whole economy and stopping coronavirus. It could start up again once the economy re-opens. On rental assistance for households, Cormann says it is mainly a state and territory issue that is being worked through national cabinet, but he says they want something fair and equitable to ensure sustainability for six months, at least. So not really sure what that would entail, yet. Cormann says the idea of Australia going into hibernation to get through the coronvirus pandemic is about \u201cspreading the pain\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on helping bring down the costs, helping defer costs where that is appropriate. Working with the banks, working with state and territory governments around some of the things that we can do ourselves in our capacity as landlords for businesses in some of the properties that are owned by government. \u201cThe idea here is to spread the pain as fairly and as equitably as possible to as many business as possible to be there on the other side when we expect a very strong recovery.\u201d Cormann won\u2019t say if it will be 70% or 80% of wages. He says it will be fair and equitable, but won\u2019t say what it means for the hundreds of thousands already put out of work. \u201cWe are working as fast as we can,\u201d he says. He confirms the government will ease partner income restrictions for people seeking welfare that currently mean if your partner earns $48K per year you can\u2019t get welfare, but he won\u2019t say what level it will be raised to. Mathias Cormann is asked whether he is still ruling out a UK-style wage subsidy system that he said \u201cwouldn\u2019t work\u201d in Australia just two days ago. Cormann says it will be done \u201cin an Australian way\u201d and in a way \u201cthat actually is going to be able to be delivered, using our existing systems and our existing architecture\u201d. When asked whether employee wages will be subsidised if employers keep staff on, Cormann says it will be \u201cincome support through business\u201d, through the tax and welfare systems. He says the government is still working through it. Insiders has produced this very useful segment on how Australia is tracking so far. Finance minister Mathias Cormann is about to be on ABC\u2019s Insiders program. I\u2019ll bring you updates from that interview, depending on what he says. Greg Jericho on whether we can expect the economy to bounce back quickly after the pandemic: In this instance we need to consider the virus and the response of governments around the world. The global economy is only as strong as the weakest link. And right now the US, led by Donald Trump, is in a pitiful state. NSW planning and public spaces minister Rob Stokes has told Nine newspapers that he is prepared to shut parks and other public spaces in the state if people are flouting the rules regarding social distancing. The Botanic Gardens in Melbourne have been closed already, and Stokes is now considering following his Victorian counterpart. A warm day in Melbourne yesterday saw people flock to beaches in St Kilda, which the Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton described as \u201creally crap\u201d. Good morning, and welcome to Sunday\u2019s live coverage of Australian news related to the coronavirus pandemic, I\u2019m Josh Taylor. As of 8.30am Sunday, there are over 3,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, and over 640,000 cases globally. There have been 14 deaths of people confirmed to have coronavirus in Australia, and almost 30,000 deaths globally. At 11am AEDT this morning we are expecting an announcement from the prime minister Scott Morrison, for $1bn in funding for support services including Medicare-subsidised telehealth services, domestic violence support, and mental health services as well as a boost for charities. A third stimulus package is not tipped to be announced until mid-week, but there are reports that the government is now considering a wage subsidy similar to the UK in order for companies affected by the pandemic to keep workers on. My colleague Katharine Murphy reports this morning that the third stimulus announcement is likely to be sequenced with further restrictions to enforce social distancing. Overnight in the US, president Donald Trump hinted New York could be quarantined for two weeks. You can find out more of what happened overnight here.",

Hungary, for example, has conducted less than a quarter of the number of tests that neighbouring Austria has, despite having a slightly larger population.

Romania is particularly vulnerable to a health crisis: the country has faced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/21/romanian-hospitals-in-crisis-as-emigration-take-its-toll\">chronic shortage of doctors for years</a>, with thousands leaving for better paid jobs abroad.</p> \n<p>To help with shortages of equipment, governments across the region have turned to Beijing. Over the past week the Czech and Hungarian prime ministers have personally met planes carrying equipment from China on the airport tarmac in Prague and Budapest.</p> \n<p>On Thursday a plane containing 150 respirators, 600,000 medical masks and more than 250,000 medical overalls arrived in Warsaw. On Friday the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borisov, announced he had struck a deal with China to purchase 50 respirators and 1.1m masks.</p> \n<p>There have also been promises to scale up testing, with Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, pledging the country will move to a model of mass testing on the advice of Chinese medical experts. But increasing the number of tests requires laboratory capacity that may not be present.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if we had more tests, we don\u2019t have the people to do them,\u201d Gra\u017cyna Cholewi\u0144ska, a Polish consultant specialising in infectious diseases, told the Polska Times this month. Romania\u2019s health minister resigned on Friday, two days after making the implausible promise that the government would test the entire 2 million population of Bucharest. So far Romania has carried out 12,000 tests.</p> \n<p>Authorities have tried to silence medics who raise concerns in public. In Poland, a nurse was dismissed by the director of her hospital for publishing an angry account on Facebook in which she described a chronic shortage of essential equipment and other irregularities.</p> \n<p>In Bulgaria, four doctors who complained about a lack of resources were reprimanded by the police for speaking out and \u201cspreading panic\u201d. In Hungary, several doctors contacted by the Guardian said they had been warned by their hospital bosses in the strictest terms against speaking to the media.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is also a fear that emergency coronavirus measures across the region could lead to the further erosion of democratic norms in the long term. Legislation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/hungary-to-consider-bill-that-would-allow-orban-to-rule-by-decree\">due to be passed in Hungary on Monday</a> will give the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the potential to rule by decree with no time limit or sunset clause. It also introduces jail terms for people who spread false information, and there are fears the law could be used to stifle critical reporting of the government response to the crisis.</p> \n<p>In Bulgaria, the leader of the opposition Socialist party, Kornelia Ninova, lamented the suspension of parliament during the state of emergency as \u201cthe first step towards dictatorship\u201d.</p> \n<p>In Poland, the government has insisted it will go ahead with presidential elections on 10 May despite the pandemic. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the Polish parliament passed an amendment to the electoral code allowing senior citizens and anyone in quarantine to use postal voting. The opposition has called for a postponement, saying it will be impossible to campaign during a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Amid the political manoeuvring, the region is nervously awaiting the inevitable rise in cases and hoping the early lockdowns will help avoid Italian-style carnage. One positive is that like elsewhere, people have come together like never before to support beleaguered medics.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never received this many messages of warmth and gratitude and this amount of love throughout my career,\u201d said the doctor in Budapest, who has been working for several decades. \u201cI feel like this time our work is really appreciated.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi and Martin Dimitrov</em></p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 31 March 2020, to add information about the Czech Republic testing widely for coronavirus.</p>",

But increasing the number of tests requires laboratory capacity that may not be present. \u201cEven if we had more tests, we don\u2019t have the people to do them,\u201d Gra\u017cyna Cholewi\u0144ska, a Polish consultant specialising in infectious diseases, told the Polska Times this month. Romania\u2019s health minister resigned on Friday, two days after making the implausible promise that the government would test the entire 2 million population of Bucharest. So far Romania has carried out 12,000 tests. Authorities have tried to silence medics who raise concerns in public. In Poland, a nurse was dismissed by the director of her hospital for publishing an angry account on Facebook in which she described a chronic shortage of essential equipment and other irregularities. In Bulgaria, four doctors who complained about a lack of resources were reprimanded by the police for speaking out and \u201cspreading panic\u201d. In Hungary, several doctors contacted by the Guardian said they had been warned by their hospital bosses in the strictest terms against speaking to the media. There is also a fear that emergency coronavirus measures across the region could lead to the further erosion of democratic norms in the long term. Legislation due to be passed in Hungary on Monday will give the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the potential to rule by decree with no time limit or sunset clause. It also introduces jail terms for people who spread false information, and there are fears the law could be used to stifle critical reporting of the government response to the crisis. In Bulgaria, the leader of the opposition Socialist party, Kornelia Ninova, lamented the suspension of parliament during the state of emergency as \u201cthe first step towards dictatorship\u201d. In Poland, the government has insisted it will go ahead with presidential elections on 10 May despite the pandemic. In the early hours of Saturday morning, the Polish parliament passed an amendment to the electoral code allowing senior citizens and anyone in quarantine to use postal voting. The opposition has called for a postponement, saying it will be impossible to campaign during a pandemic. Amid the political manoeuvring, the region is nervously awaiting the inevitable rise in cases and hoping the early lockdowns will help avoid Italian-style carnage. One positive is that like elsewhere, people have come together like never before to support beleaguered medics. \u201cI\u2019ve never received this many messages of warmth and gratitude and this amount of love throughout my career,\u201d said the doctor in Budapest, who has been working for several decades. \u201cI feel like this time our work is really appreciated.\u201d Additional reporting by Flora Garamvolgyi and Martin Dimitrov \u2022 This article was amended on 31 March 2020, to add information about the Czech Republic testing widely for coronavirus.",

Because the epidemics will vary state by state, and the response will vary state by state.\u201d It is \u201ccrucially urgent\u201d for the Trump administration to coordinate aid for the states and for the president to use his bully pulpit to focus the national attention, said Gostin. \u201cThat should have been happening several weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we wait without having a properly coordinated national approach the worse the disaster will unfold in the United States.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Mark Kermode<br><em><strong>Chief film critic for the Observer since 2013</strong></em></h2> <p>\u201cEvery now and then, in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, when you\u2019ve seen a run of really bad films \u2013 <em>Mighty Pups</em>, say, followed by some terrible Michael Bay movie \u2013 and you\u2019re scuttling from one screening room to another, and it\u2019s raining, and you\u2019ve got a deadline, and you\u2019ve been up since 5am, and you think: \u2018Ohhh, life is so hard!\u2019 But then you go: \u2018Hang on a minute\u2026\u2019\u201d Mark Kermode takes a breath and reflects on his professional fortunes. \u201cWhen I went to the school careers office, they told me I should probably work in an insurance office. Instead,\u201d \u2013 he draws the next six words out for emphasis \u2013 \u201cI watch films for a living. Which is astonishing to me. I should never ever complain about the job that I have, because I have the best job in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Kermode got the job as the<em> Observer</em>\u2019s chief film critic in 2013, taking over from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/01/philip-french-tributes-mark-kermode-clive-james-claire-tomalin\" title=\"\">the late, great Philip French</a>, who was retiring after 50 years in the role. Prior to that, he had written for <em>Time Out</em>, <em>NME</em> and <em>Fangoria</em>, as well as broadcasting about film for the BBC and Channel 4. Each new gig delighted him, but when the <em>Observer</em> first got in touch in 2003, asking him to fill in while French was away, Kermode recalls being \u201ccompletely overwhelmed\u201d by the opportunity. (Aptly, given his love of horror films, his first review was of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/08/features.review\" title=\"\">the Japanese chiller </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jun/08/features.review\" title=\"\">Dark Water</a></em>.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every week I am filled with the absolute belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every Monday and Tuesday, in normal times, Kermode travels to London from the New Forest, where he lives with his wife, the film studies professor Linda Ruth Williams, and watches eight or nine films in Soho\u2019s screening rooms. He takes notes as he watches \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t use a light-up pen or any of that nonsense, I just taught myself to write in the dark\u201d \u2013 jotting down things that particularly strike him, \u201clike the composition of a shot, or a particular line, or the use of a piece of music, or a striking juxtaposition of scenes\u201d.</p> <p>Agreeing on his film of the week with his editor at the <em>Observer</em>, he gets his notes in order on the train home and writes his column on Wednesday morning. Kermode admits to finding writing \u201cthe most stressful thing on Earth\u201d. After filing at 1pm, \u201cI worry away at it for the rest of the afternoon while subbing queries come in. And then it goes off on Thursday and I am filled with the belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written ever and it will bring the newspaper to its knees. Then it comes out on Sunday and it starts all over again.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of this, Kermode\u2019s love of film criticism runs deep. As a kid, growing up in Hertfordshire, he used to keep notes of all the films he watched. Now, in his home office crammed with movie memorabilia, books and DVDs, he is adamant the form remains as vital and relevant as ever in the social media age.</p> <p>He welcomes one significant change. \u201cThere have always been brilliant female film critics, but I think people finally started to realise that the fact that a room full of the same ageing white blokes wasn\u2019t doing anybody any good.\u201d His <em>Observer</em> deputies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/wendy-ide\" title=\"\">Wendy Ide</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simran-hans\" title=\"\">Simran Hans</a> are, he says, brilliant. \u201cWorking with them makes me constantly up my game.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201cThe Sunday that the first review I wrote for the <em>Observer</em> came out, I remember sitting with the paper open on the kitchen table, just looking at it going: \u201cI\u2019ve arrived.\u201d I thought to myself, look, I\u2019m in the <em>Observer</em>, I must know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Laura Cumming<br><em><strong>Art critic for the Observer since 1990</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a91b23d22dace6f5d3269ba349e1db173c7b4b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a91b23d22dace6f5d3269ba349e1db173c7b4b8a/0_0_4854_3640/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Laura Cumming at home in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laura Cumming at home in London, in front of a painting by her father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt seems to me it comes in three stages,\u201d says Laura Cumming of the process of reviewing art for the <em>Observer New Review</em>. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s the exhilaration of seeing the show. Then there\u2019s the torture of thinking it through; and finally the torture is relieved by the writing.\u201d</p> <p>Cumming has been working through these stages on an almost weekly basis for more than 20 years. Born in Edinburgh to artist parents, she studied English literature at university and started out as a producer and presenter for the BBC. Her deeply held interest in art was channelled first through radio shows on painting and then through writing for the <em>New Statesman</em> and the <em>Guardian</em> before she became the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s art critic in 1999.</p> <p>Over the years, Cumming has taken great pleasure in witnessing artists embrace \u201cfilm and video and performance and installation and ballet, and every other field that has come into art to enrich it\u201d \u2013 and she still feels exhilarated every time she goes to a gallery. \u201cThe prospect of each new show,\u201d she says, \u201cis like virgin snow.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Thank God for deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She prepares by poring over the catalogue and soaking up everything else she can find about the artist, from books to online video clips. Then she goes to a critics\u2019 preview, usually on the weekend before her review comes out. Making notes and sketches with pen and paper, she also uses her phone to \u201cphotograph astonishing details that I know I will never see again \u2013 I\u2019ve got billions of them stored away\u201d.</p> <p>Occasionally, she\u2019ll catch herself saying out loud things like \u201cshocking, shocking\u201d or \u201cfor God\u2019s sake!\u201d, but there\u2019s rarely anyone around to hear it, because, as she acknowledges: \u201cWe see exhibitions when the galleries are completely empty, which is of course both an enormous privilege and an unreality.\u201d</p> <p>Back home, in south London, she commits her notes to laptop and lets it sit, usually overnight, while she wrestles with \u201cthe thinking bit, which is the torture\u201d. Then comes the release. \u201cI write in our bedroom in the loft \u2013 I don\u2019t have a study,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I write a lot in bed, because I don\u2019t really have a desk either.\u201d The words come slowly. Reviewing a Jackson Pollock retrospective early in her career, she spent eight hours writing and rewriting the first paragraph. \u201cSo thank God for deadlines,\u201d she says. \u201cI love deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s striking about her home in Clapham, which I visited before the coronavirus outbreak, is how little art there is on the walls. She has some reproductions of prints, notably \u201ca blow-up of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/26/velazquez-las-meninas-everything-is-happening-extract-michael-jacobs\" title=\"\">Las Meninas</a></em> [by Vel\u00e1zquez] on a big card, which I love looking at\u201d, but otherwise it\u2019s mainly work by her parents \u2013 her father James\u2019s geometrical paintings (an example is in the photograph above), her mother Betty\u2019s tapestries. \u201cI don\u2019t collect art,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not acquisitive. I\u2019m much happier seeing it in its natural state in the wild, in the gallery, rather than in my house.\u201d</p> <p>There are things that dismay her about her field. \u201cOne big change in the past couple of decades,\u201d she says, \u201chas been the crowning of curators \u2013 sometimes you are following a curator\u2019s mind rather than an artist\u2019s.\u201d She is suspicious of the commercial workings of the art world and tries to steer clear of curators, artists and publicists when seeing shows. \u201cOur job,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cis to be critics, not courtiers.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, reviewing for the <em>Observer</em> is a high point of Cumming\u2019s week, which is also taken up by authoring books (<em>On Chapel Sands</em>, her 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/23/on-chapel-sands-laura-cumming-extract-memoir-mother\" title=\"\">memoir-through-photography about her mother</a> has been shortlisted for many awards). Despite the torturous moments that precede the writing, \u201cit is not agonising,\u201d she insists. \u201cIt is an absolute privilege and a total joy.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201cIn 2006, before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/22/art\" title=\"\">the Vel\u00e1zquez exhibition at the National Gallery</a>, I came upon one of the paintings laid out on a table while conservators were trying to work out whether or not a fleck of paint had come off the surface. It was a scene like <em><a href=\"https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/artworks/the-anatomy-lesson-of-dr-nicolaes-tulp-146/\" title=\"\">The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Nicolaes Tulp</a></em>, with low lights over the painting and people in white gloves carefully examining whether or not they\u2019d lost a dot of light on the hem of an infanta\u2019s gown. They hadn\u2019t, as it turned out, but to be in the room and be able to see what they were looking at in such close-up was extraordinary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Bidisha<br><em><strong>Observer dance critic since 2019</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4e5e0a792a3f4b71746afea5cbd49070cb6a2361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e5e0a792a3f4b71746afea5cbd49070cb6a2361/0_0_3455_4523/764.jpg\" alt=\"Bidisha in her garden.\" width=\"764\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bidisha in her garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bidisha has written about books, art, film and music since she was a teenager, but when she became a regular dance critic last year, a role she shares with the critic Sarah Crompton, she almost couldn\u2019t figure out how to handle it. \u201cEvery single person I spoke to said: \u2018Don\u2019t you realise it\u2019s absolutely the dream job?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I realised that my feeling was actually just sheer disbelief that I get paid to do something that doesn\u2019t feel like work at all.\u201d</p> <p>The role fits seamlessly with her wider career as a journalist, writer and film-maker \u2013 and her natural night-owl tendencies. \u201cI get home at 11, so if you finish by two that\u2019s just a normal bedtime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most fun thing is coming home, making the decaf coffee, and then sitting at the computer. The street\u2019s really quiet; your thoughts are really clear.\u201d</p> <p>Her pre-virus morning routine may prompt howls of jealousy in those working nine to five: she usually sleeps till 10.30. \u201cThat\u2019s the norm \u2013 but I get most done in the evenings, I\u2019m most awake then.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bidisha also finds it rather helpful to have to go out a few nights a week. \u201cI love to work from home because you just get so much more done. But we\u2019re living in a time of increasing atomisation, where we watch films on our laptops, we watch TV on our laptops, we read at home, so being pulled out is incredibly valuable.\u201d</p> <p>Plus writing about dance has a fruitful impact on her own creative practice of making short films: \u201cYou learn so much about how to present something dramatic from dance. It\u2019s teaching me a lot about lighting and music and costume, about editing and storytelling.\u201d</p> <p>If she\u2019s reviewing in the evening, Bidisha will spend the day catching up with life admin before heading to the theatre for 7pm. \u201cI love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She\u2019ll take \u201cvery complete\u201d notes during the performance, so that almost the whole review is in her notebook by the end. Writing it up involves topping and tailing with context and interpretation. \u201cBut I\u2019m very, very against obscurantism,\u201d she says vehemently.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of critics fall into the trap of saying \u2018Well, this Beethoven was nothing like when I saw it in New York in 1974\u2019. It\u2019s a form of willy-measuring, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p> <p>Bidisha\u2019s approach is simply to describe the movement. \u201cPeople think you need a special kind of vocabulary for dance, which you don\u2019t at all. You don\u2019t have to find a story; just sit back and enjoy it. And that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d</p> <p>But for all the joy, criticism is still a job. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped going with friends because they\u2019re a bad influence! We always wound up having two martinis and dinner at 11. Now I eat enough at five so I\u2019m full during the performance, then have hot skimmed milk when I get home if I\u2019m peckish.\u201d</p> <p>She also tries to leave as quickly as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not a night out, so I just want to pack up the stuff, and beat the rush for the exit.\u201d That means that she \u2013 and the other critics, usually sat on the ends of the row \u2013 scoot out without applauding. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because we\u2019re cynical, jaded hacks,\u201d she admits. \u201cHow many times can you possibly clap for a thing?\u201d <br><strong>Interview by Holly Williams</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Rowan Moore<br><em><strong>Observer architecture critic since 2010</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7d57fa3679249d07696c507a96716cc408203aa9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d57fa3679249d07696c507a96716cc408203aa9/0_736_4676_2806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rowan Moore at home in east London, in the extension, by 6a architects, designed for his late wife.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rowan Moore at home in east London, in the extension, by 6a architects, designed for his late wife.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before Rowan Moore became a full-time architecture critic, he worked on the other side of the fence, training as an architect and co-running his own practice until 1994. Though he went on to edit <em>Blueprint</em> magazine and review for the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Evening </em><em>Standard</em> \u2013 as well as heading up the Architecture Foundation from 2002 to 2008 \u2013 his early experience helped him appreciate the difficulties of the profession from the inside. \u201cAlthough I criticise architects,\u201d he says, \u201cI think to put up a building that has some kind of intention to it, that realises an idea, is a hugely impressive achievement.\u201d</p> <p>Moore, who joined the <em>Observer</em> in 2010, considers it his job to weigh up \u201cbroader issues around architecture as well as architecture itself\u201d. Instead of simply writing about \u201ca single work by a master of the art form\u201d, he\u2019ll think carefully about the people who move through the building, the area in which it stands, and the social, political and economic factors that shaped it.</p> <p>One unusual aspect of his job is that \u2013 unlike other forms of criticism that, in normal times, depend on a weekly schedule of releases \u2013 it\u2019s not always clear what he\u2019ll write about. Sometimes, in the absence of a new building or exhibition to assess, \u201cit\u2019s a case of making your own story\u201d, he says. Lately, this has meant taking aim at Tory planning policies or surveying architectural responses to the climate crisis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another difference is that Moore\u2019s job often involves speaking to the people whose work he\u2019s critiquing. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in writing about buildings as magical objects that just appear one day, because they\u2019re always there for a reason, or many reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I talk to people \u2013 clients as well as architects \u2013 and ask them what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d</p> <p>He jots all this down in a notebook and snaps details with his phone, before heading home to write \u2013 ideally over a couple of days so he can take a fresh look at his copy before filing. Having previously worked on daily newspapers with fast turnarounds, Moore finds it \u201ca fantastic luxury on the <em>Observer</em> to be able to take more time over articles\u201d.</p> <p>He\u2019s susceptible to the odd bit of procrastination \u2013 \u201cI distract myself by looking at football results and the news\u201d \u2013 but when it comes to writing Moore doesn\u2019t seem at all precious. \u201cI can write with noise in the background,\u201d he says, and at home in Whitechapel, east London, \u201cI just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy.\u201d</p> <p>There is plenty of space to wander around in: his home consists of two smallish 1830s terraced houses joined together, with dividing walls removed on the ground floor so that the kitchen opens into a spacious living room with a huge desert-scape by his painter friend Jock McFadyen on the wall.</p> <p>At the back is a long, gently sloping extension which was added to accommodate Moore\u2019s late wife, who was diagnosed with MS in her mid-30s. By 2011, she was using a wheelchair and no longer able to access the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. \u201cThe extension was about giving her everything she needed without any steps,\u201d says Moore.</p> <p>It was also about \u201cenhancing the house rather than the opposite\u201d. When architects design for disability, \u201cthere\u2019s still a bit of an attitude that if you\u2019re fixing somebody\u2019s practical problem, they should be grateful for it,\u201d says Moore, \u201ceven if it\u2019s really ugly and messes up the house.\u201d With this extension, which slopes gracefully down to a bedroom and bathroom, opening on to a garden with decked pathways amid sumac and eucalyptus trees, Moore and his wife, who died in 2017, were challenging that view.</p> <p>In its joyful layering of different periods, the house repudiates one of Moore\u2019s pet hates in architecture. \u201cWhen I started out in the 80s, the dominant narrative was: modern architects have messed everything up,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow lots of people get the idea that modern design can do something for you. But it\u2019s the opposition of modern and old that I find very unhelpful.\u201d</p> <p>Though he expresses strong views in his columns, and mostly regrets \u201cthe ones when I was too nice \u2013 when I tried too hard to be positive in a situation where it wasn\u2019t warranted\u201d, Moore doesn\u2019t regard himself as a \u201cfinal arbiter\u201d on any given project. \u201cI have a viewpoint that I think has a validity, because I know about this subject and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut whatever I write, it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all \u2013 it\u2019s a contribution to an ongoing process of understanding architecture.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>In 1986, after finishing university, he went to Los Angeles to write some magazine articles, which put him in contact with Frank Gehry and other interesting architects. \u201cThe climate in Britain at that time was extremely suspicious of new architecture, so it was really exciting and encouraging to go to California, where there was a very positive view and really interesting things going on. It gave me a lot of faith that new buildings could be good.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Interactive\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Susannah Clapp<br><em><strong>Theatre critic for the Observer since 1997</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd77ce7e1efb13ae3a69ed913602df6caeb8cfed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd77ce7e1efb13ae3a69ed913602df6caeb8cfed/0_0_4788_3591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susannah Clapp at her home in King\u2019s Cross, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susannah Clapp at her home in King\u2019s Cross, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cSideways,\u201d is how Susannah Clapp describes her route into writing about theatre. In 1994, after years of working in and around the publishing industry \u2013 she <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/london-review-of-books-at-40-susannah-clapp\" title=\"\">helped found the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/london-review-of-books-at-40-susannah-clapp\" title=\"\">London Review of Books</a></em> and wrote a biography of the writer Bruce Chatwin \u2013 she was asked to review plays for the BBC Radio 3 arts programme <em>Night Waves</em>, a gig that involved dashing straight from the theatre to deliver a \u201cmatch report\u201d on the latest stage action. Moving into print, Clapp reviewed for the <em>New Statesman</em> before becoming chief theatre critic for the <em>Observer</em> in 1997.</p> <p>Having spent so much time focusing on the written word, \u201cit was exciting to work in something which also required you to think about how things <em>looked</em>,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTheatre involves so many different reactions \u2013 acoustic, visual, working out how people\u2019s gestures influence or interrupt what they say \u2013 all of which is instantaneous and can\u2019t be captured instantaneously in a book.\u201d</p> <p>One of her aims, starting out, was to avoid writing literary reviews \u201cwhich suggested that plays were composed of cut-out text walking around the stage\u201d. Instead, she wanted \u201cto write about [characters] as if you\u2019re writing about an enhanced group of friends, or enemies, a hyperactive piece of life, and I suppose that\u2019s joy of it \u2013 that, at its best, theatre either takes you out of your life or further into it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always think about the first thing I\u2019d say to describe a play to a friend</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The fact that \u201cthere are so many different things going on at the same time\u201d on the stage is endlessly compelling. \u201cEven if you\u2019re squirming with boredom or frustration, you can isolate an element of design, or the one actor who elevates it \u2013 and if it\u2019s simply a travesty, that in itself is interesting.\u201d</p> <p>For her <em>Observer</em> column, Clapp usually reviews three plays per week. This involves a considerable amount of pre-planning \u2013 she keeps a \u201clong, obsessive list\u201d of forthcoming openings around the country. Even when the week ahead has been finalised, she can never be quite sure, until she\u2019s seen them all, which of the three plays will be her lead review. As a result, \u201cthe major part of the writing always gets done at the last minute\u201d.</p> <p>She makes notes in the theatre, \u201cbut they\u2019re often unreadable because I don\u2019t have very good handwriting\u201d, she says. \u201cQuite often, I forget to turn over the page and I find that I\u2019ve written my already indecipherable scrawl on top of something else \u2013 but I hope that the act of writing fixes it in my mind.\u201d She tries to identify her \u201cline\u201d on the play in the same night \u2013 \u201cjust simply, whether I liked it or not. And what is the first thing I would say about this if I were describing it to a friend?\u201d</p> <p>There are a number of small but niggling dilemmas that accompany a theatre critic through her week. The hours are odd \u2013 you\u2019re starting work when others are clocking off \u2013 and the timing of dinner is often fraught. \u201cDo you eat beforehand and risk getting sleepy? On the other hand, if you go hungry, and there\u2019s a play with a lot of eating in it, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s odd, too, rubbing shoulders with fellow critics night after night \u2013 \u201cwe share a vocabulary, we share a task, though we\u2019re not exactly colleagues\u201d \u2013 while having to resist discussing the play at hand, lest it sway your opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most male profession I\u2019ve ever worked in \u2013 much more male and, of course, white than broadcasting or publishing or literary journalism. It\u2019s changing now, but very slowly.\u201d</p> <p>Home is a flat overlooking a square near King\u2019s Cross, London. Here Clapp does most of her writing in her front room, which is lined with play texts, theatrical biographies and reference books, though she sometimes works in a cafe or library. \u201cI am a big believer in walking as writing (or vice versa),\u201d she says. \u201cIf I get stuck, I charge around the square and often find a sentence slips into place. I work out what I think more easily on the hoof \u2013 going to or from the theatre, or emptying the rubbish \u2013 than when stooped over my desk.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The career moment I\u2019ll never forget</strong><br>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/29/theatre\" title=\"\">Punchdrunk\u2019s site-specific production of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/29/theatre\" title=\"\">Faust</a></em> in a warehouse in Wapping \u2013 a meticulously created Edward Hopper world with bubbling test tubes and stinky herbs and extraordinarily fragrant pine forests.

      "bodyText": "Mark Kermode Chief film critic for the Observer since 2013 \u201cEvery now and then, in the middle of Tuesday afternoon, when you\u2019ve seen a run of really bad films \u2013 Mighty Pups, say, followed by some terrible Michael Bay movie \u2013 and you\u2019re scuttling from one screening room to another, and it\u2019s raining, and you\u2019ve got a deadline, and you\u2019ve been up since 5am, and you think: \u2018Ohhh, life is so hard!\u2019 But then you go: \u2018Hang on a minute\u2026\u2019\u201d Mark Kermode takes a breath and reflects on his professional fortunes. \u201cWhen I went to the school careers office, they told me I should probably work in an insurance office. Instead,\u201d \u2013 he draws the next six words out for emphasis \u2013 \u201cI watch films for a living. Which is astonishing to me. I should never ever complain about the job that I have, because I have the best job in the world.\u201d Kermode got the job as the Observer\u2019s chief film critic in 2013, taking over from the late, great Philip French, who was retiring after 50 years in the role. Prior to that, he had written for Time Out, NME and Fangoria, as well as broadcasting about film for the BBC and Channel 4. Each new gig delighted him, but when the Observer first got in touch in 2003, asking him to fill in while French was away, Kermode recalls being \u201ccompletely overwhelmed\u201d by the opportunity. (Aptly, given his love of horror films, his first review was of the Japanese chiller Dark Water.) Every Monday and Tuesday, in normal times, Kermode travels to London from the New Forest, where he lives with his wife, the film studies professor Linda Ruth Williams, and watches eight or nine films in Soho\u2019s screening rooms. He takes notes as he watches \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t use a light-up pen or any of that nonsense, I just taught myself to write in the dark\u201d \u2013 jotting down things that particularly strike him, \u201clike the composition of a shot, or a particular line, or the use of a piece of music, or a striking juxtaposition of scenes\u201d. Agreeing on his film of the week with his editor at the Observer, he gets his notes in order on the train home and writes his column on Wednesday morning. Kermode admits to finding writing \u201cthe most stressful thing on Earth\u201d. After filing at 1pm, \u201cI worry away at it for the rest of the afternoon while subbing queries come in. And then it goes off on Thursday and I am filled with the belief that what I\u2019ve written is the stupidest thing anyone has ever written ever and it will bring the newspaper to its knees. Then it comes out on Sunday and it starts all over again.\u201d In spite of this, Kermode\u2019s love of film criticism runs deep. As a kid, growing up in Hertfordshire, he used to keep notes of all the films he watched. Now, in his home office crammed with movie memorabilia, books and DVDs, he is adamant the form remains as vital and relevant as ever in the social media age. He welcomes one significant change. \u201cThere have always been brilliant female film critics, but I think people finally started to realise that the fact that a room full of the same ageing white blokes wasn\u2019t doing anybody any good.\u201d His Observer deputies Wendy Ide and Simran Hans are, he says, brilliant. \u201cWorking with them makes me constantly up my game.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget \u201cThe Sunday that the first review I wrote for the Observer came out, I remember sitting with the paper open on the kitchen table, just looking at it going: \u201cI\u2019ve arrived.\u201d I thought to myself, look, I\u2019m in the Observer, I must know what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d Laura Cumming Art critic for the Observer since 1990 \u201cIt seems to me it comes in three stages,\u201d says Laura Cumming of the process of reviewing art for the Observer New Review. \u201cFirst, there\u2019s the exhilaration of seeing the show. Then there\u2019s the torture of thinking it through; and finally the torture is relieved by the writing.\u201d Cumming has been working through these stages on an almost weekly basis for more than 20 years. Born in Edinburgh to artist parents, she studied English literature at university and started out as a producer and presenter for the BBC. Her deeply held interest in art was channelled first through radio shows on painting and then through writing for the New Statesman and the Guardian before she became the Observer\u2019s art critic in 1999. Over the years, Cumming has taken great pleasure in witnessing artists embrace \u201cfilm and video and performance and installation and ballet, and every other field that has come into art to enrich it\u201d \u2013 and she still feels exhilarated every time she goes to a gallery. \u201cThe prospect of each new show,\u201d she says, \u201cis like virgin snow.\u201d She prepares by poring over the catalogue and soaking up everything else she can find about the artist, from books to online video clips. Then she goes to a critics\u2019 preview, usually on the weekend before her review comes out. Making notes and sketches with pen and paper, she also uses her phone to \u201cphotograph astonishing details that I know I will never see again \u2013 I\u2019ve got billions of them stored away\u201d. Occasionally, she\u2019ll catch herself saying out loud things like \u201cshocking, shocking\u201d or \u201cfor God\u2019s sake!\u201d, but there\u2019s rarely anyone around to hear it, because, as she acknowledges: \u201cWe see exhibitions when the galleries are completely empty, which is of course both an enormous privilege and an unreality.\u201d Back home, in south London, she commits her notes to laptop and lets it sit, usually overnight, while she wrestles with \u201cthe thinking bit, which is the torture\u201d. Then comes the release. \u201cI write in our bedroom in the loft \u2013 I don\u2019t have a study,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I write a lot in bed, because I don\u2019t really have a desk either.\u201d The words come slowly. Reviewing a Jackson Pollock retrospective early in her career, she spent eight hours writing and rewriting the first paragraph. \u201cSo thank God for deadlines,\u201d she says. \u201cI love deadlines. I love the clarity they impose on your thought.\u201d What\u2019s striking about her home in Clapham, which I visited before the coronavirus outbreak, is how little art there is on the walls. She has some reproductions of prints, notably \u201ca blow-up of Las Meninas [by Vel\u00e1zquez] on a big card, which I love looking at\u201d, but otherwise it\u2019s mainly work by her parents \u2013 her father James\u2019s geometrical paintings (an example is in the photograph above), her mother Betty\u2019s tapestries. \u201cI don\u2019t collect art,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not acquisitive. I\u2019m much happier seeing it in its natural state in the wild, in the gallery, rather than in my house.\u201d There are things that dismay her about her field. \u201cOne big change in the past couple of decades,\u201d she says, \u201chas been the crowning of curators \u2013 sometimes you are following a curator\u2019s mind rather than an artist\u2019s.\u201d She is suspicious of the commercial workings of the art world and tries to steer clear of curators, artists and publicists when seeing shows. \u201cOur job,\u201d as she puts it, \u201cis to be critics, not courtiers.\u201d For all that, reviewing for the Observer is a high point of Cumming\u2019s week, which is also taken up by authoring books (On Chapel Sands, her 2019 memoir-through-photography about her mother has been shortlisted for many awards). Despite the torturous moments that precede the writing, \u201cit is not agonising,\u201d she insists. \u201cIt is an absolute privilege and a total joy.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget \u201cIn 2006, before the Vel\u00e1zquez exhibition at the National Gallery, I came upon one of the paintings laid out on a table while conservators were trying to work out whether or not a fleck of paint had come off the surface. It was a scene like The Anatomy Lesson of Doctor Nicolaes Tulp, with low lights over the painting and people in white gloves carefully examining whether or not they\u2019d lost a dot of light on the hem of an infanta\u2019s gown. They hadn\u2019t, as it turned out, but to be in the room and be able to see what they were looking at in such close-up was extraordinary.\u201d Bidisha Observer dance critic since 2019 Bidisha has written about books, art, film and music since she was a teenager, but when she became a regular dance critic last year, a role she shares with the critic Sarah Crompton, she almost couldn\u2019t figure out how to handle it. \u201cEvery single person I spoke to said: \u2018Don\u2019t you realise it\u2019s absolutely the dream job?\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I realised that my feeling was actually just sheer disbelief that I get paid to do something that doesn\u2019t feel like work at all.\u201d The role fits seamlessly with her wider career as a journalist, writer and film-maker \u2013 and her natural night-owl tendencies. \u201cI get home at 11, so if you finish by two that\u2019s just a normal bedtime,\u201d she says. \u201cThe most fun thing is coming home, making the decaf coffee, and then sitting at the computer. The street\u2019s really quiet; your thoughts are really clear.\u201d Her pre-virus morning routine may prompt howls of jealousy in those working nine to five: she usually sleeps till 10.30. \u201cThat\u2019s the norm \u2013 but I get most done in the evenings, I\u2019m most awake then.\u201d Bidisha also finds it rather helpful to have to go out a few nights a week. \u201cI love to work from home because you just get so much more done. But we\u2019re living in a time of increasing atomisation, where we watch films on our laptops, we watch TV on our laptops, we read at home, so being pulled out is incredibly valuable.\u201d Plus writing about dance has a fruitful impact on her own creative practice of making short films: \u201cYou learn so much about how to present something dramatic from dance. It\u2019s teaching me a lot about lighting and music and costume, about editing and storytelling.\u201d If she\u2019s reviewing in the evening, Bidisha will spend the day catching up with life admin before heading to the theatre for 7pm. \u201cI love to people-watch beforehand \u2013 dance audiences are the most fabulously dressed,\u201d she says. She\u2019ll take \u201cvery complete\u201d notes during the performance, so that almost the whole review is in her notebook by the end. Writing it up involves topping and tailing with context and interpretation. \u201cBut I\u2019m very, very against obscurantism,\u201d she says vehemently. \u201cA lot of critics fall into the trap of saying \u2018Well, this Beethoven was nothing like when I saw it in New York in 1974\u2019. It\u2019s a form of willy-measuring, and I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d Bidisha\u2019s approach is simply to describe the movement. \u201cPeople think you need a special kind of vocabulary for dance, which you don\u2019t at all. You don\u2019t have to find a story; just sit back and enjoy it. And that\u2019s what I try to do.\u201d But for all the joy, criticism is still a job. \u201cI\u2019ve stopped going with friends because they\u2019re a bad influence! We always wound up having two martinis and dinner at 11. Now I eat enough at five so I\u2019m full during the performance, then have hot skimmed milk when I get home if I\u2019m peckish.\u201d She also tries to leave as quickly as possible. \u201cIt\u2019s not a night out, so I just want to pack up the stuff, and beat the rush for the exit.\u201d That means that she \u2013 and the other critics, usually sat on the ends of the row \u2013 scoot out without applauding. \u201cAnd it\u2019s because we\u2019re cynical, jaded hacks,\u201d she admits. \u201cHow many times can you possibly clap for a thing?\u201d Interview by Holly Williams Rowan Moore Observer architecture critic since 2010 Before Rowan Moore became a full-time architecture critic, he worked on the other side of the fence, training as an architect and co-running his own practice until 1994. Though he went on to edit Blueprint magazine and review for the Daily Telegraph and Evening Standard \u2013 as well as heading up the Architecture Foundation from 2002 to 2008 \u2013 his early experience helped him appreciate the difficulties of the profession from the inside. \u201cAlthough I criticise architects,\u201d he says, \u201cI think to put up a building that has some kind of intention to it, that realises an idea, is a hugely impressive achievement.\u201d Moore, who joined the Observer in 2010, considers it his job to weigh up \u201cbroader issues around architecture as well as architecture itself\u201d. Instead of simply writing about \u201ca single work by a master of the art form\u201d, he\u2019ll think carefully about the people who move through the building, the area in which it stands, and the social, political and economic factors that shaped it. One unusual aspect of his job is that \u2013 unlike other forms of criticism that, in normal times, depend on a weekly schedule of releases \u2013 it\u2019s not always clear what he\u2019ll write about. Sometimes, in the absence of a new building or exhibition to assess, \u201cit\u2019s a case of making your own story\u201d, he says. Lately, this has meant taking aim at Tory planning policies or surveying architectural responses to the climate crisis. Another difference is that Moore\u2019s job often involves speaking to the people whose work he\u2019s critiquing. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in writing about buildings as magical objects that just appear one day, because they\u2019re always there for a reason, or many reasons,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I talk to people \u2013 clients as well as architects \u2013 and ask them what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d He jots all this down in a notebook and snaps details with his phone, before heading home to write \u2013 ideally over a couple of days so he can take a fresh look at his copy before filing. Having previously worked on daily newspapers with fast turnarounds, Moore finds it \u201ca fantastic luxury on the Observer to be able to take more time over articles\u201d. He\u2019s susceptible to the odd bit of procrastination \u2013 \u201cI distract myself by looking at football results and the news\u201d \u2013 but when it comes to writing Moore doesn\u2019t seem at all precious. \u201cI can write with noise in the background,\u201d he says, and at home in Whitechapel, east London, \u201cI just wander around with my laptop and write wherever I fancy.\u201d There is plenty of space to wander around in: his home consists of two smallish 1830s terraced houses joined together, with dividing walls removed on the ground floor so that the kitchen opens into a spacious living room with a huge desert-scape by his painter friend Jock McFadyen on the wall. At the back is a long, gently sloping extension which was added to accommodate Moore\u2019s late wife, who was diagnosed with MS in her mid-30s. By 2011, she was using a wheelchair and no longer able to access the bedroom and bathroom upstairs. \u201cThe extension was about giving her everything she needed without any steps,\u201d says Moore. It was also about \u201cenhancing the house rather than the opposite\u201d. When architects design for disability, \u201cthere\u2019s still a bit of an attitude that if you\u2019re fixing somebody\u2019s practical problem, they should be grateful for it,\u201d says Moore, \u201ceven if it\u2019s really ugly and messes up the house.\u201d With this extension, which slopes gracefully down to a bedroom and bathroom, opening on to a garden with decked pathways amid sumac and eucalyptus trees, Moore and his wife, who died in 2017, were challenging that view. In its joyful layering of different periods, the house repudiates one of Moore\u2019s pet hates in architecture. \u201cWhen I started out in the 80s, the dominant narrative was: modern architects have messed everything up,\u201d he recalls. \u201cNow lots of people get the idea that modern design can do something for you. But it\u2019s the opposition of modern and old that I find very unhelpful.\u201d Though he expresses strong views in his columns, and mostly regrets \u201cthe ones when I was too nice \u2013 when I tried too hard to be positive in a situation where it wasn\u2019t warranted\u201d, Moore doesn\u2019t regard himself as a \u201cfinal arbiter\u201d on any given project. \u201cI have a viewpoint that I think has a validity, because I know about this subject and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at buildings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut whatever I write, it\u2019s not the be-all and end-all \u2013 it\u2019s a contribution to an ongoing process of understanding architecture.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget In 1986, after finishing university, he went to Los Angeles to write some magazine articles, which put him in contact with Frank Gehry and other interesting architects. \u201cThe climate in Britain at that time was extremely suspicious of new architecture, so it was really exciting and encouraging to go to California, where there was a very positive view and really interesting things going on. It gave me a lot of faith that new buildings could be good.\u201d Susannah Clapp Theatre critic for the Observer since 1997 \u201cSideways,\u201d is how Susannah Clapp describes her route into writing about theatre. In 1994, after years of working in and around the publishing industry \u2013 she helped found the London Review of Books and wrote a biography of the writer Bruce Chatwin \u2013 she was asked to review plays for the BBC Radio 3 arts programme Night Waves, a gig that involved dashing straight from the theatre to deliver a \u201cmatch report\u201d on the latest stage action. Moving into print, Clapp reviewed for the New Statesman before becoming chief theatre critic for the Observer in 1997. Having spent so much time focusing on the written word, \u201cit was exciting to work in something which also required you to think about how things looked,\u201d she recalls. \u201cTheatre involves so many different reactions \u2013 acoustic, visual, working out how people\u2019s gestures influence or interrupt what they say \u2013 all of which is instantaneous and can\u2019t be captured instantaneously in a book.\u201d One of her aims, starting out, was to avoid writing literary reviews \u201cwhich suggested that plays were composed of cut-out text walking around the stage\u201d. Instead, she wanted \u201cto write about [characters] as if you\u2019re writing about an enhanced group of friends, or enemies, a hyperactive piece of life, and I suppose that\u2019s joy of it \u2013 that, at its best, theatre either takes you out of your life or further into it.\u201d The fact that \u201cthere are so many different things going on at the same time\u201d on the stage is endlessly compelling. \u201cEven if you\u2019re squirming with boredom or frustration, you can isolate an element of design, or the one actor who elevates it \u2013 and if it\u2019s simply a travesty, that in itself is interesting.\u201d For her Observer column, Clapp usually reviews three plays per week. This involves a considerable amount of pre-planning \u2013 she keeps a \u201clong, obsessive list\u201d of forthcoming openings around the country. Even when the week ahead has been finalised, she can never be quite sure, until she\u2019s seen them all, which of the three plays will be her lead review. As a result, \u201cthe major part of the writing always gets done at the last minute\u201d. She makes notes in the theatre, \u201cbut they\u2019re often unreadable because I don\u2019t have very good handwriting\u201d, she says. \u201cQuite often, I forget to turn over the page and I find that I\u2019ve written my already indecipherable scrawl on top of something else \u2013 but I hope that the act of writing fixes it in my mind.\u201d She tries to identify her \u201cline\u201d on the play in the same night \u2013 \u201cjust simply, whether I liked it or not. And what is the first thing I would say about this if I were describing it to a friend?\u201d There are a number of small but niggling dilemmas that accompany a theatre critic through her week. The hours are odd \u2013 you\u2019re starting work when others are clocking off \u2013 and the timing of dinner is often fraught. \u201cDo you eat beforehand and risk getting sleepy? On the other hand, if you go hungry, and there\u2019s a play with a lot of eating in it, it\u2019s a nightmare.\u201d It\u2019s odd, too, rubbing shoulders with fellow critics night after night \u2013 \u201cwe share a vocabulary, we share a task, though we\u2019re not exactly colleagues\u201d \u2013 while having to resist discussing the play at hand, lest it sway your opinion. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly the most male profession I\u2019ve ever worked in \u2013 much more male and, of course, white than broadcasting or publishing or literary journalism. It\u2019s changing now, but very slowly.\u201d Home is a flat overlooking a square near King\u2019s Cross, London. Here Clapp does most of her writing in her front room, which is lined with play texts, theatrical biographies and reference books, though she sometimes works in a cafe or library. \u201cI am a big believer in walking as writing (or vice versa),\u201d she says. \u201cIf I get stuck, I charge around the square and often find a sentence slips into place. I work out what I think more easily on the hoof \u2013 going to or from the theatre, or emptying the rubbish \u2013 than when stooped over my desk.\u201d The career moment I\u2019ll never forget \u201cPunchdrunk\u2019s site-specific production of Faust in a warehouse in Wapping \u2013 a meticulously created Edward Hopper world with bubbling test tubes and stinky herbs and extraordinarily fragrant pine forests. When I came out, I felt that my eyes and my body had been dismantled and put back together, and I looked at what I saw in a different way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The federal government has issued new guidance to federal departments and agencies to move as many of its 160,000 employees to working from home as possible, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread. Despite the exhortations to other employers to get their employees to work from home, until Sunday there was no clear policy about who in the federal public service should work from home, causing consternation from the union that covers public servants. \u201cThe prime minister and the APSC must follow their own advice and allow the public sector to work from home, wherever possible. It is just baffling that there is one rule for private business and another for the public sector,\u201d the CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said earlier on Sunday. On Sunday evening the commonwealth public service commissioner, Peter Woolcott, released new advice making it clear that federal public servants should work from home where possible. Woolcott said the updated guidance made it clear that, wherever practicable, public servants should work from home, subject to the decisions of agency heads. He said it was up to departmental and agency heads, but working from home was \u201cthe priority\u201d. Woolcott also stressed that every public servant who can work, should work. \u201cThe government considers the APS to be an essential service which needs to keep working in order to keep Australians safe, and ensure that services are delivered for the Australian people,\u201d he said. \u201cAgency heads have always had the flexibility for employees to work at home subject to operational requirements. But current circumstances mean as soon as practicable agency heads should facilitate their staff working from home where possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are extraordinary times. A time where the Australian Public Service is essential to keep Australians safe, and to deliver services for the Australian people. Our focus is on both employees\u2019 health and wellbeing, and importantly the continued delivery of critical public services.\u201d He said APS staff would be deployed to where needs were greatest and that agency heads would be asked to facilitate movement of staff between agencies urgently to perform critical functions. The CPSU said the Australian Taxation office had been on the verge of moving the majority of its staff to remote working last week, but had put the plan on hold after \u201cmixed messages\u201d from the prime minister, including that \u201canyone with a job is an essential service\u201d. Defence and the ATO are understood to have run large-scale trials of remote working but have been waiting for an APSC-wide directive before implementing them. Tensions had been simmering between the union and the government after departmental heads appeared reluctant to allow working from home without a government policy. One message from the Department of Social Security to all staff last week said: \u201cThere has been no direction from Government for the APS, as an essential service, to move to a broader working from home stance.\u201d However, DSS said short-term home-based working arrangements were in place for people who may be more vulnerable and to assist meeting social distancing requirements. Some departments such as Treasury and Finance already have high levels of people working from home, but other policy departments were still requiring attendance at the office. The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, had also expressed concern about the slow move to remote working. The ACT had 77 Covid-19 cases as of Sunday. Asked about the federal public service on ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said: \u201c If they can work from home, they should work from home. \u201cBut there is a lot of work that needs to be done right now by the federal public service to support the government\u2019s efforts in relation to protecting people\u2019s health.\u201d He declined to elaborate on which public servants would be permitted to work from home. \u201cThis is going to be done through an orderly fashion based on the appropriate advice. I\u2019m not going to provide a directive through Insiders, as much as you would want me to do so,\u201d he said. The new directive reveals the APSC has established an APS Workforce Management Taskforce to manage the mobility of the workforce across agencies. Woolcott said the taskforce was in the early stages of identifying the critical gaps in capacity across the public service. In the short term, the key priority is to increase capacity in areas that are critical to the delivery of government services. The redeployment comes on top of recruitment of an extra 5,000 workers at Centrelink, which the CPSU believes will be filled by 4,500 private sector workers, including labour hire, and just 500 casuals recruited to the public service.",

You\u2019re picking the better of two evils.\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump is concerned that a prolonged lockdown might harm his chances of re-election. He agrees.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem,\u201d the president said last week, announcing that America would be \u201copen for business\u201d by Easter.</p> <p>But senior public health officials including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/23/coronavirus-trump-anthony-fauci/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-national%3Ahomepage%2Fcard-ans&amp;tid=lk_inline_manual_3&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, think this is no time to scale back social distancing.</p> <p>If anything, they say, the economy needs to be shut down even further. Otherwise the virus will continue to escalate, inundating hospitals and causing far more deaths. America leads the world in coronavirus cases. Dr Fauci believes we haven\u2019t yet felt the worst of the pandemic.</p> <p>It may seem logical to weigh the threat to public health against the accumulating losses to the economy, and then at some point decide economic losses outweigh health risks. As Stephen Moore, who is advising the White House, warns: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a policy that says we\u2019re going to save every human life at any cost, no matter how many trillions of dollars you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>But this leaves out one big thing. The \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d of economic losses don\u2019t exist on any balance sheet that can be tallied against human lives. An \u201ceconomy\u201d is nothing but human beings. So it matters whose losses we\u2019re talking about \u2013 whose losses of life, and whose losses of dollars.</p> <p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re going to lose a number of people to the flu,\u201d Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to lose more people by putting the country into a massive recession or depression.\u201d</p> <p>Wrong. Recessions and depressions don\u2019t themselves cause people to sicken or die. Their health is imperiled during such downturns if they don\u2019t have enough money to eat, keep a roof over their heads and get needed medical care.</p> <p>Last week, lawmakers took an important step to prevent such hardships. Because unemployment insurance levels in many states are so low, Democrats insisted on a provision in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">$2.2tn coronavirus bill</a> that would provide jobless Americans an additional $600 a week for four months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-economy-health-lives-trump\">The economy v our lives? It's a false choice \u2013 and a deeply stupid one</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Republicans objected that this would boost incomes for some of the unemployed higher than their pay when they worked, the bill was almost scuttled. The Senate vote on the Republican amendment was a hair-raising 47 to 47. But the provision made it into the law.</p> <p>Apparently, Republicans didn\u2019t appreciate that the pay of the typical working American hasn\u2019t increased in decades, adjusted for inflation. So a temporary boost in pay in order to get people to stay home and thereby help slow the spread of Covid-19 is hardly unseemly.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what <em>is</em> unseemly. The \u201ceconomy\u201d the bankers and billionaires are eager to restart had been growing rapidly. But most of its gains had gone into corporate profits, as shown by the meteoric rise of the stock market.</p> <p>The bankers and billionaires now urging Americans get back to work possess a huge share of that stock market. The richest 1% of the population owns roughly half of the value of all shares of stock. (The richest 10% own more than 80%.)</p> <p>So when they recommend Americans get back to work for the sake of the \u201ceconomy\u201d, they\u2019re really urging that other people risk their lives for the sake of the bankers\u2019 and billionaires\u2019 own stock portfolios.</p> <p>While it\u2019s true that we can\u2019t save every human life at any cost, and at some point may have to end the lockdown of America and accept some additional coronavirus casualties, we need to keep in mind whom we are talking about.</p> <p>The trade-off average Americans might make between getting back to work and exposing themselves to the virus is likely to be quite different from the trade-off bankers and billionaires make, especially if average Americans have enough income support to get through the crisis.</p> <p>Four months of extra unemployment benefits may not be enough. The richest nation in the world surely has enough resources to keep its people safe at home for as long as it takes.</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Capitalism-Many-Not-Few/dp/0345806220\">Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052552049X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\">The Common Good</a>.

      "bodyText": "Dick Kovacevich, former CEO of Wells Fargo bank, thinks most Americans should return to work in April, urging that we \u201cgradually bring those people back and see what happens\u201d. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, whose net worth is $1.1bn, recommends \u201cthose with a lower risk of the diseases return to work\u201d within a \u201cvery few weeks\u201d. Tom Galisano, the founder of Paychex, whose net worth is $2.8bn, believes \u201cthe damages of keeping the economy closed could be worse than losing a few more people. You\u2019re picking the better of two evils.\u201d Donald Trump is concerned that a prolonged lockdown might harm his chances of re-election. He agrees. \u201cWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem,\u201d the president said last week, announcing that America would be \u201copen for business\u201d by Easter. But senior public health officials including Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, think this is no time to scale back social distancing. If anything, they say, the economy needs to be shut down even further. Otherwise the virus will continue to escalate, inundating hospitals and causing far more deaths. America leads the world in coronavirus cases. Dr Fauci believes we haven\u2019t yet felt the worst of the pandemic. It may seem logical to weigh the threat to public health against the accumulating losses to the economy, and then at some point decide economic losses outweigh health risks. As Stephen Moore, who is advising the White House, warns: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a policy that says we\u2019re going to save every human life at any cost, no matter how many trillions of dollars you\u2019re talking about.\u201d But this leaves out one big thing. The \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d of economic losses don\u2019t exist on any balance sheet that can be tallied against human lives. An \u201ceconomy\u201d is nothing but human beings. So it matters whose losses we\u2019re talking about \u2013 whose losses of life, and whose losses of dollars. \u201cLook, you\u2019re going to lose a number of people to the flu,\u201d Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to lose more people by putting the country into a massive recession or depression.\u201d Wrong. Recessions and depressions don\u2019t themselves cause people to sicken or die. Their health is imperiled during such downturns if they don\u2019t have enough money to eat, keep a roof over their heads and get needed medical care. Last week, lawmakers took an important step to prevent such hardships. Because unemployment insurance levels in many states are so low, Democrats insisted on a provision in the $2.2tn coronavirus bill that would provide jobless Americans an additional $600 a week for four months. When Republicans objected that this would boost incomes for some of the unemployed higher than their pay when they worked, the bill was almost scuttled. The Senate vote on the Republican amendment was a hair-raising 47 to 47. But the provision made it into the law. Apparently, Republicans didn\u2019t appreciate that the pay of the typical working American hasn\u2019t increased in decades, adjusted for inflation. So a temporary boost in pay in order to get people to stay home and thereby help slow the spread of Covid-19 is hardly unseemly. Here\u2019s what is unseemly. The \u201ceconomy\u201d the bankers and billionaires are eager to restart had been growing rapidly. But most of its gains had gone into corporate profits, as shown by the meteoric rise of the stock market. The bankers and billionaires now urging Americans get back to work possess a huge share of that stock market. The richest 1% of the population owns roughly half of the value of all shares of stock. (The richest 10% own more than 80%.) So when they recommend Americans get back to work for the sake of the \u201ceconomy\u201d, they\u2019re really urging that other people risk their lives for the sake of the bankers\u2019 and billionaires\u2019 own stock portfolios. While it\u2019s true that we can\u2019t save every human life at any cost, and at some point may have to end the lockdown of America and accept some additional coronavirus casualties, we need to keep in mind whom we are talking about. The trade-off average Americans might make between getting back to work and exposing themselves to the virus is likely to be quite different from the trade-off bankers and billionaires make, especially if average Americans have enough income support to get through the crisis. Four months of extra unemployment benefits may not be enough. The richest nation in the world surely has enough resources to keep its people safe at home for as long as it takes.

      "body": "<p>Gardens have been the anchor and mainstay of my life, the most enduring source of fascination and pleasure. I started young. My father is a besotted plantsman and after my parents divorced in the early 1980s he spent custody weekends taking me and my younger sister to every open garden within 50 miles of the M25. We whiled away wet Saturdays in the hothouses at <a href=\"https://www.kew.org/\" title=\"\">Kew</a>, trying to persuade the butterflies to land on our fingers. I learned my first botanical name at <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/gardens/wisley\" title=\"\">RHS Wisley</a> one winter afternoon, lured by the rich fragrance emitting from a nondescript shrub with tiny clusters of shell-pink flowers \u2013 Daphne odora \u2018Warblington\u2019, a name that has lodged with me ever since.</p> <p>I was an anxious and not very happy child, and I loved the spell of self-forgetfulness that happens in a garden \u2013 the sense of being wholly absorbed, lifted out of time. The places I was most drawn to were shaggy, a little wild around the edges. I agreed with Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s manifesto in <em>The Secret Garden</em>: a garden loses all its magic if it becomes too spick and span. It must feel half-forgotten, sunk in slumber. You have to be able to lose yourself, to forget the outside world; to feel, as Burnett put it, hundreds of miles from anyone, but not lonely at all.</p> <p>One of our favourite places was <a href=\"https://www.parhaminsussex.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Parham</a>, an Elizabethan garden in Sussex, where there were tiny formal pools in the corner of each walled enclosure, carpeted in luminous green duckweed. We went to <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sissinghurst-castle-garden\" title=\"\">Sissinghurst</a> almost every spring, driving through Kentish lanes ripe with apple blossom. We\u2019d start in the tower, where Vita Sackville-West had created the most enviable of studies, before wandering down the nut walk and into the orchard, along curved paths mown into a tangled meadow that spilled to the banks of the moat. The past hung heavy on the air. Sometimes it felt as if whole centuries had slipped away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b657cf0824ce70ee2e72162f6cb2544c25a7e42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b657cf0824ce70ee2e72162f6cb2544c25a7e42/0_437_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"our garden in Cambridge in 2018/19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Learning names meant beds and borders weren\u2019t just a blur\u2019: our garden in Cambridge in 2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivia Laing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father always carried a small black notebook in which he made neat lists of plant names, pouncing on any unusual form or colour. Learning names meant beds and borders were no longer a harlequin blur, and they also served as a potent source of fascination in their own right. I loved old varieties in particular, hoarding away lists of antique roses or apples popular in 16th century orchards. Winter Queening, Catshead, Golden Harvey, Green Custard, Old Pearmain\u2026 a spell of language that opened up a portal in time.</p> <p>As a teenager, my sister was obsessed with the queer artist and filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman\" title=\"\">Derek Jarman</a>. She collected his books, which was how I first got my hands on <em>Modern Nature</em>, his account of building his improbable, exuberant garden in the shingle at Dungeness. I loved how Jarman approached gardening: freely, haphazardly, working with whatever came to hand, incorporating driftwood and stones and plonking in old roses to take their chances with the vicious wind. Unlike most gardeners, he didn\u2019t go in for fences or walls, writing proudly, \u201cMy garden\u2019s boundaries are the horizon.\u201d</p> <p>He was captivated by the deep history of plants, the folklore that entwines itself around herbs and weeds. His garden was explicitly laid out as a pharmacopoeia, a medicine chest drawn from medieval apothecaries, and <em>Modern Nature</em> is riddled with bright snatches from the herbals of Gerard and Culpeper. It\u2019s hard to express the lure that knowledge held for me. Some of his quotings I still have by heart, reciting them automatically every time I see the plant in question. \u201cI, borage, bring courage.\u201d \u201c<em>Rosa mundi</em>, rose of the world.\u201d</p> <p>It took a few false starts, but I did eventually find a way of incorporating plants into my working life, at least for a while. After a brief dalliance with an English degree and a spell living outdoors as an environmental activist, I decided in 1998 to start a degree in herbal medicine. The training took five years. Many of our courses were the same as in a standard medicine degree, but there were witchier modules, too, in materia medica, botany and the art of dispensing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef8ee5b6c03d83f76232dcf164f4d86a7bb55dad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef8ee5b6c03d83f76232dcf164f4d86a7bb55dad/0_0_4200_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018My garden\u2019s boundaries are the horizon\u2019: Derek Jarman\u2019s garden on the beach at Dungeness in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My garden\u2019s boundaries are the horizon\u2019: Derek Jarman\u2019s garden on the beach at Dungeness in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I did my clinical training at an old manor house deep in the Sussex Weald. It was set in a magnificent garden, once immaculate, but now tumbling back into wildness. One of its more unusual components was a poison garden, full of the so-called Schedule III herbs that only a trained practitioner can dispense, among them belladonna, lily of the valley and henbane. The swimming pool had been drained and angelica and globe artichoke towered over the neglected beds. After we\u2019d finished seeing patients in the training clinic, we\u2019d go on herb walks, talking about properties and contraindications in the dusty afternoon sun.</p> <p>I thought I had a reasonable knowledge of plants, but it turned out I didn\u2019t know the first thing. Studying botany is above all an education of the eye, a practice of close observation. I learned how to recognise different families, and then how to identify species, to separate pennyroyal from peppermint, to know a lamium from a nettle. For years I didn\u2019t go on a country walk without a copy of <em>The</em> <em>Wild Flowers of Britain and Northern Europe</em>, known as \u201cFitter, Fitter and Blamey\u201d for its co-authors. The first time I saw fumitory I cried out in joy. I\u2019d been looking at Marjorie Blamey\u2019s meticulous drawing of it, sketching a copy in the hand-drawn materia medica I was assembling. Suddenly there it was, at the edge of a ploughed field, precise and emphatic.</p> <p>But it turned out I liked studying botany more than I liked seeing patients. After a few years practising as a herbalist, I shifted into journalism. My 30s were overwhelmingly urban. I lived in a succession of rented flats in Brighton and New York, and though I still loved plants, gardens receded in my life. It was only when I was with my father that I\u2019d speak in botanical nomenclature, that hard-won tongue so suited to the pedant. Each year we\u2019d go to Northumberland and walk around the Gertrude Jekyll garden at <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lindisfarne-castle\" title=\"\">Lindisfarne Castle</a> or the beautifully named <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/lyveden\" title=\"\">Lyveden New Bield</a>, quibbling over Latin names, a pursuit that would drive my long-suffering sister to fury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da95c625d9a6833c60d67e2849ebe06f068087b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da95c625d9a6833c60d67e2849ebe06f068087b0/0_179_2816_1690/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flutter by: a European Comma on Echinacea purpurea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flutter by: a European Comma on Echinacea purpurea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elaine Stavert/GuardianWitness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until I was nearly 40 that I finally acquired a garden of my own. My main motivation for moving to Cambridge was that I was able to afford to rent a tiny terraced house with a handkerchief of outdoor space, half of which was occupied by a giant holly. A quick inspection revealed that the soil was infested with ground elder. It was distinctly unpromising, but for the first time in years I could use my old trowel, inherited from my grandfather, another gifted gardener.

      "bodyText": "Gardens have been the anchor and mainstay of my life, the most enduring source of fascination and pleasure. I started young. My father is a besotted plantsman and after my parents divorced in the early 1980s he spent custody weekends taking me and my younger sister to every open garden within 50 miles of the M25. We whiled away wet Saturdays in the hothouses at Kew, trying to persuade the butterflies to land on our fingers. I learned my first botanical name at RHS Wisley one winter afternoon, lured by the rich fragrance emitting from a nondescript shrub with tiny clusters of shell-pink flowers \u2013 Daphne odora \u2018Warblington\u2019, a name that has lodged with me ever since. I was an anxious and not very happy child, and I loved the spell of self-forgetfulness that happens in a garden \u2013 the sense of being wholly absorbed, lifted out of time. The places I was most drawn to were shaggy, a little wild around the edges. I agreed with Frances Hodgson Burnett\u2019s manifesto in The Secret Garden: a garden loses all its magic if it becomes too spick and span. It must feel half-forgotten, sunk in slumber. You have to be able to lose yourself, to forget the outside world; to feel, as Burnett put it, hundreds of miles from anyone, but not lonely at all. One of our favourite places was Parham, an Elizabethan garden in Sussex, where there were tiny formal pools in the corner of each walled enclosure, carpeted in luminous green duckweed. We went to Sissinghurst almost every spring, driving through Kentish lanes ripe with apple blossom. We\u2019d start in the tower, where Vita Sackville-West had created the most enviable of studies, before wandering down the nut walk and into the orchard, along curved paths mown into a tangled meadow that spilled to the banks of the moat. The past hung heavy on the air. Sometimes it felt as if whole centuries had slipped away. My father always carried a small black notebook in which he made neat lists of plant names, pouncing on any unusual form or colour. Learning names meant beds and borders were no longer a harlequin blur, and they also served as a potent source of fascination in their own right. I loved old varieties in particular, hoarding away lists of antique roses or apples popular in 16th century orchards. Winter Queening, Catshead, Golden Harvey, Green Custard, Old Pearmain\u2026 a spell of language that opened up a portal in time. As a teenager, my sister was obsessed with the queer artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman. She collected his books, which was how I first got my hands on Modern Nature, his account of building his improbable, exuberant garden in the shingle at Dungeness. I loved how Jarman approached gardening: freely, haphazardly, working with whatever came to hand, incorporating driftwood and stones and plonking in old roses to take their chances with the vicious wind. Unlike most gardeners, he didn\u2019t go in for fences or walls, writing proudly, \u201cMy garden\u2019s boundaries are the horizon.\u201d He was captivated by the deep history of plants, the folklore that entwines itself around herbs and weeds. His garden was explicitly laid out as a pharmacopoeia, a medicine chest drawn from medieval apothecaries, and Modern Nature is riddled with bright snatches from the herbals of Gerard and Culpeper. It\u2019s hard to express the lure that knowledge held for me. Some of his quotings I still have by heart, reciting them automatically every time I see the plant in question. \u201cI, borage, bring courage.\u201d \u201cRosa mundi, rose of the world.\u201d It took a few false starts, but I did eventually find a way of incorporating plants into my working life, at least for a while. After a brief dalliance with an English degree and a spell living outdoors as an environmental activist, I decided in 1998 to start a degree in herbal medicine. The training took five years. Many of our courses were the same as in a standard medicine degree, but there were witchier modules, too, in materia medica, botany and the art of dispensing. I did my clinical training at an old manor house deep in the Sussex Weald. It was set in a magnificent garden, once immaculate, but now tumbling back into wildness. One of its more unusual components was a poison garden, full of the so-called Schedule III herbs that only a trained practitioner can dispense, among them belladonna, lily of the valley and henbane. The swimming pool had been drained and angelica and globe artichoke towered over the neglected beds. After we\u2019d finished seeing patients in the training clinic, we\u2019d go on herb walks, talking about properties and contraindications in the dusty afternoon sun. I thought I had a reasonable knowledge of plants, but it turned out I didn\u2019t know the first thing. Studying botany is above all an education of the eye, a practice of close observation. I learned how to recognise different families, and then how to identify species, to separate pennyroyal from peppermint, to know a lamium from a nettle. For years I didn\u2019t go on a country walk without a copy of The Wild Flowers of Britain and Northern Europe, known as \u201cFitter, Fitter and Blamey\u201d for its co-authors. The first time I saw fumitory I cried out in joy. I\u2019d been looking at Marjorie Blamey\u2019s meticulous drawing of it, sketching a copy in the hand-drawn materia medica I was assembling. Suddenly there it was, at the edge of a ploughed field, precise and emphatic. But it turned out I liked studying botany more than I liked seeing patients. After a few years practising as a herbalist, I shifted into journalism. My 30s were overwhelmingly urban. I lived in a succession of rented flats in Brighton and New York, and though I still loved plants, gardens receded in my life. It was only when I was with my father that I\u2019d speak in botanical nomenclature, that hard-won tongue so suited to the pedant. Each year we\u2019d go to Northumberland and walk around the Gertrude Jekyll garden at Lindisfarne Castle or the beautifully named Lyveden New Bield, quibbling over Latin names, a pursuit that would drive my long-suffering sister to fury. It wasn\u2019t until I was nearly 40 that I finally acquired a garden of my own. My main motivation for moving to Cambridge was that I was able to afford to rent a tiny terraced house with a handkerchief of outdoor space, half of which was occupied by a giant holly. A quick inspection revealed that the soil was infested with ground elder. It was distinctly unpromising, but for the first time in years I could use my old trowel, inherited from my grandfather, another gifted gardener. My father came over and together we dug it clear, and planted peonies, cistus and irises. To my amazement it flourished. Within a year it was an eye-popping jungle. It\u2019s frustrating, gardening in a rented house. When I cleaned the rank old pond, the management company responded by telling me I\u2019d have to fill it in when I left. It still felt worthwhile to leave it more fertile and abundant than when I\u2019d arrived. Tending it was also an antidote to the transient, insecure feeling that too often accompanies renting. Bedded in, rooted: so many of our words to do with being at home are actually drawn from plants. That garden was also how I met my future husband. Ian lived a few streets north. We had friends in common and we quickly identified a shared interest in gardening. He was married to the writer Jenny Diski, and when she was diagnosed with cancer a couple of years later his own beautiful plot became increasingly neglected. When we got together after she had died, it was riddled with couchgrass and full of old shrubs that had long since exceeded their allotted space. It wasn\u2019t working, but like the fictional secret garden, it pulsed with potential. The house was on a terrace built for Victorian railway workers.

So nurses are every day carrying out services to patients or care and treatment to patients and they will be less than one metre away, so they particularly need to know whether the person they are dealing with, whether they themselves, have been infected with Covid-19 so that they can take the appropriate time off but also protect themselves and their families.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Europe is being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-deaths-in-italy-pass-10000-with-889-new-fatalities\">10,000 deaths in Italy</a>. In the grimmest of league tables, Spain comes second. Normal life has been suspended across the continent and the hit to the economy is immense. France\u2019s output is running at two-thirds of what it was last year. Germany has abandoned fiscal rectitude and \u2013 along with the rest \u2013 adopted a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach.</p> <p>Border controls have been erected to stop the flow of people even though this contravenes one of the founding principles of the single market. Rules on state aid to struggling companies have been relaxed. The European Central Bank has embarked on a gigantic asset purchase scheme in an attempt to flood the eurozone economy with cheap money.</p> <p>Jean Monnet, the driving force behind the creation of what was to become the European Union in the 1950s, said that Europe would be <a href=\"https://thewell-travelledpostcard.com/portfolio/europe-will-be-forged-in-crises-how-crisis-has-shaped-eu-integration/\">forged in cris</a><a href=\"https://thewell-travelledpostcard.com/portfolio/europe-will-be-forged-in-crises-how-crisis-has-shaped-eu-integration/\">es</a>, and Covid-19 clearly meets that criterion. The twin health-economic emergency is by far the worst crisis Europe has had to face since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957: worse than the oil shock of the mid-1970s, worse than the banking meltdown of 2008.</p> <p>That, though, was not the end of Monnet\u2019s observation. He went on to say that the sort of Europe that would be forged would depend on the \u201csolutions adopted for those crises\u201d. And, in that respect, the signs have not been good.</p> <p>If ever there was a time for the EU to act as one, for the richer countries to show solidarity with those less fortunate, then this is it. Yet when Italy pleaded for fellow countries to send it medical equipment such as masks, France and Germany not only failed to respond, they placed export bans (since lifted) on the export of the kit Italian hospitals were crying out for. In the end it was left to China to show EU how to respond to a country in dire need.</p> <p>Another problem for Italy is that because of its slow growth and high levels of public debt it has to pay a higher rate of interest on the money the government borrows than is the case for Germany and, when the hospitals in the cities of Lombardy started to fill up with Covid-19 cases, this gap \u2013 or spread \u2013 started to widen. It was therefore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\">deeply unhelpful for Christine Lagarde</a>, the president of the ECB, to say that it was not the job of her institution to \u201cclose bond spreads\u201d.</p> <p>Lagarde, to her credit, quickly recanted and the ECB is now doing its utmost to help Italy and the wider eurozone economy. But the crisis has highlighted the weaknesses of the eurozone: the lack of coordination between monetary policy run by the ECB from Frankfurt and fiscal policy under the control of member states; the lack of a sizeable, single budget; the absence of financial tools that would make a collective approach easier.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/eu-leaders-clash-over-economic-response-to-coronavirus-crisis\">virtual meeting of EU leaders</a> was supposed to come up with a joint approach to the crisis but was instead a complete car crash. One group of countries \u2013 including Italy, Spain and France \u2013 wanted the creation of corona bonds, which would be issued collectively by all eurozone countries.</p> <p>The thinking behind a corona bond is simple. By pooling risk, hard-pressed countries such as Italy and Spain would benefit from the reputation for financial probity of countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Of the money raised, the lion\u2019s share would go to the countries at greatest need and at lower rates of interest than they would have to pay if they were issuing their own national bonds.</p> <p>Yet even in these quite exceptional circumstances, corona bonds proved to be a non-starter.

      "bodyText": "Europe is being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been more than 10,000 deaths in Italy. In the grimmest of league tables, Spain comes second. Normal life has been suspended across the continent and the hit to the economy is immense. France\u2019s output is running at two-thirds of what it was last year. Germany has abandoned fiscal rectitude and \u2013 along with the rest \u2013 adopted a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach. Border controls have been erected to stop the flow of people even though this contravenes one of the founding principles of the single market. Rules on state aid to struggling companies have been relaxed. The European Central Bank has embarked on a gigantic asset purchase scheme in an attempt to flood the eurozone economy with cheap money. Jean Monnet, the driving force behind the creation of what was to become the European Union in the 1950s, said that Europe would be forged in crises, and Covid-19 clearly meets that criterion. The twin health-economic emergency is by far the worst crisis Europe has had to face since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957: worse than the oil shock of the mid-1970s, worse than the banking meltdown of 2008. That, though, was not the end of Monnet\u2019s observation. He went on to say that the sort of Europe that would be forged would depend on the \u201csolutions adopted for those crises\u201d. And, in that respect, the signs have not been good. If ever there was a time for the EU to act as one, for the richer countries to show solidarity with those less fortunate, then this is it. Yet when Italy pleaded for fellow countries to send it medical equipment such as masks, France and Germany not only failed to respond, they placed export bans (since lifted) on the export of the kit Italian hospitals were crying out for. In the end it was left to China to show EU how to respond to a country in dire need. Another problem for Italy is that because of its slow growth and high levels of public debt it has to pay a higher rate of interest on the money the government borrows than is the case for Germany and, when the hospitals in the cities of Lombardy started to fill up with Covid-19 cases, this gap \u2013 or spread \u2013 started to widen. It was therefore deeply unhelpful for Christine Lagarde, the president of the ECB, to say that it was not the job of her institution to \u201cclose bond spreads\u201d. Lagarde, to her credit, quickly recanted and the ECB is now doing its utmost to help Italy and the wider eurozone economy. But the crisis has highlighted the weaknesses of the eurozone: the lack of coordination between monetary policy run by the ECB from Frankfurt and fiscal policy under the control of member states; the lack of a sizeable, single budget; the absence of financial tools that would make a collective approach easier. Last week\u2019s virtual meeting of EU leaders was supposed to come up with a joint approach to the crisis but was instead a complete car crash. One group of countries \u2013 including Italy, Spain and France \u2013 wanted the creation of corona bonds, which would be issued collectively by all eurozone countries. The thinking behind a corona bond is simple. By pooling risk, hard-pressed countries such as Italy and Spain would benefit from the reputation for financial probity of countries like Germany and the Netherlands. Of the money raised, the lion\u2019s share would go to the countries at greatest need and at lower rates of interest than they would have to pay if they were issuing their own national bonds. Yet even in these quite exceptional circumstances, corona bonds proved to be a non-starter. Germany thought Italy should ask for assistance through the European Stability Mechanism, where the money comes with strings attached. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, said under no circumstances would he agree to common bonds. For Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other northern European eurozone members, it is a question of moral hazard: the countries that are running big budget deficits will never change their ways if they think they can always borrow on the cheap. The Italians and the Spanish also dug their heels in, preferring for the meeting to end with no agreement rather than accept the stigma of conditionality. So, in time-honoured fashion, the can was kicked down the road, with eurozone finance ministers given a couple of weeks to come up with something. One possible solution would be to get round the moral hazard problem by making the corona bonds a one-off solution to a quite exceptional crisis. If, as is possible, the emergency is relatively short-lived, the Germans and the Dutch ought to be able to support the idea of corona bonds are for 2020 only. There is little doubt which side Monnet would be backing. This is not just about providing a lifeline to Italy, important though that is. Nor is it simply about avoiding the meltdown of already shaky Italian banks, which would have ripple effects across the eurozone. It is about political legitimacy and whether the EU goes forward or backwards.

      "body": "<p>I saw a coronavirus banner the other day that said \u201cCheck in on your five nearest neighbours\u201d, and I thought about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/04/errol-graham-welfare-uk-benefit-cuts-disability-deaths\">Errol Graham</a>.</p> <p>Back in January, just as China\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak was turning critical, the story broke of how Graham, a grandfather of two and lover of football, had died aged 57. In June 2018, bailiffs pursuing him for nonpayment of his rent had found Graham\u2019s body, which weighed just four and a half stone. A coroner\u2019s report said he suffered from severe social anxiety, and had isolated himself from even family and friends. His flat in Nottingham had no gas or electricity, and there was no food in his fridge apart from two cans of fish that were four years out of date.</p> <p>Eight months before Graham\u2019s body was discovered, his benefits had been stopped after he didn\u2019t attend a fitness for work assessment. Among the items found in his home was a letter addressed to what news reports called \u201cwelfare officials\u201d, pleading with them to \u201cjudge me fairly\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We all know the basics: a population divided into \u2018skivers' and \u2018strivers', and the endless cruelties of \u2018sanctions'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Graham\u2019s case received a lot of attention, not least in the Guardian. But for all the awfulness of his story, it never really caught the popular imagination: at the time it was covered, the media was still aflame with controversy about the opinionated actor Laurence Fox and the fate of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Graham was one particularly tragic example of something that 21st-century Britain has long been in danger of accepting as a given: a nasty, punitive benefits system seemingly run according to the inhuman rhetoric we have regularly heard from politicians \u2013 and still might be hearing, had Covid-19 not arrived.</p> <p>For about a decade now, the cruelties of that system and their consequences have existed in plain sight. We all know the basics: a population divided into \u201cskivers\u201d and \u201cstrivers\u201d, people either ill or disabled summarily judged fit for work, joblessness usually assumed to be the fault of the jobless person, and the endless cruelties of the \u201csanctions\u201d that mean many people have had their benefits arbitrarily suspended, leaving them barely able to survive. In February it was revealed that the National Audit Office had linked at least 69 suicides to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/07/dwp-benefit-related-suicide-numbers-not-true-figure-says-watchdog-nao\">workings of the benefits system</a>, and this number was probably an underestimate.</p> <p>Six weeks later, the fact that people in charge are suddenly speaking a language of solidarity and accepting that unemployment is a consequence of economics rather than character failure is something to behold. Whatever its caveats, Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-chancellor-rishi-sunak-provides-an-updated-statement-on-coronavirus\">plan for people\u2019s jobs and incomes</a>\u201d is welcome; so is hearing him talk about people \u201cnot being able to pay the rent or the mortgage\u201d and \u201cnot having enough set by for food and bills\u201d. There is a truly astral irony in Sunak\u2019s efforts being <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hzeffman/status/1242954230899585026\">saluted</a> by that well-known Tory sympathiser Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless, just about every part of the benefits machine that has ruined so many lives is, inevitably, still in place. We will sooner or later find out if it can survive this huge undermining of its basic logic \u2013 and either grind on or at last be changed.</p> <p>As my colleague Polly Toynbee <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/britain-benefits-rishi-sunak-claimants-austerity\">pointed out</a> last week, there will be a very large gap between the communitarian words of politicians and the reality that people new to benefits will discover when they begin trying to access universal credit. This is already becoming clear in the stories of day-long waits on helplines and the mounting sense of a new segment of the population finding that supposed \u201cwelfare\u201d falls far short of what is required to avoid debt, bad housing, ill health and all the rest. Yes, the government has loosened some aspects of universal credit, working tax credits and payments for housing. The Department for Work and Pensions has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-update-benefit-reviews-and-reassessments-suspended\">announced</a> that people receiving benefits will not have to attend the usually compulsory jobcentre appointments for at least three months \u2013 a move that, in theory at least, suspends the sanctions regime. But even these things could sooner or later revert to normal, with consequences that this crisis and its aftershocks will inevitably make worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/universal-basic-income-help-self-employed\">Universal basic income is the best way to help the self-employed | Owen Jones</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When politics returns to normal, nobody on the left should kid themselves that resisting such backward steps will be easy. After all, we are talking not just about policies and systems, but also beliefs that are deeply entrenched in large chunks of the population, and which even this international tragedy might not shift. Notwithstanding a softening of people\u2019s views about the welfare state and support for increasing the minimum wage, recent research from the British social attitudes survey <a href=\"https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk/media/39284/bsa35_full-report.pdf\">suggested</a> that when it came to benefits and the needs they cover, we remained a fairly crabby, judgmental country. In 2018, 43% of us accepted the idea that the \u201cgenerosity of welfare benefits creates dependence\u201d. Only 20% of us agreed that unemployed people should receive higher benefits. The kicker, perhaps, was the fact that 56% of respondents agreed that \u201cmost unemployed people could find a job if they really wanted one\u201d, compared with just 17% who disagreed.</p> <p>Outside of major cities, I have heard these things so many times that they have often seemed as unremarkable as the weather. In many cases, they are a dysfunctional sign of the resentments and frustrations sown by insecurity and want. They have been repeatedly stoked by politicians \u2013 most obviously by Conservatives, though rifling through the news archives throws up such memorable headlines as \u201cGordon Brown to crack down on benefit cheats in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d (from 2008). </p> <p>But to some extent, people in Westminster were merely seizing on malign views already present in the<strong> </strong>culture.

      "bodyText": "I saw a coronavirus banner the other day that said \u201cCheck in on your five nearest neighbours\u201d, and I thought about Errol Graham. Back in January, just as China\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak was turning critical, the story broke of how Graham, a grandfather of two and lover of football, had died aged 57. In June 2018, bailiffs pursuing him for nonpayment of his rent had found Graham\u2019s body, which weighed just four and a half stone. A coroner\u2019s report said he suffered from severe social anxiety, and had isolated himself from even family and friends. His flat in Nottingham had no gas or electricity, and there was no food in his fridge apart from two cans of fish that were four years out of date. Eight months before Graham\u2019s body was discovered, his benefits had been stopped after he didn\u2019t attend a fitness for work assessment. Among the items found in his home was a letter addressed to what news reports called \u201cwelfare officials\u201d, pleading with them to \u201cjudge me fairly\u201d. Graham\u2019s case received a lot of attention, not least in the Guardian. But for all the awfulness of his story, it never really caught the popular imagination: at the time it was covered, the media was still aflame with controversy about the opinionated actor Laurence Fox and the fate of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Graham was one particularly tragic example of something that 21st-century Britain has long been in danger of accepting as a given: a nasty, punitive benefits system seemingly run according to the inhuman rhetoric we have regularly heard from politicians \u2013 and still might be hearing, had Covid-19 not arrived. For about a decade now, the cruelties of that system and their consequences have existed in plain sight. We all know the basics: a population divided into \u201cskivers\u201d and \u201cstrivers\u201d, people either ill or disabled summarily judged fit for work, joblessness usually assumed to be the fault of the jobless person, and the endless cruelties of the \u201csanctions\u201d that mean many people have had their benefits arbitrarily suspended, leaving them barely able to survive. In February it was revealed that the National Audit Office had linked at least 69 suicides to the workings of the benefits system, and this number was probably an underestimate. Six weeks later, the fact that people in charge are suddenly speaking a language of solidarity and accepting that unemployment is a consequence of economics rather than character failure is something to behold. Whatever its caveats, Rishi Sunak\u2019s \u201cplan for people\u2019s jobs and incomes\u201d is welcome; so is hearing him talk about people \u201cnot being able to pay the rent or the mortgage\u201d and \u201cnot having enough set by for food and bills\u201d. There is a truly astral irony in Sunak\u2019s efforts being saluted by that well-known Tory sympathiser Bernie Sanders. Nonetheless, just about every part of the benefits machine that has ruined so many lives is, inevitably, still in place. We will sooner or later find out if it can survive this huge undermining of its basic logic \u2013 and either grind on or at last be changed. As my colleague Polly Toynbee pointed out last week, there will be a very large gap between the communitarian words of politicians and the reality that people new to benefits will discover when they begin trying to access universal credit. This is already becoming clear in the stories of day-long waits on helplines and the mounting sense of a new segment of the population finding that supposed \u201cwelfare\u201d falls far short of what is required to avoid debt, bad housing, ill health and all the rest. Yes, the government has loosened some aspects of universal credit, working tax credits and payments for housing. The Department for Work and Pensions has announced that people receiving benefits will not have to attend the usually compulsory jobcentre appointments for at least three months \u2013 a move that, in theory at least, suspends the sanctions regime. But even these things could sooner or later revert to normal, with consequences that this crisis and its aftershocks will inevitably make worse. When politics returns to normal, nobody on the left should kid themselves that resisting such backward steps will be easy. After all, we are talking not just about policies and systems, but also beliefs that are deeply entrenched in large chunks of the population, and which even this international tragedy might not shift. Notwithstanding a softening of people\u2019s views about the welfare state and support for increasing the minimum wage, recent research from the British social attitudes survey suggested that when it came to benefits and the needs they cover, we remained a fairly crabby, judgmental country. In 2018, 43% of us accepted the idea that the \u201cgenerosity of welfare benefits creates dependence\u201d. Only 20% of us agreed that unemployed people should receive higher benefits. The kicker, perhaps, was the fact that 56% of respondents agreed that \u201cmost unemployed people could find a job if they really wanted one\u201d, compared with just 17% who disagreed. Outside of major cities, I have heard these things so many times that they have often seemed as unremarkable as the weather. In many cases, they are a dysfunctional sign of the resentments and frustrations sown by insecurity and want. They have been repeatedly stoked by politicians \u2013 most obviously by Conservatives, though rifling through the news archives throws up such memorable headlines as \u201cGordon Brown to crack down on benefit cheats in Queen\u2019s speech\u201d (from 2008). But to some extent, people in Westminster were merely seizing on malign views already present in the culture. The most pitiful thing to see was the acceptance of these opinions by people whose experiences showed how misplaced they were. I remember going to the Cheshire town of Warrington eight years ago and, watched by press officers from the Department of Work and Pensions, interviewing a 27-year-old man who had just endured nine months of unemployment. He said he had been averaging 25 to 30 job applications a week, most of which had not even got a reply. \u201cI think I should have applied for more,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have tried more. When you\u2019re feeling down, you start blaming the world for your mistakes \u2026 You feel the world owes you. And it doesn\u2019t.\u201d If millions of people are suddenly staring into the most uncertain future imaginable, and 500,000 people are suddenly applying for universal credit, will those ideas survive? Put another way, what will happen to the beliefs and prejudices that have defined so much of the last 10 to 15 years, encouraged by politicians chasing votes: mutual suspicion, a manic belief in \u201cpersonal responsibility\u201d, and the very British tendency to focus your furies on the people down the street? In his capacity as a newspaper editor, the former chancellor George Osborne last week commissioned a special back page of London\u2019s Evening Standard emblazoned with the slogan \u201cLondon stands together\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser.</p> <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.</p> <p>The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election.</p> <p>Boyd said the government was aware of <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/644968/UK_National_Risk_Register_2017.pdf\">many risks</a> with low likelihoods but potentially very high impacts on the nation, such as pandemics, severe storms and power blackouts. But he said these were assessed independently from one another, underplaying the total risk, which itself was rising due to climate change, population growth and the globalisation of travel.</p> <p>Looked at alone, a pandemic had appeared unlikely, he said. \u201cAs a result, getting sufficient resource just to write a decent biosecurity strategy was tough. Getting resource to properly underpin implementation of what it said was impossible.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd added: \u201cThe middle of a crisis may not be the best time to suggest why we should learn lessons \u2026 But many people are more likely to listen now. Certainly, nothing should distract us from getting ahead of Covid-19. My concern is that we should come out of this much wiser.\u201d</p> <p>The NHS is reported to have failed a government test of its ability to handle a pandemic, though the finding were not made public. Exercise Cygnus, a three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016, examined how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronavirus.</p> <p>According to the Sunday Telegraph, ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment.</p> <p>Boyd said politicians found it tough to deliver large-scale preventive policies to a public unconcerned about major risks. \u201c[They] often talk the talk but find it hard to walk the walk of the changes needed. As they are currently structured, governments are hopelessly underpowered to implement the about-turn needed on policy.\u201d</p> <p>The 2018 biological security strategy, the UK\u2019s first, stated: \u201cThe UK is globally renowned for the quality of our preparedness planning [for] significant biological risks.\u201d It noted that the UK spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year on the issue.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, these efforts have not always been as well coordinated as they could have been and we have sometimes failed to approach these issues with an international as well as a domestic perspective,\u201d it said. As a result, \u201cwe may also fail to maximise the impact of our activities or to tackle issues as quickly as we need to\u201d.</p> <p>The strategy said the UK maintained \u201cappropriate stockpiles of clinical countermeasures for diseases of concern\u201d, made it a priority \u201cto protect first responders through ensuring that they are equipped and trained properly\u201d and had \u201ca strong public communications capability to ensure we are able to engage swiftly and clearly with the public about any action they might need to take\u201d.</p> <p>As well as committing to improving government coordination and data sharing, and the communication of risk to the public, the strategy said: \u201cWe will develop a UK government response plan for major international diseases to ensure that the government is fully prepared to respond as quickly.\u201d</p> <p>The UK was ranked second in the world in 2019 by the <a href=\"https://www.ghsindex.org/\">Global Health Security (GHS) Index</a>, with the US first. The independent GHS Index assessed the capability to prevent and mitigate pandemics in 195 countries.</p> <p>In July 2019 the House of Commons joint committee on the national security strategy <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/inquiries/parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health-inquiry-17-19/\">launched an inquiry</a> into preparing for emerging infectious diseases. However, its <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news-parliament-2017/biosecurity-human-health1-evidence-19-20/\">first evidence session in October</a> was postponed due to debates on Brexit and the calling of a general election. The December election meant the inquiry was cancelled.</p> <p>Catherine Rhodes, the head of the centre for the study of existential risk at Cambridge University, had been scheduled to give evidence to the MPs\u2019 inquiry. She said the UK had had fairly good pandemic planning in place.</p> <p>\u201cThere does, however, seem to have been a significant gap between recognition of the risk and planning, and action on preparedness,\u201d she said. \u201cIn particular, there could have been much better public communication in advance of the outbreak about the sort of measures that might be necessary in such a situation, and surge capacity in the NHS could have been substantially improved.\u201d</p> <p>Opi Outhwaite, at St Mary\u2019s law school in London, who was also scheduled to give evidence to the inquiry, said: \u2018I think broadly that any government would likely have been overwhelmed by this outbreak.\u201d</p> <p>But she said: \u201cThe risk of an outbreak of this type has been known for some time, while the biological security strategy seemed to have stalled. The response aspect of the strategy focuses a lot on deployment of expertise to other parts of the world. To me this emphasises the idea that we needed to be preparing to respond to outbreaks overseas, with less emphasis on what we would do once an outbreak crossed into the UK.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that we had to experience a pandemic here first-hand to shift the thinking. It\u2019s very noticeable now hypothetical everything [in the strategy] appears.\u201d</p> <p>A government spokesman said:<strong> </strong>\u201cThe UK has well-established and world-leading capabilities for dealing with disease outbreaks and pandemics. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-the-evidence-base-underpinning-the-uk-influenza-pandemic-preparedness-strategy\">UK influenza pandemic preparedness strategy</a><em> </em>reflects experience and lessons learned from previous pandemics and was used in developing the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-action-plan\">coronavirus action plan</a>, guided by clinical and scientific advice.\u201d</p> <p>Boyd said: \u201cIf there is a legacy of Covid-19, it might be that it is enough of a warning shot to enough people that it creates the political headroom for serious action.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser. Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, said a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled. The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election. Boyd said the government was aware of many risks with low likelihoods but potentially very high impacts on the nation, such as pandemics, severe storms and power blackouts. But he said these were assessed independently from one another, underplaying the total risk, which itself was rising due to climate change, population growth and the globalisation of travel. Looked at alone, a pandemic had appeared unlikely, he said. \u201cAs a result, getting sufficient resource just to write a decent biosecurity strategy was tough. Getting resource to properly underpin implementation of what it said was impossible.\u201d Boyd added: \u201cThe middle of a crisis may not be the best time to suggest why we should learn lessons \u2026 But many people are more likely to listen now. Certainly, nothing should distract us from getting ahead of Covid-19. My concern is that we should come out of this much wiser.\u201d The NHS is reported to have failed a government test of its ability to handle a pandemic, though the finding were not made public. Exercise Cygnus, a three-day dry run for a pandemic carried out in October 2016, examined how hospitals and other services would cope in a flu outbreak with a similar mortality rate to coronavirus. According to the Sunday Telegraph, ministers were told three years ago that Britain would be overwhelmed, suffering a lack of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment. Boyd said politicians found it tough to deliver large-scale preventive policies to a public unconcerned about major risks. \u201c[They] often talk the talk but find it hard to walk the walk of the changes needed. As they are currently structured, governments are hopelessly underpowered to implement the about-turn needed on policy.\u201d The 2018 biological security strategy, the UK\u2019s first, stated: \u201cThe UK is globally renowned for the quality of our preparedness planning [for] significant biological risks.\u201d It noted that the UK spends hundreds of millions of pounds a year on the issue. \u201cHowever, these efforts have not always been as well coordinated as they could have been and we have sometimes failed to approach these issues with an international as well as a domestic perspective,\u201d it said. As a result, \u201cwe may also fail to maximise the impact of our activities or to tackle issues as quickly as we need to\u201d. The strategy said the UK maintained \u201cappropriate stockpiles of clinical countermeasures for diseases of concern\u201d, made it a priority \u201cto protect first responders through ensuring that they are equipped and trained properly\u201d and had \u201ca strong public communications capability to ensure we are able to engage swiftly and clearly with the public about any action they might need to take\u201d. As well as committing to improving government coordination and data sharing, and the communication of risk to the public, the strategy said: \u201cWe will develop a UK government response plan for major international diseases to ensure that the government is fully prepared to respond as quickly.\u201d The UK was ranked second in the world in 2019 by the Global Health Security (GHS) Index, with the US first. The independent GHS Index assessed the capability to prevent and mitigate pandemics in 195 countries. In July 2019 the House of Commons joint committee on the national security strategy launched an inquiry into preparing for emerging infectious diseases. However, its first evidence session in October was postponed due to debates on Brexit and the calling of a general election. The December election meant the inquiry was cancelled. Catherine Rhodes, the head of the centre for the study of existential risk at Cambridge University, had been scheduled to give evidence to the MPs\u2019 inquiry. She said the UK had had fairly good pandemic planning in place. \u201cThere does, however, seem to have been a significant gap between recognition of the risk and planning, and action on preparedness,\u201d she said. \u201cIn particular, there could have been much better public communication in advance of the outbreak about the sort of measures that might be necessary in such a situation, and surge capacity in the NHS could have been substantially improved.\u201d Opi Outhwaite, at St Mary\u2019s law school in London, who was also scheduled to give evidence to the inquiry, said: \u2018I think broadly that any government would likely have been overwhelmed by this outbreak.\u201d But she said: \u201cThe risk of an outbreak of this type has been known for some time, while the biological security strategy seemed to have stalled. The response aspect of the strategy focuses a lot on deployment of expertise to other parts of the world. To me this emphasises the idea that we needed to be preparing to respond to outbreaks overseas, with less emphasis on what we would do once an outbreak crossed into the UK. \u201cI suspect that we had to experience a pandemic here first-hand to shift the thinking. It\u2019s very noticeable now hypothetical everything [in the strategy] appears.\u201d A government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has well-established and world-leading capabilities for dealing with disease outbreaks and pandemics. The UK influenza pandemic preparedness strategy reflects experience and lessons learned from previous pandemics and was used in developing the coronavirus action plan, guided by clinical and scientific advice.\u201d Boyd said: \u201cIf there is a legacy of Covid-19, it might be that it is enough of a warning shot to enough people that it creates the political headroom for serious action.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Jair Bolsonaro has reportedly told his health minister he will sack him if he dares criticise his handling of the coronavirus crisis. According to a report in the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, the Brazilian president\u2019s warning came during a top-level meeting on Saturday as the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country rose to more than 3,900 and the death toll hit 114. The health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, reportedly informed Brazil\u2019s far-right leader he would have no choice but to publicly criticise him if he insisted on going out in public despite warnings to stay indoors. \u201cBolsonaro replied that, if he did so, he would fire him,\u201d the conservative newspaper reported, citing anonymous sources. Bolsonaro\u2019s downplaying of coronavirus \u2013 and his public call for Brazil to relax quarantine measures and get back to work \u2013 have appalled critics and many citizens, sparking nightly pot-banging protests in major cities. On Friday, the president shrugged his shoulders at the likely deaths, telling an interviewer: \u201cSome will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo said that at Saturday\u2019s summit \u2013 which was also attended by Brazil\u2019s justice and defence ministers \u2013 Mandetta tried to convince Bolsonaro of the gravity of the situation. He reportedly said: \u201cAre we ready for the worst-case scenario, with army trucks transporting bodies through the streets?

Bolsonaro\u2019s efforts to undermine regional governments\u2019 efforts to enforce such shutdowns have sparked a political rebellion by the governors of nearly all of Brazil\u2019s 27 states. Speaking to the Guardian last week, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, the leftwing governor of Maranh\u00e3o, criticised Bolsonaro\u2019s denial of the dangers of coronavirus and his \u201ccatastrophic\u201d dawdling. \u201cIf you\u2019re on a battlefield and don\u2019t know which weapon to use, which direction to shoot, and when to open fire, you expose the whole army to serious harm,\u201d Dino said.",

      "body": "<p>The world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-has-26k-living-per-1sqkm-says-bmc-report/story-83y9dyIsVpnQxjQAH9Y1nO.html\">second-most crowded city</a> is trying to stay home, but it wasn\u2019t built for social distancing. Ever since it became an entrep\u00f4t of the British empire, Mumbai has been optimised to keep things moving \u2013 both labour and capital. Over the last fortnight, its citizens have been retreating from public premises. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/28/slum-loaded-term-homegrown-neighbourhoods-mumbai-dharavi\">majority</a> are now confined to one- or two-room tenement housing, often with dividing walls made of tin and tarpaulin. These stand cheek-by-jowl with shops, restaurants and crowded medical clinics. Isolation is for people who live in homes with attached toilets.</p> <p>The numbers aren\u2019t yet staggering. Unlike New York City, which currently accounts for nearly 10% of the world\u2019s known Covid-19 cases, <a href=\"https://howindialives.com/gram/coronadistricts/\">Mumbai counts 74</a> as of this writing. Unlike London, authorities here initiated shutdowns before India\u2019s government passed orders for a national lockdown.</p> <p>The novel coronavirus was first detected here, as elsewhere, among wealthy international travellers, but last week it made its <a href=\"https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/wily-virus-moves-into-slum-chawls/articleshow/74819907.cms\">first appearance</a> in Mumbai\u2019s informal settlements, where unchecked spread would be devastating. Under these circumstances, the extreme measure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/indias-13bn-population-locked-down-to-beat-coronavirus\">quarantining 1.3 billion people</a> may have looked like a sensible decision to stave off tragedy. Yet on the first morning after lockdown, it was immediately clear that another tragedy was already under way.</p> <p>Television news programmes showed long lines of migrant labourers leaving big cities, starting the long walk, on empty stomachs and in blistering heat, to their homes in rural India. With industry and construction at a standstill, daily wagers found themselves out of jobs, instantly unable to afford food or shelter. Without buses and trains, they were out of transport. From Mumbai, 300 workers were found <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-lockdown-300-rajasthan-workers-found-travelling-in-truck-containers-from-telangana-2201303\">stowing away</a> in stifling container trucks. From Delhi, weary migrants trickling back into the neighbouring province of Uttar Pradesh on foot <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/coronavirus-india-lockdown-supply-chain-problem-6331743/\">recalled scenes of famine</a> in British India.</p> <p>How have we been plunged, unprepared, into wartime? Independent India\u2019s welfare state evolved precisely in response to its depredations under empire: its core job has always been to feed the hungry. We have a powerful central government led by the country\u2019s most popular politician, Narendra Modi. Since February, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1227536939479228417\">opposition politicians</a> have been warning of the approaching risks. The southern state of Kerala, the first to start widespread testing and quarantine measures, has prevented uncontrolled outbreak within its borders for several weeks.</p> <p>So, at least in principle, this country should not have gone from bracing for an epidemic to expecting twin catastrophes of contagion and starvation. But we have. As every country in the world faces up to the mistakes it has made in confronting this disease, it\u2019s hard not to feel that India is emblematic of how unprepared the world was for Covid-19. What else was going to happen in a country that has more billionaires than anywhere save China and the US, but still has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis_in_India\">world\u2019s highest incidence of tuberculosis</a>? </p> <p>Indian epidemiologists already <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/956932/interview-suppression-wont-work-in-india-slow-down-the-coronavirus-this-will-be-a-long-haul\">knew</a> that total lockdown wouldn\u2019t work in India the way it does in Europe: the infrastructure to ensure basic necessities at every doorstep doesn\u2019t exist, which is why many essential services, from grocery delivery to agricultural work, are exempt from curfews.</p> <p>The infectious diseases expert <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/coronavirus-outbreak-its-a-long-road-to-normal-says-leading-epidemiologist-j-muliyil\">Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil</a> advised us to devise various forms of community participation in controlling the disease instead: discouraging large gatherings and preparing to practice social distancing for months at a time. India\u2019s only option was to \u201cmitigate\u201d, he told the digital publication Scroll \u2013 not \u201cmilitate\u201d.</p> <p>This was oblique, but prescient. Indians are now spectators as police are filmed committing brutality on the streets, beating, humiliating, even <a href=\"https://scroll.in/latest/957298/covid-19-lockdown-man-out-to-buy-milk-in-west-bengal-beaten-up-by-police-dies-claims-family\">allegedly murdering people</a> who step out to hunt for essentials. There is a resonant continuity with scenes from India\u2019s winter of political dissent, during which Modi\u2019s government excused or enabled nauseating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality\">police violenc</a>e to suppress street protests.</p> <p>This footage is available, for now, because the government has designated media work an \u201cessential service\u201d that must function through the emergency. Meanwhile, misinformation and <a href=\"https://news.abplive.com/videos/news/india-up-cm-yogi-adityanath-welcomes-package-under-pm-garib-kalyan-yojana-1183059\">propaganda</a> bolt through televisions and WhatsApp, spreading superstition, medical hoaxes and racist rumours about minorities, none of which Modi has addressed, in spite of three long prime-time discourses on Covid-19 delivered to the nation.</p> <p>Last week, even before the grievous spectacle of internal displacement began, Modi told Indians that we face a challenge greater than that of the world wars. It was a significant claim to make to a country that sent millions of soldiers to those battlefields, and suffered the effects deeply. But it also suggested that the prime minister knows the situation is far worse than his government is letting on: the epidemiologist Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan pointed out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrrsXCxs2xg&amp;feature=youtu.be\">in an interview</a> that if Modi believed India\u2019s modest official numbers and projections, he would not have used such a grave analogy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\">Coronavirus means we really are, finally, all in this together  | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What lies in store for India? Dr Laxminarayan, the director of the <a href=\"https://cddep.org/\">Centre For Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html\">warns that without mitigation</a>, at least a million Indians could be critically ill in a matter of weeks: four or five times fewer than in a scenario without lockdown, but still overwhelming for a country with inadequate public healthcare. \u201cTest, test, test,\u201d says the World Health Organization. But our nation of 1.3 billion is still only testing 18 people per million: some say <a href=\"https://scroll.in/pulse/957380/testing-is-key-to-fighting-coronavirus-so-why-does-india-have-such-a-low-testing-rate\">because of red tape</a>, others that India is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SreenivasanJain/status/1239806166995046406\">hiding the extent of the problem</a>.</p> <p>In Mumbai, where people otherwise take a certain big-city pride in toughing it out through crises, the Covid-19 lockdown has taken away our most visible source of support: each other. Many can afford to Instagram quarantine cooking and lie around reading <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decameron\">The Decameron</a>, like our peers in the global elite.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s second-most crowded city is trying to stay home, but it wasn\u2019t built for social distancing. Ever since it became an entrep\u00f4t of the British empire, Mumbai has been optimised to keep things moving \u2013 both labour and capital. Over the last fortnight, its citizens have been retreating from public premises. A majority are now confined to one- or two-room tenement housing, often with dividing walls made of tin and tarpaulin. These stand cheek-by-jowl with shops, restaurants and crowded medical clinics. Isolation is for people who live in homes with attached toilets. The numbers aren\u2019t yet staggering. Unlike New York City, which currently accounts for nearly 10% of the world\u2019s known Covid-19 cases, Mumbai counts 74 as of this writing. Unlike London, authorities here initiated shutdowns before India\u2019s government passed orders for a national lockdown. The novel coronavirus was first detected here, as elsewhere, among wealthy international travellers, but last week it made its first appearance in Mumbai\u2019s informal settlements, where unchecked spread would be devastating. Under these circumstances, the extreme measure of quarantining 1.3 billion people may have looked like a sensible decision to stave off tragedy. Yet on the first morning after lockdown, it was immediately clear that another tragedy was already under way. Television news programmes showed long lines of migrant labourers leaving big cities, starting the long walk, on empty stomachs and in blistering heat, to their homes in rural India. With industry and construction at a standstill, daily wagers found themselves out of jobs, instantly unable to afford food or shelter. Without buses and trains, they were out of transport. From Mumbai, 300 workers were found stowing away in stifling container trucks. From Delhi, weary migrants trickling back into the neighbouring province of Uttar Pradesh on foot recalled scenes of famine in British India. How have we been plunged, unprepared, into wartime? Independent India\u2019s welfare state evolved precisely in response to its depredations under empire: its core job has always been to feed the hungry. We have a powerful central government led by the country\u2019s most popular politician, Narendra Modi. Since February, opposition politicians have been warning of the approaching risks. The southern state of Kerala, the first to start widespread testing and quarantine measures, has prevented uncontrolled outbreak within its borders for several weeks. So, at least in principle, this country should not have gone from bracing for an epidemic to expecting twin catastrophes of contagion and starvation. But we have. As every country in the world faces up to the mistakes it has made in confronting this disease, it\u2019s hard not to feel that India is emblematic of how unprepared the world was for Covid-19. What else was going to happen in a country that has more billionaires than anywhere save China and the US, but still has the world\u2019s highest incidence of tuberculosis? Indian epidemiologists already knew that total lockdown wouldn\u2019t work in India the way it does in Europe: the infrastructure to ensure basic necessities at every doorstep doesn\u2019t exist, which is why many essential services, from grocery delivery to agricultural work, are exempt from curfews. The infectious diseases expert Dr Jayaprakash Muliyil advised us to devise various forms of community participation in controlling the disease instead: discouraging large gatherings and preparing to practice social distancing for months at a time. India\u2019s only option was to \u201cmitigate\u201d, he told the digital publication Scroll \u2013 not \u201cmilitate\u201d. This was oblique, but prescient. Indians are now spectators as police are filmed committing brutality on the streets, beating, humiliating, even allegedly murdering people who step out to hunt for essentials. There is a resonant continuity with scenes from India\u2019s winter of political dissent, during which Modi\u2019s government excused or enabled nauseating police violence to suppress street protests. This footage is available, for now, because the government has designated media work an \u201cessential service\u201d that must function through the emergency. Meanwhile, misinformation and propaganda bolt through televisions and WhatsApp, spreading superstition, medical hoaxes and racist rumours about minorities, none of which Modi has addressed, in spite of three long prime-time discourses on Covid-19 delivered to the nation. Last week, even before the grievous spectacle of internal displacement began, Modi told Indians that we face a challenge greater than that of the world wars. It was a significant claim to make to a country that sent millions of soldiers to those battlefields, and suffered the effects deeply. But it also suggested that the prime minister knows the situation is far worse than his government is letting on: the epidemiologist Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan pointed out in an interview that if Modi believed India\u2019s modest official numbers and projections, he would not have used such a grave analogy. What lies in store for India? Dr Laxminarayan, the director of the Centre For Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, warns that without mitigation, at least a million Indians could be critically ill in a matter of weeks: four or five times fewer than in a scenario without lockdown, but still overwhelming for a country with inadequate public healthcare. \u201cTest, test, test,\u201d says the World Health Organization. But our nation of 1.3 billion is still only testing 18 people per million: some say because of red tape, others that India is hiding the extent of the problem. In Mumbai, where people otherwise take a certain big-city pride in toughing it out through crises, the Covid-19 lockdown has taken away our most visible source of support: each other. Many can afford to Instagram quarantine cooking and lie around reading The Decameron, like our peers in the global elite. But these numbers are a fraction of the population that has lost the certainty of its next meal, the prospect of its next job and, for perhaps the first time in a generation, the optimism that tomorrow will be better. Despair cannot be the only side-effect of a pandemic. But at this moment, only the fear of death, and the impending grief we share with the rest of the world, links us all. \u2022 Supriya Nair is a writer and a columnist for the Mumbai Mirror \u2022 This article was amended on 29 March 2020.

Finally, the clocks have gone back to British Summer Time. We\u2019ve lost an hour of sleep, but hello, light.</p> <p>The greatest hope for the new season this year is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">better weather will start to make </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/will-spring-slow-spread-of-coronavirus-in-northern-hemisphere\">it harder for coronavirus</a> to spread. And for those lucky enough to still have their health, spring can provide other consolations. Its strong sense of a new beginning nudges our outlook and actions in welcome ways. Katherine Milkman, a behavioural scientist at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, has studied the phenomenon and found that there is more to spring cleaning than the sunlight suddenly showing up cobwebs and window smears. \u201cThe start of spring generally makes us feel more motivated \u2013 it\u2019s a so-called \u2018fresh start date\u2019,\u201d she says. As such, it makes us feel less connected to the past. \u201cThat disconnect gives us a sense that whatever we messed up on previously, we can get right now. Maybe the old you failed to quit smoking or start a lasting exercise routine, but the new you can do it.\u201d</p> <p>These moments, she says, also tend \u201cto promote bigger-picture thinking, which gets us focused on our goals\u201d. Whether facing health, financial or professional worries, newly working from home or home schooling, or being suddenly at a loss for something to do, Milkman says this effect can stretch \u201cacross all of our goal-oriented activities. We\u2019ve seen that it affects everything from decisions about exercise to retirement savings.\u201d</p> <p>Spring can also fortify us with the relief it brings from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/30/sad-winter-depression-seasonal-affective-disorder\">seasonal affective disorder</a> (Sad). Even if you do not have a clinical case of it, says Hugh Selsick, chair of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep\">sleep</a> working group at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, \u201cmost people will experience some degree of lifting of mood in the summer months\u201d. Studies looking at populations in North America have illustrated this neatly, according to Selsick. \u201cThe further north you go, the worse our mood gets in the winter, because of that lack of light. For us [in the north] the payoff is that we also get these really nice bright long, spring and summer days.</p> <p>\u201cAs humans, we evolved in a tropical place, where there was a lot more light,\u201d Selsick says. This means our brains have evolved to expect a certain amount of it. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why we are so susceptible to changes in light,\u201d he says. And why the gloomier months can negatively affect sleep patterns and mood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bc064788ce5ef127c161ef8f2febc0ce808e485\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc064788ce5ef127c161ef8f2febc0ce808e485/0_0_5671_3780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woman looking through a window\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Breathe deep ... our brains have evolved to expect more light than we get in winter.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: martin-dm/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sad symptoms that spring might alleviate include low mood, tiredness, sleeping longer than normal and, says Selsick, cravings of carbohydrates in particular. So feel free to harness this knowledge to fuel a new effort to start exceeding your five a day.</p> <p>Now that most of us are only allowed out once a day, for exercise, the greatest gains in terms of making the most of spring light are to be had from stepping out first thing in the morning. Not only will getting up and out help avoid the crowds of joggers, but morning light is the most crucial for setting our circadian rhythms. \u201cIt\u2019s much better at synchronising our body clocks and getting us back into sync with the outside world,\u201d says Selsick.</p> <p>When it\u2019s dark, we produce melatonin, which acts as a time signal to the body, telling it we should be sleepy. \u201cThat first bit of light in the morning,\u201d says Selsick, \u201cis very effective at switching that melatonin off, which then tells the brain and the rest of the body it\u2019s now time to be awake and active.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a special set of receptors in our eyes which communicate directly with the body clock in the brain,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re particularly sensitive to blue-green light, which on a [sunny] day like today is the colour of the sky. So that sort of bright sunlight, that outdoor light is what our brains are particularly sensitive to.\u201d Exposure to this in the morning helps us to wake up and shake off bleary-eyed grumpiness. \u201cAnd it helps to regulate our sleep. If your body knows when the day is starting, it\u2019s easier for it to also know at what time it needs to start winding down and getting ready for sleep.\u201d And of course sleeping well has the positive knock-on effect of giving you a better shot at feeling content and having good overall health.</p> <p>The big danger with being locked down, warns Selsick, is \u201callowing your whole rhythm to drift\u201d. Even if a temporary break from commuting allows you to sleep in a little, keep your waking-up time consistent to reap the benefits of the spring sunshine. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting that first dose of light at a different time every morning, your body has no idea where it is in time,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re essentially jet-lagging your body by having a different rising time every day.\u201d Setting regular meal times helps keep our daily rhythms in sync, too.</p> <p>It\u2019s essential that we make the most of opportunities to be outside, whether it\u2019s that one permitted outing, or additional gardening, or spending some time on the balcony. \u201cThe more outdoors you can get the better, without getting in close contact with people,\u201d says Selsick.</p> <p>Getting some sun can fill our heads with new ideas, too. In 2005, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2005.01602.x\">psychologists at the University of Michigan</a> found that half an hour out in the sun boosted not only mood, but also memory and creativity. To test the latter, they assessed changes in what they call cognitive broadening \u2013 \u201ca style of thinking in which people become more creative and which is hypothesised to be an adaptive shift in cognition that leads to behavioral flexibility and exploration\u201d, write the authors.</p> <p>Late-evening light may be less likely to have an impact on circadian rhythms than morning rays, but, says Selsick, \u201cpeople do generally report a better quality of life if they have some light in the evening\u201d. Indeed. A 2016 study by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032716306553\">researchers at Brigham Young University in Utah</a> looked at six years of data from more than 16,000 adults and found that seasonal increases in hours of sunshine correlated with decreased mental health distress.</p> <p>Longer days also seem to extend the amount of use we get from waking hours. When it\u2019s light in the evenings, it feels like daytime for longer. Staying up to batch cook, bake bread or, in the current climate, have beers with friends over Zoom, will seem appealing all of a sudden. \u201cLight does to some extent push sleep away a little bit,\u201d says Selsick. \u201cAnd people do often feel more alert when there\u2019s bright light.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9ed444914f683c827e0bc6f5d1d9bc85b9bc0cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b9ed444914f683c827e0bc6f5d1d9bc85b9bc0cd/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gardening time with my daddyYoung man and his son taking care of their plants on the balcony of loft apartment\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Have balcony, will garden ... a spot of seasonal potting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AleksandarNakic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And of course, with spring, light and warmth comes nature.

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green has been urged not to use coronavirus as an excuse to stop payments into the Topshop retirement scheme, as a pensions expert called on the billionaire\u2019s Monaco-based wife, Tina, to plug any shortfall. Arcadia Group, the parent company of the Green family\u2019s retail empire, is planning to halt cash injections into the firm\u2019s pension fund as it seeks to conserve cash to survive the coronavirus crisis that has dealt a devastating blow to retailers. But MP Rachel Reeves said businesses \u201cwill need to answer for their decisions during this pandemic and whether they did the right thing by workers and pension holders\u201d. She said the pandemic should not be used as an excuse to reduce pension provision for loyal staff. John Ralfe, who has previously advised MPs investigating the collapse of Green\u2019s defunct retail chain BHS, said there was no reason to leave the scheme \u201cshort-changed\u201d. Arcadia\u2019s plan involves postponing payments that were agreed with the Pensions Regulator last year as Green sought a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), a controversial form of insolvency, to keep the retail group afloat. The regulator and pension trustees agreed to allow the company to halve contributions into the Arcadia scheme from \u00a350m a year to \u00a325m, in exchange for Tina Green pledging to put in \u00a3100m to make up for the shortfall. The deal involved Lady Green paying in instalments of \u00a325m a year from her own wealth, plus an extra one-off \u00a325m payment. While Philip Green chairs the business, it is owned by Tina Green, based in tax-free Monaco. The Green family took a \u00a31.2bn dividend from the company in 2005, while Tina Green was paid \u00a325m by the retail group in 2017. While Arcadia plans to suspend the company\u2019s immediate contributions to the pension scheme, it said the payments from Tina Green would continue and would arrive on time. But Ralfe said the company could avoid suspending any pension contributions during the coronavirus crisis if she agreed to bring forward the \u00a3100m in contributions rather than staggering them. \u201cIf Arcadia wants to delay its payments to conserve cash flow, then Lady Tina should bring forward her payments so the pension scheme gets the same amount,\u201d Ralfe said. \u201cGiven Lady Tina\u2019s significant net worth, the Pensions Regulator must ensure that coronavirus is not an excuse for the Arcadia pension scheme to be short-changed. \u201cThe latest Arcadia annual report at August 2018 shows a \u00a3138m deficit \u2013 \u00a3931m assets and \u00a31.07bn liabilities \u2013 which today will be around \u00a390m, given deficit contributions and other movements. \u201cIf Arcadia were to enter administration, the deficit would be much higher, at \u00a3350m\u2013\u00a3400m.\u201d Ralfe has previously advised a parliamentary committee examining the demise of BHS, which Green sold for \u00a31 to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell.

It is only right that it serves to be a community asset, particularly at this time.\u201d Plymouth have also raised almost \u00a325,000 since launching a crowdfunding campaign with the aim of supporting local suppliers, pledging to donate one match ticket to NHS staff from Devon and Cornwall for every \u00a3100 raised. \u201cIf we can be successful without kicking a ball to help save people\u2019s lives, that to me is a big yes,\u201d says Ryan Lowe, the Plymouth manager. \u201cThere are parents, nurses and doctors putting their bodies on the line and not going home to see their families, so it is great we can do something to give back. \u201cFootball has taken a back step and rightly so because it\u2019s not about football and we\u2019re doing our bit to help that. Everyone is missing football and desperate to get back playing but ultimately the most important thing is to save lives and stop this cruel virus.\u201d",

In other developments: Moscow went into full lockdown: no one to leave the house except to go to the nearest shop or pharmacy or walk pets up to 100m from the house. Patrick Devedjian, a former French cabinet minister and prominent local politician, died in hospital after being tested positive. He was 75. Thomas Schaefer, the finance minister of Germany\u2019s Hesse state, took his own life apparently after becoming \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about how to cope with the economic fallout from the epidemic. The main opposition candidate in Polish presidential elections called for the vote to be boycotted if the government insists on going ahead with it on 10 May. Pope Francis called for a ceasefire in all conflicts around the globe to focus on the \u201cfight of our lives\u201d against Covid-19. Egypt shut its beaches as cases in the Middle East surpassed 50,000. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced further restrictions including limiting public gatherings to just two people. All travellers entering South Korea will face two weeks of mandatory quarantine starting at midnight next Wednesday. Tokyo confirmed 68 new coronavirus cases, another record daily increase. China continued to relax restrictions, with flights from Hubei province and tube and bus services in Wuhan city, the centre of the outbreak, resuming this weekend. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, said on Sunday that the \u201cnew way of life\u201d in Iran was likely to be prolonged, as the country\u2019s death toll rose to 2,640 and its number of officially confirmed cases to 38,309. \u201cWe must prepare to live with this virus until a treatment or vaccine is discovered,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 100 critically endangered sea turtles have hatched on a deserted beach in Brazil, their first steps going almost unnoticed because of coronavirus restrictions that prohibit people from gathering on the region\u2019s sands. The 97 hawksbill sea turtles, or tartarugas-de-pente as they are known in Brazil, hatched last Sunday in Paulista, a town in the north-eastern state of Pernambuco. Photographs taken by government workers, the only people to witness the event, showed the tiny creatures making their way down the beach and into the Atlantic waves. Locals have been forbidden from gathering on Pernambuco\u2019s spectacular shoreline since last weekend, when the state governor, Paulo C\u00e2mara, ordered a partial shutdown and urged residents to stay indoors to slow the spread of coronavirus. Speaking to the Guardian last week, C\u00e2mara said such measures \u2013 which the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has actively undermined \u2013 were vital if Brazil were to avoid a crisis similar to the one that has taken hold in Europe. \u201cOnly isolation will stop the curve growing at the speed it is growing in other places,\u201d he said. C\u00e2mara said the government of Pernambuco, which has so far confirmed 68 Covid-19 cases and five deaths, was racing against time to make hospital beds available for patients. \u201cAll of our efforts are now geared towards delaying its profileration \u2026 [so that] when this curve grows, and it will grow, we are as ready as we possibly can be to care for people,\u201d he said. According to Brazil\u2019s Tamar conservation project, which protects sea turtles, hawksbills lay their eggs along the country\u2019s north-eastern coast and are considered a critically endangered species. They can grow up to 110cm in length, weigh 85kg and owe their Portuguese name, which translates as \u201ccomb turtles\u201d, to the fact that their shells were once widely used to make combs and frames for glasses. The turtle\u2019s English name comes from its narrow, pointed beak, according to the WWF. Paulista\u2019s environmental secretary, Roberto Couto, said the town was home to four of the five types of turtle found along Brazil\u2019s coastline: the hawksbill, the green sea turtle, the olive ridley turtle and the loggerhead turtle. More than 300 turtles have hatched there this year.

      "body": "<p>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national on temporary release from a five-year jail sentence, is for the first time under formal consideration for clemency, her family has been told. A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran\u2019s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK.</p> <p>Zaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight\u2019s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/iran-to-pardon-10000-including-security-prisoners\"> 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak.</a> She has been allowed to stay at her parents\u2019 house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents\u2019 home.</p> <p>All prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran\u2019s political prisoners to be freed.</p> <p>The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight\u2019s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday.</p> <p>Arrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail. Her sentence is due to come to an end within 10 months unless new charges are levelled against her - something the Islamic revolutionary guards corps has threatened in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec9acfe94f50a554009065481e533af29fffd373\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec9acfe94f50a554009065481e533af29fffd373/0_579_2764_3454/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe pictured with her ankle brace\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe pictured with her ankle brace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Free Nazanin Campaign/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The potential offer of clemency, relayed to Nazanin\u2019s father by the prison authorities at the weekend, will be recommended to the Iranian prosecutor general\u2019s office. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, described the move as \u201cpotentially a baby step towards freedom\u201d. \u201cI spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Ratcliffe told the Guardian: \u201cThe deputy prosecutor can either approve clemency or refer the file back to the supreme leader\u2019s office with a recommendation that she not be granted clemency, or it could just sit on his desk for a bit.</p> <p>\u201cThe supreme leader can refuse a recommendation not to grant clemency, or can follow it and specify that Nazanin not be granted. But the default in the process following the supreme leader\u2019s proclamation last week is that the law requires eligible people to be granted clemency.</p> <p>\u201cSo it is a good that her file has been put forward \u2013 an acknowledgement by the judiciary that she is formally eligible, and she is being treated so far like everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>He and his wife, 41, have suffered painful false dawns before, partly because the Iranian political system has many different centres of decision-making.</p> <p>British officials believe any decision to grant her clemency will be taken at the highest level, including an assessment of the wider political benefits to Iran in winning support for the lifting of sanctions. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has deliberately made no political statement since her release from jail, but the pressure to release other prisoners is intense, with reports of unrest in prisons continuing this weekend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab9750221cc8f6d850d5e744b6f15c01994f7735\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab9750221cc8f6d850d5e744b6f15c01994f7735/0_0_3108_1865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Ratcliffe said the potential offer of clemency was a \u2018baby step towards freedom\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Ratcliffe said the potential offer of clemency was a \u2018baby step towards freedom\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Iranian foreign ministry has been mounting an increasingly effective international campaign, including with American Democrats, to turn up the diplomatic heat on the US for its refusal to suspend economic sanctions to help Iran purchase medical equipment needed to help fight the pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/uk-presses-us-to-ease-iran-sanctions-to-help-fight-coronavirus\">Britain has been privately urging</a> Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to see if the US can remove any blocks to a new Swiss channel, the Swiss humanitarian trade arrangement, that is supposed to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran.</p> <p>International bankers say they still do not have sufficient reassurance from the US Treasury that they will not be sanctioned if they finance the trade. At the same time, Iran has been seeking help in securing a $5bn (\u00a34bn) IMF loan, something the US could block. A reformist MP from Tehran, Alireza Rahimi, tweeted on Sunday that the IMF was going to release \u201ca substantial portion\u201d of the loan.</p> <p>The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said: \u201cThe US government had moved from sabotage to assassinations to waging an economic war and economic terrorism on Iranians and now to medical terrorism. This even exceeds what is permissible on the battlefield.\u201d</p> <p>However, hardliners are determined to send out a message that the government can ride out the crisis alone, and seem mainly eager to take aim at the failure of Europe and the US to bring the pandemic under control.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/end-us-sanctions-iran-fight-coronavirus-pandemic\">End US sanctions against Iran so that we can fight coronavirus with all our might | Azadeh Moaveni and Sussan Tahmasebi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pressure has also been mounting on the sometimes incoherent Iranian leadership over its handling of the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian dual national on temporary release from a five-year jail sentence, is for the first time under formal consideration for clemency, her family has been told. A decision will be made by the highest level of Iran\u2019s multi-layered government. There is no guarantee that clemency will be granted, or that she will be allowed to return to the UK. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, seen by some as a bargaining chip in the wider diplomatic dispute between the UK and Iran, was given a temporary fortnight\u2019s release from Evin prison, Tehran, on 17 March along with 85,000 other prisoners at risk from the coronavirus outbreak. She has been allowed to stay at her parents\u2019 house in Tehran but made to wear an ankle brace that keeps her within 300 metres of her parents\u2019 home. All prisoners sentenced for five years or less were given temporary release, permitting half of all Iran\u2019s political prisoners to be freed. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, announced early last week that what had initially been seen as a fortnight\u2019s release for furloughed prisoners had been extended to early April since there was no sign that the coronavirus pandemic was easing. Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s inclusion in that extension was only confirmed to the family by the prison on Saturday. Arrested in April 2016, she was sentenced in September to five years in jail. Her sentence is due to come to an end within 10 months unless new charges are levelled against her - something the Islamic revolutionary guards corps has threatened in the past. The potential offer of clemency, relayed to Nazanin\u2019s father by the prison authorities at the weekend, will be recommended to the Iranian prosecutor general\u2019s office. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, described the move as \u201cpotentially a baby step towards freedom\u201d. \u201cI spoke to her yesterday and her mood was pretty upbeat,\u201d he said. Ratcliffe told the Guardian: \u201cThe deputy prosecutor can either approve clemency or refer the file back to the supreme leader\u2019s office with a recommendation that she not be granted clemency, or it could just sit on his desk for a bit. \u201cThe supreme leader can refuse a recommendation not to grant clemency, or can follow it and specify that Nazanin not be granted. But the default in the process following the supreme leader\u2019s proclamation last week is that the law requires eligible people to be granted clemency. \u201cSo it is a good that her file has been put forward \u2013 an acknowledgement by the judiciary that she is formally eligible, and she is being treated so far like everyone else.\u201d He and his wife, 41, have suffered painful false dawns before, partly because the Iranian political system has many different centres of decision-making. British officials believe any decision to grant her clemency will be taken at the highest level, including an assessment of the wider political benefits to Iran in winning support for the lifting of sanctions. Zaghari-Ratcliffe has deliberately made no political statement since her release from jail, but the pressure to release other prisoners is intense, with reports of unrest in prisons continuing this weekend. The Iranian foreign ministry has been mounting an increasingly effective international campaign, including with American Democrats, to turn up the diplomatic heat on the US for its refusal to suspend economic sanctions to help Iran purchase medical equipment needed to help fight the pandemic. Britain has been privately urging Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, to see if the US can remove any blocks to a new Swiss channel, the Swiss humanitarian trade arrangement, that is supposed to ease the flow of humanitarian supplies to Iran. International bankers say they still do not have sufficient reassurance from the US Treasury that they will not be sanctioned if they finance the trade. At the same time, Iran has been seeking help in securing a $5bn (\u00a34bn) IMF loan, something the US could block. A reformist MP from Tehran, Alireza Rahimi, tweeted on Sunday that the IMF was going to release \u201ca substantial portion\u201d of the loan. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said: \u201cThe US government had moved from sabotage to assassinations to waging an economic war and economic terrorism on Iranians and now to medical terrorism. This even exceeds what is permissible on the battlefield.\u201d However, hardliners are determined to send out a message that the government can ride out the crisis alone, and seem mainly eager to take aim at the failure of Europe and the US to bring the pandemic under control. Pressure has also been mounting on the sometimes incoherent Iranian leadership over its handling of the pandemic. The Iranian health ministry on Sunday announced a further 2,901 new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours, taking the total number of cases to 38,309. The 24-hour total of new infections has ballooned in the past five days from below 900 new infections in a week. The official total death toll is only 2,640, and the daily recorded deaths are broadly static, something that is hard to reconcile with the higher level of infections. The death toll is a quarter of Spain\u2019s, and may be due to Iran\u2019s decision to classify some deaths as caused by respiratory difficulties rather than coronavirus. Following weeks of pressure to take tougher steps, Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, finally introduced physical distancing and city quarantines. An emergency 2,000-bed hospital has been built in Tehran, reflecting the pressure in the capital. A total of 3,467 patients are described as \u201cin severe condition\u201d.",

The firm said it wanted all its staff to be tested regularly to ensure customers who cannot visit the shops because they are observing lockdown protocols can receive deliveries safely. It has paid \u00a31.5m for the testing kits, with 40,000 already delivered and a further 60,000 to come. Ocado refused to state from which company it had bought the tests. While Ocado has managed to source testing kits for staff contributing to the food supply effort, nurses and doctors have been left waiting.

Ocado said testing would help ensure staff can continue \u201cworking round the clock\u201d to get as much food delivered to as many homes as possible, with demand 10 times higher than average. Its ordering service has buckled under the strain of rocketing orders, prompting its chairman, Stuart Rose, to urge Britons to stop stockpiling groceries, insisting \u201cnobody will starve\u201d during the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cNo matter how hard we work, we do not have enough capacity to serve these unprecedented levels of demand,\u201d Ocado said in an emailed statement. \u201cOur priorities are the safety and wellbeing of our customers, colleagues and the community.\u201d The kits will allow Ocado to test grocery packers and delivery drivers who have emerged as one of the most vital segments of the workforce during the coronavirus crisis because of their role in bringing food to those who cannot leave the house. Anyone involved in the production, processing, distribution, sale and delivery of food has been given \u201ckey worker\u201d status, affording them certain privileges such as permission to send their children to school. Ocado said if it were asked to do so, it would hand over testing kits to the government to ensure that health workers were first in line. \u201cOcado is clear that the NHS takes priority in the national effort to combat coronavirus and kits will be made available to the NHS if and where required,\u201d it said. The government has said that tests for NHS healthcare workers will be rolled out next week, allowing them to confirm whether they have been infected or are safe to work. It bought 3.5m of the kits but has been criticised over the time it has taken for them to reach frontline staff most at risk of contracting the virus from patients. While key workers have had to wait to be tested, private health firms have come under fire for selling thousands of test kits to wealthy buyers for up to \u00a3295 each. Public Health England said last week that mass home-testing would be possible \u201cwithin days\u201d via a procedure that involves pricking the finger to produce a drop of blood, which is then analysed by a device. The test is being validated in Oxford to ensure it works. The health body said the kits would soon be available on the high street, or to order via Amazon\u2019s delivery service. But Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, later played down the idea that millions of the tests would be available on the internet this week. High street pharmacist Boots said on Friday night that it had agreed to help the government open drive-through Covid-19 testing facilities by assisting with recruitment of staff, although it has no plans to test in stores.",

We may have moved to higher ground, but the wave of illness and death is yet to hit. And when it comes, many of our fellow Australians will die alone or in crowded hospitals.</p> <p>As we mobilise for action on these fronts, I am concerned we are not preparing for the wave of grief that will have to be expressed alone, in ways totally foreign to our natural instinct to come together and physically embrace each other.</p> <p>How will someone mourn the passing of their parent if they can\u2019t sit with them in their final hours? How will we mark the loss of friends and colleagues when we aren\u2019t allowed the time and space to honour them? How will local communities cope when loved health workers die?</p> <p>How do we prepare for the sadness that will be thrust upon us?</p> <p>We must prepare to rediscover the art of lament.</p> <p>Lament is a one of those words that seems to have lost its meaning. Lament is not a label to put on a person or a situation \u2013 it\u2019s the communal sharing of this grief, an act of solidarity that ensures no one needs to grieve alone, despite our physical distance.</p> <p>If we are going to find a way to lament through the coming months, we need to start now by actively participating in our shared sense of exile. As Camus reminds us, it is about giving wandering shadows substance by rooting ourselves in the solid earth of our distress.</p> <p>Sharing exile can take many forms, but it starts with developing common rituals \u2013 whether it is joining in online church services or choral events freely available, lighting a candle with friends across a Zoom meeting, clapping our valiant health workers on our doorstep at 8pm each evening or singing from balconies like the Lombards.</p> <p>It\u2019s also about meditating on what we are grateful for \u2013 family, friends, a room with a view \u2013 even in quarantine we need to find meaning in our lives, to know we are seen, that our pain is validated by others and to know we are loved.</p> <p>At these times of lament, charities have always filled an important role \u2013 to organise the collective support for the one in need, anchored in a common benevolent love of humanity.</p> <p>But even here the virus challenges us. Many of our charities are facing their own crises, first in the largely older volunteer force who do the work and, inevitably, facing a reduction in the amount of money people can afford to donate to support their work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/buy-a-nurse-a-coffee-ways-australians-can-help-others-during-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Buy a nurse a coffee: ways Australians can help others during the coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of these institutions may not survive, others will need to fundamentally rethink their delivery models, but what will remain constant is the need for the act of charity, that benevolent love of humanity, to sustain us.</p> <p>That\u2019s why the nation\u2019s major charities are coming together to create a \u201cCharities Cabinet\u201d to advise the government on ways we can deliver all our citizens the basics of a roof, a meal, a sense of human connection and a reminder that in the midst of global mayhem every individual matters. Charities exist to prioritise the needs of the vulnerable; whether they have insecure housing, or no housing. All indeed matter. Charity is the old English word for inclusive love.</p> <p>This is a moment in our shared humanity when we don\u2019t know what happens next, but I suspect that we will need more than just an economic stimulus; we will need a stimulus in civility, in community and in charity that can only be generated from within, as we lament and then renew ourselves together.</p> <p>In the words of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the 19th century maverick Australian poet and politician: \u201cLife is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone. Kindness in another\u2019s trouble, Courage in your own.\u201d</p> <p>These will be the saddest of times, but when it passes we will have the chance to rebuild our world on the charity in all of us.</p> <p><em>\u2022&nbsp;Join Tim Costello as he<a href=\"https://australiaathome.squarespace.com/upcoming-conversations/tim-costello\"> gives the inaugural Australia at Home lunchtime briefing at 1pm Monday</a></em></p> <p><br><br></p>",

But I\u2019m concerned that over the coming weeks we fall into the trap of kidding ourselves this is the crisis, that the preparations and changes to our normal routines represent the full impact of this cruel virus. Because this exile is not the crisis \u2013 it is the beginning of the crisis. We may have moved to higher ground, but the wave of illness and death is yet to hit. And when it comes, many of our fellow Australians will die alone or in crowded hospitals. As we mobilise for action on these fronts, I am concerned we are not preparing for the wave of grief that will have to be expressed alone, in ways totally foreign to our natural instinct to come together and physically embrace each other. How will someone mourn the passing of their parent if they can\u2019t sit with them in their final hours? How will we mark the loss of friends and colleagues when we aren\u2019t allowed the time and space to honour them? How will local communities cope when loved health workers die? How do we prepare for the sadness that will be thrust upon us? We must prepare to rediscover the art of lament. Lament is a one of those words that seems to have lost its meaning. Lament is not a label to put on a person or a situation \u2013 it\u2019s the communal sharing of this grief, an act of solidarity that ensures no one needs to grieve alone, despite our physical distance. If we are going to find a way to lament through the coming months, we need to start now by actively participating in our shared sense of exile. As Camus reminds us, it is about giving wandering shadows substance by rooting ourselves in the solid earth of our distress. Sharing exile can take many forms, but it starts with developing common rituals \u2013 whether it is joining in online church services or choral events freely available, lighting a candle with friends across a Zoom meeting, clapping our valiant health workers on our doorstep at 8pm each evening or singing from balconies like the Lombards. It\u2019s also about meditating on what we are grateful for \u2013 family, friends, a room with a view \u2013 even in quarantine we need to find meaning in our lives, to know we are seen, that our pain is validated by others and to know we are loved. At these times of lament, charities have always filled an important role \u2013 to organise the collective support for the one in need, anchored in a common benevolent love of humanity. But even here the virus challenges us. Many of our charities are facing their own crises, first in the largely older volunteer force who do the work and, inevitably, facing a reduction in the amount of money people can afford to donate to support their work. Some of these institutions may not survive, others will need to fundamentally rethink their delivery models, but what will remain constant is the need for the act of charity, that benevolent love of humanity, to sustain us. That\u2019s why the nation\u2019s major charities are coming together to create a \u201cCharities Cabinet\u201d to advise the government on ways we can deliver all our citizens the basics of a roof, a meal, a sense of human connection and a reminder that in the midst of global mayhem every individual matters. Charities exist to prioritise the needs of the vulnerable; whether they have insecure housing, or no housing. All indeed matter. Charity is the old English word for inclusive love. This is a moment in our shared humanity when we don\u2019t know what happens next, but I suspect that we will need more than just an economic stimulus; we will need a stimulus in civility, in community and in charity that can only be generated from within, as we lament and then renew ourselves together. In the words of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the 19th century maverick Australian poet and politician: \u201cLife is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone. Kindness in another\u2019s trouble, Courage in your own.\u201d These will be the saddest of times, but when it passes we will have the chance to rebuild our world on the charity in all of us. \u2022 Join Tim Costello as he gives the inaugural Australia at Home lunchtime briefing at 1pm Monday",

      "body": "<p>Lots of things about modern politics would surprise <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/william-ewart-gladstone\" title=\"\">William Gladstone</a> if the 19th-century Liberal prime minister was unexpectedly reincarnated into the Britain of 2020. Things like press conferences, video links and female MPs would all catch him out. Gladstone would, though, be reassured by one thing. He would easily be able to find his way around Westminster. That\u2019s because the corridors of power in which politics, parliament and government are conducted in 2020 are remarkably unchanged since he died in 1898. The warren of staircases and rooms in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/10-downing-street#take-the-tour\" title=\"\">10 Downing Street</a> and the cramped Commons chamber, with MPs jostling through the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/aye-and-no-lobbies/\" title=\"\">division lobbies</a>, would all be familiar to him.</p> <p>Whether Britain benefits or suffers from its traditionalised habits and settings of politics is a <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-palace-of-westminster-should-be-a-museum-not-the-institutional-heart-of-british-politics/\" title=\"\">recurrent question</a>. But the Covid-19 pandemic poses it in a new way. Parliament went on sitting through world wars and financial crises. Gladstone himself sat through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/04/story-cities-14-london-great-stink-river-thames-joseph-bazalgette-sewage-system\" title=\"\">Great Stink</a> of the summer of 1858, when the Thames became a sewer. But a modern pandemic that has made human proximity unsafe has meant that parliament cannot sit at all, and that MPs cannot do their fundamental job. Business in the chamber became a ghostly charade. Voting by crowding into the aye and no lobbies was deemed too dangerous to attempt. At the height of a national crisis, therefore, many of the checks and balances on government, and parliamentary democracy itself, have effectively collapsed. These issues must be addressed before parliament returns on 21 April.</p> <p>Now the Covid-19 virus has penetrated to the heart of government too. Last Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/what-boris-johnson-matt-hancock-expect-coronavirus\" title=\"\">three most important people</a> leading the fight against the pandemic all went into self-isolation. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, have all been put out of action. So has the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack. We wish them all well and a full recovery. But the disruption at the top of government is huge. The virus has done what the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13347380\" title=\"\">Luftwaffe</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/from-the-archive-blog/2014/oct/03/brighton-bombing-grand-hotel-tory-conservative-conference-1984\" title=\"\">IRA</a> could not.

      "bodyText": "Lots of things about modern politics would surprise William Gladstone if the 19th-century Liberal prime minister was unexpectedly reincarnated into the Britain of 2020. Things like press conferences, video links and female MPs would all catch him out. Gladstone would, though, be reassured by one thing. He would easily be able to find his way around Westminster. That\u2019s because the corridors of power in which politics, parliament and government are conducted in 2020 are remarkably unchanged since he died in 1898. The warren of staircases and rooms in 10 Downing Street and the cramped Commons chamber, with MPs jostling through the division lobbies, would all be familiar to him. Whether Britain benefits or suffers from its traditionalised habits and settings of politics is a recurrent question. But the Covid-19 pandemic poses it in a new way. Parliament went on sitting through world wars and financial crises. Gladstone himself sat through the Great Stink of the summer of 1858, when the Thames became a sewer. But a modern pandemic that has made human proximity unsafe has meant that parliament cannot sit at all, and that MPs cannot do their fundamental job. Business in the chamber became a ghostly charade. Voting by crowding into the aye and no lobbies was deemed too dangerous to attempt. At the height of a national crisis, therefore, many of the checks and balances on government, and parliamentary democracy itself, have effectively collapsed. These issues must be addressed before parliament returns on 21 April. Now the Covid-19 virus has penetrated to the heart of government too. Last Friday, the three most important people leading the fight against the pandemic all went into self-isolation. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, have all been put out of action. So has the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack. We wish them all well and a full recovery. But the disruption at the top of government is huge. The virus has done what the Luftwaffe and the IRA could not. It has made the work of leading the nation in an emergency significantly harder than it was already. When a government has just taken extraordinary powers to impose its rule, this is a particularly bad time to suffer that sort of hit. None of this is to imply that all would be well if only Britain\u2019s government and parliament conducted their business in airy modern buildings with wider corridors, state-of-the-art health and safety provisions, and better designed workspaces. Berlin has spacious, modern government buildings of this kind, but Angela Merkel is having to self-isolate nevertheless. Prime ministers have also been stricken in past emergencies. In the first world war, David Lloyd George spent nine days with influenza in a temporary hospital inside Manchester town hall during the 1918 epidemic. In the second, Winston Churchill had a heart attack in late 1941 and serious pneumonia 15 months later. The reality is that the world cannot be designed, or politics conducted, without risk. Nevertheless, there are lessons to consider and apply. Politics, like the health service, needs the best possible circumstances for it to do its job. The buildings should be more suitable.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us here on the UK side. Head over to our global live blog for all the latest worldwide coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Normal life will not resume for at least six months, according to the chief deputy medical officer (see 4.51pm) as she warned the coronavirus death toll was expected to increase \u201cfor the next week or two\u201d. Dr Jenny Harries described the first confirmed death of a frontline NHS worker with coronavirus as \u201cworrying\u201d, as Amged El-Hawrani\u2019s family paid tribute to the \u201cmuch-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend\u201d (see 4.07pm). The UK death toll from coronavirus increased by 209 people in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228 so far (see 2.05pm). The figure was lower than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260, which may bring some hope that the rise in deaths could stabilise soon. NHS workers should not be asked to work without protective equipment, said the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick. Directly appealing to frontline workers, he said the government \u201cwill not stop\u201d until healthcare staff are provided with the equipment they need as he outlined the vast amounts of stocks which are in the process of being received around the country (see 4.19pm). A 108-year-old woman and survivor of the 1918 Spanish flu is thought to have become the oldest victim of coronavirus in the UK. Hilda Churchill died in a Salford care home on Saturday, hours after testing positive for Covid-19 and just eight days before her 109th birthday. 19,522 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, after 127,737 tests, the Department of Health confirmed; while 95 people in Scotland are in intensive care with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, with the figures for England, Wales and Northern Ireland unknown. The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented and a lack of resources was to blame, according to Prof Ian Boyd, a former government chief scientific adviser. Government does not rule out mass repatriation flights, with Britons stranded around the world struggling to return from places where a lockdown has been imposed (see 5.07pm). Labour deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon said criticism of China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak by ministers represented a \u201cTrump-style\u201d ploy to distract from government failures (see 3.31pm). Evictions from private rented accommodation and social homes are to be banned in Scotland during the coronavirus outbreak under emergency legislation (see 3.22pm). It comes after the UK government was accused of breaking a promise to renters when proposed laws only extended the notice period that landlords must give tenants before they can evict them from two months to three. The nationwide lockdown is allowing animals to roam paths which they usually shy away from. \u201cWe have annual visitor numbers in excess of 1 million and suddenly, in the peak of breeding season, they are not going to be here,\u201d said the conservation manager of the largest national nature reserve in England. \u201cNature is just going: \u2018Ahhh, it\u2019s all to ourselves now.\u2019\u201d Harries said she expected the coronavirus death toll to increase \u201cfor the next week or two\u201d. But then we anticipate that if we keep doing what we\u2019re doing \u2026 we do anticipate that those numbers will start to drop. Asked about death figures she said it \u201clags behind our impressions on the rate of increase of infections\u201d. So, we just need to watch it carefully, hold tight for a week or two, keep doing what we\u2019re doing and then come back and ask me the question again and I think hopefully we will be on the way down a little bit. Jenrick said that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had been working \u201cextremely hard\u201d with British missions worldwide to bring those stranded abroad back to the UK. He has spent this weekend speaking with his counterparts in a range of countries, where there are citizens who we want to get back safely to the UK as soon as possible. On arranging further rescue flights for those still abroad, Jenrick said: We haven\u2019t ruled out repatriation flights and we are doing those in some cases. There is a flight ongoing at the moment, for example to Peru, to bring back a group of British citizens who have been in a difficult situation there. If we need to do more steps of that kind in the days ahead, then we will of course do so. We want to get those British citizens back safely to the UK. Robert Jenrick said that he had heard the news shortly before the briefing that Dr Amged El-Hawrani had \u201cvery sadly passed away\u201d. The deaths we are reporting daily at these press conferences are very sobering. Every death is a tragedy. We don\u2019t want to see any unnecessary death. Dr Jenny Harries said as a medical professional she usually would not comment on an individual case but added she was \u201cvery saddened\u201d that a professional colleague had passed away. It clearly is a worrying event, it is worrying for the nation because it is another death in our statistics, it is another loss to a family. And it will be a loss to an NHS family as well. It is in no-one\u2019s interests that we lose our colleagues. The Muslim Council of Britain has highlighted that Amged El-Hawrani is the third doctor of the Islamic faith to have died from confirmed or suspected coronavirus. Directly appealing to frontline workers, Jenrick said the government \u201cwill not stop\u201d until healthcare staff are provided with the equipment they need. We simply cannot and should not ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment. To NHS and social care workers, all those who rely on this equipment, and to their families and loved ones watching this afternoon. We understand and we will not stop until we have got you the equipment you need. I\u2019ll continue to post the full quotes from the presser as we get them. When asked whether the country would be on lockdown for the next six months, Harries said: We actually anticipate our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, and then we are looking to see whether we have managed to push that curve down and we start to see a decline. This is not to say we would be in complete lockdown for six months, but as a nation we have to be really, really responsible and keep doing what we\u2019re all doing until we\u2019re sure we can gradually start lifting various interventions which are likely to be spaced \u2013 based on the science and our data \u2013 until we gradually come back to a normal way of living. She said the government would review lockdown measures in three weeks\u2019 time. The issue of the three weeks is for us to review where we are and see if we\u2019ve had an impact jointly on the slope of that curve. But I think to make it clear to the public if we are successful we will have squashed the top of that curve, which is brilliant, but we must not then suddenly revert to our normal way of living that would be quite dangerous. If we stop then all of our efforts will be wasted and we could potentially see a second peak. So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review. The press conference has now concluded. The Guardian\u2019s Kate Proctor asks whether the scale of the repatriation package for Britons stranded abroad will equal that of Germany\u2019s \u20ac50m (\u00a345m) package. Jenrick says the foreign secretary has been working \u201cextremely hard\u201d with British embassies around the world. He adds that Britons have been advised to return on commercial flights where available and that repatriation flights \u2013 such as those under way from Peru \u2013 would come if necessary. We are the world\u2019s leading country in supporting vaccine research, Jenrick adds. He recognises there will be lessons to be learned, in the UK and elsewhere, but that the current focus is on saving lives. Harries confirms that the large rises of deaths in recent days have been expected and reiterates deaths are expected to continue to rise. On whether further social distancing measures have been modelled, Jenrick says he hopes the current policies will be sufficient. The restrictive measures the UK has imposed have been largely respected, Jenrick says, after people met en masse in parks last weekend before the new orders were made. There is a moral obligation upon everyone, including young people who think they are invincible, to protect others, the minister adds. This is a moving target, Harries clarifies, saying there is a time lag between reporting of people becoming symptomatic and deteriorating. We actually anticipate our numbers will get worse over the next week, possibly two, she adds, then we will see if we have managed to push the curve down. There may be a few months on the way, she says. Jenrick extends his sympathies to the family of Amged El-Hawrani. He says Boris Johnson will write to the British people this week saying that we all have the power to influence the course of events. \u201cIf we want to protect people\u2019s lives \u2026 then we need to take heed of the medical advice,\u201d he repeats. Harries says she would not usually comment on individual cases but his death is worrying and extends her condolences to his family. \u201cIt is in no one\u2019s interest that we lose our colleagues on the frontline and we really want to support them,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a disease like this, we need to remember it\u2019s not just the NHS or a family \u2026 This will affect all of us. We should not take this as a signal to the NHS.\u201d She adds that new guidance will be issued shortly for people working in essential services. Harries confirms the government will review the lockdown measures in three weeks, but says it will take three to six months to see if the policies have \u201csquashed\u201d the virus. \u201cAs a population we have evidence we are getting better at [social distancing],\u201d she adds. \u201cWe need another couple of weeks to see that through.\u201d She says that there will be further uncertainty and does not confirm when the lockdown will end. Asked what the current forecast for the pandemic is, after Boris Johnson said the UK would turn the tide within 12 weeks a fortnight ago, Jenrick says: Nobody is pretending that this will be over in a few weeks ... But if we all play our part and follow the medical advice we can turn the tide of this virus. Harries adds that this is a \u201cmoving feast\u201d and that Johnson had noted the modelling at the time. She said she hopes the UK will indeed have turned the tide by the date he cited. Please call your elderly neighbours before you go shopping to help them get their groceries, he adds before taking questions from journalists remotely. Care packages sent out already included tea, biscuits and tinned goods, and thousands more will be delivered to those who cannot get their groceries, Jenrick says. A new phone number will be on a letter that vulnerable people will soon receive to help support them, he says, imploring the millions of most vulnerable to remain home for 12 weeks. We will not stop until we have got you the equipment you need, Jenrick proclaims. We\u2019ve established the national supply distribution response team, he says, supported by the armed forces, to work around the clock to deliver the equipment to those who need it most. This includes: 170m masks 42.8m gloves 13.7m aprons 182,000 gowns Almost 10m items of cleaning equipment 2.3m eye protectors These are being delivered to GP surgeries, dentists, pharmacies, community providers, along with hospitals and care homes. One issue, he says, is the provision of PPE. \u201cWe simply cannot and should not ask people to be on the frontline without the right protective equipment,\u201d he concedes. Strategic coordination centres will be set up across the country led by gold commanders from the emergency services to lead communities through the challenging period - from Cornwall to Cumbria \u2013 with members of the armed forces embedded within these teams to plan local response to the virus. He announces he has put in place across the country measures to put the country on emergency footing, an unprecedented step in peacetime, he says. Jenrick confirms there have been 127,737 tests, with 108,215 testing negative and 19,522 testing positive. Of those who have contracted the virus, 1,228 have died, he said. The virus is indiscriminate, Jenrick added, calling for people to stay home. The press conference has now begun. Last night 63-year-old Adil El Tayar, an organ transplant specialist, became the first working NHS surgeon to die from coronavirus. He died on Wednesday at West Middlesex university hospital in London, his family said. The doctor, who had worked around the world, spent his final days volunteering on the frontlines against the outbreak in an A&amp;E department in the Midlands. NHS England appear to have sought to draw a distinction between El Tayar, who was not a frontline healthcare worker, and El-Hawrani, in their announcement that the latter was the first frontline hospital worker to die from coronavirus. The government\u2019s daily press conference is due to begin shortly, convened by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, alongside Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. NHS England have said El-Hawrani is the first confirmed hospital frontline worker to die after testing positive for coronavirus. Prof Stephen Powis, NHS national medical director, said: My deepest condolences are with Amged\u2019s family at this extremely sad time. The NHS is a family and we all feel deeply the loss of any of our colleagues, as we all continue to unite and work together to tackle the spread of coronavirus, I know that the whole of the NHS and the public we serve will want to extend our sympathies to the El-Hawrani family. Nobody can be in any doubt about the scale of the challenge we face with this virus, and Amged\u2019s death is not just an individual human tragedy but a stark reminder to the whole country that we all must take this crisis seriously, which means everyone abiding by the government\u2019s clear instructions to stay indoors, self-isolate, keep strictly to social distancing advice and practise good hygiene, which means washing hands more often and for longer. The advice issued by government and the health service can be the difference between life and death, so this is everybody\u2019s chance to be a lifesaver. A spokesman for El-Hawrani\u2019s paid tribute to him: Amged was a loving and much-loved husband, son, father, brother, and friend. His greatest passions were his family and his profession, and he dedicated his life to both. He was the rock of our family, incredibly strong, compassionate, caring and giving. He always put everyone else before himself. We all turned to him when we needed support and he was always there for us. He had so many responsibilities and yet he never complained. Amged reached the very top of his profession and we know he made a difference to thousands of lives during his career. He viewed his role as a doctor as one of life\u2019s most noble pursuits. He was also a leader, who educated many doctors who have subsequently become ENT consultants. We are incredibly proud of the legacy he has left behind and all that he has achieved. We would like to thank all those involved in his care for their kindness and compassion during his illness. They worked tirelessly for their patient, as he would have done for his own. Losing Amged is devastating for our family. Life without him is impossible to imagine but together, we will do all we can to honour his memory and live how he would have wanted us to. El-Hawrani\u2019s son Ashraf said: Most of my dad\u2019s time was dedicated towards his family, and the rest of that time was dedicated towards his profession. He taught me the significance of respect and equality. He also stressed the importance of not worrying about the things I cannot control, which he displayed to me right up until the end of his life. He did not seek the praise and approval of others, he was satisfied by viewing the positive effects of his actions and the wellbeing of his family. I am incredibly proud to say that for 18 years of my life, Amged El-Hawrani was my father. Amged El-Hawrani\u2019s colleagues have paid tribute to the ENT consultant who died at Leicester Royal Infirmary on Saturday evening after testing positive for Covid-19. Gavin Boyle, chief executive at University Hospitals of Derby and Burton (UHDB), said: Mr El-Hawrani, known to his colleagues as Amged, was an extremely hard working consultant and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) trainer who was well liked at the Trust and particularly at Queen\u2019s Hospital Burton where he worked. Amged played a leading role in the merger between the hospitals in Burton and Derby and helped bring the two clinical teams together. He was keen to support colleagues outside of ENT and was well known across a wide number of departments. He was known for his dedication and commitment to his patients. He had also raised funds for the hospitals, including climbing in the Himalayas with a group of friends some years ago. The whole UHDB family are desperately saddened at losing Amged who was such a valued and much loved colleague. On behalf of everyone here at UHDB, including our patients and the communities we serve, I would like to offer our sincere condolences to his family. We would also like to thank our colleagues at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust for their professionalism and the compassionate care they have shown for Amged and his family. Interesting graph published earlier by the FT showing that the growth rate in new cases is beginning to slow. Consultant Amged El-Hawrani, 55, who had tested positive for coronavirus, has died at Leicester Royal Infirmary, University Hospitals of Derby and Burton has said. Low-paid women are at high risk of exposure to coronavirus as they are more likely to be in jobs such as social care, nursing and pharmacy, a study has found. Out of 3.2 million workers employed in the highest-risk roles, about 2.5 million are women, according to Autonomy, an economics thinktank. As many as a million of those workers \u2013 who are considered to be at highest risk because they normally work closely with the public and people with diseases and infections \u2013 are also among the lowest paid, according to the study. A 108-year-old woman and survivor of the 1918 Spanish flu is thought to have become the oldest victim of coronavirus in the UK. Hilda Churchill died in a Salford care home on Saturday, hours after testing positive for Covid-19 and just eight days before her 109th birthday. She is the oldest victim of the virus to be named in the UK. She was born in 1911, the year before the Titanic sank and three years before the start of the first world war. It was also seven years before the Spanish flu pandemic, which infected 500 million worldwide and killed her sister. The coronavirus pandemic had prompted Churchill to reminisce about the Spanish flu, according to her grandson, Anthony Churchill. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: As I was telling her about this coronavirus she started talking about the Spanish flu and she remembered how bad that was. Moles are daring to clamber above ground to hunt for worms, oystercatchers are nesting on deserted beaches, and overlooked plants such as ivy-leaved toadflax are gaining new friends. The shutdown of modern life as we know it is liberating British wildlife to enjoy newly depopulated landscapes. But conservationists say the impact is not all positive, with wildlife crimes going unreported and vital work including monitoring unable to be carried out. Jake Fiennes, the conservation manager of the 9,600-acre Holkham national nature reserve, the biggest in England, said: We have annual visitor numbers in excess of one million and suddenly, in the peak of breeding season, they are not going to be here. Nature is just going \u2018ahhh, it\u2019s all to ourselves now. The Labour deputy leadership candidate Richard Burgon has claimed criticism of China\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak by minister\u2019s represents a \u201cTrump-style\u201d ploy to distract from government failures. Questioned about the limited extent of testing in the UK earlier, the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said some of the signals coming out of China were not clear about \u201cthe scale, the nature, the infectiousness\u201d. The former Tory party leader Iain Duncan Smith meanwhile highlighted a delay to China\u2019s coronavirus reporting and accused states of \u201ckow-towing\u201d to China to secure trade deals, while the Mail on Sunday quoted a senior government source saying a \u201creckoning\u201d would follow the crisis. The paper also quoted an anonymous cabinet minister as saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t stand by and allow the Chinese state\u2019s desire for secrecy to ruin the world\u2019s economy and then come back like nothing has happened.\u201d Tweeting overnight as the Mail on Sunday published its front page, Burgon said: Sturgeon also said the Scottish parliament would meet for one day this week to consider and, she hopes, pass emergency legislation specifically for Scotland. This would include legislation to ensure no one can be evicted during the coronavirus crisis. Amongst a number of other things that legislation will ensure that no one can be evicted from their home during this crisis. It will increase to six months in most cases the minimum period of notice a landlord must give to a tenant before eviction. The legislation will apply to tenants in both the private sector and the social housing sector and will provide all tenants with additional security at what is an immensely difficult time. We expect to publish the emergency legislation and introduce it to parliament on Tuesday and parliament will then have the opportunity to consider it on Wednesday. The announcement comes after Labour and renters\u2019 campaign groups accused the UK government of breaking its promise to protect people from evictions during the coronavirus epidemic after emergency legislation tabled on Monday evening only extended the notice period that landlords must give tenants before they can evict them from two months to three. Bit of a row ensuing on Twitter between the health minister Nadine Dorries \u2013 who has been isolating due to being infected with Covid \u2013 and Sky News correspondents. TLDR: Dorries objected to Beth Rigby\u2019s suggestion that the contraction of coronavirus by Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock showed that the UK\u2019s approach to the pandemic was flawed. Sturgeon also revealed that 95 people were in intensive care on Saturday night with either confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Meanwhile, she announced that a new volunteer campaign named Scotland Cares will launch tomorrow to allow people to register to volunteer during the pandemic, following the establishment of similar NHS initiative by the UK government. Hull Trains is to temporarily suspend all its services from Monday as a result of \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d to safeguard the future of the business, the company has announced. Nicola Sturgeon has thanked people for staying home despite the occasional sunshine as she noted the rapid growth in the number of cases in Scotland. The first minister acknowledged that the rise in confirmed cases was putting pressure on NHS and care services. An area of concern which I know has been expressed in recent days is around the provision of personal protective equipment for those on the frontline. I can confirm today some new steps to improve even further the supply of PPE ... Over the past four to six weeks, around 34m items of PPE have been delivered to hospitals across Scotland. All health boards now have a single point of contact to manage PPE supply and distribution. This should help ensure the right people receive the correct equipment, she added. Eight weeks of PPE will be delivered to GP surgeries from tomorrow and should arrive by the end of the week, while additional staff are being employed to help deliver PPE to the care sector. However, Sturgeon did not elaborate on the amount of equipment care homes should expect to receive. Derbyshire police said they broke up a \u201cmassive party\u201d on Saturday night involving 25 adults and children. Meanwhile, police in Northern Ireland are to target tourist sites and visitor locations to ensure compliance with social-distancing rules, the chief constable has said. People who repeatedly fail to comply with officer requests to disperse could face fines up to \u00a3960 under new emergency regulations agreed by the Stormont Executive. The measures, which came into force at 11pm on Saturday, also provide for fines up to \u00a35,000 for businesses not adhering to the new rules around closures and implementation of social-distancing practices. For readers noticing the slight discrepancy between the UK death toll figures and those announced by the constituent nations\u2019 health authorities, we are looking into it and will keep you posted. On a day where the government has sought to make clear the importance of testing, Sky News\u2019 Joe Pike makes an important point. One more person has died after testing positive for coronavirus in Scotland, taking the total there to 41, the Scottish government has announced. The UK\u2019s total includes 190 deaths in England, NHS England said in a statement. The patients were aged between 39 and 105. All but for of them had underlying health problems. The four that did not have heath problems were aged between 57 and 87. The NHS figures also reveal that London hospital continue to be the worst hit. Of the 190 deaths in England, 15 were at Barts Health trust, five each were at Chelsea and Westminster and Imperial College, six were at King\u2019s College, seven at Lewisham and Greenwich, and 10 at the Royal Free. The worst hit hospitals outside London were: Portsmouth, University Hospitals Birmingham, and Mid Essex all with seven deaths; Worcestershire Acute Hosptials with six; and Epsom and St Helier with five. The UK\u2019s latest death toll includes six more fatalities in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 21 deaths. Northern Ireland\u2019s department for health, also announced that a further 86 patients have tested positive out of a total of 742. The UK death toll from coronavirus has increased by 209 people in the last 24 hours bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228 so far. The figure was fewer than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260, which may bring some hope that the rise in deaths could stabilise soon. The Department of Health and Social Care also said 19,522 have now tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. Ten more people have died from coronavirus in Wales, taking the country\u2019s total to 48. Dr Giri Shankar, the incident director for the coronavirus outbreak response at Public Health Wales, said: 148 new cases have tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19) in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 1241, although the true number of cases is likely to be higher. 10 further deaths have been reported to us of people who had tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19), taking the number of deaths in Wales to 48. We offer our condolences to families and friends affected, and we ask those reporting on the situation to respect patient confidentiality. The UK\u2019s biological security strategy, published in 2018 to address the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser. Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, told the Guardian that a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled. The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election. Police in Northern Ireland are to target tourist sites and visitor locations to ensure compliance with physical distancing rules, the chief constable has said, PA reports. People who repeatedly fail to comply with officer requests to disperse could face fines up to \u00a3960 under new emergency regulations agreed by the Stormont Executive. The measures, which came into force at 11pm on Saturday, also provide for fines up to 5,000 for businesses not adhering to the new rules around closures and implementation of social-distancing practices. Northern Ireland was the last part of the UK to develop regulations flowing from new powers secured through legislation passed at Westminster earlier in the week. Fifteen people with Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland. The new regulations include a list of which type of business premises should close during the current clampdown on public life, and which can continue operating as an essential service. Police Service of Northern Ireland Chief Constable Simon Byrne set out the police\u2019s approach to using the new enforcement powers on coronavirus restrictions. He said: \u201cOfficers will apply their discretion and will ask questions to establish individual circumstances. We will instruct people to return home if they do not have a reasonable excuse to be out of their house.\u201d Byrne said officers would be targeting popular tourism locations and visitor spots to ensure people were not gathering. (This is Matthew Weaver standing in for Mattha Busby while he takes a break). North Somerset council is making an \u201curgent plea\u201d for protective equipment as care workers across the area are forced to work without it due to supplies \u201cdrying up\u201d. The council has appealed to local schools, colleges and businesses with such items to help \u201cbridge the gap\u201d until new stocks reach the south west, expected to be on 6 April. Mike Bell, the council\u2019s deputy leader and executive member for adult social care, said: Our care homes and community care workers are desperate. We need basic items such as masks, disposable gloves, aprons and hand sanitiser. Please, if you have them stored away, and don\u2019t have an immediate care-related need, get in touch. You will help save lives. The peak of the coronavirus is dependent on people\u2019s actions and the lockdown will remain in place for a \u201csignificant period\u201d, Michael Gove said (see 10.01am). I can\u2019t make an accurate prediction, but everyone does have to prepare for a significant period when these measures are still in place. On his broadcast round, Gove appeared to lay the blame for the UK\u2019s lack of mass testing on China, raising the prospect of increased diplomatic tension between the two countries. Asked why Britain did not have sufficient testing, despite the first case in China being known about in December, Gove said some of reporting from China was not clear about the scale of the disease. The move appears to be part of a concerted attempt from No 10 to shift responsibility for the pandemic, and the UK\u2019s apparent inability to adequately respond, eastwards (see 11.16am). The Cabinet Office minister did not provide any assurance as to when all health and social care staff \u2013 who number well over a million \u2013 would be tested. He simply told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI hope that we will be able to test as many frontline workers at the earliest possible stage.\u201d The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called for mass testing to end the coronavirus lockdown as quickly as possible. The success that countries such as South Korea and Germany have had in using mass testing to curb the spread of the virus should serve as an example, he said (see 9.10am). Rebecca Long-Bailey said it was unacceptable for self-employed workers to have to wait until June to be paid through the government\u2019s support scheme and she suggested the health of many others who are continuing to go to work was unnecessarily being put at risk. (see 9.44am) Labour MP and doctor Rosena Allin-Khan said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the UK\u2019s coronavirus advice was not in keeping with WHO guidance and she urged Boris Johnson to self-isolate for 14 days rather than seven (see 9.21am). Care home managers are refusing to accept elderly people discharged from NHS hospitals owing to coronavirus fears, and one has said government-issued protective equipment for residents and staff is \u201ccompletely useless\u201d. A shortage of midwives on NHS maternity units has doubled since the start of the outbreak, with one in five midwifery posts now unfilled, raising concerns about the safety of pregnant women, new mothers and newborn babies. A London doctor said that there will be no new staff for the Nightingale hospital and NHS staff will be asked to spread even further, describing the situation as \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul\u201d (see 11.02am), as the Royal College of Emergency Medicine said there was a \u201ccontinual stream\u2019 of Covid patients entering London hospitals (see 9.58am). The actor James McAvoy donated \u00a3275,000 to a crowdfunding campaign set up to by a group of doctors to raise money to buy vital protective equipment for NHS staff treating coronavirus. A man was arrested after deliberately coughing in the face of a paramedic, police have said. There have been a spate of similar incidents since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. Two-thirds of people in the UK want the government to request an extension to the Brexit transition period in order to focus on the coronavirus outbreak, polling commissioned by the cross-party campaign group Best for Britain and anti-racism group Hope Not Hate has suggested (see 11.43am). The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS combat Covid-19 has reached 750,000, two days after the target was increased after hitting the initial 250,000 goal within less than 24 hours, the Royal Voluntary Service has announced. This is today\u2019s most upvoted comment, from a reader named JohnTest who certainly does not mince his words. Hate to point out the obvious, but UK has not embarked on the testing campaign because it would rapidly become apparent that we do not have the capacity. That would then lead to awkward questions about the wisdom of running down a country\u2019s health service. Far better to divert with Dunkirk, mass volunteer campaigns and hand clapping nonsense. Meanwhile our loved ones that work in the NHS are being sent like lambs to the slaughter without protective gear. Those who have liberty but are isolating, meanwhile, are being instructed by people who are still working to cherish the moments they have with their family at this unprecedented time. In the past week four people in one wing alone at Harmondsworth immigration removal centre near Heathrow airport have been quarantined and there have been unconfirmed reports of one detainee there testing positive for Covid-19 and being released, according to the campaigning group Bail for Immigration Detainees. An online medical fetish store made news yesterday after it announced it had donated its entire stock of disposable scrubs to an NHS hospital. Later, the company said the real heroes were NHS staff and dismissed claims they had not gifted the uniforms to the health service. We may be isolating and avoiding non-essential travel and contact, but the coronavirus lockdown presents a unique opportunity to attract wildlife to your doorstep. Here\u2019s how: During the fine weather of the past week or so, my garden has been alive with the sounds of spring. From my office window I can hear the metallic wheezing of a greenfinch, the metronomic sound of a chiffchaff calling out its name, trilling wrens, repetitive song thrushes, tuneful robins, and just now, a quartet of ravens high in the sky overhead, uttering their deep, croaking call. And this is not just at dawn and dusk \u2013 the traditional peak times for birdsong \u2013 but all day long. If you have never tried to attract birds to your garden, it\u2019s easier than you think. Just as we humans need food, drink and accommodation, so do they. So your mission \u2013 should you choose to accept it \u2013 is to create the avian equivalent of a five-star hotel and restaurant. Earlier, Michael Gove said there would be an opportunity to learn the lessons from the government\u2019s widely criticised approach to the coronavirus pandemic once it is over (see 10.17am). But an inquiry already appears to be under way within the medical community. Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said coronavirus testing for NHS \u201cshould have happened sooner\u201d after healthcare workers began to be tested en masse this weekend. She told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge: Well, I believe it should have happened sooner but we are where we are and we need it now so nurses are, everyday they are carrying out services to patients, they are giving treatment to patients and they will be last than one metre away so they particularly need to know whether the person they are dealing with, whether they themselves, test positive for coronavirus so that they can take time, the appropriate time off but also protect themselves and their families. Care home managers are refusing to accept elderly people discharged from NHS hospitals owing to coronavirus fears, and one has said government-issued protective equipment for residents and staff is \u201ccompletely useless\u201d. David Steedman, the manager of Arlington House care home in Sussex, said he had five empty rooms but he was not taking in people discharged from hospital as it would be \u201cmadness\u201d to expose residents and staff to the risk of infection. Senior local government figures last night urged the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to \u201cmove faster\u201d and provide protective equipment for all social care workers to ensure their safety. Currently, available stocks are in some cases unfit for purpose, the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services said. We have been sent pictures of PPE that is used, dirty and damaged. This cannot and will not be used. Earlier, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said it was unacceptable for self-employed workers to have to wait until June to be paid through the government\u2019s support scheme (see 9.44am). And she suggested the health of many others who are continuing to go to work was unnecessarily being put at risk. Now, there are workers right across the country this week who have been going to construction sites, warehouses, call centres, where their health is being put at significant risk and the government now needs to be very clear about what non-essential and essential work is and to make sure those workers are at home if they are not providing an essential function and that they are financially protected. Certainly where we see the pictures that we\u2019ve seen this week in warehouses and building sites, where workers are on top of each other and we hear reports, every single MP across the country will have had reports about workers who are frightened because they know that their colleagues have gone home sick with suspected coronavirus. She added that an announcement on the outcome of the Labour leadership contest, in which she is a contender, would be made remotely. I think we\u2019re trying to deal with these strange times and have an announcement on the leadership contest that our members and the public can view from their homes really. It is logistically quite challenging and we\u2019ve all been asked to do this victory speech so that it can be sent out over the airways as quickly as possible after we win. I haven\u2019t done mine yet by the way! It is going to be a bit bizarre, yes. The actor James McAvoy has donated \u00a3275,000 to a crowdfunding campaign set up to by a group of doctors to raise money to buy vital protective equipment for NHS staff treating coronavirus. One of the medics behind the project, Dr Salaj Masand, said: We are overwhelmed and speechless at the trust and faith people have put into us to deliver this. The number of very generous donations from everyone doubled our target within three days. Loss of taste and smell is being added to the list symptoms for coronavirus, according to ITV\u2019s Paul Brand. Only by implementing carefully controlled programmes that use two very different Covid-19 test kits will it be possible to predict how the disease will affect the country, researchers have said. To locate those in the first category \u2013 the newly infected \u2013 medical staff need to use a polymerase chain reaction test, which can find viral particles on a person. The test locates a particular coronavirus gene sequence and creates multiple copies that can then be easily detected. Andrew Preston, of Bath University, said that the PCR test was in itself very effective for detecting the virus but that that efficacy was dependent on how well healthcare workers took samples from patients, from the nose and the back of the throat. If a virus is not picked up on the swab, the result will be negative. Thus, how effectively the swab is taken, and the amount of virus present at the sampling sites, will determine whether the virus is detected from an infected person. Prof Adam Finn, of Bristol University, said: Testing people across the country to find if they have been infected by Covid-19 will tell us precisely how the disease is behaving. This will create certainty about where we stand and about the measures we need to take to limit the spread of the virus. At present we are in the dark. That should stop once we get the antibody test up and running. A man has been arrested after deliberately coughing in the face of a paramedic, police have said. The ambulance service was called just before 11pm on Saturday to a man in Stroud, Gloucestershire, who was feeling unwell. A spokeswoman for Gloucestershire police said: They attended an address where another man who was self-isolating allegedly deliberately coughed in the face of one of the paramedics. The man, a 43-year-old, was arrested, charged and remanded for assaulting an emergency worker by way of coughing and threatening GBH by infecting with Covid-19. His arrest follows a spate of similar incidents since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. Earlier this morning the fitness instructor Joe Wicks was on the BBC discussing his online physical education sessions. Here is his 10-minute home workout for seniors: LBC\u2019s political editor, Theo Usherwood, who has now recovered from coronavirus, has paid tribute to NHS staff for saving his life. The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, has responded to Michael Gove\u2019s suggestion earlier that \u201csome of the reporting from China was not clear about the nature, the scale, the infectiousness\u201d of coronavirus. He said: The evidence this was a serious virus was well documented through January into February. We need to understand precisely how ministers were responding, rather than feeble excuses that they didn\u2019t know. Going forward, every effort must be made, nationally and internationally, to ensure that we are in the best possible position to provide medical care as the number of cases grows. Polling commissioned by the cross-party campaign group Best for Britain and anti-racism group Hope Not Hate has suggested that almost two-thirds of people in the UK want the government to request an extension to the Brexit transition period in order to focus on the coronavirus outbreak. The Focaldata poll of 2,022 people showed 64% of people agreed with the statement \u201cThe government should request an extension to the transition period in order to focus properly on the coronavirus\u2019, while 36% agreed with the statement \u201cThe Brexit transition period must end on 31 December whether a deal has been fixed or not\u201d. Best for Britain\u2019s call for an extension to the transition period has been echoed by numerous bodies and pressure groups, including the Scottish and Welsh governments. The same poll also found that 65% of people wished the government to seek membership of the EU early warning and response system for medical emergencies, amid reported reluctance within No 10 to remain a member. Best for Britain\u2019s CEO, Naomi Smith, said: It\u2019s simply not reasonable to expect we will have tied up negotiations with the EU by the end of the year while dealing with a warlike emergency. Nor is it desirable. Most people just want the government to get on with the job at hand so that lives can be saved and normality restored as quickly as possible. The country is simply not in a place to weather two storms at the moment. Hope Not Hate\u2019s CEO, Nick Lowles, said: EU schemes like the early warning and response system and the ventilator procurement programme are critical tools for responding to this urgent public health crisis. The government must put politics aside and urgently seek participation in these schemes. It would be foolhardy for ideology to get in the way of practical measures to keep people safe. Ramping up testing should be a national priority, the Labour MP David Lammy has said. Meanwhile, this Sunday Telegraph report of a pandemic trial run in 2017 that was not followed up with extra funding is continuing to do the rounds on Twitter. A woman in hospital with suspected Covid-19 has said she has been moved to a ward with vulnerable patients. Delia Colwill, from Berkshire, was taken into hospital on Tuesday, six days after she first began showing symptoms of the coronavirus. The 47-year-old suffers from a spinal cord injury that affects her nervous system and has chronic pain. She said the virus had \u201cabsolutely knocked me sideways\u201d and she had been tested for coronavirus, receiving mixed results with one positive and one negative. She told the PA news agency: I\u2019m not sure what to believe. I\u2019ve suddenly been moved to a general ward with very vulnerable patients and I have no mask, nothing and I still have a virus. I\u2019m not sure what to make of the testing and the situation honestly because I\u2019ve had five doctors say it\u2019s Covid-19, one confirmed test positive and now a negative. Her symptoms have varied from \u201chorrific head pain and sinus pain that feels like my brain is exploding out of my skull\u201d to blackout headaches and intense sweats, while she has also suffered from a loss of appetite and sense of taste. She has now been in the hospital for five days and said staff looking after her were exhausted by the influx of new patients. The Mail on Sunday today reported that No 10 is furious over China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its initial underreporting of the crisis, but as my colleague Peter Walker notes, it is worth highlighting how the government is seeking to shift blame before the pandemic peaks. A London doctor has said that there will be no new staff for the Nightingale hospital and NHS staff will be asked to spread even further, describing the situation as \u201crobbing Peter to pay Paul\u201d. Speaking to the Guardian they gave an account of what the medics are saying about the new hospital space in the Excel centre. It was all framed as if there would be a cavalry coming of newly up-skilled doctors, doctors from other regions, those out of retirement to staff it. But it is becoming more clear there is not a cavalry but just more space for us to spread into, but with the same number of staff.\u201d The more I see official policies and documents for it I know every single name on a document or email ... We have a world leading network of critical care in London and it is the same names and faces who, in addition to running their own hospitals at surge capacity, are also expecting to provide cover equipment and staff to Excel. We need to be clear that this is not something that is coming to save London hospitals. This is a sign we will have to surge past any surge done so far. The doctor said that they were trying to make more space and there was likely to be a criteria for those treated at the Nightingale. One of the issues is medical wards are now all full of covid patients who don\u2019t need intensive care so we cannot step down patients to medical wards as they are near surge capacity too. At what level do you want surge capacity for extra beds - do you want them to be intubated intensive care beds? Or people who are on a tiny bit of oxygen? Do you want it to be for patients who have appendicitis who happen to get sick during all of this? There will be criteria for getting into the Nightingale but think it will be more about whether you are safe to be at a facility that does not have the depth of specialty backup. At first the Nightingale felt like a great idea as though a bunch of people would come to run it but now we have realised it is robbing Peter to pay Paul and it felt more like a publicity stunt. As they have been filling in the Nightingale and more concrete plans are coming out ... we are seeing leadership consultants we really admire moving over there and everyone is starting to realise there is not a cavalry we are the same team and stretch to cover this but maybe that is good and mean safer care across London. Following his round of broadcast interviews, it is now clear that Michael Gove did not provide any assurance as to when all health and social care staff \u2013 who number well over a million \u2013 would be tested. If 25,000 are tested a day \u2013 which is the government\u2019s intention after it succeeded in testing 10,000 per day during a trial over the weekend \u2013 then that would take 40 days for the first million workers. The Cabinet Office minister simply told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI hope that we will be able to test as many frontline workers at the earliest possible stage.\u201d Some hospitals are \u201cbending the rules\u201d over the provision of protective gear for healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients, the Royal College of Nursing chair has said. Many smaller producers and retailers will struggle during the lockdown, but the challenge is especially acute for those on Scotland\u2019s islands, where ferry travel is now limited to essential trips only. The new website isle20.com aims to bring customers to smaller island companies, offering everything from hampers of Scottish tablet made on Skye, Orkney rum and seaweed-based cosmetics from Colonsay. Isle 20 was set up by Rhoda Meek, who runs the Tiree Tea company. She said: Lots of wee makers rely completely on tourism. Most local post offices are running their own safety measures. We\u2019re conscious of not overloading the local post service, so we\u2019re trying to be mindful of that but we\u2019re not Amazon warehouse ... if we get one order a day we\u2019re delighted. Tiree, in the Inner Hebrides, has a few suspected cases and the community has been practising physical distancing: On the one hand, we\u2019re used to being quite isolated, and we\u2019re very used to looking out for each other, making sure people get to the shops and so on. But what is absolutely counter to the Hebridean way is not going into people\u2019s homes, or stopping for a chat. The number of people who have volunteered to help the NHS combat Covid-19 has reached 750,000, two days after the target was increased after hitting the initial 250,000 goal within less than 24 hours, the Royal Voluntary Service has announced. The drive will now be temporarily paused to enable the RVS to process the applications and work together with the NHS to get the volunteers up and running. The RVS chief executive, Catherine Johnstone, said: We have been absolutely overwhelmed by the response and cannot thank the public enough. As history shows, it is often in times of crisis that we pull together and become our best selves. The chief nursing officer for England, Ruth May, said: I want to thank each and every one of the 750,000 people who have committed their precious time to help some of the most vulnerable people stay home and save lives. Coronavirus is an unprecedented global health emergency and your generosity and goodwill offers every one of us some light at the end of the tunnel. The former prime minister Tony Blair has said a point will need to be reached where a \u2018very large\u2019 proportion of the population is tested for coronavirus. He echoed the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt in calling for mass testing: The Labour former health secretary Andy Burnham has said the government is getting \u201cmost things right\u201d but has called for the lockdown to be extended. Speaking to BBC Politics England, he said: There are some places open that really shouldn\u2019t be. Because workers in those places can\u2019t observe the two metre distancing. The environment doesn\u2019t help, the handrails, the door handles, the surface tops. There are some workplaces, I think, that are still contributing to the spread of the virus and I\u2019d like to see a clearer ruling on that. I\u2019ve received 300 complaints from 150 businesses from people saying that they can\u2019t safely distance. And that is giving them a lot of concern because they are going home after working to their families. Gove has apologised to a company that said it did not receive a reply from the government after offering to procure ventilators for the NHS. An NHS supplier in Nantwich said that in the international market it had found 25,000 ventilators that it could have procured for the government. However, the supplier said that having asked the government if it wanted the ventilators, it did not get a reply. Gove told Marr: I\u2019m very sorry if that company says that it didn\u2019t get a reply, I\u2019ll investigate as soon as I\u2019ve stopped talking to you [Andrew Marr]. It is the case that for companies that have got in touch with the government those offers of help have been forwarded to the relevant people in the NHS and in other aspects of government in order to make sure we secure those supplies. If that company wants to get in touch directly with me, we\u2019ll investigate, because there have been some cases where people had hoped they might be able to help, but in fact the material that they produce has not met the NHS specifications, it\u2019s not what\u2019s required in order to save lives, but we have been following up every single lead presented to us. Gove said there was \u201ccommunication confusion\u201d after the government missed the deadline to join an EU scheme to get extra ventilators. Downing Street said this week that the UK had decided to pursue its own scheme rather than joining the EU\u2019s procurement scheme. However, a No 10 spokesman said that officials did not get emails inviting the UK to join and that it could join future schemes. Gove told Marr: There was some confusion over our involvement in that scheme, but I\u2019ve talked to senior figures in the NHS and they\u2019ve reassured me that there is nothing that we can\u2019t do as an independent nation that being part of that scheme would have allowed us to do.\u201d Asked whether an email was received by the government, he said: There was some communication confusion, I don\u2019t know all the details of that, but I do know having talked to senior figures in the NHS that there\u2019s nothing that participating in that scheme would have allowed us to do that we have not been able to do ourselves. On Sky, Gove said there was an \u201cincreased level of infection\u201d and an \u201cincreased level of mortality\u201d to come for the UK The models are projections and of course we adjust our action on the basis of behaviour, on the basis of data, on the basis of facts, on the basis of science but people should, as the prime minister\u2019s letter today absolutely underlines and recognises, that the situation will get worse before it gets better and that is why it is so important that all of us play our part. It is also why it is so inspiring that those leading the NHS have been able to increase capacity, increase the number of beds available and ensure that we can be in the best position to deal with the increased level of infection and, indeed, the increased level of mortality that is coming. He said the NHS now had just over 8,000 ventilators, with another 8000 to come including from abroad, and potentially 10,000 more from a deal with Dyson Well, we have available to the NHS now just over 8000 ventilators. That\u2019s because we\u2019ve repurposed some of the intensive care capacity that we have in the NHS, it\u2019s also the case that Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS, has done a deal with the private sector in order to increase ventilator capacity available to the NHS, and we are going to get another 8000 or so ventilators, including some of which have been sourced from abroad, which have come in here from other countries, and of course we are increasing our capacity to manufacture ventilators in the UK. As you\u2019ll be aware, we have done a deal with Dyson, which means provided all the appropriate tests are passed, we can have an additional 10,000 ventilators from that source and there are other companies, from Maclaren to Rolls Royce and others, who are changing the way in which they manufacture, in order to join in the national effort to increase the ventilator capacity available. Gove said the UK had been ordering coronavirus tests for the last month and suggested criticism of the government\u2019s approach should be made once the coronavirus pandemic was over. Asked why the UK had not mass-tested like Germany and was not \u201chunting\u201d down Covid-19 patients like the World Health Organization has urged, he said: Its certainly the case the Germans have had success in testing. There are other countries that are also ramping up testing. But the acceleration here in the UK is significant. If one looks at a league table ... then the UK is rising up that. But frankly, the most important thing is not to look backwards but forwards and do everything to increase the number of tests. Once this epidemic is over there will be an opportunity to look back and learn the lessons. Some more lines from Gove\u2019s interview, in which he said that a \u201cwalk of up to an hour\u201d would be appropriate for most people as their daily exercise during the lockdown, depending on their level of fitness. Michael Gove has said the peak of the coronavirus is dependent on people\u2019s actions and that the lockdown will remain in place for a significant period. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme, the Cabinet Office minister said: It\u2019s difficult to know precisely [when the UK hit the peak of the coronavirus outbreak]. It depends on the action all of us take. if we practice the social distancing measures. If we follow the rules the government has outlined, if we follow that good scientific advice, then we can delay the infection rate and that gives our NHS the chance to become more resilient. So, the date of the peak depends on all of our behaviour. It\u2019s not a fixed point, a date in the calendar like Easter, it is something that all of us can affect by our actions. He added that the public must prepare for a \u201csignificant period\u201d of lockdown. Everyone is making a sacrifice and I appreciate the scale of that sacrifice. But the reason all of us are making these sacrifices is because all of us will have people whom we love who are at risk from this virus. I can\u2019t make an accurate prediction, but everyone does have to prepare for a significant period when these measures are still in place. Dr Katherine Henderson, a consultant at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals and president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, has blamed supply chain issues for the lack of PPE and said none of her staff had yet been tested for coronavirus. We are seeing a continual stream of patients into London hospital who have got coronavirus. London is very busy, its got a lot of critical care capacity ... but obviously some places see a surge and we have to make arrangements. Asked if testing was starting to happen, she said six members staff who were off sick with symptoms and that 10 had been self-isolating. There\u2019s no question we are really keen to get staff testing up and running so that we can get these very key people back to work. We haven\u2019t started testing staff particularly but we are confident there will be a roll-out of that but the sooner that happens the better from our point of view. We have staff who are staying in local hotels who have identified that somebody is beginning to feel unwell at home and then they move out really rapidly. That\u2019s been helpful and that has worked but to get people tested to ensure that the index case is negative would be incredibly helpful. She added that hospitals were adapting their rotas to cope with high numbers of staff being off sick. People are talking about 20% and all of us have been doing staff plans working on the basis that 10%, 20%, 30% of staff could be off at any one time, and adapting rotas to make it possible to staff units.\u201d On the availability of personal protective equipment in hospitals, Henderson pointed to issues within the supply chain: The best thing that is going to happen is there\u2019s going to be some new guidance coming out in the next couple of days, which I think will relieve a lot of people\u2019s anxieties. We need to make sure frontline healthcare workers, social care, GPs, all have the appropriate kit they need to see patients. The Labour leadership contender Rebecca Long-Bailey has said the government must be \u201cvery clear\u201d about what is classed as essential work. There are workers right across the country this week who have been going to construction sites, warehouses, call-centres, where their health is being put at significant risk. The government needs to now be very clear about what non-essential and essential work is, and make sure those workers are at home if they\u2019re not providing an essential function and are financially protected. The Labour MP told Sky News that every politician across the country will have had reports about workers who are concerned that their fellow employees have suspected Covid-19 \u2013 from construction sites to call centres \u2013 and she called for non-essential workers to be furloughed. We know that people\u2019s lives are being put at significant risk and that places further pressure on the NHS further down the line. There\u2019s no excuse for those employers not to furlough those staff because the government scheme is being made available to provide 80% of their wages. She added that self-employed workers having to wait until June to be paid was not acceptable. Many self-employed people have to wait until June to receive a payout from this. That is not acceptable, when we see other countries, such as New Zealand, who will have similar schemes far quicker. We need the government to really, really make sure that resources are deployed into HMRC, so that those self-employed people who are eligible can access that cash as quickly as possible and aren\u2019t forced to go to work. A shortage of midwives on NHS maternity units has doubled since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, with one in five midwifery posts now unfilled, raising concerns about the safety of pregnant women, new mothers and newborn babies. The Royal College of Midwives is urging NHS leaders to ringfence maternity services as midwives are redeployed to care for people with Covid-19, fall sick themselves or are forced to self-isolate because of illness within their household. The former prime minister Tony Blair has echoed Jeremy Hunt in calling for mass testing, saying that a point will need to be reached where a \u201cvery large\u201d proportion of the entire population is tested for coronavirus. Your risk, obviously, is as you start to ease the lockdown, how do you then deal with any resurgence of the disease? This, of course, is what they\u2019re now dealing with in China and South Korea, and elsewhere. Unless you have that testing capability that you can apply at scale, and by the way when I say mass testing I mean I actually think you will need to get to the point where you\u2019ve got the capability, and I assume we\u2019re preparing for this now, of testing literally a very large proportion of the entire population. You may have to do those tests two or three different times because you need all the time to be able to track what\u2019s happening with the disease, to learn where, for example, there may be a surge or a hotspot of it, and take immediate action. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, the Labour MP, has called for NHS staff and social care workers to be given immediate access to testing. She told Sky News: These are the people who are at the front line, these are people who need to know whether or not they have the virus or not. So, if they feel better, if they\u2019re feeling poorly, they can return to work and keep working. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s entirely fair that senior politicians are having access to testing when frontline NHS staff, who are going in to work night shifts, day shifts, double shifts at the moment, can\u2019t get the tests that they need. And she warned that no single group of people are immune from coronavirus. We were hearing so often that it only really affects people over 70, it only really affects people that have underlying health conditions, and that\u2019s why I asked the prime minister in [PMQs] - why are the social distancing measures merely just suggestions? Because what we were seeing echoed on the NHS frontline was the fact that people were coming in who were young, fit and healthy. Of course, the majority of the patients will be older, those that actually require ventilation, but no single group of people are immune. On the UK\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 described by some observers as idiosyncratic \u2013 Allin-Khan said she was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the country\u2019s coronavirus advice was not in keeping with that of the WHO. They are saying that you can still be able to spread the virus long after your symptoms have resolved and they are actually saying that it is recommended that you stay self-isolated for 14 days. So, for senior politicians such as the prime minister and the health secretary to suggest that they will return to work after seven days is a real worry for people working in the health sector like myself, because we need to save lives and we need people to properly observe self-isolation processes. I would like Boris Johnson, the prime minister, to self-isolate for 14 days. Good morning, Welcome to our UK-focused coronavirus news live blog. We\u2019ll bring you developments as they happen after the UK recorded the highest single-day increase in deaths yesterday since the Covid outbreak began. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for mass testing to end the coronavirus lockdown as quickly as possible. The success that countries such as South Korea and Germany have had in using mass testing to curb the spread of the virus should serve as an example, he said. Just weeks after it was the second hardest-hit country in Asia, South Korea has dramatically slowed its infection rate, recording 105 new cases on Sunday. Meanwhile, Germany has carried out four times as many tests as the UK and recorded 342 deaths. Hunt said mass testing gave authorities greater clarity in identifying and containing potential outbreaks. Where you find it, you can isolate and contain it. And where you don\u2019t, vital services continue to function. With mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission. So far, only those who fit a rigid criteria can be tested for coronavirus, besides the most unwell patients. Testing for NHS and social care workers is now being rolled out after widespread criticism that healthcare workers were being forced to self-isolate at home due to mild symptoms such as a cough in case they have the virus. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told Sky News this morning that 10,000 healthcare workers were now being tested each day. We\u2019re going to move to get that up to 25,000 a day and we\u2019re doing all that we can to increase and to accelerate that, and I hope that we will be able to test as many frontline workers at the earliest possible stage. We\u2019ve been working, as I say, with scientists, with the big players in providing medical supplies and drugs, like Boots, and others, in order to increase the number of tests that we have.

The Derby West response section of the force tweeted: \u201cOfficers have just attended an address in absolute shock to find 25 adults and children having a massive party with speakers and karaoke.

Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon in South Wales, posted a picture of himself sitting on a chair outside his parents\u2019 London home, adhering to guidelines to stay two metres apart, as they marked the occasion with his wife, the former prime minister of Denmark, Helle Thorning-Schmidt. But officers from South Wales police, 150 miles away, rounded on him for the decision to go to see his family. It was the latest example of lockdown enforcement tactics deployed by police across the country, who have broken up parties, deterred motorists and walkers with drones and dyed a lake black to put off swimmers under strict physical distancing rules. In the tweet, with his parents sitting on their doorstep in the background, Stephen Kinnock wrote: South Wales police replied with: \u201cHello @SKinnock we know celebrating your Dad\u2019s birthday is a lovely thing to do, however this is not essential travel.

Critics said the police were overzealous in publicly criticising the MP, as others warned they could could lose the respect of the public. Don Morgan tweeted: \u201cThis looks very wrong ....focus on the big stuff \u2026 not trivia ... this will lose you public support at a time when it\u2019s really going to be needed.\u201d Walkies Cleo added: \u201cLooking after vulnerable relatives is indeed essential so well done Stephen. You delivered essential supplies, checked they were ok, all from a safe distance. @SWpolice you should be disgusted with your post, doing your force no favours and will lose all respect with public!!\u201d However, others agreed with South Wales police, saying the MP was setting a bad example to others. Bleddyn Dunn wrote: \u201cWhat\u2019s the travel distance? Why didn\u2019t you leave these \u2018supplies\u2019 at the door and leave. That\u2019s what most people are doing, including me for my Dad. I wished my Dad happy birthday over the phone on Thursday. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is irresponsible and breaks the regulations set out by the government. Essential supplies can be left on the doorstep, you don\u2019t need to take chairs along and photograph yourself. You should just take the L on this one\u201d, added Twitter user JC. The MP\u2019s sister, Rachel, could also face admonishment from police after she tweeted that she had visited her parents to deliver a \u201ccake, a crumble and a lamb curry!\u201d It comes as a 13-year-old boy was arrested and his mother was \u201cdealt with\u201d as police forces across the country were given new powers to detain people failing to comply with coronavirus lockdown rules. Ste Richardson, a senior section officer for West Yorkshire police, arrested the teenager under emergency legislation introduced on Thursday, which granted police powers to issue \u00a360 on-the-spot fines or make arrests for breaches of the UK\u2019s coronavirus rules. The officer, who is based in Leeds, said on social media the boy had refused to give him any details and he had had \u201cno choice\u201d but to arrest him. It is unclear how the child had broken the lockdown rules. In a now-deleted tweet, Richardson wrote: \u201cToday I arrested a 13 year old male under the new coronavirus powers. The male refused to give me any details so I could take him home under the Act. He was arrested and taken to custody. His mother was dealt with for being a responsible person failing to comply.\u201d Ken Marsh, the head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, has previously said that the parents of older teenagers should be forced to pay fines if they were caught ignoring government guidance. Elsewhere, a motorist was stopped by a motorway patrol on a 224-mile round trip to buy an item from eBay \u2013 with his wife in the boot, police said. The driver travelled from Coventry to collect the eBay purchase of windows in Salford, Greater Manchester, despite the public being warned only to make essential journeys due to the coronavirus pandemic. After they picked up his purchase in Salford, the driver\u2019s wife could not fit in the vehicle for the two-hour return journey south. She was travelling in the boot of the car when they were pulled over by a motorway patrol on the M6 in Cheshire, according to a tweet by the North West Motorway Police Twitter feed. Officers wrote out a traffic offence report for the driver. On Friday, Derbyshire police were criticised after releasing drone footage of walkers at a beauty spot along with the warning that such exercise did not constitute \u201cessential travel\u201d. At the weekend the same force took the step of dying the normally clear waters of a picturesque quarry near Buxton black in an attempt to deter people from visiting. In North Yorkshire police have been carrying out spot checks near Harrogate and said checkpoints could appear anywhere, any time. Roadblocks were also set up in Plymouth, Devon, while in Cornwall 150 vehicles were checked in Penzance, Hayle and St Ives. In Northern Ireland, police were preparing to target tourist sites and visitor locations, as they adopted new rules at 11pm on Saturday. Northern Ireland was the last part of the UK to develop regulations flowing from the new powers. Officers across the UK have issued fines less than 24 hours after new laws were brought into force, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council said. Those who ignore the tougher restrictions on movement could be hit with a \u00a360 fine initially \u2013 reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days \u2013 and another for \u00a3120 for a second offence. Fines could reach \u00a31,000-plus for repeat offenders. Derbyshire police said they broke up a \u201cmassive party\u201d on Saturday night involving 25 adults and children. The Derby West response section of the force tweeted: \u201cOfficers have just attended an address in absolute shock to find 25 adults and children having a massive party with speakers and karaoke. Everyone dispersed and hosts dealt with. It is clear people are still having complete disregard for the Government advice and rules.\u201d In Surrey, police broke up a house party in the Stanwell area, while in Cornwall walkers were criticised for ignoring lockdown advice and pouring into rural villages. A spokesperson for Devon and Cornwall police said they were receiving regular reports from people concerned about others flouting the lockdown rules with about five calls an hour since 10am on Saturday. Many forces have created hotlines to submit tip-offs about people allegedly flouting the social distancing rules, including gatherings of more than two people. West Midlands, Greater Manchester, and Avon and Somerset have also established online forums for those keen to report rule-breakers.",

But the exclusion of those who have become self-employed since the end of the 2018-19 tax year is disappointing. It can hardly have escaped the chancellor\u2019s attention that the 2019-20 tax year ends on 5 April \u2013 nearly two months before the scheme is expected to begin paying out. So why can\u2019t the recently self-employed be assessed pro rata on the basis of a promptly submitted 2019-20 tax return? Likewise, I hope that assessment of those who became self-employed in 2018-19 will take account of the date on which their self-employment commenced, rather than assuming their earnings for that year represent a whole year\u2019s income.<br><strong>Rob Sykes</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 It seems the chancellor\u2019s support for those suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic only goes so far. Those recently entering self-employment can apparently go swing. I started self-employment in April 2019 after 44 years of paid (and taxed) employment.

      "bodyText": "As a freelancer of nearly 20 years\u2019 standing, I welcome the support package for self-employed people (Coronavirus: UK offers self-employed 80% of earnings, 26 March) . But the exclusion of those who have become self-employed since the end of the 2018-19 tax year is disappointing. It can hardly have escaped the chancellor\u2019s attention that the 2019-20 tax year ends on 5 April \u2013 nearly two months before the scheme is expected to begin paying out. So why can\u2019t the recently self-employed be assessed pro rata on the basis of a promptly submitted 2019-20 tax return? Likewise, I hope that assessment of those who became self-employed in 2018-19 will take account of the date on which their self-employment commenced, rather than assuming their earnings for that year represent a whole year\u2019s income. Rob Sykes Oxford \u2022 It seems the chancellor\u2019s support for those suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic only goes so far. Those recently entering self-employment can apparently go swing. I started self-employment in April 2019 after 44 years of paid (and taxed) employment. As a result I am one of very few people who will not benefit from any grant or help that the government is offering. At the same time I started self-employment, my wife decided to give up her reasonably paid position to work in a care home on minimum wage. We were confident my income would support us until retirement. My wife\u2019s low income also means no universal credit either. I have lost all my work and income, and the chancellor doesn\u2019t care because there would be a risk of fraud, and yet I will shortly submit my tax return for the year ending 5 April 2020 and subsequently pay tax.

It is something of cliche to suggest sportspeople of his level are out of touch with reality and, in Stenson\u2019s case, completely unfair. He acknowledges the gravity of this pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fun stuff available for the kids and for us here [at the family home in Florida] but I\u2019m not sure I should mention that when you have someone locked in an apartment and can\u2019t go outside,\u201d Stenson says. \u201cIt\u2019s disastrous on a global level from people being really sick to losing their lives, to the world economy plummeting. Anyone who lives paycheque to paycheque is going to feel this. Everyone will to a degree but it feels corny if I am going to complain when people are losing their jobs.</p> <p>\u201cThey say you might have no or very mild symptoms but who wants to roll the dice on that? I\u2019ve had normal flu three times and felt like garbage by a multiple of 10. Once was before the 2014 Masters, I was in bed for nine days with a high fever. On a hot first day at Augusta, I almost fell into Rae\u2019s Creek walking off the 13th green. My caddie had to steer me by the arm towards the tee. Another time I was in an emergency room, convinced I was going to die. If you can feel even worse from this, it won\u2019t be a fun ride at all. People are in grave danger. This is nasty.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/21/ryder-cup-could-be-a-battle-between-a-dozen-captains-picks-apiece\">Ryder Cup could be a battle between a dozen captain's picks apiece | Ewan Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stenson\u2019s coach, Pete Cowen, tested positive after returning from the Players. \u201cHe picked it up on his travels, from what I understand,\u201d Stenson says. \u201cI hope and believe he wasn\u2019t contagious when I last saw him.

You can\u2019t have the top 30 guys on each tour playing 44 times in a year, it just isn\u2019t doable.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a number of things I like about this concept, one is the best players competing against each other on a much more regular basis. I also think golf would really benefit from a proper off-season, without feeling when you have your own time off that you are missing out because others are playing.</p> <p>\u201cWhether we end up there in the short-term or long-term I couldn\u2019t tell you but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we end up there at one point.\u201d</p>",

I\u2019ll focus on workouts and doing some fun stuff you don\u2019t get to do otherwise; cleaning the garage, cleaning closets. There\u2019s always things to do and things to accomplish, right?\u201d Stenson cherished golf\u2019s return to the Olympic scene as he collected silver in Rio. If postponement of the Tokyo Games was inevitable, it still stung the 43-year-old. \u201cBoth as an experience but also as my last chance to get another or a better medal,\u201d he says. \u201cThe Olympics and Ryder Cup were highlights looking at 2020.\u201d At least the Olympic scenario is relatively clear cut. \u201cI have played two full tournaments in the PGA Tour season so what about the FedEx Cup and qualifying for the play-offs?\u201d Stenson asks. \u201cSome guys have played 15 events. How do you tackle all that if you start playing in June or July? I am exempt through next year on the PGA Tour, so it doesn\u2019t really matter for playing privileges, but for some guys that\u2019s a big thing.\u201d Could the Ryder Cup become the sole domain of picks? \u201cNo matter what you do there, it\u2019s going to be unfair to some. Tyrrell Hatton who won in Turkey and won at Bay Hill. Can you go to picks and \u2013 this is hypothetical, clearly \u2013 a captain feels he doesn\u2019t fit into the 12? Someone could go from a lock to not in the team.\u201d Stenson is a former Open champion, a past recipient of the FedEx Cup\u2019s $10m bonus and a Ryder Cup stalwart. It is something of cliche to suggest sportspeople of his level are out of touch with reality and, in Stenson\u2019s case, completely unfair. He acknowledges the gravity of this pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fun stuff available for the kids and for us here [at the family home in Florida] but I\u2019m not sure I should mention that when you have someone locked in an apartment and can\u2019t go outside,\u201d Stenson says. \u201cIt\u2019s disastrous on a global level from people being really sick to losing their lives, to the world economy plummeting. Anyone who lives paycheque to paycheque is going to feel this. Everyone will to a degree but it feels corny if I am going to complain when people are losing their jobs. \u201cThey say you might have no or very mild symptoms but who wants to roll the dice on that? I\u2019ve had normal flu three times and felt like garbage by a multiple of 10. Once was before the 2014 Masters, I was in bed for nine days with a high fever. On a hot first day at Augusta, I almost fell into Rae\u2019s Creek walking off the 13th green. My caddie had to steer me by the arm towards the tee. Another time I was in an emergency room, convinced I was going to die. If you can feel even worse from this, it won\u2019t be a fun ride at all. People are in grave danger. This is nasty.\u201d Stenson\u2019s coach, Pete Cowen, tested positive after returning from the Players. \u201cHe picked it up on his travels, from what I understand,\u201d Stenson says. \u201cI hope and believe he wasn\u2019t contagious when I last saw him. I think he will get through it but he has been feeling pretty bad.\u201d That Rory McIlroy, Brooks Koepka and Jon Rahm have dismissed the breakaway Premier Golf League spells the end to some but Stenson suggests tales of PGL\u2019s demise are premature. \u201cThey are still here, trying to make what they believe is the best product for golf,\u201d he says. \u201cFor as long as I can remember, people complain the fields aren\u2019t strong enough. You can\u2019t have the top 30 guys on each tour playing 44 times in a year, it just isn\u2019t doable. \u201cThere are a number of things I like about this concept, one is the best players competing against each other on a much more regular basis. I also think golf would really benefit from a proper off-season, without feeling when you have your own time off that you are missing out because others are playing. \u201cWhether we end up there in the short-term or long-term I couldn\u2019t tell you but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we end up there at one point.\u201d",

The death toll in New York City stood at 672. Statewide it was 965, up 237 on the day before. With New York yet to reach the peak of its Covid-19 curve, other US cities are fast moving into the danger zone. In Louisiana, which has the second highest per-capita death rate in the country, Governor John Bel Edwards reiterated on Sunday his expectation that ventilators would run out in New Orleans within a week. More than 150 people have died in the state, according to its department of public health, many in New Orleans. More than 1,100 people have been hospitalized, a third needing ventilators. Edwards told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation his state had received no ventilators from the national stockpile, run by the Trump administration, and had placed orders for around 12,000 with private manufacturers. It has received only 192. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything that we can,\u201d Edwards said. Detroit, Michigan, is also hurtling towards becoming a major disaster area. By Sunday there had been more than 2,000 confirmed cases in the city and 46 deaths. Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, told CNN Detroit was in a dire situation that was \u201cgetting worse by the minute\u201d. Like many other governors she has been frustrated by the slow response of the federal government in providing ventilators and essential protective gear for frontline medical workers. Trump has responded to her appeals for help by denigrating her as \u201cthe woman from Michigan\u201d and by recounting publicly how he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, not to talk to her. She refused to rise to the bait, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have the energy to respond to every slight.\u201d Coronavirus continues to overshadow the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Biden appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday and cautioned against raising \u201cfalse expectations\u201d \u2013 a clear reference to Trump\u2019s much-vaunted ambition to reopen parts of the country. \u201cThe American people have never shied away from being able to deal with the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is raise false expectations and then watch them get dashed \u2013 then, they begin to lose confidence in their leadership.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hull Trains is to become the first British rail operator to suspend all services, after cancelling trains between London and the port city until further notice due to the \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d caused by coronavirus. The company, part of rail operator FirstGroup, said it has been forced into the decision to safeguard the future of the business, after passenger numbers dwindled following government advice to avoid nonessential travel. Most routes on the UK rail network have been stripped back because of decreased demand but Hull Trains is the first company to stop running altogether. The government has also suspended rail franchises in England because of the pandemic, relieving the companies that run them of financial risk. Hull Trains is not a franchise owner but an open access operator, which takes the full commercial risk of its business rather than sharing it with the government. Open access train companies buy the right to run trains on government infrastructure, in order to foster competition with franchise companies. Government-owned LNER also runs a service between London and Hull, after a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin Group was stripped of the franchise. As one of three such firms in the country, Hull Trains has not been offered additional financial support from the government, which franchised rail operators have. Louise Cheeseman, the managing director of Hull Trains, said that suspending services was a difficult decision but it would help keep the business alive. \u201cWe have explored every avenue to try to keep trains running but sadly it is not currently financially viable to run our services,\u201d she said, adding that the company will resume services as soon as it can. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very difficult week for the business but the reluctant decision to temporarily suspend services is the right one based on the current unprecedented circumstances and I hope our passengers understand this. \u201cThe move protects the long-term future of Hull Trains and our people\u2019s jobs, which is important as it will allow us to reinstate operations quickly when possible.\u201d Mick Cash, the general secretary of transport union RMT, said: \u201cThis decision affects 130 rail staff around the Hull area and they must be treated as an absolute priority. \u201cWe expect the company and the government to guarantee wages at 100% and not some reduced rate and we also expect jobs, service, pensions and conditions for these rail staff to be fully protected throughout this crisis. \u201cWe will be in direct talks to secure our members the guarantees they are entitled to.

The transfers are said to be voluntary but some of the refugees told the Guardian that they distrust the police and are fearful of being forced into the centres, so plan to run away and continue in their attempts to cross the Channel.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"34c5dc3a-6353-49e9-b613-d60927312a76\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Why did Calais become a staging post?</b><br></p>\n    <p>Refugees have been gathering in Calais on their way to the UK for decades. Periodically the French authorities attempt to prevent them from coming but asylum seekers continue to arrive. Some pay people-smugglers to get them into lorries parked near the port while those who have no money try to conceal themselves in moving trucks.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Who travels to camps on the Channel? </b></p>\n    <p>Many asylum seekers have relatives or friends in the UK or have some level of English language skills. But the 1,000 or so refugees currently living in Calais and Dunkirk represent a very small proportion of refugees seeking asylum across Europe.<br></p>\n    <p>Although the situation in Northern France attracts attention because it is at the UK border, the numbers gathered here are tiny compared with the 100,000- plus who arrived in Europe in 2017, the vast majority of whom intend to claim asylum elsewhere in Europe.</p>\n    <p><b>What are politicians doing to change the situation?</b></p>\n    <p>The British government has contributed to a \u00a317m joint Anglo-French package of security measures, including the construction of a 1km-long concrete wall, aimed at preventing asylum seekers from getting close lorries arriving at the port.</p>\n    <p>But charities say extra security does not prevent the arrival of new refugees. They want the British government to make it easier for vulnerable unaccompanied children to travel legally and for France to accept that there will always be some refugees in Calais, and provide dignified reception centres.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Conditions in the camps are worsening, with shortages of food, water and showers as NGOs are forced to pull out because of the coronavirus pandemic, although no cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the camps.</p> \n<p>Many refugees \u2013 mostly from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan \u2013 often make repeated attempts to cross to the UK. Last year, 1,900 reached the UK by boat, with many others arriving by lorry. Eighty migrants are understood to have reached the UK by boat last week, with some reports of around 160 attempts in one day.</p> \n<p>While numbers are disputed, internal documents collated by NGOs in the area and seen by the Guardian revealed there are about 1,500 people in Calais, including 160 unaccompanied children, the youngest of whom is 11.

      "bodyText": "Up to 2,100 refugees in Calais and Dunkirk are facing an imminent coronavirus lockdown by French authorities, with many saying they will try to reach the UK rather than go to accommodation centres if their camps are cleared. Buses will be sent to the camps to transfer refugees to centres housing up to 100 people from Tuesday. The transfers are said to be voluntary but some of the refugees told the Guardian that they distrust the police and are fearful of being forced into the centres, so plan to run away and continue in their attempts to cross the Channel. Conditions in the camps are worsening, with shortages of food, water and showers as NGOs are forced to pull out because of the coronavirus pandemic, although no cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the camps. Many refugees \u2013 mostly from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq and Sudan \u2013 often make repeated attempts to cross to the UK. Last year, 1,900 reached the UK by boat, with many others arriving by lorry. Eighty migrants are understood to have reached the UK by boat last week, with some reports of around 160 attempts in one day. While numbers are disputed, internal documents collated by NGOs in the area and seen by the Guardian revealed there are about 1,500 people in Calais, including 160 unaccompanied children, the youngest of whom is 11. There are about 600 people in Grand Synthe in Dunkirk, including around 35 families. Some have serious health problems such as diabetes, and others have suffered broken limbs including a broken arm and a broken jaw. A 16-year-old boy from Sudan told the Guardian that he planned to run away and cross the Channel rather than go into one of the French centres. \u201cIf we are taken away to these centres we won\u2019t know what will happen to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI will run away and I will keep trying to reach the UK by lorry.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of passengers, many of them British, on a coronavirus-stricken cruise trip where four people have died are confined to their cabins awaiting the go-ahead to pass through the Panama Canal. Dozens have fallen ill on the Zaandam cruise ship, which was stranded off the Pacific coast of Panama after several Latin American countries refused to let it into port. Some passengers were transferred to a second ship \u2013 the Rotterdam \u2013 on Saturday night. Negotiations are continuing for final permission to be granted for the two cruise ships carrying more than 1,500 passengers and crew to pass through the canal on their way to Florida, where they hope to be given permission to dock. A decision made to stop them travelling through the canal was reversed on Saturday evening by the Panamanian government for \u201chumanitarian reasons\u201d. However, on Sunday passengers on the Rotterdam received a message from the captain saying they were working with the Panamanian authorities to finalise things and that it was \u201ca fluid situation\u201d. Once they dock in Florida, Britons on board will still have try to fly home. The UK government is urging citizens on broad to try to get commercial flights where possible. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the government did not rule out repatriation fights and one such mission was under way to bring back British people in Peru, but added that it is still possible to fly home from many countries. He said: \u201cIf we need to do more steps of that kind in the days ahead, then we will of course do so. We want to get those British citizens back safely to the UK.\u201d Up to 1,000 British nationals stranded in Peru were being repatriated by the UK Foreign Office on Sunday. The British ambassador to Peru, Kate Harrisson, confirmed on Twitter that one British Airways flight was full on departure and that a second BA flight chartered by Ireland was due to take off. \u201cThis today will be our third flight leaving Peru for the UK \u2013 two flights chartered by the UK, one flight chartered by Ireland \u2013 and tomorrow we\u2019ll have two more flights flying back from Lima to London, bringing British nationals back to the UK to their friends and families,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile we\u2019re very happy to be going home, we are mindful that there are still Brits in Peru who need repatriating,\u201d said passenger Ellie Harper, 32, who had been stranded in Huacachina, a desert oasis five hours from the Peruvian capital. Nine Britons and one Irish citizen who were staying in the Pariwana hostel have been prevented from joining the repatriation flights. Peruvian health authorities say they must remain under quarantine for up to three months along with 140 fellow guests after two tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cWe were then treated like we were going to get on a flight today to then find out five hours before we could be here indefinitely,\u201d Si\u00e2n Forkan, one of the British guests, told the Guardian. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has reportedly been talking to other foreign ministries over the weekend to try to resolve other cases of British people struggling to return. He is understood to be making an announcement on Monday of a significant financial package to bring people back, which may include organising flights to Nepal and New Zealand, and using RAF Voyager planes, which can carry some 290 people, as part of the transport.

As the UK\u2019s death toll from the virus rose to 1,228 over the weekend, two surgeons were confirmed to have died in what the NHS medical director described as \u201ca stark reminder to the whole country that we all must take this crisis seriously\u201d. Amged El-Hawrani, a 55-year-old ear, nose and throat consultant, died on Saturday at Leicester Royal Infirmary, while Adil El Tayar, 63, an organ transplant specialist, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex University Hospital in London, it emerged. Both had contracted Covid-19. As they mourned the death of their colleagues, doctors\u2019 and nurses\u2019 groups attacked continuing shortages of protective equipment \u2013 from masks to gowns \u2013 and complained that there was still confusion despite fresh official guidance about their proper use. There were further calls to ramp up testing of NHS workers. Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer, said fatalities were expected to increase. With Britain beginning its second full week under effective lockdown, she indicated that normal life was not likely to resume for three to six months \u2013 and \u201cit is plausible it could go further than that\u201d, she cautioned.

The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told CNN\u2019s State Of The Union: \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying.\u201d The US response to the outbreak seems to be falling along partisan lines, with Democratic governors imposing restrictions and Republicans refusing to do the same. Treatments for Covid-19 continue to evolve. The NHS is trialling an experimental antibody treatment, where patients are given plasma from people who have survived. The treatment is for people admitted to hospital with pneumonia in the hope it reduces the number who end up on ventilators. Australia The government will check all proposed foreign investments into Australia, amid fears the economic fallout from Covid-19 will make assets vulnerable. As the western world locks down economies, China has made moves to restart its own economic activity, raising concerns that distressed foreign assets could be bought without appropriate checks and balances. A 91-year-old woman has died after she and four other people were attacked by three dogs on the NSW south coast. The woman died at the scene after sustaining serious injuries. 2019 was probably the worst year this century for the environment in Australia. Record heat and drought affected river flows, tree cover and wildlife on an \u201cunprecedented scale\u201d, according to a new report. The world Church services all over the world have defied Covid-19 lockdowns to hold packed services. While millions worshipped online, dozens of parishioners, many of them elderly, crowded into Kazan Cathedral in St Petersburg to receive communion. The British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is under consideration for clemency. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year jail sentence in Iran, is seen by some as a bargaining chip in a wider diplomatic dispute with the UK. North Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles on Sunday. South Korea described the timing as \u201cinappropriate\u201d. Recommended reads Michael McGowan reports on the personal toll of the outbreak. In Sydney he talks with Jazmin Weatherall, who used to work at a cinema until it had to close down. In Victoria, Bruce Roberts and his partner Cory, both flight attendants, face having no income. \u201cThere\u2019s so many of us with so many questions\u201d he says. In Melbourne, Marlee Jane Ward, a 37-year-old writer and receptionist, says: \u201cMy job that paid the bills was casual so I had no leave entitlements or redundancy. It\u2019s really revealed how fucking tenuous everything was to begin with.\u201d Beno\u00eet Jacquot\u2019s 2012 film Farewell, My Queen, follows three days in Versailles on the eve of the French revolution. Now streaming on SBS On Demand, the plot of the French-language film revolves around a servant, Sidonie (L\u00e9a Seydoux), who is the assistant reader to Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger). Even though we know, thanks to history, where the story ends, Farewell, My Queen still manages to feel like a workplace thriller, with the story focused on the ladies\u2019 maids and palace librarians who wonder if the revolutionaries will want to dispose of them too. It isn\u2019t exactly relaxing, but something about stories of extremely wealthy people not sharing their resources feels essential at this moment. And a round of applause for the world\u2019s grandparents, doing their duties from self-isolation and using new technology to stay in touch with their grandchildren. \u201cThe last time we had any physical contact was the 14th of March,\u201d says Susan Slaughter from Brisbane. \u201cAll my time was geared around the children but it\u2019s all changed. They\u2019re not allowed into the house any more and so we see them over the fence and on FaceTime.\u201d Daisy Dumas reports on how Australian families are keeping young children apart from their older relatives. Listen Today\u2019s Full Story podcast looks at how the Ruby Princess was allowed to disembark at Sydney and spread Covid-19 across Australia. The ship docked on a warm autumn day in Sydney Harbour to let its 2,700 passengers off. Not long afterwards, passenger after passenger was confirmed to have contracted the virus. In this episode of Full Story we look at who was ultimately responsible for a breakdown in Australia\u2019s biosecurity safeguards. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

Both the NRL and Rugby League Players\u2019 Association are confident a deal will be reached early this week on pay. Media roundup Australian news websites are focused on the new coronavirus restrictions. The Australian describes the situation as \u201cAustralia\u2019s new social order: three\u2019s a crowd\u201d, before going on to report that even the crowds at Bondi seem to be getting the message. The Sydney Morning Herald has a more global look, with its live blog reporting on restrictions in the UK, and the falling death rate in Italy. The West Australian leads with news that the stricken German cruiser Artania would be able to send 29 passengers to the Joondalup health campus, rather than the Hollywood and Bethesda hospitals, where staff said they were not prepared to treat Covid-19 patients.

Under current rules, all EU citizens have until June 2021 to apply for settled status. However, there are concerns that the pandemic will mean that the government support available to help EU citizens will reduce, and public awareness campaigns, designed to reach the most vulnerable people and those without an online presence, will be delayed. Campaigners claim that this could hit the very care workers \u2013 NHS staff and delivery workers \u2013 who are helping the country deal with the virus. The Right to Stay campaign, newly launched by Another Europe is Possible and supported by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, is urging the government to replace the application process for settled status with a guaranteed right to stay for all EU citizens residing in the UK written into law. Zoe Gardner, of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \u201cThe coronavirus crisis means that the entire system of applications is at risk of failing. \u201cSupport services to help people through the process are largely face to face and simply won\u2019t be able to function for a prolonged period, with charities designed to support vulnerable EU citizens severely limited in their ability to support vulnerable people.\u201d The charity sector, which also helps offer advice to EU citizens, could also be overwhelmed by the crisis as their resources are diverted to help people navigate the welfare system.

An earlier version incorrectly included Liverpool University among those making unconditional offers. The article had also said that UK universities were closed; this was later clarified to say UK university campuses were closed and teaching had moved online and the article amended accordingly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Strict limits on the number of students that each university in England can recruit are set to be imposed by the government in an effort to avoid a free-for-all on admissions, with institutions plunged into financial turmoil as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the Guardian has learned. A government source said each university would face limits on the number of UK and EU undergraduates it could admit for the academic year starting in September, in a move backed by higher education leaders. It will be the first such limit since the university admission cap was lifted in 2015. This month, the Guardian reported that British universities faced a black hole of hundreds of millions of pounds in tuition fees as international students from China and other countries severely affected by coronavirus are forced to cancel or postpone enrolments. UK university campuses are closed and teaching has moved online. To avoid certain universities hoovering up domestic students to fill their courses, leaving other, less prestigious institutions with empty lecture theatres, the pain will be spread through the introduction of a cap, it is understood. \u201cUnless there are significant developments, this will happen,\u201d said one policymaker involved in the discussions between the government and universities. The imposition of a cap means that students currently going through the application process are set to have their choices restricted. It also means some students will not be able to attend universities at which they have been offered place. The policy was backed by the board of Universities UK at a virtual meeting held on Friday, although it was strongly opposed by some leading universities, including several members of the Russell Group of research-intensive institutions. The decision is likely to be announced within the next few days, although some well-known institutions are fighting a rearguard battle in Whitehall over worries that they will also face financial difficulty if they cannot recruit additional student numbers from the UK to replace the international tuition fees they expect to lose. Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK (UUK), the group that includes most mainstream English universities, said: \u201cThe UUK board discussed a range of measures needed to promote financial stability of the sector in these tough times. Foremost was the need for government financial support for universities.

Nick Hillman, the head of the Higher Education Policy Institute(Hepi), who was previously a special adviser to the government, said: \u201cThere has to be a policy response to this severe crisis, and we have to protect our university sector at a time of such profound change. \u201cBut there are people who have long wanted to restrict access to higher education who might see this as the chance to do it. Yet when there are fewer jobs to go around, education becomes more important, not less.\u201d Hillman said the coronavirus pandemic was \u201cfast becoming the catalyst for the return of student number caps\u201d, in opposition to \u201cevery ministerial utterance since at least 2010\u201d on the subject. \u201cReintroducing number caps would protect those universities that have grown the most in recent years by locking down the number of home students that they educate and stopping others from growing at their expense. Older, more prestigious universities would be the biggest losers, as they had hoped to be able to replace lost international students with more home students,\u201d Hillman said. Those university leaders opposed to the cap argue that there is no rush to impose the policy, given the uncertainties over how the coronavirus crisis will play out, and that decisions on admissions could wait until July at the latest. Chris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, is to argue in an article to be published by Hepi on Monday that \u201cradical action is needed on university admissions\u201d, including the reintroduction of student number controls for more than one year. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to supporting our world-class higher education institutions, and will continue working closely with the sector to manage the impact of coronavirus. \u201cWe recognise the challenges universities are facing, but are impressed by their resilience and efforts to tackle the virus, through the use of labs, accommodation and community support.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020. An earlier version incorrectly included Liverpool University among those making unconditional offers. The article had also said that UK universities were closed; this was later clarified to say UK university campuses were closed and teaching had moved online and the article amended accordingly.",

Three years earlier, the former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Forsyth said the chancellor was aping Micawber by adopting a \u201csomething will turn up\u201d attitude toward the economy. Donald Trump Ebenezer Scrooge (A Christmas Carol) After unveiling a plan to slash food stamp benefits for more than half a million unemployed Americans just before Christmas, Trump became the latest in a long line of politicians to be compared to the miserly Scrooge. Paul Krugman of the New York Times noted that by Trump-era standards, \u201cEbenezer Scrooge was a nice guy\u201d.

Some speculated that she was referring to Sydney Carton, the doomed fixer for the vain, feckless Mr Stryver.

      "bodyText": "Supermarket chain Morrisons is to distribute \u00a310m worth of food to the UK\u2019s food banks during the coronavirus outbreak by producing more fresh items from its own manufacturing sites and bolstering deliveries from its stores. The UK\u2019s largest fresh food manufacturer will this week ramp up production at its bakery, egg and fruit and vegetable packing site by an extra hour every day to make, prepare and pack essentials to help restock food banks. The UK\u2019s food banks have been struggling to meet demand at a time when the number of volunteers, typically older people, has slumped because of to self-isolation. It is estimated that the outbreak of Covid-19 has led to a 40% reduction in donations to community food banks across the country, when most are seeing demand for their services soar. Morrisons is the only British supermarket to have its own sites supplying meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, bakery and other products that help to make more than half of the fresh food sold in its 495 stores. There are 14 Morrison production sites across the UK. David Potts, chief executive of Morrisons, said: \u201cAs a food maker and shopkeeper we are uniquely placed to help. We know food banks are finding life very difficult and running our manufacturing sites for an extra hour each day to help restock them is the right decision at this time.\u201d The retailer, which has 120,000 staff and typically serves more than 12 million customers every week, said it was planning for \u00a310m worth of food to be distributed to food banks by July. It will also be sending deliveries of ambient food \u2013 such as canned goods and pasta \u2013 to its stores to also give to their local food bank. To encourage customers to make donations, it is lifting purchase limits to four items and removing limits on some items altogether. Its in-store cafes \u2013 now closed for business \u2013 will be revamped as donation hubs. Last week the the Co-op said it would donate \u00a31.5m worth of food to the UK\u2019s largest food redistribution charity FareShare, to help boost stocks and support local communities struggling because of the coronavirus outbreak. Lindsay Boswell, FareShare chief executive, said: \u201cThe situation around coronavirus is unprecedented and developing fast, and we are working as a UK-wide network of redistribution organisations to meet the changing needs of local organisations on the ground and ensure we are best prepared for all possible outcomes.\u201d FareShare, the UK\u2019s largest hunger-fighting charity, is also appealing for more volunteers to help with its distribution operation. The discount supermarket Lidl will this week start donating thousands of fresh fruit and vegetable bags to NHS staff in an effort to help provide frontline health workers with fresh produce.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic could cause UK economic output to plunge by an unprecedented 15% in the second quarter of the year and unemployment to more than double, according to dire forecasts. The deepest recession since the financial crisis is now all but unavoidable, according to analysts at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), after businesses shut up shop and consumer spending fell dramatically as a result of lockdown restrictions. The centre said it expected the economy to have shrunk marginally in the first three months of the year by 0.5%, followed by the steepest economic contraction since comparable records began more than 20 years ago. The predicted slump would dwarf the 2.2% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the banking crash took hold, marking by far the worst three-month period since at least 1997. Japan\u2019s Nomura bank has pencilled in a slightly less precipitous fall for the UK of 13.5%, but also predicted a significant rise in unemployment. The bank\u2019s analysts forecast that government initiatives designed to persuade employers not to let staff go will not be enough to stop the figure more than doubling from 3.9% to 8% between April to June, before creeping up to 8.5% in the third quarter. The Department for Work and Pensions said on Wednesday that 477,000 people had applied for universal credit in just nine days, forcing it to redeploy thousands of civil servants to help process the claims. The CEBR and Nomura predict unprecedented economic pain in the second quarter, but both expect a subsequent rebound, assuming coronavirus restrictions are eased and the government takes economic stimulus measures. The CEBR said a cut in VAT could help to kickstart consumer spending, and it expects measures to promote investment in business, which would not recover until 2030 otherwise. That would deliver a \u201csharp bounceback\u201d in the second half of the year, it said, although 2020 GDP would still be 4% lower than 2019. House prices will fall 13% in the year to the end of March 2021, the CEBR said.",

You could own that good one. That\u2019s why two-year-olds are so exciting and why there\u2019s always a market for them.\u201d</p> <p>Aside from the horses, Hannon has his family to help keep his own spirits up. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and the weather\u2019s nice, so you can go outside and spend a bit of time with them.

There\u2019s a lot of people living in cities who have it a lot harder than we do.\u201d</p> <p>While he was at school, Hannon had no thought other than one day taking over his father\u2019s racing stable; will he now be getting involved in the home-schooling of his children? \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d pass many exams if I was home-schooling them,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut we have a bit of a laugh with them and they\u2019re reading plenty of books.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to see Granny and Grandad, even though they live 100 yards down the road and always have a drawer full of sweets.

In the meantime there is hope, which has always been central to racing\u2019s appeal and which Hannon believes can be a source of comfort to his owners. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of them will have had investments in the stock market and other things that obviously won\u2019t have gone well. But the great thing about a lot of our horses is that you don\u2019t know what they are, what they could be. People who own unraced two-year-olds have always got hope for the future. You could own that good one. That\u2019s why two-year-olds are so exciting and why there\u2019s always a market for them.\u201d Aside from the horses, Hannon has his family to help keep his own spirits up. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and the weather\u2019s nice, so you can go outside and spend a bit of time with them. It\u2019s OK now but I should imagine after a few weeks there\u2019s going to be some awful cabin fever. \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky, we live in a lovely place in the country and we have some space, we work with lovely animals. It makes us a lot better off than most people at this time. We don\u2019t have anything to moan about, that way. There\u2019s a lot of people living in cities who have it a lot harder than we do.\u201d While he was at school, Hannon had no thought other than one day taking over his father\u2019s racing stable; will he now be getting involved in the home-schooling of his children? \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019d pass many exams if I was home-schooling them,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut we have a bit of a laugh with them and they\u2019re reading plenty of books. \u201cThey\u2019re not allowed to see Granny and Grandad, even though they live 100 yards down the road and always have a drawer full of sweets. At the moment, the sweets are being passed through letterboxes and through the window sometimes.\u201d",

For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around 10 days later.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days.

We\u2019ve launched a new one at the link below where I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest news for the next few hours: Hundreds of worshippers attended services at a Louisiana church on Sunday, flouting a ban on large gatherings, angering neighbours and seemingly turning a deaf ear to their governor, who once again warned that hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with new cases of the coronavirus, AP reports. An estimated 500 people of all ages filed inside the mustard-yellow and beige Life Tabernacle church in Central, a city of nearly 29,000 outside Baton Rouge. Assistant ministers and worshippers who stood outside the front doors and in the parking lot of Life Tabernacle told news reporters to leave, saying cameras would not be allowed on the property and they had been told not to talk to the news media. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Helen Sullivan with you now for the next few hours. You can get in touch with me at any point on Twitter @helenrsullivan. That\u2019s all from me, Clea Skopeliti. My colleague Helen Sullivan will be guiding you through the next few hours as events continue to unfold. Many thanks to everyone who got in touch via Twitter. Here are the main points from the last few hours: Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, has announced it will cap the number of people allowed to enter its islands to 100 a week from Tuesday. Up to 1,000 British nationals stranded in Peru are being repatriated by the foreign office tonight. Over 100 Irish nationals and dozens of others from 13 EU countries are also on their way back via a rescue flight organised by Ireland. Egyptian banks have been instructed to apply temporary caps on daily withdrawals and deposits, while Zimbabwe has legalised the use of foreign currency in domestic transactions as the countries deal with the outbreak. Costa Rica has confirmed 19 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases in the country up to 314. This follows Bolivia and Uruguay both announcing their first coronavirus deaths today. Fort Lauderdale\u2019s mayor has expressed opposition to having a cruise ship with coronavirus patients dock in the city\u2019s port. Mayor Dean Trantalis issued a statement explaining that the port is in the middle of a very urban area. 20,000 former NHS staff have returned to support the health service, Boris Johnson said in a video posted online. Nigeria\u2019s president has ordered a lockdown in Lagos and the capital city of Abuja. Moscow has announced a citywide lockdown beginning tomorrow, confining residents of the city of nearly 12 million people to their homes. France has announced 292 deaths in 24 hours, and has reached a total of 40,174 confirmed cases. Italy has said it will extend its month-long lockdown beyond 3 April. The decision came as the number of deaths in the country increased by 756 to reach 10,779. Madeira, an autonomous region of Portugal, has announced it will cap the number of people allowed to enter its islands at 100 a week from Tuesday, Reuters reports. The available hotel space will be used to quarantine people with coronavirus symptoms. The region has confirmed a total of 34 cases. Hundreds of British and Irish nationals gathered under white awnings are sat on rows of plastic chairs in a makeshift terminal set up at Lima\u2019s military airbase known as Grupo A\u00e9reo Ocho, amid emergency workers and soldiers. \u201cWe\u2019re all just really happy to be going home,\u201d said Ellie Harper , 32, who had been marooned in Huacachina, a desert oasis five hours from the Peruvian capital. \u201cAs hard as it has been to organise and get everything together, from this morning the organisation from the Irish embassy from the UK British embassy has been fantastic.\u201d \u201cThe staff at the airport have been really lovely and friendly and have explained everything to us really clearly and they\u2019re working to find ways to get absolutely everybody on board,\u201d she added. The first Boeing 777 left with 219 passengers and the second is expected to leave at full capacity taking 275 passengers including one extra stranded traveler, who works as a BA flight attendant and was able to use the drop seat used by the crew. \u201cWhile we\u2019re very happy to be going home we are mindful that there are still Brits in Peru who need repatriating,\u201d Harper said. Nine Britons and one Irish citizen who are staying in the Pariwana Hostel in Cusco have been prevented from joining the repatriation flights. Peruvian health authorities say they must remain under quarantine for up to three months along with some 140 fellow guests after two tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. \u201cWe were treated like we were going to get on a flight today to then find out five hours before we could be here indefinitely,\u201d Si\u00e2n Forkan, one of the British guests, told The Guardian. Patients in the UK dying now were infected around a month ago, weeks before the country started social distancing, an expert has warned. Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, spoke out after a further 209 people died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK. Although this is a lower number than the 260 deaths the previous day, he warned it is too early to draw conclusions, underlining that \u201cdaily numbers can be lower (or higher) than expected due to random factors\u201d. Prof Naismith said: \u201cI am confident that provided we follow social distancing the increase in deaths will stop and this will be followed by a decrease in the daily numbers. \u201cIt can take up to two weeks from infection to onset of symptoms. For over 80% of people these symptoms are mild, for the much smaller number who develop the most serious illness, intensive care is needed around 10 days later. \u201cFor those who do not recover but die, data from China suggests this takes around another four days. The tragic deaths today will be from people infected roughly a month ago. It is inevitable that there will be more tragedies for families ahead. \u201cWe can reduce the final death toll only by following current Government advice. We must expect and welcome changes in Government advice as science, medicine and social science work together to learn more.\u201d Up to 1,000 British nationals stranded in Peru are being repatriated by the foreign office tonight. The British ambassador Kate Harrison has just confirmed on Twitter that one of the two British Airways flights leaving Lima tonight is full, with a second British Airways flight chartered by Ireland. Harrison said two more flights were due to leave Lima tomorrow. \u201cOur first flight in today, working with the Irish in this context, has left with a full capacity. So every single seat on that flight back to the UK is now full. The second plane that will take off today - we\u2019re looking to people from Cusco but other parts of Peru.. \u201cThis today will be our third flight leaving Peru for the UK, two flights chartered by the UK, one flight chartered by Ireland, and tomorrow we\u2019ll have two more British Airways flights flying back from Lima to London, bringing British nationals back to the UK back to their friends and back to their families,\u201d said Kate Harrison. More than 100 Irish nationals and dozens of others from 13 EU countries are also on their way back courtesy of a rescue flight organised by Ireland. Egyptian banks have been ordered to apply temporary caps on daily withdrawals and deposits, a policy that some analysts see as an attempt to control inflation and hoarding in the midst of the pandemic. The daily limit for individuals would be 10,000 Egyptian pounds and 50,000 pounds for companies, according to Reuters. This follows Zimbabwe legalising the use of foreign currency in domestic transactions in preparation for the country\u2019s 21-day lockdown. There\u2019s been an update on the Zaandam cruise ship, where four people have died. Fort Lauderdale\u2019s mayor, Dean Trantalis, is reluctant to have the ship dock at Port Everglades, saying in a statement: \u201cOur healthcare system could be extremely burdened by the time the ship arrives.\u201d He called on the Trump administration to develop a plan of action and for \u201cstringent separation procedures\u201d if the ship does dock. From Reuters: Costa Rica has confirmed 19 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases in the country up to 314. This follows Bolivia and Uruguay both announcing their first coronavirus deaths today. My colleague Henry McDonald reports from Belfast that a couple in their 70s have died of coronavirus. The man reportedly had cancer and the woman was being treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There have been 21 deaths in Northern Ireland. The UK government\u2019s effort to source 30,000 medical ventilators to treat Covid-19 patients has resulted in two significant orders so far; 10,000 for Dyson\u2019s new CoVent prototype and 10,000 from a consortium called Ventilator Challenge UK, which expects to begin producing this week. But some firms claim they could have provide medical ventilators sooner and were inexplicably snubbed. The government has this evening offered an explanation as to why. Regarding a ventilator offered by Worcester-based Gtech, a government spokesperson said the plans were rejected by the Technical Design Authority, which includes a panel of clinicians. \u201cUnfortunately the Gtech ventilator model did not pass the government\u2019s stringent safety tests and we will not be proceeding further,\u201d the spokesperson said. A firm called Direct Access said it could import 5,000 ventilators within a week and a further 20,000 within the month. The government said the plans \u201cdid not stand up to due diligence\u201d. My colleagues Erin McCormick and Patrick Greenfield and have the latest on the Zaandam cruise ship, on which four have died. The Port of Everglades has said a Covid-19-stricken cruise ship has not yet been given approval to dock in Florida after it was granted passage to pass through the Panama canal and travel towards Fort Lauderdale. Four people have died on the Zaandam cruise liner and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms after it became stranded at sea when Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic. On Saturday, Panamanian authorities reversed a decision to stop the Zaandam in the canal to travel to port in Fort Lauderdale. Hundreds of symptomless passengers have been transferred to its sister ship, the Rotterdam, during the weekend. On Sunday, the Panama canal indicated that both ships would be allowed to travel together although there has been no official confirmation from the Panamanian government. In a statement to the Guardian, Port Everglades said it would take about three days for the ship to reach south Florida, and that Holland American, the boats\u2019 owners, must then submit a plan before arrival to enter the port that meets \u201ca long list of Unified Command requirements\u201d. The ships\u2019 owners, Holland America Line, have not responded to requests for updates on the health of passengers onboard or the current travel plans. Medical leaders have praised Amged El-Hawrani, an ear, nose and throat consultant, who died today aged 55 of Covid-19. They said his death underlined the need for frontline NHS staff to have proper personal protective equipment \u2013 and for everyone to stay at home. Dr Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, which represents many hospital doctors in England, said: \u201cI am deeply saddened to hear of Mr El-Hawrani\u2019s death. He was a highly respected colleague in my own trust and it has left many of us feeling as low as we have ever been previously in our careers. The words of his family show what a wonderful person he was.\u201d \u201cHis death is a stark reminder that Covid-19 is not a disease that only affects the old and infirm. We must remember that healthcare workers are putting their lives on the line right now, and it\u2019s absolutely imperative that they have access to suitable personal protective equipment [PPE].\u201d Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, who is self-isolating after displaying symptoms of the virus, said: \u201cI share the deep sadness about the death of Mr El-Hawrani that will be felt by the whole medical profession and wider NHS, and send condolences to his family on behalf of all of us. \u201cCovid-19 is a risk to everyone, but clinical NHS staff are at the frontline in battling this disease. Everyone is rightly inspired by the skill and dedication of our NHS staff like Mr El-Hawrani. \u201cThe action that everyone in the UK can do to reduce the risk to the NHS is to continue to follow government advice on staying at home and social distancing. This is the practical support the NHS and its staff need from us all at the moment.\u201d Nigeria\u2019s president Muhammadu Buhari has ordered a lockdown in Lagos and the capital city of Abuja, AFP reports. Nigeria has recorded 97 confirmed coronavirus cases and one death. More than \u00a3250,000 has been raised to help provide free hot meals for NHS staff in the UK, less than a week after the initiative was started by a small group of friends. About 4,000 meals have been provided to hospitals, and tens of thousands more are expected soon. \u201cWe were talking about how a group of friends who are NHS workers are just not eating properly,\u201d Andrew Muir Wood, one of the founders, told PA Media. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for anyone to operate on an empty stomach let alone people trying to save lives, so we got together trying to work out how we could solve that.\u201d To support the campaign, visit www.mealsforthenhs.com. In the UK, Stuart, a street outreach worker from Brighton, says his job has changed dramatically since the coronavirus outbreak as every homeless person has to be indoors by this weekend. While the threshold for housing people was once high, local authorities are now able to get accommodation in 30 minutes, he said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s all shifted and they are trying to negotiate with landlords and hotel owners to get people into accommodation. \u201cIt\u2019s been quick, you send five people over and within 30 minutes the council can say got somewhere. New accommodation seems to have cropped up from landlords offering their services, but it is frustrating because the government has not allowed local authorities to requisition buildings from private owners. That would be easier and quicker. I had a problem that one hotel changed their mind last minute after we were going to place people there.\u201d The other role he now has is supporting those indoors, and making sure they get food as all the day centres have closed. He said there was a mix of moods among homeless people. \u201cSome have taken the news of the outbreak in their stride, while others are panicking. There are a small number who don\u2019t want to go inside.\u201d Moscow has announced a citywide lockdown beginning tomorrow, confining residents of the city of nearly 12 million people to their homes to slow the spread of coronavirus. The restrictions are some of the most severe in the Russian capital\u2019s history and are comparable with steps taken in cities in Italy and China to slow the pandemic. As of Monday, residents will not be allowed to leave their homes except to seek medical care, to travel to work if they provide essential services, to go to the nearest store or chemist, or to walk pets no further than 100 metres from their home. The restrictions would not limit movement in and out of Moscow in personal cars, the statement read, emphasising that Russians could still enter or exit the capital. Similar restrictions are expected in the greater Moscow region, where another 7 million people live. It was not immediately clear if police or military would be deployed on the streets to enforce the ban. The statement referred to a \u201csmart system of control\u201d, indicating that the city may use facial recognition on cameras or use telephone geolocation data in order to track the movements of people around the city. \u201cThe extremely negative turn of events that we have seen in the largest cities of Europe and the United States have caused great concern for the life and health of our citizens,\u201d read a statement on the personal website of Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin. Russia has identified 1,534 cases of coronavirus so far. Eight deaths have been attributed to the virus. Vladimir Putin has announced a national holiday for the coming week but stopped short of declaring a national state of emergency. Sobyanin also said that because of an expected spike in job losses, the city would disburse 19,500 roubles (\u00a3200) per month in unemployment. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the head of France\u2019s health authority, has issued an update on the country\u2019s situation. The total number of confirmed cases in France is 40,174. There are currently 19,354 people in hospital in France, an increase of 10% on the previous day. There are 4,632 people in intensive care in hospital; 359 more than yesterday. Of those in intensive care: 34% are under 60 years old; 64% aged 60-80; 60 people are under 30 years old. 7,132 people have recovered, Salomon said. There have been 2,606 deaths in French hospitals. This is an increase of 292 in 24 hours. Italy has said it will extend its month-long lockdown as the number of deaths in the country increased by 756 to reach 10,779. There are now 97,689 confirmed cases in Italy. Reuters reports that there have been 10 new coronavirus deaths in Ireland, bringing the country\u2019s total to 46. The health department has announced 200 new confirmed cases, making a total of 2,615. The United Arab Emirates has reported one new death and 102 new cases. This brings the death toll to three, and the total number of infections to 570. Here are some of the key developments: The coronavirus pandemic has killed over 30,000 people. The total number of confirmed cases is currently at 691,867, according to Johns Hopkins. The finance minister of Germany\u2019s Hesse state, Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, has killed himself after apparently becoming \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about how to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus. The Syrian health ministry has announced the country\u2019s first coronavirus death, as the total number of cases comes to nine. The death toll in Lombardy, Italy\u2019s worst affected region, has slowed. It rose by about 416 in a day to at least 6,360. The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, has said the city will run out of critical medical supplies, including ventilators, by next Sunday, 5 April. New curfew regulations have been introduced in Serbia. The country has increased its curfew from 3pm till 5am on weekends, and 5pm till 5am on weekdays. The UK death toll has increased by 209 in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228. The figure was lower than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has tightened social distancing measures. New advice states that public gatherings should include no more than two people outside of the household. Kuwait\u2019s health ministry has announced 20 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 225. Mexico has asked its 130 million citizens to stay at home for a month. The country\u2019s president has previously been criticised for not doing enough to deal with the crisis. Saudi Arabia has reported four deaths and 96 new coronavirus cases today. This brings the the death toll to eight and the total number of coronavirus cases to 1,299. Saudi Arabia has tightened its restrictions on movements to contain spread of coronavirus. The interior ministry has today banned residents from entering or exiting the city of Jeddah. The finance minister of Germany\u2019s Hesse state, Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, has killed himself after apparently becoming \u201cdeeply worried\u201d about how to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus, the Local reports. \u201cWe are in shock, we are in disbelief and above all we are immensely sad,\u201d state premier Volker Bouffier said in a statement. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. As hospitals hit capacity in Spain, healthcare workers are being stretched to breaking point. Hospital staff in Madrid have been meditating to cope with the stress. The Syrian health ministry has announced the first coronavirus death in the country. Four new cases have also been confirmed, pushing the total number of infections to nine. The patient died upon her arrival to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, state run news agency reports. Syria has implemented several precautionary measures to slow the spread of the deadly virus, with a nationwide curfew from 6pm to 6 am beginning last week. Shops, markets and public transport have been shut down as well with only pharmacies allowed to keep their opens, according to Al Arabia. An aeroplane used as an air ambulance has burst into flames in the Philippines, killing all eight people onboard. The New York Times reports that it is unclear if the passengers were being airlifted for coronavirus treatment. Local reports say that in addition to the pilot, the plane was carrying two crew members, a doctor, a nurse, a flight medic and an American and a Canadian passenger. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, has announced a funding boost for a children\u2019s helpline to support those who are isolated at home. Engineering firms have said that the UK may not have enough ventilators when coronavirus cases reach their peak, the BBC reports. The UK has just over 8,000 ventilators, but it is estimated the country will need 30,000 during the peak of the crisis, which is expected in two weeks\u2019 time. Manufacturers have said they will be unable to meet that deadline. Clea Skopeliti here, taking over from my colleague Jedidajah. Spot something I\u2019ve missed? Feel free to message me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti. As we cover the UK\u2019s daily government briefing too, please follow our UK blog here. The coronavirus death toll in the northern Italian region of Lombardy, the country\u2019s worst affected, has risen by about 416 in a day to at least 6,360, Reuters reports. Day-on-day the deaths were down markedly from Saturday\u2019s 542, which was the second largest since the outbreak first emerged just over five weeks ago. The number of cases in the region, which includes the country\u2019s financial capital, Milan, increased by 1,592 to approximately 41,007, the source said. Dutch GPs are phoning elderly and at-risk patients to check if they are willing to take the risk of dying at home in case they get Covid-19, so that their hospital bed can be taken up by someone with better survival chances, the Volkskrant newspaper reported. In the Dutch healthcare system such conversations are normally carried out face to face. Bianca Buurman, professor of acute elderly care at Amsterdam UMC, emphasised in an article published with three other colleagues the importance for healthcare providers to contact elderly people to ask what their wishes would be if they were affected by the virus. \u201cProximity is important for such tough topics, but going by is not an option now,\u201d Buurman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know whether such a conversation will further fuel fear.\u201d The US government\u2019s leading infection disease expert, Anthony Fauci, has said the country could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic. Speaking on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, Fauci offered his prognosis as the federal government mulls rolling back social distancing measures in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak, when the nationwide 15-day effort to slow the spread of the virus will come to an end. As Spain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed that of China, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has tightened the country\u2019s lockdown, my colleague Ashifa Kassam reports on the increasingly desperate attempts of Spanish doctors and nurses to fight the virus. The mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, has said his city will run out of critical medical supplies, including ventilators, by next Sunday, 5 April. In a tweet, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re at war and ventilators are our ammunition.\u201d New York is the worst-affected US state, with most deaths in the country having so far been recorded in New York, where also a third of the about 52,000 people who have so far been confirmed to have the virus are from. As we reported this morning, the British Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has said the peak of the coronavirus outbreak in Britain will depend on people\u2019s actions. He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that the lockdown would remain in place for a \u201csignificant period\u201d. UK coronavirus live: lockdown measures will be in place for \u2018significant period\u2019, says Gove Here a video of Gove\u2019s comments by my colleague Elena Morresi: Hundreds of doctors in the UK have said they are less likely to return to the frontline or increase their hours to fight Covid-19 because they believe their families will not be properly compensated if they die, my colleagues Robert Booth and Denis Campbell report. Full story below. A plane loaded with medical supplies has arrived in New York from China on Sunday, the first in a series of flights the White House has organised over the next 30 days, Reuters reports. A commercial carrier landed at John F Kennedy airport carrying gloves, gowns and masks for distribution in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, three particularly hard-hit states in the US. The airlift is a product of a team led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, which formed \u201cProject Airbridge\u201d, a partnership between several large US healthcare distributors and the federal government. Donald Trump, who initially played down the threat from the virus, has been searching for supplies to fill the mounting need for equipment to protect healthcare workers caring for Covid-19 patients. The coronavirus pandemic already looks to be profoundly reshaping Latin America\u2019s political landscape. Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 - whom nearly 60 governments recognise as the country\u2019s rightful interim president \u2013 has spent the last 15 months battling to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and force his Socialist party from power. But on Saturday Guaid\u00f3 announced he now believed it was time for a national unity government to tackle the impending emergency, which is likely to hit the crisis-stricken country hard. \u201cFor obvious reasons it cannot be lead by Maduro,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 tweeted. \u201cBut neither can it be solely made up of the forces we represent,\u201d he added in a video address arguing that \u201call political and social forces\u201d needed to be included. Maduro\u2019s administration has so far confirmed 119 coronavirus cases and two deaths in Venezuela and has placed many parts of the country on lockdown in an attempt to halt its spread. But many suspect the real numbers are far higher and in Saturday\u2019s broadcast Guaid\u00f3 said the situation was likely to deteriorate, with Venezuela\u2019s collapsing healthcare system ill-equipped to deal with a wave of Covid-19 deaths. \u201cUnfortunately everything suggests the situation will get worse because of the situation our country finds itself in,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said. \u201cIn the coming weeks Venezuela could become the country with the highest number of infections in the region.\u201d New curfew regulations have been introduced in Serbia. On Saturday, Serbia stepped up its curfew from 3pm till 5am on weekends, and 5pm till 5am on weekdays. All people over 65 years old resident in cities have been asked to stay home at all times, except for designated shopping hours from 3am till 8am on Sundays. The borders have been closed for a while but now the period for which all returning citizens must self-isolate has been extended to 28 days Hi, this is Jedidajah Otte again, taking back over. My colleagues Lily Kuo and Helen Davidson are reporting that foreigners in China are observing a rise in xenophobia in the country amid the global Covid-19 outbreak. As Chinese health officials report new \u201cimported\u201d coronavirus cases almost every day, foreigners have been turned away from restaurants, shops, gyms and hotels, subjected to further screening, yelled at by locals and avoided in public spaces. The UK death toll from coronavirus has increased by 209 people in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths in the UK to 1,228 so far. The figure was lower than Saturday\u2019s record rise of 260, which may bring some hope that the rise in deaths could stabilise soon. The Department of Health and Social Care also said 19,522 had now tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. More on our UK coronavirus liveblog. Iran\u2019s president has defended his country\u2019s response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East, saying the government has to weigh economic concerns as it takes measures to contain the pandemic. Hassan Rouhani told Associated Press that authorities had to consider the effect of mass quarantine efforts on Iran\u2019s beleaguered economy, which is under heavy US sanctions. \u201cIt\u2019s a dilemma playing out across the globe, as leaders struggle to strike a balance between restricting human contact and keeping their economies from crashing,\u201d Rouhani said at a cabinet meeting. \u201cHealth is a principle for us, but the production and security of society is also a principle for us. We must put these principles together to reach a final decision.\u201d On Sunday, state TV reported another 123 deaths, pushing Iran\u2019s overall death toll to 2,640 among 38,309 confirmed cases. In recent days, the country has ordered the closure of non-essential businesses and banned travel between cities. But those measures came long after other countries in the region imposed more sweeping lockdowns. Many Iranians are still flouting orders to stay home in what could reflect widespread distrust of authorities. More news from my colleague, Shaun Walker, our central and eastern Europe correspondent, based in Budapest: The main opposition candidate in Polish presidential elections has called on the public to boycott the vote if the government insists on going ahead with it on 10 May. Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice party has refused to call off the vote despite a lockdown currently in place to fight coronavirus, with its incumbent Andrzej Duda the favourite to win another term. In the early hours of Saturday, the Polish parliament passed an amendment allowing pensioners and those in quarantine to vote by post. On Sunday, Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, the main opposition candidate, published an open letter on Facebook: \u201cThere is no other task in Poland today than to fight the [coronavirus] outbreak and its effects \u2026 In this situation, organising presidential elections would be a reckless act. Everyone should agree with the principle that we must not put human life at risk.\u201d She said if the vote did go ahead, the government would be responsible for any citizens who got sick, and called on other candidates to also boycott the race. The opposition has previously said the vote should be postponed because it would be inappropriate to run a campaign during a pandemic. Luxury fashion group Chanel has said it will launch production of face masks to help bolster supplies in France in its fight against the virus. Prototypes were being worked on and would roll off production lines once they received the approval of French authorities, reported Reuters. \u201cToday we are mobilising our workforce and our partners ... to produce protective masks and blouses,\u201d Chanel said in a statement. On Saturday, Olivier Veran, the health minister, said the government had ordered more than a billion face masks \u2013 mostly from China \u2013 to be supplied in the weeks and months ahead. France was using 40m face masks per week, he said. Doctors, nursing home carers and police have complained of shortages. Chanel also said it would not be putting any of its 4,500 employees into temporary unemployment as the company weathers the sharp downtown in economic activity.

You can get in touch with me on Twitter or by email at nazia.parveen@theguardian.com. I might not have time to reply but I will certainly give emails and messages a read. As reported earlier, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has stepped up measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. New advice warns that public gatherings should include no more than two people outside of the household. Morrison said Australians now needed to stay home unless they were shopping for food and other essentials, attending medical appointments, exercising, or attending work or education. People aged 70 and over \u201cshould stay at home and self-isolate for their own protection\u201d. Here is a video: India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has asked the population for forgiveness after imposing a lockdown, the BBC reports. After the shutdown, which was implemented with less than four hours\u2019 notice, was criticised for lacking a proper plan, Modi apologised for the impact in his weekly radio address. \u201cPossibly many would be angry at me for being locked in their homes. I understand your troubles but there was no other way to wage war against coronavirus. For a country like India with a population of 1.3 billion it is a battle of life and death and we have to win it,\u201d he said. Kuwait\u2019s health ministry has announced 20 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 225. Seven of the new cases are related to travel to the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. 13 others were infected due to their contact with previously confirmed cases, the health ministry said. Kuwait has reported 67 recoveries so far. Spain and Italy demanded more European help as they fight still-surging coronavirus infections amid the continents worst crisis since the second world war, the Associated Press reports. Both countries together account for more than half of the world\u2019s Covid-19 death toll, and are still seeing over 800 deaths a day each. Europe must demonstrate that it is able to respond to this historic call, the Italian premier, Giuseppe Conte, said on Saturday evening. \u201cI will fight until the last drop of sweat, until the last gram of energy, to obtain a strong, vigorous, cohesive European response,\u201d he said. The death toll of some countries could yet be much higher than reported, experts say, as unlike the US, France and Italy for instance do not count deaths that take place in nursing homes or in homes among their virus numbers. More news from my colleague Tom Phillips, our Latin America correspondent: Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 has called for the creation of an emergency government of national unity to face up to the coronavirus crisis. Guaid\u00f3 has been fighting to topple Nicolas Maduro since January 2019, so this represents a major direction change for his campaign. In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has reportedly told his health minister he will sack him if he criticises his handling of the coronavirus crisis. The health minister, in return, has asked Bolsonaro whether he is really ready to see army trucks transporting hundreds and hundreds of bodies through the streets of Brazilian cities in front of the cameras. One Brazilian commentator has come up with a new nickname for Brazil\u2019s far-right leader in today\u2019s paper: \u201cCaptain Corona.\u201d The sale of alcohol has been banned in the Greenland capital, Nuuk, in an attempt to reduce violence against children during the period of confinement, AFP reports. \u201cIn such a situation, we have to take numerous measures to avoid infection,\u201d the government leader Kim Kielsen said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cBut at the heart of my decision is the protection of children, they have to have a safe home.\u201d Nearly one in three people living in the autonomous Danish Arctic territory suffered sexual abuse during childhood. Experts link the abuse to alcohol, drugs and ignorance of children\u2019s rights. After Greenland closed down schools from Monday with 10 cases of the novel coronavirus diagnosed, a rise in violence followed. \u201cUnfortunately, in Nuuk, domestic violence has been on the rise in recent weeks,\u201d the health minister Martha Abelsen told local media. Excessive drinking by parents exposes children to dangers in the home, Greenlanders were warned. The alcohol ban came into force on Saturday and is scheduled to last until 15 April. Mexico has implored its 130 million citizens to stay at home for a month, arguing that is the only way to slow the transmission of the coronavirus through Latin America\u2019s second biggest economy. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has been condemned for his dismissive response to the crisis and for continuing to attend public events, where he has hugged and kissed fans. On Saturday afternoon, one of the country\u2019s top health officials issued a direct plea to Mexican citizens not to go out. \u201cWe need to reduce the speed of transmission urgently. Urgently. This is our last chance to do it and do it now,\u201d said Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, the deputy health minister. \u201cAnd this means we need to stay at home in massive numbers.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador, had made a similar call on Friday night in a pre-recorded message to the nation. But on Sunday morning the leftwing populist was out and about again, tweeting video footage from a tour he is conducting of cities along the Mexico-US border. So far 848 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Mexico and 16 deaths, although low testing rates means the real numbers are likely to be higher. Here a few key developments at a glance: Spain has recorded a further 838 deaths, a record daily increase of fatalities in the country. Tokyo has confirmed 68 new coronavirus cases, another record daily increase, as millions of people in and around Tokyo are urged to stay at home unless a trip outside is necessary. The British cabinet minister Michael Gove has said the lockdown restrictions in the UK could remain in place for a \u201csignificant period\u201d, as criticism mounted over the government\u2019s testing of cases and ordering of ventilators under an EU scheme they did not participate in because of \u201ccommunication problems\u201d. Italy\u2019s deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, has said he expects the country, which is globally the worst affected by Covid-19 and has now recorded more than 10,000 deaths, to hit its infection peak in no more than 10 days. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced further restrictions for the population, including limiting public gatherings to just two people. People should only leave their homes for essential reasons, and those over the age of 70 should stay home, he said. Domestic abuse victims are allowed to leave home to seek help despite the lockdown rules, the UK home secretary, Priti Patel, has said in a column in the Mail on Sunday. The Swiss Covid-19 death toll has risen to 257, up from 235 on the previous day, with the number of confirmed cases now at 14,336, from 13,213. All travellers entering South Korea will be subjected to two weeks of mandatory quarantine starting at midnight next Wednesday, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, announced on Sunday. Domestic flights will resume in Hubei province, except in Wuhan, from Sunday midnight local time, as China\u2019s new infections continue to fall. The Swiss Covid-19 death toll has risen from 235 to 257 in a day, Reuters report. The number of confirmed cases has increased to 14,336 from 13,213, the Swiss health agency said. Mass funerals still being held in ultra-Orthodox Jewish circles in Israel are threatening to accelerate the spread of the virus in the country, the Haaretz newspaper reported. An estimated 300 people ignored social distancing rules and participated in the funeral of rabbi Tzvi Shinkar in the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak on Saturday night. The coronavirus is now spreading fastest in ultra-Orthodox communities in Israel, according to internal health ministry figures obtained by Haaretz. The French authorities are leafleting migrants in camps at Calais and Dunkirk this weekend before a \u201cvoluntary\u201d evacuation sparked by concerns about the spread of coronavirus. Police will begin transferring migrants to temporary centres across the on Tuesday. Officials insist this will be done on a \u201cvoluntary basis\u201d, according to reports in the local press. Buses will be sent to the camps transfer occupants to regional centres housing up to 100 people from 31 March. The migrants who agree to leave will be given a medical check before being placed in a bus and taken \u201cfar from Calais and Dunkirk\u201d. Once they reach the temporary accommodation they will be expected to keep the same lockdown rules as the rest of the French population. The decision to evacuate the migrants was taken after consultations with humanitarian organisations working in the camps, say authorities. Many of the French and British humanitarian organisations who have been helping the migrants with food and medical care have pulled out because of the difficulties with working since the national lockdown since 17 March and concerns about the risk to volunteers. There are believed to be around 600 migrants living in between five to eight encampments around the Channel port at Calais. There are an estimated 600 further north at Grande Synthe near Dunkirk. Even before the coronavirus crisis, life in the camps was grim. Volunteers said asking migrants who were often four or five sharing a single tent to maintain \u201csocial distancing\u201d was impossible. Tokyo has confirmed 68 new coronavirus cases, a record daily increase, the public broadcaster NHK reported on Sunday. Japanese authorities fear a rise in cases, after the country has so far benefited from low infection rates in an otherwise troubled region. 1,800 people have been reported infected in Japan, with 55 deaths as of Sunday afternoon, NHK said. Millions of people in and around Tokyo have been asked to avoid non-essential outings until 12 April. France\u2019s high-speed TGV trains are being used to free up intensive care beds in some of the country\u2019s worst-hit areas, AFP reports. The trains have been adapted into hospitals on wheels for transport critical patients around the country. \u201cWe have a lot more space than in an ambulance or a helicopter,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Braun, president of the Samu emergency service. A British national who tested positive for Covid-19 in South Korea may face penalties for not observing quarantine rules. The resident of Suwon, Gyeonggi province, got tested for the virus on 23 March, five days after he returned from a trip to Thailand, the Korea Herald reported. Although he was required to self-isolate until the results were out, he travelled to another city by bike that evening, and the next morning he visited an indoor golf range. Suwon\u2019s mayor, Yeom Tae-young, said on Facebook that the city would hold the person responsible for violating quarantine rules. \u201cThe city will deal with this sternly,\u201d he said. Under recently revised laws, those violating quarantine rules or obstructing quarantine efforts may face up to 1 year in prison and fines of up to 10m won. Additionally, foreign violators could face deportation, authorities said. My colleagues Shaun Walker and Christian Davies have written a story on concerns that eastern Europe might experience a surge in infections after a lack of testing to date. So far, eastern European countries have far lower infection rates than several of their western neighbours. Iran announced 123 more deaths from coronavirus over the past 24 hours, which brings the country\u2019s total to 2,640, AFP reports. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry confirmed seven new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 117, my colleague Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Afghanistan. Six of the new positive cases were reported in the western province of Herat, which neighbors Iran. Spain\u2019s cabinet is meeting this morning to approve a tightening up of the country\u2019s lockdown in which all non-essential workers will be ordered to stay at home for two weeks. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the \u201cextraordinarily tough\u201d measures were needed as the county tries to halt the spread of the virus and reduce the strain on its overstretched hospitals. \u201cThis measure will reduce people\u2019s movement even further [but] it will reduce the risk of contagion and allow us to unblock out intensive care units,\u201d the prime minister said in a televised address on Saturday night. Despite the high death toll of recent days, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said that the situation in some regions appeared to be improving. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there,\u201d Sim\u00f3n told a press conference on Saturday afternoon. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly when we\u2019ll get confirmation, but we\u2019re getting close to the peak of the curve that we\u2019re studying so anxiously. In some parts of the country, they probably may even have passed it \u2013 but we need to be cautious with preliminary information.\u201d A further 838 people have died in Spain over the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. It is the highest daily increase in fatalities so far, bringing the total number of deaths from the virus to 6,528. The total number of infections now stands at 78,797, up from 72,248. An update from the World Health Organization on the coronavirus outbreak in Kenya: Michael Gove has said the peak of the coronavirus is dependent on people\u2019s actions and that the lockdown will remain in place for a significant period. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr programme, the Cabinet Office minister said: It\u2019s difficult to know precisely [when the UK hit the peak of the coronavirus outbreak]. It depends on the action all of us take. if we practice the social distancing measures. If we follow the rules the government has outlined, if we follow that good scientific advice, then we can delay the infection rate and that gives our NHS the chance to become more resilient. So, the date of the peak depends on all of our behaviour. It\u2019s not a fixed point, a date in the calendar like Easter, it is something that all of us can affect by our actions. He added that the public must prepare for a \u201csignificant period\u201d of lockdown. Everyone is making a sacrifice and I appreciate the scale of that sacrifice. But the reason all of us are making these sacrifices is because all of us will have people whom we love who are at risk from this virus. I can\u2019t make an accurate prediction, but everyone does have to prepare for a significant period when these measures are still in place. This from my colleague Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief: Italy\u2019s deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show he thinks the country is nearing the peak of its outbreak. More than 10,000 people in Italy have died far, exceeding by far death rates in other countries. Sileri said that in 10 days \u201cmaximum\u201d the country would see its infection rates reducing. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced further restrictions on movement, including limiting public gatherings to just two people. People should only leave their homes for essential reasons, and those over the age of 70 should stay home, he said. All playgrounds and outdoor gyms parks in Australia will close from Monday. Domestic flights will resume in Hubei province, except at Wuhan\u2019s Tianhe international airport, from Sunday midnight local time, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. All passenger and cargo flights on domestic air routes via airports will resume. The province, for weeks the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, has seen its restrictions being gradually lifted by the government, as the country\u2019s cases of infection has continued to fall. Flights to and from the city of Wuhan are expected resume at midnight on 8 April, when the city\u2019s lockdown is due to be lifted. The Italian deputy health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, has said that the lockdown in the country is beginning to work, but he said it would take at least a fortnight for the benefits to show, after all movement was banned and non-essential businesses closed on Sunday. Over the last few days we had an increase of infections [but] this was due to an increase in [testing]. We are searching more and obviously we have more results of positive people, mainly without symptoms. We are live in the peak of this epidemic. I believe in one week time, 10 days maximum, we will see a significant drop in cases. There were 900 people confirmed to have died in Italy from Covid-19 yesterday, bringing the total in the country to more than 10,000. Sileri rejected reported criticism from China concerning Italy\u2019s apparent failure to lockdown more quickly and more completely. I believe we have been very, very fast. We\u2019ve been very unlucky to have several outbreaks in a very active part of our country, Lombardy, and we did not find patient zero. Probably patient one was not even patient one. All travellers entering South Korea will be subjected to two weeks of mandatory quarantine starting midnight on Wednesday, 1 April, the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, announced on Sunday. \u201cThe measure will also include short-term foreign visitors in order to practically block the entry for unimportant purposes, such as tourism,\u201d Chung said, according to CNN. Those who don\u2019t have an address in the country will be quarantined in a government provided facility for two weeks at their own expense. Previously, the mandatory quarantine order was for travellers coming into South Korea from the US and Europe. The cabinet minister Michael Gove said the UK government is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the rising number of deaths and infections. Gove told Sky News that Britain was now carrying out 10,000 tests per day and the government was doing \u201call that we can\u201d to accelerate that rate. \u201cNaturally we are very concerned and our thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who have lost loved ones in the last few days,\u201d he told Sky News. Qatar Airways will continue to operate flights for as long as necessary to get stranded travellers home but might run out of cash soon, Reuters reported. The airline\u2019s chief executive, Akbar al-Baker, said: \u201cWe have enough cash to take us through a very short period of time,\u201d adding that it would eventually have to seek support from its owner, the Qatar government. Qatar Airways is one of few global carriers to continue operating after the coronavirus outbreak reduced global travel demand drastically over the past weeks. Domestic abuse victims are allowed to leave home to seek help despite the lockdown rules, the home secretary has said. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Priti Patel said restrictions imposed on the population by the government to stay indoors were even more challenging for people whose \u201chome is not the safe haven it should be\u201d. Police and campaigners had previously said the instruction to stay indoors poses risks for domestic abuse victims. \u201cI am acutely aware that the necessary guidelines about social distancing and self-isolation may leave the victims of hidden crime, such as domestic abuse and child sexual abuse, feeling especially isolated, vulnerable and exposed,\u201d Patel wrote. \u201cBut my message to every potential victim is simple: we have not forgotten you and we will not let you down. \u201cAnd my message to every perpetrator is equally as simple: you will not get away with your crimes.\u201d Here my colleague Harriet Sherwood\u2019s story on how the Covid-19 outbreak is driving midwife shortages in the UK. The NHS shortage of midwives has doubled since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, she reports, with one in five midwifery posts now unfilled, raising concerns about the safety of pregnant women, new mothers and newborn babies. The world\u2019s largest glove maker, Malaysia\u2019s Top Glove Corporation Bhd, which makes one in every five gloves globally, expects a product shortage as demand from Europe and the United States is exceeding its capacity, Reuters reports. The company has extended shipping times to cope with the demand surge, according to executive chairman Lim Wee Chai. Lim said orders received in the past few weeks, mainly from Europe and the United States, were almost double the company\u2019s production capacity. Top Glove can produce 200 million natural and synthetic rubber gloves a day. A 33-year-old member of staff of the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, has died from complications with Covid-19, CNN reports. April Dunn served in the governor\u2019s Office of Disability Affairs. \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we mourn the loss of our dear April,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cShe brightened everyone\u2019s day with her smile, was a tremendous asset to our team and an inspiration to everyone who met her. \u201cShe lived her life to the fullest and improved the lives of countless Louisianans with disabilities. April worked hard as an advocate for herself and other members of the disability community.\u201d My colleagues Patrick Greenfield and Erin McCormick have written a story about the crisis-stricken cruise liner Zaandam, which is trying to reach Florida. More than 30,000 people have died after contracting Covid-19, from more than 660,700 confirmed cases. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases, and the US has reported more than 120,000 cases. Japan has reported a record daily increase in cases, with 68 new confirmed diagnoses on Sunday. New Zealand reported its first death on Sunday, Singapore reported its third, Thailand its seventh, and Australia its 15th and 16th. The US CDC issued an immediate warning to residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to avoid all non-essential travel for the next 14 days. It came after US president Donald Trump had earlier proposed an enforced regional quarantine on the state of New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, prompting an angry rebuke from NY governor Andrew Cuomo. Trump later said quarantine would not be necessary and he had asked the CDC to instead issue a serious travel warning for the areas. Spain, Northern Ireland, and Timor-Leste are among countries to introduce new waves of restrictions. Ireland\u2019s Health Service Executive would begin distributing around \u20ac20m worth of personal protective equipment to health workers from Sunday, after the first of up to 11 flights made its way back from China with supplies. Thousands of migrants bound for the US have amassed in immigration shelters in Panama and Costa Rica as plans to relocate them to less crowded areas to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus have faltered. UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 yesterday, has warned British households that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better. The Zandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama Canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, wife of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, said she has recovered from Covid-19. Her husband and their three children have been in isolation and haven\u2019t shown symptoms. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said Hi all, I am taking over the blog from my colleague Helen Davidson. If you want to get my attention with an update on the Covid-19 situation, please flag either on Twitter @JedySays or email me at jedidajah.otte.casual@guardian.co.uk. Here\u2019s a wrap of today\u2019s developments, leading on the news that the US infectious diseases authority, the CDC, has urged millions of residents in three states touching the New York City region to avoid non-essential travel, citing extensive spread of coronavirus among the population. Japan has reported a record daily increase in cases, with 68 mew confirmed diagnoses on Sunday. Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,700, with 55 deaths as of early Sunday, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month, broadcaster NHK reported. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has asked the tens of millions of people in the city and surrounding regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until 12 April, particularly this weekend. There has been enormous concern about efforts taken - in multiple countries - to protect inmates from the virus, including in the US. On Saturday the federal bureau of prisons announced Patrick Jones, a 49-year-old prisoner in Louisiana who was serving a 27-year prison term for a drug charge, had become the first federal inmate to die from Covid-19. According to the BOP\u2019s website on Saturday, there were five inmates who have tested positive for Covid-19 at Oakdale, Reuters reports. Criminal justice advocates and prison union officials have in recent days called on the Justice Department to do more to try and prevent the spread of the virus. Critics have said the Justice Department should fast-track the release of non-violent offenders who qualify based on age and pre-existing conditions. In Australia, group of more than 100 lawyers in Victoria have called for the release of some prisoners during the pandemic, focusing on those who are vulnerable, close to parole, or with fewer than six months to go on their sentence. \u201cThe prison system is not an island and is not immune from the ravages of COVID-19,\u201d they wrote to government. \u201cIt will enter into the system creating intense hotspots, presenting extreme risk to prison and wider communities. Prisoners will be subject to lockdown, social isolation and isolation from their families. Their mortality rates will be higher in custody than if they were in the community. Allowing this unnecessary exposure to a potentially deadly infection to the listed classes of prisoner will be such as to amount to torture.\u201d From Reuters: Cambodia reported one new case of the coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the total to 103 as the country prepares to tighten entry requirements for foreign nationals to try to curb the spread of the virus. The new case is a 30-year-old woman who worked in a karaoke club in Cambodia\u2019s northwestern Banteay Meanchey province, the Ministry of Health said in a statement. A total of 21 patients have recovered since January, the ministry said. Cambodia\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Friday it cancel visas on arrival for foreign nationals for one month, effective midnight of March 30, to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Foreign nationals wishing to travel to Cambodia must obtain a prior visa abroad and they must have medical certificate \u201ccertifying that he/she has not tested positive\u201d with the virus, the ministry said. In addition, the must show proof of medical insurance with coverage of at least $50,000, the ministry said. Singapore has reported its third death from Covid-19. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said a 70 year-old male Singapore citizen with no recent travel history to affected places, died on Sunday. According to Channel News Asia, the man had a hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and was admitted to hospital on 29 February, and had been in intensive care since 2 March. 70 new cases in Singapore were reported on Saturday, bringing the total to 802. Singapore recently introduced new restrictions on social gatherings and services, after concerns about a rise in imported cases and potential community complacency. Thailand has 143 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total of cases since the outbreak to 1,388, the spokesman of the government\u2019s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said on Sunday. It also reported one new fatality, bringing Thailand\u2019s since the outbreak started to seven. Following Trump\u2019s decision not to propose a quarantine over New York and neighbouring states, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a warning against non-essential travel in the region instead. \u201cDue to extensive community transmission of Covid-19 in the area, CDC urges residents of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately,\u201d said the warning issued late on Saturday, local time. It said employees of trucking, food supply, financial services and some other industries were exempt from the measure, and governors of the three states had full discretion over how to carry out the advisory. The first of up to 10 flights to be sent to China to pick up medical equipment for Ireland is on its way back. More than \u20ac225m had been spent on personal protective equipment for Irish health workers, said the minister for health, Simon Harris. Usually around \u20ac15m is spent in a year. Ireland\u2019s Health Service Executive would begin distributing around \u20ac20m worth of equipment from Sunday, after warnings that stocks were running low. One group of doctors told the Irish Times they had procured \u20ac6,000 worth of PPE on their own after losing patience with the HSE. Jim Dolan, the owner of NBA team the New York Knicks, has tested positive for Covid-19. Here\u2019s a quick look at the biggest developments today: More than 30,000 people have died after contracting Covid-19, from more than 660,700 confirmed cases. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases, and the US has reported more than 120,000 cases. New Zealand reported its first death on Sunday. Spain, Northern Ireland, and Timor-Leste are among countries to introduce new waves of restrictions. US president Donald Trump earlier proposed an enforced regional quarantine on the state of New York and parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, prompting an angry rebuke from NY governor Andrew Cuomo. Trump later said quarantine would not be necessary and he had asked the CDC to instead issue a serious travel warning for the areas. UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 yesterday, has warned British households that the virus epidemic will get worse before it gets better. The Zandam cruise ship, which has hundreds of passengers on board including at least 130 with flu-like symptoms, has been granted passage through the Panama Canal. Four people on the ship have died and two of those with symptoms have been diagnosed with Covid-19. And Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, wife of the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, said she has recovered from Covid-19. Her husband and their three children have been in isolation and haven\u2019t shown symptoms. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said South Korea has reported 105 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, bringing the country\u2019s total to 9,583, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Sunday. Virus prevention measures took a violent turn in parts of Africa over the weekend. Read a full report from Jason Burke here, and below are some images which have come through, with details from AP. In Kenya, police fired tear gas at a crowd of ferry commuters as the country\u2019s first day of a coronavirus curfew slid into chaos. \u201cWe were horrified by excessive use of police force ahead of the curfew that began Friday night,\u201d Amnesty International Kenya and 19 other human rights groups said in a statement issued Saturday. The tear gas caused hundreds of people trying to reach a ferry in the port city of Mombasa ahead of the overnight curfew to touch their faces as they vomited, spat and wiped away tears, increasing the chance of the virus spread, the rights groups said. In an apparent show of force on Saturday, South Africa\u2019s military raided a large workers\u2019 hostel in the Alexandra township where some residents had defied the lockdown. From Reuters: Thousands of African, Haitian and Asian migrants bound for the United States have amassed in immigration shelters in Panama and Costa Rica as plans to relocate them to less crowded areas to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus have faltered. Earlier this week, Costa Rica\u2019s government said it had begun transferring about 2,600 migrants headed for the United States from its southern border with Panama to its frontier with Nicaragua, citing concerns that large crowds could further spread the virus. However, the head of Costa Rica\u2019s immigration office, Raquel Vargas, told Reuters on Saturday that the transfer was suspended until further notice. \u201cWe must find a solution,\u201d Vargas said after Nicaragua decided to send its military to its southern border. Vargas said the transfer of the first group of migrants in coordination with Panama was \u201cvery successful,\u201d but that under the current circumstances more people could not be moved. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s wife said Saturday that she has recovered from being ill from COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus. \u201cI am feeling so much better,\u201d Sophie Gregoire Trudeau said in a statement on social media. She said she received the clearance from her doctor and Ottawa Public Health. Trudeau\u2019s office announced on 12 March that she had tested positive for the coronavirus after she fell ill upon returning from a trip to London. The prime minister and his family have been in self isolation at home since then. He and their three children didn\u2019t show symptoms. Timor-Leste has declared a state of emergency as part of its efforts to \u201ccontain the pandemic, save lives and ensure the subsistence of supply chains of essential goods and services for our population\u201d. The declaration by the presidency of the council of ministers said they were taking the action \u201ceven though they may limit some fundamental rights and freedoms\u201d \u201cThese measures are taken with respect for constitutional limits and following the guidelines of the World Health Organisation and the example of other States.\u201d The state of emergency came into place on Sunday, and will run until at least 26 April. Timor-Leste is one of the world\u2019s poorest nations, with around 40% of people living below the poverty line. The government has authorised the transfer of $100m from its petroleum fund to fund emergency measures and the purchase of medical supplies. Foreigners are prohibited from entering the country, except for foreigners born in Timor-Leste, resident citizens and legal representatives of minors of Timorese nationality. The restriction doesn\u2019t apply to oil rig workers in the Timor Sea. Anyone entering the country must quarantine for 14 days. Commercial and service establishments, markets and street vendors are allowed, but public transport will cease. Everyone must wear masks when entering commercial or servicing venues, and maintain hygiene and social distancing. All school activities are suspended on a face-to-face basis and the facilities of educational, education and vocational training establishments are closed. Teachers and students are prohibited from staying in the premises. Distance learning should be promoted through the means of information and communication in this period. Licences, authorisations, visas and residence permits, and other administrative acts and documents will remain valid regardless of expiry dates. In Argentina, Uki Go\u00f1i reports some optimism. Authorities are hopeful that Argentina may have imposed its nationwide lockdown early enough to avoid the kind of difficult scenarios seen in the US or Europe. The country added only 55 new cases of coronavirus and two deaths to its toll Saturday, bringing the total to 745 cases and 19 deaths so far, a sharp drop from the 101 cases Friday. \u201cThe spike is moving to May and we are hoping it won\u2019t be abrupt,\u201d said health minister Gin\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez Garc\u00eda. The lockdown was declared on March 20 when there were only 128 cases and three deaths reported. The government\u2019s deepest concern regarding the spread of the virus is the Greater Buenos Aires area around the capital city of buenos Aires, with a population of over 12 million people. Some 21% of the GBA live in shanty towns, most of them without access to running water, nearly half of whom sleep more than three to a room. Unemployment is over 10% and 40% of the employed are informal workers without benefits. \u201cThe quarantine is a dramatic situation for people in vulnerable situations,\u201d said Agust\u00edn Salvia of the Social Observatory of the Catholic University of Buenos Aires, which provides the most reliable statistics on poverty in Argentina. The quarantine has had one unexpected consequence, according to pharmacists, a shortage of Viagra, after the stock for March sold out early. \u201cThere was an unexpected consumption,\u201d said Marcelo Peretta, head of the Argentine Union of Pharmacists, who blamed the free time at home by the imposed quarantine for the run on the erectile dysfunction drug. \u201cWe had to limit the amount sold per person, we never thought we\u2019d sell this much Viagra.\u201d Further details on the first Covid-19 related death in New Zealand. The woman, who authorities said had underlying health conditions, was reportedly diagnosed with influenza on admittance to hospital. New Zealand health officials confirmed new 63 cases on Sunday \u2013 a drop from the increase of the previous two days \u2013 with the overall number of coronavirus cases standing at 514, said the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield. Nine were receiving hospital care and one other was in intensive care on a ventilator. From Reuters: Mexico\u2019s deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell called on Saturday on all residents in Mexico to stay at home for a month, saying it was the only way to reduce the transmission rate of the coronavirus. Mexican health authorities said there was a total of 848 confirmed cases in Mexico as of Saturday, 131 more than the previous day, and 16 deaths. President Donald Trump will send off a naval hospital ship Saturday before it heads to New York City, as he aims to highlight the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. The USNS Comfort, a 1,000-bed hospital ship, had been undergoing planned maintenance, but was rushed back into service to aid the city which is now the centre of the nation\u2019s outbreak. It is scheduled to arrive Monday at a Manhattan pier a week after its sister ship, the USNS Mercy arrived in Los Angeles to preform similar duty on the West Coast. Trump, 73, is in a high-risk category because of his age, and federal guidance for weeks has advised those in that pool to refrain from non-essential travel of all sorts. He has already tested negative once after close contact with officials who came down with the virus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to be hugging people and it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to be shaking people\u2019s hands and everything,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I think it sends a signal when the president is able to go there and say thank you. So, you know, we\u2019ll be careful.\u201d China reported 45 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for 28 March, down from 54 on the previous day, Reuters reports. All but one involved travelers from overseas, the country\u2019s health authority said on Sunday. The reported number of imported cases also fell from 54 on the previous day, data from the National Health Commission showed. China also reported five new deaths on Saturday, all of which were in Wuhan in Hubei province, where the Covid-19 respiratory illness was first identified. A total of 3,300 people have now died in mainland China, with a reported 81,439 infections. Saturday marked the fourth consecutive day that Hubei province recorded no new confirmed cases. With traffic restrictions in the province lifted, Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, is also gradually reopening borders and restarting some local transportation services. The only domestic transmission on Saturday was recorded in central China\u2019s Henan province, which borders Hubei. Still in Australia, a 75-year-old Queensland woman, who had been on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship, has died overnight. A man aged in his 80s also died in a Melbourne hospital overnight. The deaths bring Australia\u2019s toll to 16. For more details on this and Morrison\u2019s press conference, follow our Australia-focussed blog here. Australian authorities are giving an update of the situation there. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia\u2019s daily rate of increase in cases had dropped from between 25-30% to 13-15%. Morrison says this shows the government\u2019s containment measures (which have caused some confusion among Australians with some very specific limits like a maximum 30 minutes at a hairdresser, only five people at a wedding, but 10 people at a bootcamp or funeral), are working. But the government will not release modelling to show this. Morrison pushes back on questions about adopting tactics used by other countries. He says they won\u2019t \u201ccut and paste measures from other places where they have completely different societies\u201d. He cites Chinese authorities welding people\u2019s doors shut, suggesting that maybe people were \u201cOK with that\u201d. Morrison has told media that of the country\u2019s 3,809 confirmed cases, 2,562 were imported from overseas. New Zealand, which is a few days into a lockdown lasting at least four weeks, has reported the first death attributed to Covid-19. Dr Ashley Bloomfield said the West Coast woman was in her 70s, and was initially diagnosed with influenza. Because of this hospital staff were only wearing PPE suitable for a case of influenza, not Covid-19, and 21 people were now in self-isolation. Bloomfield said none of the staff were showing symptoms, and staffing at the hospital wouldn\u2019t be affected because of the cancellation of all elective procedures. New Zealand has 514 cases, most with a link to international travel. \u201cToday\u2019s death is the reminder of the fight that we have on our hands,\u201d prime minister Jacinda Ardern said. \u201cStay at home, break the chain, and save lives.\u201d Donald Trump has now said there will be no need to enforce a regional quarantine on New York and neighbouring states. A few minutes ago the president tweeted that he would instead have the CDC issue \u201ca strong travel advisory\u201d. US president Donald Trump has flagged an enforced regional quarantine of the state of New York, and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about certain things. Some people would like to see New York quarantined because it\u2019s a hotspot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might not have to do it, but there\u2019s a possibility that sometime today we\u2019ll do a quarantine, short-term, two weeks on New York. Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut. This would be an enforceable quarantine. I\u2019d rather not do it, but maybe we need it.\u201d But New York governor Andrew Cuomo says it wasn\u2019t mentioned when they spoke, and he\u2019s said such a move would be \u201ca federal declaration of war\u201d. Why you would want to just create total pandemonium on top of a pandemic I have no idea,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s totally opposite with what the president would want to do, work with the states, get the economy running and get some sense of stability. You wouldn\u2019t at this point literally fracture the entire nation because it\u2019s not just New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, it\u2019s Louisiana and New Orleans. The numbers will continue to rise and every few days it\u2019s going to be another hotspot.\u201d He added: \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. If we start walling off areas all across the country it would just be totally bizarre, counterproductive, anti-American, anti-social.\u201d Read more here. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to colleagues in the UK for running the last day\u2019s coverage, which you can catch up on here. If you have questions, comments, or contributions, you can reach me on Twitter @heldavidson In the meantime, here are the latest updates: The global death toll has passed 30,000, with confirmed cases at 660,706. Northern Ireland has announced a wave of new restrictive measures which came into force an hour ago, including a ban on gatherings and leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Spain has announced further restrictions on movement to stem the flow of the virus, with all non-essential workers being told to stay home. Panama\u2019s government has said it will allow the Zaandam cruise ship to pass through the Panama Canal, after passengers got stuck on board when authorities refused to grant access. The cruise ship has 130 people with flu-like symptoms, and four have died. At least two of those with symptoms are confirmed to have coronavirus. The coronavirus death toll in France has passed the grim milestone of 2,000 deaths, with more than 38,000 cases. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliff, the British-Iranian aid worker who has been detained in Iran on spying charges has had her prison leave extended and her case put forward for clemency, her husband said Cases in the US have passed 120,000. A letter from UK prime minister Boris Johnson will be sent to every household in Britain, warning them that the worst of the virus is yet to come.",
