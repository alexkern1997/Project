The two, one young person and one elderly, remain well and are being housed in a separate isolation unit inside the Manigurr-ma village outside Darwin, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer said Friday morning. Public health authorities from their home states were organising medical transfers for the patients and their partners. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said all of the 164 Australian citizens and permanent residents evacuated from the Diamond Princess on Thursday, and flown to Darwin, were health screened before boarding the Qantas flight out of Japan.

Two people who contracted the illness on board the ship, an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman, have died. The quarantine procedures on board have been criticised, in particular the failure to isolate known cases from uninfected people. In a YouTube video since pulled offline, Kentaro Iwata, professor at the infectious diseases division of Japan\u2019s Kobe University, described the situation on board as \u201cchaotic\u201d and \u201ccompletely inadequate in terms of infection control\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Top-rating broadcaster Ray Hadley has accused fellow rightwing commentator Andrew Bolt of being \u201csoft on paedophiles\u201d in an extraordinary blast on his 2GB morning show. Hadley took aim at Bolt for his widely condemned comments about ABC Four Corners and St Kevin\u2019s victim Paris Street on the Bolt Report. After Street wrote an open letter to Bolt saying his comments made him sick, the News Corp journalist apologised on Sky News for upsetting him, saying he regretted using the phrase \u201chit on\u201d. On Friday\u2019s show Hadley said Bolt\u2019s claim that Street wasn\u2019t sexually assaulted but was \u201chit on\u201d was \u201cdemeaning, insulting and beyond the pale\u201d. \u201cYou do a lot of good in the community, but, by crikey, when it comes to paedophilia you\u2019ve got a very poor record,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cA very poor record. Which has compelled you to apologise to Street today. \u201cMr Bolt has a history of defending people who are convicted of paedophilia. He has a history of it! Even when appeals are denied, he has a history of it. Now that\u2019s on his conscience, not mine.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve been an ambassador for Bravehearts for two decades, Mr Bolt. I\u2019ll stand by my record in condemning paedophilia against yours any day of the week.\u201d Hadley said Bolt\u2019s comments on the case showed he was ignorant of the facts and had a complete lack of understanding of the victims of child sexual abuse. \u201cDefending paedophiles! ... Then apologising when he\u2019s attacked by me and others. That poor boy shouldn\u2019t have been penning that letter. He shouldn\u2019t have been subjected to that on Sky News. And I hope that there\u2019s been a lesson well-learned here by Mr Bolt. \u201cAnd the only reason you made an apology is because you\u2019ve been targeted by various social media groups for your creepy behaviour!\u201d Camp Hill murders coverage condemned Many of the front pages about the horrific murder of Hannah Clarke and her three young children in Brisbane on Wednesday focused on the scourge of domestic violence and the \u201cevil\u201d, \u201cunthinkable\u201d act of a \u201cmongrel\u201d man who killed his estranged wife and children. The Courier Mail, the Daily Telegraph and the West Australian were strong in their condemnation on Friday. But not all the coverage has been appropriate and some headlines received criticism online for lauding the murderer, such as \u201cEx footy star who died in burning car\u201d from Fox Sports and \u201cEx-Rugby League star Rowan Baxter, his wife and three children die in car fire tragedy\u201d from the UK Mirror. The Daily Mail had particularly appalling takes: \u201c\u2018Chin up bro, everything will work out\u2019: Chilling last post to ex-footy star days before he was torched to death inside a car with his three kids as friend says he was \u2018depressed about splitting from his wife\u2019\u201d and \u201cEx-footy star who died in burning car showered kids with love\u201d. However, some critics leapt to condemn reporters without understanding the legal restrictions media face in reporting unfolding events. The police don\u2019t immediately confirm what they suspect, making it hard to report some facts early on, such as whether the car was deliberately set alight. Drone delivery tall tale takes flight There was a rare light-hearted news story to emerge from the coronavirus outbreak last week. An Australian couple quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan had ordered bottles of wine by drone. \u201cAn Australian couple quarantined on a cruise ship due to the deadly coronavirus kept the party flowing by getting a drone to deliver wine straight to their cabin,\u201d the Australian reported. \u201cJan and Dave Binskin, from Queensland, have chronicled their journey of boredom and booze while stranded on the Diamond Princess ship off the coast of Tokyo for the past week. \u201c\u2018Thank God for drones, the Japanese Coast Guard did not know what the fuck was going on\u2019,\u201d the couple was quoted as saying. The Oz was not alone. Fox.news.com was also excited by this yarn: \u201cWe\u2019ll drink to that,\u201d the Fox reporter wrote. \u201cAn Australian couple has made the best of a bad situation.\u201d This tale of the resourceful couple made it into the Mail Online, the New York Post, nine.com.au, Pedestrian.tv, Gizmodo, Yahoo.com.au and US news site ABC 14 News \u201cInventive Aussies stuck on coronavirus cruise ship in Japan get their wine club to bring them two cases of booze delivered by DRONE,\u201d the MailOnline said.

The wine came from the cabin steward and not a drone. Days after a the publication of a comprehensive fact check by AFP Fact Check all the stories remain online. Fake news, real risk The drone story was just one of many fake news stories around the coronavirus scare. Last week we had the map showing the pattern of global air traffic 10 years ago was used by several major Australian media organisations to show the alleged spread of the epidemic. This week researchers from East Anglia University looked at the impact of scare stories, rumours and false information about diseases such as norovirus, flu and monkeypox and found that about 40% of people in the UK believe at least one conspiracy theory of some kind. They say the misinformation on social media during infectious disease outbreaks, including the current novel coronavirus epidemic, can cost lives.

Many considered Suleimani to have been the second most powerful person in Iran, behind supreme leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, but arguably ahead of President Hassan Rouhani. He was commander of the Quds Force, the elite, external wing of the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which the Trump administration designated as a terror organisation in April last year.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>He was born in Rabor, a city in eastern Iran, and forced to travel to a neighbouring city at age 13 and work to pay his father\u2019s debts to the government of the Shah. By the time the monarch fell in 1979, Suleimani was committed to the clerical rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and joined the Revolutionary Guards, the paramilitary force established to prevent a coup against the newly declared Islamic Republic.</p>\n    <p>Within two years, he was sent to the front to fight in the war against the invading Iraqi army. He quickly distinguished himself, especially for daring reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines, and the war also gave him his first contact with foreign militias of the kind he would wield to devastating effect in the decades to come.</p>\n    <p>By the the time the Iraq government fell in 2003, Suleimani was the head of the Quds force and blamed for sponsoring the Shia militias who killed thousands of civilian Iraqis and coalition troops. As fighting raged on Iraq\u2019s streets, Suleimani fought a shadow war with the US for leverage over the new Iraqi leadership.</p>\n    <p>Once described by American commander David Petraeus as \u2018a truly evil figure\u2019, Suleimani was instrumental in crushing street protests in Iran in 2009. In recent months outbreaks of popular dissent in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran were again putting pressure on the crescent of influence he had spent the past two decades building. Violent crackdowns on the protests in Baghdad were blamed on militias under his influence.<br></p>\n    <p>Eighteen months before his death, Suleimani had issued Donald Trump a public warning, wagging his finger and dressed in olive fatigues. \u201cYou will start the war but we will end it.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-safi\"><b>Michael Safi</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Many of those advocating abstention are close to despair and admit they have been over-optimistic about the change that can be achieved under the uncompromising supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p> \n<p>Yet some figures in government are nervous, fearing that the guardian council may have shot itself in the foot and depressed the turnout in urban areas by going so much further than normal in debarring so many prominent reformists.</p> \n<p>As a result, patriotic calls to vote to defeat the west came from every layer of Iranian government \u2013 military, political and clerical.</p> \n<p>Hesameddin Ashena, a senior adviser to the president, Hassan Rouhani, said that however angry people might feel, abstention \u201cwill only please Iran\u2019s enemies and lead to increased sanctions, an increased probability of military invasion, larger budgets for hired anti-Iranian media, a decline in national resilience and reduced political bargaining power\u201d.</p> \n<p>Khamenei himself warned that \u201cfriends and foe are watching out for the election results\u201d.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018Never just a daughter \u2013 my very best friend\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the news that matters most this morning.</p> \n<p>The New Zealand man found guilty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/grace-millane-man-jailed-for-life-for-killing-of-uk-backpacker\">murdering British backpacker Grace Millane</a> in November 2018 has been sentenced to life in prison, with no parole for at least 17 years. Millane, 22, from Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she died by strangulation in the Auckland hotel room of a man she met on the dating app Tinder. The man took photographs, then packed her body into a suitcase and buried her in bushland. Her remains were found eight days later. \u201cManual strangulation is a particularly intimate form of violence \u2026 cold-blooded,\u201d said Justice Simon Moore in Auckland\u2019s high court on Friday morning. \u201cYour actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim \u2026 You didn\u2019t ring an ambulance, or call the police, instead you embarked on a well-planned and sustained and coordinated course of action to conceal any evidence of what had occurred in your room.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grace\u2019s parents, David and Gillian, appeared via videolink in the courtroom. \u201cThe tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be being able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye,\u201d said Gillian. \u201cGrace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/a-life-sentence-grace-millane-leaves-trail-of-shattered-lives\">my very best friend</a>.\u201d The crown prosecutor, Brian Dickey, said the man\u2019s crime against Millane had been \u201cpersonalised, depraved and callous\u201d. By court order the man\u2019s name cannot be published and the reason for this is also suppressed.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Worker rules \u2018will fuel modern slavery\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Closing UK borders to low-skilled workers risks driving vulnerable EU citizens into modern slavery, charities have warned. The East European Resource Centre predicts some businesses might be happy to hire undocumented workers if the supply of low-skilled workers is choked off by the Tories\u2019 immigration policy. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/immigration-rules-post-brexit-could-fuel-modern-slavery-say-charities\">someone will have to do the dirty, low-paid jobs</a>, from construction to food processing to social care. Where are these workers going to come from?\u201d said Barbara Drozdowicz, the centre\u2019s chief executive. Critics of the government\u2019s proposed immigration laws say they do not make sense in an economy where there is near full employment. Emily Kenway, from Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: \u201cIf you take away the legal routes, people are just going to fall into the hands of traffickers.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Never just a daughter \u2013 my very best friend\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray bringing you the news that matters most this morning. The New Zealand man found guilty of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane in November 2018 has been sentenced to life in prison, with no parole for at least 17 years. Millane, 22, from Essex, was on a round-the-world trip when she died by strangulation in the Auckland hotel room of a man she met on the dating app Tinder. The man took photographs, then packed her body into a suitcase and buried her in bushland. Her remains were found eight days later. \u201cManual strangulation is a particularly intimate form of violence \u2026 cold-blooded,\u201d said Justice Simon Moore in Auckland\u2019s high court on Friday morning. \u201cYour actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim \u2026 You didn\u2019t ring an ambulance, or call the police, instead you embarked on a well-planned and sustained and coordinated course of action to conceal any evidence of what had occurred in your room.\u201d Grace\u2019s parents, David and Gillian, appeared via videolink in the courtroom. \u201cThe tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be being able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye,\u201d said Gillian. \u201cGrace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, my very best friend.\u201d The crown prosecutor, Brian Dickey, said the man\u2019s crime against Millane had been \u201cpersonalised, depraved and callous\u201d. By court order the man\u2019s name cannot be published and the reason for this is also suppressed. * * * Worker rules \u2018will fuel modern slavery\u2019 \u2013 Closing UK borders to low-skilled workers risks driving vulnerable EU citizens into modern slavery, charities have warned. The East European Resource Centre predicts some businesses might be happy to hire undocumented workers if the supply of low-skilled workers is choked off by the Tories\u2019 immigration policy. \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves: someone will have to do the dirty, low-paid jobs, from construction to food processing to social care. Where are these workers going to come from?\u201d said Barbara Drozdowicz, the centre\u2019s chief executive. Critics of the government\u2019s proposed immigration laws say they do not make sense in an economy where there is near full employment. Emily Kenway, from Focus on Labour Exploitation, said: \u201cIf you take away the legal routes, people are just going to fall into the hands of traffickers. If we think of the tragedy in October when 39 Vietnamese people were killed, you see the terrible consequences of that.\u201d * * * D\u00e1il number incomplete \u2013 Leo Varadkar has resigned as Ireland\u2019s taoiseach as the wrangling to form a government continues following the election. Varadkar will remain as caretaker in the post, equivalent to prime minister, until his Fine Gael party, Fianna F\u00e1il, Sinn F\u00e9in or a combination of those and others can assemble a working majority. Last night, at a testy sitting of the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann, Varadkar, the Sinn F\u00e9in leader, Mary Lou McDonald, the Fianna F\u00e1il leader, Miche\u00e1l Martin, and the Green party leader, Eamon Ryan, were all nominated for taoiseach but fell far short of receiving the votes required. Several left wing parties supported McDonald for taoiseach, underlining their preference for a left wing rainbow coalition. But, writes Rory Carroll, there is widespread acceptance that a stable government will require two of the three big parties \u2013 and Fine Gael appears determined to go into opposition, saying it needs to regroup after nine years in office and a hammering from voters. * * * Regions miss share of jobs \u2013 Almost half of new jobs in England in the past decade were in London and the south-east, which hold only a third of the population, the thinktank IPPR North has found. The north-east and north-west of England and Yorkshire and the Humber had 17% of the country\u2019s new jobs despite containing 28% of the population. Boris Johnson, has promised to put \u201clevelling up\u201d regional divides at the top of his government\u2019s agenda but Luke Raikes from IPPR North said: \u201cThis parliament must be the devolution parliament. It is time to overturn the centralisation that\u2019s let towns, cities and regions fall into decline \u2026 Levelling up should mean opening the door for all of England to benefit from devolution, while also letting areas that have devolution take on more.\u201d In today\u2019s long read, Luke Brown tells the story of how his Lancashire hometown of Fleetwood \u2013 the once-proud fishing port, home of Fleetwood Town FC and its Cod Army, as well as Fisherman\u2019s Friend lozenges \u2013 is hanging on, and the people who won\u2019t give up on it. And there is hope in Redcar, North Yorkshire, where a land deal means steelmaking could be back up and running within three years. * * * \u2018Tap forgotten shares for charity\u2019 \u2013 A government scheme that gives proceeds of dormant bank accounts to good causes could raise a further \u00a32bn by expanding to unclaimed insurance payouts and share sales. Since 2011 the UK\u2019s 30 biggest banks and building societies have been voluntarily transferring money left in dormant bank accounts to the scheme, called Big Society Capital, with \u00a3600m redistributed to charities helping young people get into work and housing, and others tackling financial exclusion.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of what\u2019s happened so far on Friday. 450 more passengers disembarked from the Diamond Princess. Two Australians passengers who were repatriated from Japan tested positive for the virus after arriving home. Another doctor in Wuhan died from the virus. He was 29. South Korea reported a big jump in confirmed cases, to 156, as it added 52 new cases on Friday. The vast majority of new cases were in the city of Daegu, where special measures were put in place to control the virus\u2019s spread. New cases in China reported on Friday totalled 1,109, up from 394 reported on Thursday. The total numbers of infections stands at 75,685. China reported 118 deaths nationally, taking total deaths from the outbreak to 2,236. 500 Chinese prisoners are infected with Covid-19, across three provinces. This includes 230 inmates at Wuhan\u2019s Women\u2019s Prison, where the director was sacked. The director of Wuhan Women\u2019s Prison has been removed from her position, according to the Hubei Daily, where it\u2019s believed 230 inmates have tested positive for Covid-19. Another 41 prisoners in Shayang Hanjin prison, also tested positive, according to reports in the Hubei Daily. The Global Times has reported on new cases in prisons in two other provinces (202 in Shandong, 28 in Zejiang). By my calculation that adds up to 500 new cases in prisons across three provinces. Agence France-Presse has conducted interviews with some of the crew members of the Diamond Princess, who were not subject to the same quarantine restrictions on the ship. They (the crew) were preparing food and delivering meals to cabins, leading some critics to charge they were inadvertently spreading the virus throughout the ship, which has seen more than 600 cases of the potentially deadly COVID-19 disease. As they have been in close contact with possibly infected passengers, the crew is expected to undergo a 14-day quarantine starting when the last passenger leaves the ship. Crew have generally been reticent to speak to media, apparently concerned for their jobs, but some have broken their silence to describe difficult conditions and fear on board. Sonali Thakkar, a 24-year-old security officer on board, told AFP in an interview crews were sleeping two to a cabin, sharing washrooms and eating together, \u201cso the disease can spread very easily.\u201d \u201cWe do have a lot of fear, me and my colleagues, more than 1000 crew. We\u2019ve been working since the quarantine started. As the days pass and the number of patients increase, the crew is feeling more afraid,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are scared that it can spread really fast and all we want is tests to be done and to be separated from those who are positive. We don\u2019t want to stay on board.\u201d Her father Dinesh said: \u201cSonali is stuck in a small windowless room on the cruise and is very scared... We speak to her every day trying to calm her.\u201d \u201cWhy did the government wait for so long as more and more people got infected? She should have been rescued with other Indians from the cruise long ago. This is very wrong,\u201d he told AFP. Hubei province has revised its new cases for Friday up from 411 to 631, which pushes the day\u2019s total across china above 1,100. New deaths in Hubei remained unchanged at 115. \u201cThe prison system has increased by a total of 220 cases,\u201d the bulletin from the Hubei health commission says. A note at the top of the commission\u2019s revised figures says: \u201ccurrently, there is no access to the province prison network reporting system of infectious diseases\u201d. It also says 271 cases were reported by the prison department, of which 51 seem to have been counted previously, and the remaining 220 were added to the daily total of new cases today. In case you missed this, the BBC\u2019s Stephen McDonell has made a video about the empty streets of Beijing and how its citizens are coping with the virus lockdown. China\u2019s Global Television Network is reporting that 200 prisoners in a facility in the eastern province of Shandong are infected with Covid-19. The sources of the infection is reported to be an affected prison guard. Car sales plummeted in China in February, state media is reporting. Another doctor in Wuhan has died from the virus. According to health authorities, 29 year old Peng Yinhua, working in respiratory and critical care at Wuhan\u2019s Jiangxia district\u2019s First People\u2019s Hospital, died at 9:50pm on Thursday. Peng had contracted the virus and was admitted to hospital on 25 January, where his condition worsened by the 30th. He was sent to Jinyin Tan hospital in Wuhan for emergency treatment and died at the hospital. The Jiangxia health commission said it expressed its \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d to Peng\u2019s family. Jiangxia district had previously held Peng up as an example of the many doctors fighting on the frontline of the outbreak, featuring an article about Peng delaying his wedding in order to work. On Weibo, news of his death has travelled quickly, with more than 190 million views. \u201cThe bride will never get her bridegroom back home again,\u201d one user wrote. The Japanese media outlet, NHK, says a third group of passengers has left the stricken cruise ship in Yokohama. Some 700 people have disembarked since Wednesday and another 450 are expected to get off on Friday, NHK says. Only those who have tested negative are being allowed to leave, but \u201canyone who shared a cabin with an infected passenger is being asked to stay onboard for another 14 days after they separated \u2013 even if they have tested negative\u201d, the report says. We\u2019re getting some more detail on the 52 new cases of Covid-19 in South Korea. Yonhap news agency is reporting that 41 are in the city of Daegu, 300km southeast of Seoul, and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang Province. Another three were reported in Seoul, the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement. Of the 52 new cases, 39 are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Daegu. Around 1,000 members of the church have been asked to self isolate. Yonhap also reported that military personnel have been confirmed as having Covid-19. Three cases were confirmed, one each in the army, the navy and the air force, it said. All three are believed to have visited or contacted people from Daegu. Meanwhile, in the capital, Seoul, authorities are taking measures to curtail the virus, including banning rallies and closing down Shincheonji church services, Yonhap said. Two Chinese officials have been removed from their posts at prisons, after both centres recorded confirmed cases of Covid-19, the state-owned Global Times is reporting. Just doubling back on those figures for the virus in China ... there were 889 new confirmed cases reported in Friday\u2019s national briefing from the country\u2019s health commission, which is a jump up from the 394 reported the previous day. The total number of infections stands at 75,465. You may recall that the way China reports cases changed again yesterday, to remove patients who had been clinically diagnosed (by a doctor/scan) who had subsequently tested negative for the virus. This appeared to influence the trend down on Thursday, compared to Wednesday. Trying to establish trends on a day-to-day basis is difficult, but generally, it would seem new cases are trending down, as you can see in the Johns Hopkins University graph of confirmed cases below. On Friday China reported 118 deaths (on Thursday it was 114), taking the total number of fatalities to 2,236. South Korea has seen a significant rise in Covid-19 cases \u2013 from 104 to 156 \u2013 prompting the PM to declare \u201cstrong and swift\u201d measures will be taken to tackle the outbreak. \u201cSpecial care zones\u201d have been designated in Daegu and Cheongdo. The latter recorded the country\u2019s first death from the virus on Thursday, according to Yonhap news agency. Seventy cases have been reported in Daegu (population 2.4 million) this week, many linked to a controversial \u201ccult\u201d church. The city\u2019s mayor said residents faced an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d from the virus outbreak. As of Friday more than 400 members of the church were showing symptoms of the disease, Reuters reports, though tests were still ongoing, Daegu mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said at a briefing. After several military members tested positive for the virus on Thursday, South Korea\u2019s defence minister banned all soldiers from taking leave, leaving their barracks, and receiving guests. Two Australians who were repatriated from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for Covid-19 after returning home. More than 160 Australians onboard the cruise liner were flown to the Howard Springs camp outside the northern city of Darwin on Wednesday. At news conference on Thursday local medical authorities said six passengers had cold-like symptoms on arrival and would be tested the virus. They were quarantined from the other passengers, and from other residents at the camp who were evacuated previously from the city of Wuhan. Health authorities say it is possible other Australian passengers from the Diamond Princess may test positive. On Thursday Australia extended its travel ban for people coming from China into a fourth week. It will stay in place until 29 February, despite please from the tertiary education sector, who want their international students to be able to return for the start of the academic year. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. China has recorded 889 new cases, up from 394 recorded on Thursday.

Although this has no dummy entry of its own in Chambers (which tends to be a bit patchy in its treatment of such irregular forms) it should not have been too difficult to relate it to abear, where it does appear. One or two of you queried the spelling of the clue word, even to the point of suggesting that I had misspelt it myself (and in one case even insisting on cluing it as BROUHAHA). It is difficult to account for the fact that C includes it at all since not even the OED has it. One of life\u2019s little mysteries, I guess, and not the easiest of words to clue (in either form), but most of you had a pretty good stab at it, the best being very good indeed. Despite the new PM\u2019s diktat about avoiding its further use, Brexit still figured widely in clues submitted. Perhaps it will quietly die over the coming months, though this household at least continues to mourn the whole wretched business.</p> <p>Of 16 clues nominated as clue of the month, the one receiving most votes was \u2018Little in Italian court one comprehends, words being truncated\u2019 for APOCOPATION. My reference to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in my clue to DAIL drew a few wry comments on how the recent Irish election may affect his career. I expect he\u2019ll continue as a member of parliament, if not a star (and he will forever remain the very pleasing anagram of AARDVARK, of course!).</p> <p>There are plenty of ways to define a br(o)uhaha. One I could not accept involved omitting the hyphen from noun definitions, e.g. \u2018to-do\u2019 and \u2018carry-on\u2019, thus converting them into verbal phrases and thereby changing their meaning for the benefit of the surface reading of the clue. There is no way that BR(O)UHAHA can be seen as a verb.</p> <p>And finally, in connection with the Azed 2,500 lunch in May, the splendidly diligent organisers ask me to mention that they are still taking bookings for the event.

Although this has no dummy entry of its own in Chambers (which tends to be a bit patchy in its treatment of such irregular forms) it should not have been too difficult to relate it to abear, where it does appear. One or two of you queried the spelling of the clue word, even to the point of suggesting that I had misspelt it myself (and in one case even insisting on cluing it as BROUHAHA). It is difficult to account for the fact that C includes it at all since not even the OED has it. One of life\u2019s little mysteries, I guess, and not the easiest of words to clue (in either form), but most of you had a pretty good stab at it, the best being very good indeed. Despite the new PM\u2019s diktat about avoiding its further use, Brexit still figured widely in clues submitted. Perhaps it will quietly die over the coming months, though this household at least continues to mourn the whole wretched business. Of 16 clues nominated as clue of the month, the one receiving most votes was \u2018Little in Italian court one comprehends, words being truncated\u2019 for APOCOPATION. My reference to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in my clue to DAIL drew a few wry comments on how the recent Irish election may affect his career. I expect he\u2019ll continue as a member of parliament, if not a star (and he will forever remain the very pleasing anagram of AARDVARK, of course!). There are plenty of ways to define a br(o)uhaha. One I could not accept involved omitting the hyphen from noun definitions, e.g. \u2018to-do\u2019 and \u2018carry-on\u2019, thus converting them into verbal phrases and thereby changing their meaning for the benefit of the surface reading of the clue. There is no way that BR(O)UHAHA can be seen as a verb. And finally, in connection with the Azed 2,500 lunch in May, the splendidly diligent organisers ask me to mention that they are still taking bookings for the event.

On Friday the Japanese carmakers Nissan and Honda further delayed restarting their manufacturing plants near the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China until at least 11 March after the latest government directive to contain the spread. The shutdown in China has disrupted the global supply chain as carmakers struggle to source the tens of thousands of parts needed for each car. This week, Ralf Speth, the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said the company had been forced to fly parts in suitcases from China to the UK as supplies continued to dwindle.

      "bodyText": "One of Thailand\u2019s most popular opposition parties has been disbanded after it was found to have violated electoral rules by receiving an illegal loan, a decision analysts say is likely to heighten political tensions. The constitutional court dissolved Future Forward on Friday and banned 16 of its leaders from politics for 10 years. Future Forward, which has criticised the Thai army\u2019s influence over politics, was founded less than two years ago but has rapidly emerged as a prominent opposition voice, gaining more than 6m votes during an election last year. Future Forward\u2019s anti-establishment message, and its charismatic leader, the billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, appealed especially to younger voters. But the party has been dogged by legal charges, which it says are politically motivated. On Friday, the court ruled the party had violated election rules by taking a 191.2m baht (\u00a34.7m) loan from Thanathorn. The law limits donations from an individual to 10m baht. Thanathorn denies any wrongdoing, and some political commentators say other parties\u2019 finances have not been scrutinised in the same way. The decision will strengthen the parliamentary strength of a coalition led by Prayuth Chan-ocha. The prime minister, who initially took power in a military coup in 2014, was reinstated as leader during a process critics said was rigged in favour of the army. Thanathorn, who was suspended from parliament in November over separate allegations, said in a comment on Facebook: \u201cWhy do we face a party dissolution, a ban on executives and even jail for wanting to build a new type of honest political party with good intentions and transparency?\u201d Future Forward has been hit with a series of legal charges, some of which carry a possible prison sentence, including sedition and an allegation the party broke public assembly law by organising a flash mob. Last month, the party was cleared of separate claims that it was seeking to overthrow the monarchy and had links to the Illuminati \u2013 a suggestion apparently based on the party\u2019s symbol, an upside-down triangle. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the decision to disband the party was \u201ca critical setback for democratic development\u201d. \u201c[Future Forward] was a party that stood against military-authoritarian rule and more importantly against the circular nature of Thai politics that has made the country stuck at a standstill for 15 years,\u201d he said, adding that other parties had not been held to the same standards. On Friday, an image that read \u201cI am one of 6,330,617 people. Don\u2019t kill our voice,\u201d was shared widely on Twitter, referring to the number of people who voted for Future Forward last year, when it came third in the election. \u201cThis will definitely heighten the political uneasiness in the country,\u201d said Charles Santiago, a Malaysian MP and chair of the Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights, an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian nations. \u201cIt\u2019s going to create a sense of illegitimacy on the part of government and young people feeling they are being locked out of the system.\u201d Most of the party\u2019s lawmakers will retain their seats and can form a new party, but the ban on its leaders will reduce the opposition\u2019s votes and influence in parliament. The effective disenfranchisement of so many voters could prompt street protests, say analysts. The decision comes at a time of growing concern over Thailand\u2019s stagnating economy, the threat of coronavirus \u2013 which has dealt a major blow to the tourism sector as well as posing a challenge to public health \u2013 the country\u2019s dangerous pollution levels, and drought. \u201cThai people like [Future Forward] supporters will either have to rise up in their own way or they will have to put up with autocratic preferences that have resulted in early economic stagnation,\u201d said Thitinan. An initial request by Thailand\u2019s election panel for the constitutional court to ban the party prompted thousands of people to take to the streets of Bangkok.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus is a public health emergency, but its threat is not only medical. Millions of lives have been altered by the outbreak, from those in self-isolation in China to Chinese nationals experiencing racism abroad. We talk to those affected in different ways, from Wuhan to the north of England. Wuhan Wi, a 29-year-old Chinese PhD student in the Midlands, is originally from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak and where her parents have been in self-quarantine for more than 20 days. \u201cThey can\u2019t walk, they can\u2019t leave their own flat \u2013 it\u2019s not a holiday, it\u2019s like jail,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are unable to even open windows for fear that the virus will spread through the air. \u201cNow the whole of Wuhan is closed, all public transport and private cars have been stopped, so they can\u2019t even drive their own cars on the road. So they just stay at home, eating, sleeping and watching movies. That\u2019s all they can do,\u201d Wi said. Wi\u2019s parents have not been told when they will be allowed to leave their flat. Wi has become concerned about the mental health of those in isolation in the city, after seeing posts on social media with locals saying they would rather kill themselves than remain in quarantine any longer. \u201cThe biggest enemy is not the virus, it\u2019s mental health. When you stay in one room for half a month, that\u2019s horrible, you cannot go outside or get fresh air.\u201d Hubei province A hundred miles from Wuhan, nestled in the countryside of Hubei province, British teacher Claude* is in self-isolation with his Chinese girlfriend and her family in her hometown, which the pair were visiting for the lunar new year. \u201cAfter a day or two it became a ghost town,\u201d Claude, 46, said. \u201cThe first week I was just relaxing \u2013 I work near Hong Kong so this was my holiday. I thought I would have more cabin fever by now, but I\u2019m actually pretty fine. My girlfriends\u2019s family are cooking lots and cleaning for us, so I\u2019m being spoilt.\u201d He described the town as \u201cpost-apocalyptic\u201d, with speakers playing American swing music on empty streets, and men in biohazard suits checking people\u2019s temperatures before they enter Walmart. He and his girlfriend still do not know when they will be allowed to leave. But when they finally return to their home in Shenzhen, they will be required to undergo another two weeks in quarantine. Claude said the mood in the town was \u201cpretty chilled out\u201d, but feared this could change in coming weeks as supplies run low. \u201cAs the days go on, more people are wearing masks, and people are standing further and further apart,\u201d he said. Hunan province In neighbouring Hunan province, Yuhan, a 28-year-old Chinese national who lives and works in Melbourne, is also trapped, after returning to visit her family for the new year. She has been in self-quarantine with her parents for 29 days, leaving only to visit her grandmother who lives 200 metres away. Yuhan worries that the isolation could last another two weeks. The family order groceries online once every two or three days, and spend most of their time cooking and watching TV. They usually go to her grandmother\u2019s for lunch and leave food for her dinner. But Yuhan said many of her friends\u2019 families would not leave the house at all. \u201cMy grandma keeps wanting to go out for walks, especially when it\u2019s sunny, but I always try to stop her and walk around the apartment with her,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is sometimes hard to explain to my grandma how dangerous things still are, as official news on TV is mainly good news.\u201d Shanghai In the country\u2019s most populous city, Shanghai, many foreign teachers are beginning to fear for their jobs. Rob, a 23-year-old teacher at an international kindergarten in the city, said about 25 other teachers had lost their jobs during the outbreak, after parents refused to send their children back to school for their final term. This has left the teachers with just 30 days to find work before their visas expire. \u201cThe worrying thing is that once these teachers have their work visas cancelled, their medical insurance goes too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe school has said they can\u2019t do anything \u2013 they need to lay them off because the profit margins are too tight, and it\u2019s illegal not to cancel their visas if they\u2019re not working.\u201d Rob could not fly home to the UK as planned, so instead flew to Bangkok. Now back in Shanghai, he told of people being charged \u00a36 for face masks, and others having to go without if they missed the daily registration for them. He had also been warned of landlords taking their tenants\u2019 allocation of masks, claiming that as homeowners, the masks given to each household should go to them. En route to the UK Some people who have travelled through China have criticised airline checks designed to prevent the spread of the virus. Dave* was on holiday in Bangkok with his partner and travelled back to the UK via Beijing with Air China, wearing face masks and swimming goggles. Airline staff took the temperatures of passengers at Bangkok, where four people \u201cblatantly tested far above the threshold\u201d but were allowed to board after short arguments with flight attendants, said the 39-year-old. \u201cMy partner and I both thought the flight was tense, and the flight crew were visibly nervous on both sides. Some people didn\u2019t seem too fussed about it, and I got the impression that a lot of people were half-hearted, like wearing masks that weren\u2019t properly over their face.\u201d At Heathrow, there were no checks or information. \u201cIt was just like flying to Heathrow on any other day,\u201d he said. \u201cI was expecting at least some information on contacting Public Health England, but there weren\u2019t even any posters.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

      "bodyText": "There have been a number of deaths from the coronavirus among doctors who are young and, as far as we know, otherwise healthy. Does this reframe who we thought was at risk? According to Dr Bharat Pankhania, an expert on communicable disease control at the University of Exeter Medical School, it is not surprising that some young, healthy people die after contracting the virus, noting the risk of infection and even death is not zero for any demographic. \u201cAll of us are at risk, and hence the superlative efforts at keeping containment in place, and keeping the virus from circulating as much as we can do,\u201d he said. David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, agreed. \u201cThis is a new disease in humans, so no-one has immunity\u2013 health workers, like everyone else, don\u2019t have immunity,\u201d he said. Are some people more at risk? Heymann said that who succumbs to the infection and who shrugs it off is often down to individual differences in the body\u2019s response to the virus. Some groups have a greater risk than others. \u201cAt the moment it appears that people who are at greater risk are the elderly and probably the very young,\u201d said Pankhania. But, he added, \u201cyou cannot have that only the elderly and the very young will die, it is part of the natural history of such infections that we will get deaths across the age ranges \u2026 The same pathophysiology can happen in the young as in the old.\u201d Are doctors more at risk of infection than non-medical staff? In short, yes. \u201cIt is not surprising that fellow clinical colleagues have got infected and some have died,\u201d said Pankhania, noting that medical professionals were in a special situation as they had multiple potential exposures to infection. \u201cYou have got infection control in place, however if you are forever being targeted, on the one rare occasion where your guard slipped, you get infected,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is like being in the battlefield \u2013 no matter how much protection you have, a stray bullet can catch you sometimes.\u201d Such a slip, he added, was not surprising. \u201cA minor slip is eminently possible, especially when you are working under stress, you are tired, you have done long hours and your guard falls \u2013 and you get infected,\u201d he said. Repeated exposure puts you more at risk of contracting the virus, but does it make an infection worse? Pankhania said that at present it was thought there was only one form of the virus in circulation, so doctors were not being exposed to a more serious strain. But Heymann said that if doctors did become exposed to the virus, it might be in a higher dose than would have occurred in a social context \u2013 for example, they might come into contact with bodily fluids. \u201cIf there is a massive inoculum of virus, that could make it a more overwhelming infection,\u201d he said. Doctors are often exposed to all sorts of illness and disease from patients \u2013 could this make them more at risk of having a severe coronavirus infection? That is a tricky question.

Can past epidemics provide clues to why some young, healthy people may die from the coronavirus infection? Pankhania said the 1918 flu pandemic offered one possibility, noting that some young people showed an \u201cexuberant immune response\u201d \u2013 in other words, their immune system reacted too strongly to infection. \u201cIn some cases, as yet poorly explained, poorly understood, the immune response is over the top \u2013 that immune response then turns itself upon the person\u2019s body itself,\u201d he said, adding that could lead to fluid loss and organ damage.

There are a lot of unknowns, including whether the virus could mutate to a more virulent form, while Pankhania said experts were still looking at the rate of deaths among those infected.

It is taken as a signal that firms are grappling with more orders, such that it is taking longer to fulfil them. In this case, though, the rationale is rather less positive \u2013 and suggests that not all of the rise in the manufacturing PMI is for \u2018good\u2019 reasons.</p> <p>One caveat is that the PMIs can overstate the impact of sudden shocks. The surveys simply tell us how many firms are reporting deteriorating levels of stocks/delivery times, but not necessarily by how much. </p> <p>Either way, it suggests the sector could face a challenging couple of months and we could see a short-term hit to production as a result.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T10:28:37.170Z\">at 10.28am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4f98bc8f08e133247475b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-21T10:13:25.004Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Industries hit by the coronavirus are expecting governments to step up spending to help offset the economic impacts of the outbreak. </strong></p> <p>At the very least, the IATA airline trade body seems to be pricing in fiscal stimulus over the coming months:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t yet know exactly how the outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not.</p> <p>Governments will use fiscal and monetary policy to try to offset the adverse economic impacts.

Have a great weekend and we\u2019ll be back on Monday. -KM Billionaire Richard Branson attempted to shrug off coronavirus fears as he promoted the launch of his first cruise ship aimed at young travellers in Dover today. The adult-only cruise ship is meant to have a \u2018festival environment\u2019, featuring sundeck yoga, a vinyl record store, a tattoo studio, 20 restaurants, and a running track, with entertainment including DJ sets and drag queens. The first boat, dubbed the \u201cScarlet Lady\u201d, will be based in the US and Caribbean. Branson said he did not expect its success to be impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Its launch is unfortunate timing. Thousands of passengers have been quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship since early February, when 10 people on board were diagnosed with the Covid-19 strain of the disease. Dozens of Britons on board are still waiting to be repatriated. However, Branson believes the cruise industry is set to grow. Obviously what happened in Japan was horrendously unfortunate. But I think the longer-term impact will be negligible. I think the fact that we\u2019re going out of America means that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll suffer. People are booking as much as they\u2019ve ever booked. The FTSE 100 has recovered some of its losses this afternoon. London\u2019s blue chip index is trading just 0.09% lower in afternoon trading, having started the session down by 0.6%. That is despite a 0.4% rise in the pound versus the US dollar, which tends to affect the attractiveness of multinational stocks that benefit when foreign currencies are stronger. The Financial Times (\u00a3) has published the first major interview with former Goldman Sachs boss Lloyds Blankfein since he retired from the CEO role in 2018. Twitter is already alight with some of his more surprising comments, which include insisting that (at least by his measure) he is not rich: Blankfein insists he is \u201cwell-to-do\u201d, not rich. \u201cI can\u2019t even say \u2018rich\u2019,\u201d he insists. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way. I don\u2019t behave that way.\u201d He says he has an apartment in Miami as well as New York. But he abjures most of the trappings. \u201cIf I bought a Ferrari, I\u2019d be worried about it getting scratched,\u201d he jokes. \u201cKen Griffin [the Chicago-based hedge fund billionaire] buys all these houses. He\u2019s out there every minute, calling the office. It can\u2019t make any sense to people outside.\u201d Despite the positive headlines from the latest PMI reading for the manufacturing sector, there are some warning signals for the road ahead, writes the Guardian\u2019s economics correspondent Richard Partington. The latest snapshot suggests that the outbreak of the coronavirus in China has weighed on overseas orders for UK factories. In a worrying sign for future output, some orders from clients in Asia have been cancelled altogether. Extended factory shutdowns in China amid quarantine efforts also look to be causing delays in supplies of materials and components to British manufacturers who depend on them, with stocks falling at the fastest pace for more than seven years. In a stark reflection of the troubles ahead, supplier delivery times plunged the most since surveys began in 1992, even exceeding the previous record seen during the UK fuel protests in 2000 when trucks were left standing idle. Manufacturers will no doubt hope the efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus will be lifted soon, lest they face continued disruption that could weigh on output in Britain. Duncan Brock, group director at CIPs, which compiles the survey, notes: These disruptions are threatening global supply chains as businesses look for new supply routes away from the epicentre of the outbreak whilst under pressure to maintain normal business levels. Regardless of whether the UK manufacturing PMI figure is being interpretted by some analysts as a false positive, the pound is now trading nearly half a percent higher against the US dollar at 1.294. (But before you get too excited, that\u2019s only the highest level since...Wednesday) Investors are turning to safe haven assets amid coronavirus fears, sending gold prices to a seven year high of $1,634.27 per ounce this morning. Car sales in China have collapsed by 92% as the coronavirus shutdown wreaks havoc on the automotive industry, writes Mark Sweney. The China Passenger Car Association said that \u201cbarely anybody\u201d has looked to buy cars in the first half of February and most dealerships have remained closed as the coronavirus shutdown takes its toll on businesses across China. The plummeting domestic car sales figures \u2013 96% down in the first week of February and 92% down across the first half of the month \u2013 come days after Jaguar Land Rover revealed it is currently making no sales in China. \u201cThere was barely anybody at car dealers in the first week of February as most people stayed at home,\u201d said Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of the CPCA. \u201cVery few dealerships opened in the first weeks of February and they have had very little customer traffic.\u201d Only 4,909 cars were sold in the first 16 days of February, down from 59,930 in the same period last year, and in a market where more than 25m cars were sold in 2019. You can read the full story here. Reuters reporter Andy Bruce highlights the same point, that increased delivery times which were factored into UK manufacturing PMI for February actually amount to a \u201cfalse signal on strength\u201d in the figures: ING\u2019s developed markets economist James Smith says the coronavirus impact on supply chains is overshadowing positive UK PMI data. He notes an \u2018alarming\u2019 drop in the supplier delivery component of the manufacturing PMI survey, which is a sign that deliveries are taking longer to fulfil. While delays are usually a sign that suppliers are struggling to keep up with a boost in orders (often a positive sign), in this case coronavirus is likely the culprit. It follows reports that Chinese factories are being disrupted by closures following the outbreak. He says: Slightly alarmingly, the nine-point drop in the supplier delivery component of the PMI \u2013 a sign that deliveries are taking longer \u2013 is the sharpest month-on-month slide in the survey\u2019s history (since 1992). In normal times, an increase in supplier delivery times would be interpreted as a positive signal. It is taken as a signal that firms are grappling with more orders, such that it is taking longer to fulfil them. In this case, though, the rationale is rather less positive \u2013 and suggests that not all of the rise in the manufacturing PMI is for \u2018good\u2019 reasons. One caveat is that the PMIs can overstate the impact of sudden shocks. The surveys simply tell us how many firms are reporting deteriorating levels of stocks/delivery times, but not necessarily by how much. Either way, it suggests the sector could face a challenging couple of months and we could see a short-term hit to production as a result. Industries hit by the coronavirus are expecting governments to step up spending to help offset the economic impacts of the outbreak. At the very least, the IATA airline trade body seems to be pricing in fiscal stimulus over the coming months: We don\u2019t yet know exactly how the outbreak will develop and whether it will follow the same profile as SARS or not. Governments will use fiscal and monetary policy to try to offset the adverse economic impacts. Some relief may be seen in lower fuel prices for some airlines, depending on how fuel costs have been hedged. The full statement can be found here. Fraser Munro, a public sector finance statistician at the Office for National Statistics, gives some context to the government borrowing figures: The PMI reading has helped push the pound higher, with sterling now trading up 0.3% versus the US dollar. Public sector net borrowing figures (excluding banks) shows the UK posted a smaller than expected budget surplus of \u00a39.8bn in January, down 18% compared to the same time last year. That is also lower than Reuters forecasts for an \u00a311.3bn surplus. The result is likely to put pressure on new chancellor Rishi Sunak ahead of the budget on 11 March. (Correction: Apologies for the typo below, where the manufacturing output index figures were mistaken for the manufacturing PMI as a whole. That has been corrected in the original post) Flash estimates for the UK\u2019s manufacturing sector, shows output hit its highest level in 10 months with PMI coming in at 51.9. That is compared to January\u2019s reading of 50.0. That\u2019s a solid performance, but it comes with a number of caveats, including warnings that supply chains are being affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The IHS/Markit report explains: There also reports that extended production stoppages in China following the COVID-19 outbreak had weighed on export sales and the receipt of manufacturing components from suppliers. February data pointed to the sharpest month-on-month drop in the suppliers\u2019 delivery times index in nearly three decades of data collection, while pre-production inventories fell to the greatest extent since December 2012. Elsewhere: Activity in the UK services sector fell to a two-month low of 53.3, according to flash PMI estimates for February. That\u2019s compared to January\u2019s reading of 53.9. It left composite PMI for the month unchanged at 53.3. Celebrations over slightly higher-than-expected German factory output may be short-lived. Danske Bank says there has been a drop in shipping activity, signalling a greater fall in manufacturing output. That could feed through into manufacturing PMI data very soon: The eurozone\u2019s PMI data suggests the economy performed reasonably well despite supply chain and travel disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. IHS Markit\u2019s chief business economist Chris Williamson says: The eurozone economy managed to pick up some momentum again in February despite many companies having been disrupted in various ways by the coronavirus, which caused supply problems and showed signs of hitting travel and tourism numbers in particular. The flash PMI has climbed to a six-month high, consistent with GDP growing at a quarterly rate approaching 0.2%. However, he warned that the outlook is much less certain In particular, the widespread delivery delays seen in February bode ill for production in March unless new deliveries can be secured. While the February survey data are welcome news in a month in which media headlines have been dominated by fears of economic growth being hit by the COVID-19 outbreak, the full immediate impact may not yet be apparent. The euro is edging even higher as investors digest eurozone PMI data for February. Flash manufacturing PMI for the bloc came in better than expected at 49.1 versus forecasts for 47.5. While output declined, it did so at a weaker rate than in January, when the reading came in at 47.9. The service sector also beat its January performance of 52.5, with flash readings showing PMI at 52.8. That\u2019s higher than the Reuters poll which had forecast a figure of 52.2. Market analysts are surprisingly upbeat about the German manufacturing data, which is helping support the eurozone currency. The euro is now trading around 0.3% higher against the US dollar at \u20ac1.08. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, says: Investors are cheerful that the German manufacturing numbers have sharply bounced back up, it certainly strengthens\u2019 the bull case for the Euro. It\u2019s not a bright picture for German manufacturers, as flash manufacturing PMI for February came in below the 50-mark at 47.8. That\u2019s slightly better than the January reading of 45.3 as well as Reuters forecasts for 44.8. Like France, Germany\u2019s service sector expanded but at a weaker rate than expected. Service sector PMI came in at 53.3, lower than January\u2019s 54.2 reading and below the Reuters poll of 53.8. DATA FLASH: French PMI data is a mix-bag Flash manufacturing PMI out of France disappointed, coming in at 49.7 which is below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Analysts had been expecting a reading of 50.7. However, the French service sector performed better than forecast, with service sector PMI coming in at 52.6 compared to a Reuters poll for 51.3. Service sector performance supported composite PMI readings for the months, resulting in a measure of 51.9, above forecasts for 51.0. If the coronavirus ends up resulting in a contraction in passenger growth for Asian carriers, it will be reminiscent of the decline that took place at the height of the SARS virus outbreak in 2003. That was the only decline for regional airlines in nearly two decades. European stock markets are in the red at the start of trading: FTSE 100 is down -0.6% German DAX is down -0.6% French CAC 40 is down -0.5% Spain\u2019s IBEX is down -0.5% Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the world economy, the eurozone, financial markets and business. Airlines have been told to brace for a near $30bn (\u00a323bn) hit to revenues in 2020, as fears over the coronavirus outbreak lowers passenger demand for air travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) trade body has released initial forecasts showing a potential 13% loss in passenger demand for airline carriers in Asia-Pacific. That\u2019s not great news for the region\u2019s airlines, which were only expected to see 4.8% growth for full year. That translates into a $27.8bn revenue loss, the bulk of which will be shouldered by Chinese carriers. Outside the region, global airlines are forecast to lose a further $1.5bn, assuming the loss of demand is focused to markets linked to China. This would bring total global lost revenue to $29.3bn. Alexandre de Juniac, IATA\u2019s Director General and CEO, said: The sharp downturn in demand as a result of COVID-19 will have a financial impact on airlines\u2014severe for those particularly exposed to the China market. We estimate that global traffic will be reduced by 4.7% by the virus, which could more than offset the growth we previously forecast and cause the first overall decline in demand since the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-09. He added: Airlines are making difficult decisions to cut capacity and in some cases routes. Lower fuel costs will help offset some of the lost revenue. This will be a very tough year for airlines. Elsewhere, it\u2019s PMI central, so buckle up and get ready for some industry analysis.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson has launched his first cruise ship and brushed off concerns that the coronavirus outbreak will dissuade younger holidaymakers from embracing his latest venture. Despite the unfortunate timing \u2013 with passengers on one ship quarantined in Japan after hundreds caught the virus, and another turned away by five countries over fears someone on board may be ill \u2013 Branson said at the launch of Scarlet Lady that he saw cruises as a growth area. The ship is targeting young people with onboard entertainment that includes tattooing, yoga and DJs. The billionaire Virgin Group founder unveiled the liner in Dover . It will be the first of four ships to sail under the Virgin Voyages brand. \u201cI have dreamed of starting my own cruise line since I was in my 20s and I\u2019m thrilled that moment has arrived,\u201d he said. The Voyages line joins the banking, airline and health club brands in Branson\u2019s Virgin Group at an turbulent time for the cruise industry. Approximately 3,700 passengers were sailing on the Diamond Princess when 10 were diagnosed with Covid-19 this month. During a two-week quarantine off the coast of Japan, 634 passengers and crew became infected with the virus, accounting for more than half of the confirmed coronavirus cases outside of China. Seventy British nationals who were onboard the Diamond Princess will travel on a repatriation flight on Saturday morning. Branson highlighted strong growth in the cruising industry, with demand for cruising holidays increasing over the past decade. The industry expects about 32 million people to set sail in 2020, almost double the number in 2009. Cruises have traditionally been popular with older travellers, but Branson is pitching a boutique hotel-style, adults-only experience to appeal to younger customers. Virgin Voyages, like established cruise operators Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Cunard, is tapping into the trend for shorter trips, visiting a number of destinations but with only five nights onboard. The Virgin Voyages website promises more than 20 \u201ceateries\u201d offering world cuisine and no big dining halls, alongside specialist coffee bars, drag queens and spa treatments on each ship. The Scarlet Lady was built at the Fincantieri shipyard in Italy, and will accommodate up to 2,770 passengers and 1,160 crew on its maiden voyage around the Caribbean in April. The cruise industry has come in for criticism over its environmental impact, and the problems experienced by ports such as Venice amid constant arrivals of enormous ships. Virgin Voyages describes itself as the first cruise line to use Climeon technology, which collects heat generated from the ship\u2019s energy and converts it into electricity, which it says will reduce fuel demand. The company says it will also use carbon offsetting.",

While some retailers say it is too soon to see a noticeable impact on stock, with many shipyard and factory workers taking time off for lunar new year anyway, they are preparing for shortages in coming weeks. China is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, with major exports including clothing, toys and electronics. Items like blinds and plantation shutters are also in short supply at some companies, with consumers waiting an extra four weeks on orders. Travel Qantas on Thursday announced a major reduction in services, cutting flights to Asia by 16% for at least three months, with flights to Shanghai suspended and those to Hong Kong and Singapore reduced.

Smartphones Apple said there would be a shortage of products, including iPhones, due to factory closures in China. \u201cWorldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cWhile our iPhone manufacturing partner sites are located outside the Hubei province \u2013 and while all of these facilities have reopened \u2013 they are ramping up more slowly than we had anticipated. \u201cThe health and wellbeing of every person who helps make these products possible is our paramount priority, and we are working in close consultation with our suppliers and public health experts as this continues. These iPhone supply shortages will temporarily affect revenues worldwide.\u201d Hospitality Australian Retail Association head of public affairs Yale Stephens said while he had not received any reports of supply chain disruptions, the industry was suffering from reduced patronage. \u201cWe are only a month in so whether [supplies chains] change depends how long this crisis goes for and how badly it affects Chinese companies selling to Australian retailers,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the hospitality trade is being particularly severely hit, particularly Chinese restaurants, so we are just encouraging people to support those businesses. \u201cThere are livelihoods at stake here: those of the hardworking mums and dads who\u2019ve put everything on the line to open a business, and those of the staff they employ whose jobs are in real danger of being lost. \u201cIf we lose iconic local retailers, or tourist operators offering unique experiences, or loved restaurants and cafes that are forced to close, we won\u2019t get them back \u2013 and that compounds the potential loss here.\u201d Seafood Mark Boulter, executive officer of Safe Sustainable Seafood Australia, said he was not aware of any seafood import shortages to date, but said if the coronavirus event continued for months it would impact on imports from China. \u201cWe are currently organising a round of member meetings and this question will be on the agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are currently highly aware of is the impact this situation is having on the domestic seafood sector, both those who are export focused mostly to China and the sectors of the domestic trade that are focused on Asian communities\u2019 desirable species, such as live mud crabs and rock lobsters, and raw prawns.\u201d He said a combination of a low-key summer due to the bushfires and subdued Lunar New Year festivities due to the virus had depressed the demand for seafood over the past few months. \u201cWe have not yet been able to determine the extent of this with our members,\u201d he said. Electronics Gerry Harvey, chief executive of the electrical and household goods retail chain Harvey Norman, refused to comment on whether electronics supplies had been affected. Sony Australia said it was difficult to assess the impact that the health crisis would have on its business. \u201cWe will continue to gather information, and assess the situation closely, taking action to minimise impact wherever possible,\u201d a spokesperson said. Stationery and electronics goods supplier Officeworks would not comment. A Kmart group spokeswoman said so far, supply chain disruptions had been minimal. \u201cOur absolute priority remains ensuring our team are safe and as a precaution, we have suspended all business travel in and out of China and Hong Kong until further notice,\u201d she said. Guardian Australia has also contacted JB Hi-Fi for comment. Medical While products such as hand sanitiser and face masks are in short supply, this is due to significant consumer demand rather than any interruption to supply chains. However, masks are not essential to protect against the virus, which is so far well contained in Australia. On Tuesday evening the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, met with health officials. He said that said apart from sporadic mask shortages there had been no reports of supplies of pharmaceuticals and devices to hospitals being disrupted. Pharmaceutical companies GSK, Janssen, and Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson Medical said there had been no supply impacts as a result of the virus and subsequent business closures in China. A GSK spokeswoman said it was an evolving situation. \u201cWe have supply chain planning in place for our products, which includes measures to secure reliable supply, such as holding strategic stock and dual sourcing,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this time, we have adequate stock in place, however this is an evolving situation which we will keep under review.\u201d In a statement, drug company Astra Zeneca said it was working closely with global health authorities. \u201cWe have in place contingency plans to support our operations,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn order to protect employees, we have taken a decision at this time to restrict all non-business critical travel to and from China, including Hong Kong.\u201d Medical device and pharmaceutical company Bayer said it was in regular contact with suppliers in China. \u201cCurrently we do not have an impact on production and market supply,\u201d a spokeswoman said. Industrial The world\u2019s biggest miner, BHP, warned demand for resources could be affected. A BHP investor report issued on Tuesday said the disease outbreak, trade policy and geopolitics were key uncertainties for the sector. \u201cIf the viral outbreak is not demonstrably well contained within the March quarter, we expect to revise our expectations for economic and commodity demand growth downwards,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis caveat applies, to varying degrees, across our portfolio and we will continue to monitor. In this regard, we highlight the distinction between a permanent loss of demand in oil due to foregone transport services; and temporary demand losses with the opportunity to be reclaimed, as in steel and copper end-use. We anticipate a net demand loss due to the 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak in the near term.\u201d With battery cell shortages also predicted, Guardian Australia has contacted Battery Specialties Australia, which supplies household, industrial, automotive and solar batteries, and Solar Juice, a wholesaler of solar panels and components. Solar Juice co-founder and head of supply, Rami Fedda, said in a message on LinkedIn that he was working with two large manufacturers unable book a vessel until later in February or early March. Stock that was ready for shipment prior to Chinese New Year won\u2019t get to the Solar Juice warehouse until March, while the company would be lucky to receive any new stock before April, he said. The next gap in the market could be raw material, where even non-Chinese manufacturers have been warning of delays. \u201cMy best guess if there is an impact it will happen around May for non-Chinese panels.\u201d",
