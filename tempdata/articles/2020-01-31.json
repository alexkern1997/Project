It\u2019s almost certainly the ugliest website to go live in decades, immediately eliciting cries of \u201cIt\u2019s making my eyes bleed\u201d on social media in response to the endless black and white headlines, cluttered links and yellow highlighter scrawl. Comments on the Australian\u2019s own news report were similarly unflattering: \u201cVisually appalling, terrible to navigate\u201d; \u201cThe formatting hurts my eyes!\u201d Thomson has lofty plans for knewz.com; claiming it will be \u201ctransformative for the global publisher\u201d and will provide an antidote to the \u201cfake news and clickbait\u201d of the social media giants and competitors Facebook and Google. \u2018Extremely graphic\u2019 coverage Academics from New Zealand and Australia have analysed the coverage of the New Zealand massacre and concluded that the two countries covered the tragedy in starkly different ways in the days after the attack. While New Zealand newsrooms focused on the victims, the Australian media was far more interested in the perpetrator and only 8% of the stories were about the victims, Gavin Ellis and Denis Muller found. Ellis and Muller scanned almost 300 newspaper reports, watched web-based TV content and interviewed news executives to conclude that the disparity in editorial decision making was driven by the \u201ceffect of proximity\u201d. \u201cNew Zealand media were focused largely on empathetic coverage of victims and resisted the alleged gunman\u2019s attempts to publicise his cause while their Australian counterparts showed no such reluctance and ran extended coverage of the alleged perpetrator, along with material ruled objectionable in New Zealand,\u201d the New Zealand Journal of Social Sciences said. \u201cThe authors conclude that a proximity filter was used by New Zealand media who identified the victims as part of their own community, but the events of 15 March 2019 were seen as \u2018foreign\u2019 by Australian journalists who used perceived distance as justification for extremely graphic content.\u201d Hun catches virus outrage The Herald Sun\u2019s decision to frame the coronavirus on its front page as a \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 complete with a red Communist star as a surgical mask and word play on the national animal the giant panda \u2013 has angered the Chinese community. A Daily Telegraph headline \u201cChina kids stay home\u201d has also been criticised for its potential to provoke discrimination against kids with a Chinese background. Tele editor Ben English apologised on Friday. \u201cOur headline was in no way intended to single out Chinese people,\u201d English said. \u201cHowever, it became obvious from reader letters that many felt the Chinese community had been targeted. The last thing we want during this public health emergency is for people to feel they are being picked on. We know Chinese people have long formed an important part of Sydney\u2019s community. If people have taken offence at the headline then I would like to apologise to them\u201d. A change.org petition signed by 45,000 Chinese community members says the Herald Sun has \u201cinappropriately labelled the coronavirus by race\u201d and asks for an apology. A spokesman for News Corp said \u201cChinese virus\u201d referred to the source of the coronavirus being China. Mondays mean Macdonald on ABC Monday night sees the return of the ABC\u2019s current affairs line-up of Four Corners, Media Watch and Q&amp;A, complete with its new host, Hamish Macdonald, who will introduce Four Corners as well as host Q&amp;A. It will be bushfire-themed across all three programs, with Macdonald anchoring his first program live from Bega, on the south coast of NSW. Four Corners sent a team of reporters and producers across the country to track down the Australians who found themselves in the centre of the firestorms we saw in the videos that circulated online. Paul Barry\u2019s Media Watch, which will be examining the coverage of the bushfires and the role of climate change, was very nearly pushed aside or to a later time slot as Four Corners was keen on extra screen time, but each program\u2019s patch was maintained in the end. Seven apologises to Yirrkala Channel Seven has apologised to members of the Yirrkala Aboriginal community over the use of images of adults from Yirrkala in the backdrop to a controversial Sunrise segment calling for Aboriginal children to be adopted by white families. But the apology was broadcast in a commercial break before 7am on Thursday and was not mentioned by the hosts, David Koch and Samantha Armytage. The file footage aired without permission in the background of a notorious segment on the popular breakfast show in March 2018, in which an all-white panel debated the merits of encouraging white families to \u201ctake in abused kids\u201d. \u201cOn 13 March 2018, we aired a story about alleged child abuse and neglect in Aboriginal communities and white people adopting Aboriginal children,\u201d the statement read. \u201cDuring the story, we showed unrelated blurred file footage of the Yirrkala community and Yolngu families in that community. \u201cThe Yirrkala community and those Yolngu families had nothing to do with the story.

The editorial cartoonist for the New Zealand Herald, Rod Emmerson, complained that the cartoon was offensive to members who worked at News Corp. \u201cDeclaring News Ltd cartoonists are pandering to systemic racism and bigotry through their employer is completely untrue and clearly defamatory,\u201d Emmerson wrote to the board. Blumenstein said he did not \u201chave an issue with professional members who are employed by News Ltd\u201d but stands behind \u201cthe content of the cartoon and my right to make satirical commentary on the behaviour of public figures, including cartoonists\u201d. \u201cI think Emmerson is correct when he says that office bearers should exercise discretion when making statements regarding members, so I have deleted the tweets in question and I apologise to any member who sees my cartoon or statements as harmful to the ACA.\u201d Rumours of the death of TV sexism It would have been a huge story if only it were true. The Australian made the bold statement that the longevity of the newsreaders Sandra Sully from Ten and Melissa Doyle from Seven proved that sexism in the news business was dead. \u201cGone are the days of TV news programs being presented by pretty young female journalists and much older male counterparts,\u201d the Oz media section reported. But the media union was quick to jump in and say the fight is not over and sexism is still rife. To mark her 30 years with the Ten network, Sully\u2019s bosses have set up a $7,500 university journalism scholarship to support a journalism student at Western Sydney University. No backing for coronavirus claim The Daily Telegraph reported the shocking tale of a 60-year-old who died from an apparent cardiac arrest \u201cwas reportedly not given CPR by bystanders out of fears that he had coronavirus\u201d. The Daily Mail picked up the story and ran it on Thursday. But the claim that bystanders didn\u2019t help because they were afraid of the coronavirus is unsourced in the story and a Sydney Morning Herald reporter said police had not confirmed the claim. Singing from the Brexit song sheet It was good local news hailed by the Hobart Mercury on its front page: \u201cLondon Calling! Tassie eyes Brexit trade bonus\u201d. \u201cTasmania\u2019s fruit and vegetable growers are expected to be among the winners as Australia looks to sign a trade deal with the UK by the end of the year,\u201d Claire Bickers reported on Friday. But a quick scan of the other News Corp papers revealed the apple isle wasn\u2019t that special after all. Brexit was also a \u201cunique opportunity\u201d for South Australia\u2019s wine industry. The Bickers story was \u201cplaced\u201d by federal trade minister Simon Birmingham\u2019s office and massaged into a local story by Bickers. Good news for everyone! Birmingham himself even tweeted out a montage of favourable headlines. Meanwhile, in an AAP story published in the Canberra Times, the news was not so good: Australia would not greatly benefit from Brexit. \u201cThe geographic distance between the two countries has always been a restriction on trade, but essentially Australia\u2019s biggest export earners, things like coal and iron ore, are not in demand by the UK,\u201d the newspaper reported.",

Still reeling in shock from a measles outbreak in Samoa, Pacific Islanders\u2019 fears were stoked as it became apparent that even large, well-developed countries were struggling to contain the outbreak. Low-resourced settings always suffer the greatest losses in global medical crises and people living in these island nations are not blind to that detail. Out of fear, people started putting pressure on health authorities to implement stringent public health and preventative measures, like the dramatic and swift response we were seeing from China and other well-developed countries. This panic translated into unsynchronised health responses all across the region. Countries such as Samoa and the Marshall Islands swiftly implemented a total travel ban on incoming travellers suspected of being infected with the novel coronavirus, whilst others like Papua New Guinea did so in a delayed, knee-jerk manner. Some island nations like Fiji and Solomon Islands did not endorse a total ban on inbound travellers, however some preventative and quarantine measures were implemented.

All too often most of these island nations rely heavily on donor-funded health activities, and responses to health crises or disasters almost always leave us at the mercy of donors, friends and neighbours. In Solomon Islands the health authority has put in measures at its international airport such as screening for fever using a digital thermometer and the use of facial mask by airport staff. Despite this, the public out of panic and fear are calling for a ban on inbound travellers who fall into the coronavirus suspect category, and for more information about what is going on.

In the mean time, here is a summary of what we know so far. The death toll stands at 213 inside China and confirmed infections are 9,096 Possible infections are at 12,167 inside China with recoveries listed as 163 The World Health organisation has declared a global public health emergency because of the spread of the virus outside China, describing it as an \u201cunprecedented outbreak\u201d. Cases outside China of the virus are increasing and is estimated to be over 100. Recent global updates include Italy (2), France (6), Germany (5), Australia (9). I will bring you a full country-by-country list shortly The US has confirmed its first person-to-person transmission Evacuations of foreign nationals are continuing, with 150 Britons expected to be flown out of Wuhan on Friday local time. The UK evacuation of its citizens out of Wuhan is underway. They are understood to be on Wamos Air 747. According to Flightradar24, a Wamos air 747 flew from Hanoi to Wuhan on 31 January, landing in Wuhan at 04.45 local time. We know from the video we posted a short time ago that UK citizens were preparing to board a Wamos air plane. I haven\u2019t yet got any information as to whether that plane has left Wuhan as there is sometimes a lag in this being uploaded. We know that passengers were ready to board On Thursday, China\u2019s Football Association cancelled all domestic games at all levels, in a response to the coronavirus. China\u2019s national women\u2019s team are in Australia to play Olympic qualifiers, but have been in quarantine in Brisbane as a result of the virus. Football Federation Australia on Friday confirmed the team will begin their qualifying tournament against Taiwan in Sydney on 6 February and will play the Australian team on 12 February. You can read the full story here. Poorer nations suffer most from global health crises, says Dr Claude Posala, an eye surgeon in Solomon Islands. His country has recently suffered a terrible measles outbreak. He says Pacific nations have watched news out of Wuhan in panic and need help to combat it. The Reuters news agency is reporting that China\u2019s Shandong province has asked companies not to resume working before 10 February to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Reuters is quoting the state news agency Xinhua. Let\u2019s take a look at the latest figures. Each morning in China the National Health Commission provides updates. The total death toll in China now stands at 213. That\u2019s up from 170 announced at this time yesterday. That\u2019s an increase of 25%, which is slightly down on yesterday\u2019s increase (29%). Confirmed cases inside China are 9,096. That\u2019s up from the figure quoted at around this time yesterday of 7,711. It makes it an 18% rise in confirmed infections over the 24-hour period. Between Wednesday and Thursday the rise in confirmed cases was 29% by my calculations. Press Association is reporting that Virgin Atlantic has suspended its flights between Britain and China due to fears about the spread of the coronavirus. The airline said in a statement it would suspend its daily operations between the UK and Shanghai for two weeks from Saturday, PA said. The decision came after the World Health Organisation on Thursday declared the coronavirus outbreak an international public health emergency. It also follows British Airways\u2019 decision to suspend flights to and from China, which is in place until at least Monday. On Thursday Air Canada suspended all flights to and from China until the end of February. It followed Canada\u2019 recommendation to avoid all non-essential travel to China. We are now hearing from the premier of the state of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who is calling for national co-ordination of the response to the virus. Australia is a federal system made up of states and territories and so far each state seems to have had a slightly different response to the virus. \u201cThere is no reason why the Federal government can\u2019t be on a phone hook-up today or over this weekend, talking to all of the (state) Premiers giving them the most up to date information. This is a serious national issue,\u201d Palaszczuk said. An obviously irritated Palaszczuk again makes the point that the national government should be co-ordinating the response. \u201cI\u2019m calling on the Commonwealth (national government) to working a spirit of national co-operation, to provide information to the states so we can help try to contain this virus,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would have had a number of planes that have come in from mainland China over the last 1 days. Where are all those people?,\u201d Palaszczuk asks. We\u2019re just hearing a news conference in Queensland that as of Thursday, coronavirus has been declared notifiable disease. \u201cThat means on clinical suspicion, any doctor or hospital that sees a patient that they think might have this novel coronavirus is obliged to let me know. They let my staff know,\u201d says Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Jeanette Young. As I wrote in the blog a short time ago, Queensland authorities have been trying to track down passengers on a plane that flew from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on 27 January, as there was a tourist from Wuhan onboard who was later diagnoses with coronavirus. He was travelling with a party of eight other people. \u201cWe are contact tracing of course the people immediately adjacent to these people on the plane, on that Tiger flight and then we\u2019re giving information to everyone else who was on the plane and the Tiger people have been extremely supportive and cooperative, so that we could do that, plus we need to go through in detail everyone who\u2019s been at the hotel these people were staying at,\u201d Young said. Hello, I\u2019m Alison Rourke picking up this live blog on the coronavirus outbreak. Thanks to Molly for her summary in the previous post and just a reminder that you can read our most recent story on the virus here and our guide to how you can help protect yourself and stop the spread of the virus here. As always, you can reach me at alison.rourke@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @alisonrourke. I\u2019d like to say a big thanks to everyone who sent in information, it\u2019s been extremely helpful. Here\u2019s a summary of some key updates before I hand over to the Australia team, who\u2019ll continue the coverage from Sydney: The virus has spread to at least 9,320 people around the world, surpassing that of the SARS epidemic over a year long period (2002-2003). 212 people have died, all in China. There are 98 confirmed cases of infection outside mainland China in at least 18 countries. The United States reported its first case of person-to-person transmission, joining Germany, Vietnam and Japan in recording similar incidents. BA has suspended all flights to and from mainstream China until the end of February. Other countries have also implemented a flight ban, most recently Italy. Almost 200 US citizens have been evacuated and have arrived at a military base in California. They will be isolated for a minimum of 72 hours. The US is said to be planning another airlift in the coming days. France have evacuated 200 citizens who are currently flying back to southern France where there\u2019ll be quarantined for 14 days. The European Commission has said it is planning a flight to evacuate more European nationals. The Chinese Football Association has postponed its domestic games in 2020, and the World Athletics Indoors Championships, due to take place in the Chinese city of Nanjing in March, have been moved to 2021. Google and IKEA became the latest franchises to shut their Chinese shops and offices. In Australia, confirmed cases of the virus have climbed to 9, but two people have been released and are \u201cpost-viral\u201d according to the country\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. Authorities have been tracking down passengers that were on a plane with a Chinese tourist who flew from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on 27 January. The 44-year-old man, from Wuhan, was diagnosed with coronavirus and was being treated in isolation in hospital on the Gold Coast. The Guardian understands that at least one passenger who was on that plane to the Gold Coast has been asked to stay home from work. The passenger is not believed to be at high risk but as a precaution has been asked to remain at home for the time being. Matt Raw, who as we reported earlier has been allowed to board the flight with his Chinese wife after a U-turn by authorities, has sent this video from inside Wuhan airport to the Guardian You can read about Matt and Ying\u2019s story here. France have evacuated 200 citizens from Wuhan, according to AFP journalists on board the flight. Citizens are on their way to southern France in a military aircraft. On arrival, the passengers will be placed into quarantine for 14 days. The US and Japan have already airlifted their citizens, with a second US flight planned in coming days. The European Commission has said it is planning a flight to evacuate more European nationals. China has responded to the WHO announcement in a statement from the National Health Commission saying: \u201cWe are confident and capable of effectively controlling and ultimately defeating the epidemic\u201d. Here\u2019s what appears to be the first picture of the evacuation plane set to bring Britons back from Wuhan, sent to the Guardian by Matt Raw, who is due to board it. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have confirmed that following a last-minute decision from China, dependents of British nationals and dual nationals will be allowed on to the evacuation flight. Previously, restrictions imposed by China meant those with Chinese passports were not permitted to leave the country, and China does not recognise dual nationality. The U-turn meant that Matt Raw and his 75-year-old mother Hazel were given permission to fly along with Raw\u2019s wife Ying, who holds a Chinese passport. It\u2019s uncertain whether other families in similar situations have been given the go-ahead to board the plane, or whether they have been able to make it to the airport in time. Here are the latest figures: The virus has spread to at least 9,320 people around the world, surpassing that of the Sars epidemic over a year long period (2002-2003). 212 people have died, all in China. There are 98 confirmed cases of infection outside mainland China in at least 18 countries. Sorry for any confusion here - this post has been amended to show that the number of cases has topped Sars, not the death toll. If you\u2019d like to read more on the plight of Britons and their families in Wuhan, here\u2019s a longer read, following three families trapped in the city. The death toll in Hubei, the Chinese province in which Wuhan is located, has risen to 204, the province\u2019s health commission has said. Hubei\u2019s announcement takes the total death toll for China to at least 212. Giuseppe Conte has provided more information on Italy\u2019s first two cases of coronavirus. Two Chinese tourists who were visiting Italy had contracted the virus, the Italian prime minister said. He said that authorities were conducting checks on the journey of the two people, in order to prevent them spreading the virus further. Their condition is good. Announcing the suspension of air traffic to and from China, Conte said: \u201cAs far as we know we are the first country in the EU to adopt such a measure.\u201d It seems that at least one Chinese-national spouse of a British citizen is being allowed on the imminent evacuation flight from Wuhan. Matt Raw, who lives in Wuhan with his wife, Ying \u2013 a Chinese national with a Chinese passport \u2013 has been told that she will be allowed to board the flight, the Guardian\u2019s Jessica Murray reports. The family are at the airport waiting to fly back to the UK. \u201cWe have actually finally been given permission to fly,\u201d Raw said in a video message. \u201cWe are at the airport now and we\u2019re just getting ready to go through security.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously been able to get my mother and my wife has been told she can fly, she has a ticket, so fingers crossed we get through security and we return to England hopefully later on today.\u201d You can read more about Matt and Ying\u2019s experience in Wuhan here. Thanks very much to all those sharing information. There\u2019s a lot to keep track of, so if you spot anything I\u2019ve missed, do drop me a line on Twitter: @mollyblackall For more information about previous public health emergencies, check out Nicola Davis\u2019 piece here: A British man has chosen not to board the evacuation flight from Wuhan because the Foreign Office could not confirm whether his four-year-old daughter, a Chinese national, would be allowed to join him. Chris Hill, 38, said he was \u201closing faith\u201d in the government. Hill, from Sunderland, told PA he could not consider leaving his family and said his wife of 11 years could not travel as she was needed to work in a hospital in Wuhan. Dominic Raab, the UK\u2019s foreign secretary, said officials had \u201cbeen working tirelessly\u201d to get citizens out of Wuhan, but China does not recognise dual-nationality and is thought to be preventing its citizens from leaving the area. The flight is due to leave Wuhan city at 7am local time (11pm GMT). Germany has announced a fifth confirmed case. The individual is an employee at the same firm as the other four infected individuals, in the southern state of Bavaria. Scott Morrison, Australia\u2019s prime minister, has announced that he is making 1m surgical masks available to GPs. In a press conference addressing the measures taken to tackle the spread of the virus, Morrison also announced that he has raised the travel advice for Wuhan and the Hubei to a level four, meaning that Australians are being told not to travel there. \u201cThe national security committee will meet today again to go over all of our arrangements, preparations, the cooperation, the preplanning and the precautions we are putting in place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re well prepared and will continue to follow the expert advice.\u201d A second case of the virus has been confirmed in Queensland, bringing Australia\u2019s total number of cases to nine. A Chinese man with coronavirus boarded a flight from Melbourne to the Gold Coast on 27 January, and Australian authorities have confirmed that a second passenger on the flight has tested positive for the virus. Authorities are now attempting to track down the other passengers on the flight - 170 people, excluding the two confirmed cases. Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, has said the country has its first two cases of the virus, according to Reuters. Italy is the fourth European country, after France, Finland and Germany, to have confirmed cases. Conte suspended air travel between Italy and China after the announcement. What does the WHO\u2019s international public health emergency mean? Escalating the virus to an international public health emergency signals that countries around the world should step up their response, and enables the organisation to offer greater support to countries with weaker health systems. It also gives the WHO the power to scrutinise the steps taken by other countries in response to the virus so far. According to Dr Bharat Pankhania, Senior Clinical Lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School: \u201cAs a result of this formal declaration, member states are obliged to work together in managing the outbreak, release resources and share diagnostics as well as logistics expertise, thus it now formalises what would have been going on in the background amongst member states. Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), member states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.\u201d This is the sixth emergency announced since 2009. Here\u2019s a recap of the others: 2009 The swine flu pandemic, which killed approximately 284,500 people, though some estimations reach 579,000. 2013-2016 The Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which led to the death of 11,300 people. 2014 The polio outbreak, in which 417 people have died. 2016 The Zika, which spread to 60 countries and caused 2,300 cases of babies born with microcephaly, which causes the head to be smaller than expected and can lead to developmental problems. 2019 The Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo which, by mid-January this year, had caused 2,236 deaths. The four chief medical officers of the UK have increased the risk level of coronavirus from low to moderate. They said that they \u201cdo not think the risk to individuals in the UK has changed\u201d but that the government should \u201cplan for all eventualities\u201d. They added that they were confident in the ability of the UK\u2019s health authorities to manage any risk to the population. The officers are Prof Chris Whitty for England, Dr Frank Atherton for Wales, Dr Catherine Calderwood for Scotland and Dr Michael McBride for Northern Ireland. The WHO has criticised trade and travel restrictions, as it announced a public health emergency over the virus. Prof Didier Houssin, chair of the emergency committee, questioned the science behind the decision made by some countries to put the restrictions in place. He said these restrictions were not an \u201cexample to follow but a decision to reconsider\u201d. Houssin said that measures such as unnecessarily placing people in quarantine and refusing visas could now be scrutinised by the international health body. The WHO has declared a global public health emergency because of the spread of the virus outside of China, describing it as an \u201cunprecedented outbreak\u201d. There are now 7,834 confirmed cases around the world. The total number of cases outside of China has reached 98 across 18 countries, Tedros Adhanom, director general of the WHO, has just told a press conference. The number of deaths remains at 170, all in China. Eight cases outside China have spread via human to human contact, in Germany, Japan, Vietnam and the US. There are currently no deaths outside of China. Praise for China, but concern for weaker health systems The organisation congratulated China, saying the declaration was not a vote of no confidence in the country, on the contrary, \u201cthe WHO continues to have confidence in China\u2019s capacity to control the outbreak\u201d. The organisation praised the \u201cextraordinary measures taken\u201d despite the social and economic impact on the Chinese people. Tedros said there would have been more cases and deaths if not for China\u2019s work. The WHO director-general added: \u201cThe main reason for this decision is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries.\u201d Tedros expressed concern for countries with weaker health systems, saying that we \u201cmust all act together now to limit further spread\u201d. \u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems, and which are ill-prepared to deal with it,\u201d he said. Tedros reiterated that the WHO were willing to support those countries in any possible way. A new case has been reported in France, taking their total up to six. The latest victim is a doctor, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent Kim Willsher has said. French citizens repatriated from Wuhan are being held in isolation near Marseille. Air France has followed British Airways\u2019 lead and is suspending flights into and out of China until 9 February. There will be special flights into and out of Shanghai and Beijing staffed with volunteer crew from tomorrow to bring back passengers and staff in China. The Guardian\u2019s Josh Halliday has just confirmed the 150 Britons being flown out of Wuhan tonight will be quarantined at Arrowe Park hospital accommodation in Wirral, Merseyside. They will be staying in the accommodation block usually designated to NHS staff and are expected to remain there for 14 days. Margaret Greenwood, the Labour MP for Wirral West, said she had been told by health secretary Matt Hancock that experts believed it was unlikely that those quarantined had the virus. Here are the latest figures on the virus: Globally, there are 7,818 confirmed cases. Of these, 7,736 are in China. In the country, 1,370 cases have been classed as severe, and there are a further 12,167 suspected cases. The number of official deaths, 170, hasn\u2019t changed since last night. Outside of China, there are 82 confirmed cases spanning 18 countries. The WHO have pushed back the announcement on their decision over whether the virus constitutes a public health emergency, we\u2019re now expecting it around 7.30pm. No reason has been given yet for the delay. Here\u2019s a reminder of the WHO\u2019s definition of a public health emergency: \u201cAn extraordinary event which constitutes a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease, and potentially requires a coordinated international response.\u201d This comes when the situation is: serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected carries implications for public health beyond the affected State\u2019s national border may require immediate international action This is Molly, I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog. The World Health Organization (WHO) are set to announce their decision imminently over whether or not to declare a global health emergency. I\u2019ll keep you updated with all the developments as and when they break. Here are the latest and most important developments around the world so far today. Health officials in Chicago have reported the US\u2019s first person-to-person transmission of coronavirus, after the spouse of a woman who became ill after visiting Wuhan tested positive for the virus. The head of health services in a city near the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak has been sacked after she could not answer questions on state television about how many people were being treated. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me how many people are being treated,\u201d Tang Zhihong told a reporter. Hundreds of Britons stranded in the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak will be flown home early on Friday morning. A plane was due to leave locked-down Wuhan on Friday morning local time. The British Wuhan evacuees are expected to be quarantined for two weeks in former NHS accommodation in north-west England. As a precaution all those who come into contact with them will wear protective clothing. The number of people tested for the virus in the UK has now reached 161, with all coming back negative. The figure came in the latest daily 2pm update from the Department of Health and Social Care. The World Health Organization is meeting once again on whether to declare coronavirus a global emergency. New cases have been reported in Tibet, India and the Philippines. China has reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths. The death toll rose to 170 on Thursday \u2013 up from 132 the previous day, a rise of 29%. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,711, up from 5,974 a day earlier. Almost two-thirds of airport screening tests fail to detect people with coronavirus, according to new research. A team from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the current techniques are ineffective because of the incubation period and the poor sensitivity of thermal scanners. Health officials in the US have reported their country\u2019s first case of person-to-person transmission of the Chinese coronavirus, the Associated Press is reporting. The patient is the spouse of a Chicago woman diagnosed with the virus after returning from Wuhan, and is the sixth reported in the US. The other five were all travellers who developed the illness after coming into the US from China. The Boston Symphony Orchestra has cancelled its coming tour of Asia amid concerns about the deadly virus in China, the Associated Press reports. Andris Nelsons, the orchestra\u2019s music director, said on Thursday that the decision was made out of concern for the health and well-being of its musicians. The orchestra had been scheduled to go on a four-city tour that included Seoul in South Korea, Taipei in Taiwan and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China from 6 to 16 February. \u201cPlease know that we are all passionately committed to a future visit to East Asia soon,\u201d Nelsons said in a statement. \u201cMost importantly, our hearts and prayers are with everyone who has been affected by the coronavirus.\u201d The International Monetary Fund is monitoring developments on the coronavirus outbreak in \u201creal time,\u201d a spokesman said Thursday, adding that the economic hit depends on the duration of the epidemic, AFP reports. \u201cWe at the IMF are monitoring this very closely, we\u2019re looking at the economic indicators on a real-time basis,\u201d said IMF spokesman Gerry Rice. \u201cIf global supply chains were systematically affected or global financial markets were significantly impacted by increasing uncertainty, then obviously the impact would be greater,\u201d Rice said, adding that the effects would be more severe if the ailment spreads to other parts of Asia from China. \u201cWe\u2019re not at this point in a position to put any hard numbers around this,\u201d Rice said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we would do in due course, but it\u2019s just too early to do that.\u201d Russia\u2019s first McDonald\u2019s restaurant has scrapped a plan to sell Big Mac burgers for virtually nothing to mark its 30th anniversary over fears it would attract huge crowds, which authorities have advised against due to coronavirus fears, Reuters reports. The restaurant on Moscow\u2019 central Pushkin Square, was due on Friday to sell the Big Mac for just three roubles ($0.0474) instead of its usual price of 135 roubles, and expected to draw tens of thousands of people. But on Thursday it ditched the plan after Moscow authorities issued a city-wide warning against mass public events. \u201cYesterday the Moscow government announced precautionary measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus,\u201d McDonald\u2019s said in a statement. \u201c(It) recommended refraining from holding public events in the near future in places where citizens gather en masse in order to minimise risks of infection.\u201d There have been no confirmed cases of the virus in Russia. Singapore has confirmed three new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of infected patients in the city state to 13. All patients so far are Chinese nationals from Wuhan, Singapore\u2019s health ministry is reported as saying by the Straits Times. The latest patients are all in stable condition and warded in isolation rooms at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, the paper said. Twitter is rerouting #coronavirus searches in the UK to automatically direct users to the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s Twitter profile page and the gov.uk website, in a move touted as an attempt to tackle disinformation about the outbreak. A DHSC spokesman said the UK is the first country in the EU to have such an arrangement with Twitter \u201cdirecting users to credible, authoritative information to help tackle misinformation and ensure the public is well informed.\u201d Announcing the arrangement, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: Public safety is our top priority and as this is a rapidly evolving situation, it\u2019s absolutely crucial everyone is able to access reliable, accurate information on Coronavirus. I welcome that Twitter is taking action to direct users to official Government health advice, helping to tackle misinformation and ensure the public is well informed. This action is hugely important, and I want to see more social media companies follow their lead. I want to stress there are no confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the UK and we have world-leading clinicians and expert teams working to protect UK patients and staff to the highest standards possible. According to Chinese officials, 170 people have so far died from coronavirus infections. Not included in those statistics will be 17-year-old Yan Cheng, although his death is most certainly a result of the outbreak. According to a report by freelance journalist Michael Standaert for the Guardian, Yan, who suffered from cerebral palsy, died alone at his home in a rural village in China\u2019s Hubei province, six days after his father and brother were taken into quarantine at a facility 15 miles away. Unable to get out to care for his son, Yan\u2019s father posted messages asking for help on the social media platform Weibo. Village officials reportedly visited Yan but fed him only twice over the six-day period. He was found dead in his bed on Wednesday. The Philippines announced its first confirmed case of coronavirus on Wednesday morning, after one of 29 people being monitored by the country\u2019s department of health tested positive. The patient is a 38-year-old Chines woman who traveled to the Philippines from Wuhan, China, via Hong Kong on January 21, health secretary Francisco Duque told a news conference, according to a report in the Rappler, an English language Filipino news website. The head of health services in a city near the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak has been sacked after she could not answer questions on state television about how many people were being treated. Tang Zhihong, who ran the health department in Huanggang city, which has reported almost 500 confirmed cases and 12 deaths, appeared on state television earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported. On being questioned by a central government inspection team and a reporter on issues like how many people a certain hospital under her remit could handle, she could not immediately answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m unclear,\u201d she said, when being asked how many sick people there were. \u201cI only know how many beds there are. Don\u2019t ask me how many people are being treated.\u201d Hours later the city\u2019s health department said Tang had been removed. It gave no other details. It was not possible to reach her for comment, Reuters said. The government has said it will investigate and punish officials involved in fighting the virus who slack off on their jobs. The number of cases in Huanggang is second only to that of nearby Wuhan, where the virus was first reported in December. Huanggang has also been largely shut off from the outside world by the government as it seeks to control the virus\u2019 spread. Hello world. This is Damien Gayle taking on the live blog from my colleague Matthew Weaver. As usual, please get in touch with any developments, tips or stories that you think we ought to be be covering. You can reach me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via my Twitter profile @damiengayle. Here are the main developments so far: Hundreds of Britons stranded in the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak will be flown home early on Friday morning. A plane was due to leave locked-down Wuhan on Friday morning local time. The Wuhan evacuees are expected to be quarantined for two weeks in former NHS accommodation in north-west England. As a precaution all those who come into contact with them will wear protective clothing. The number of people tested for the virus in the UK has now reached 161, with all coming back negative. The figure came in the latest daily 2pm update from the Department of Health and Social Care. A Chinese couple on a locked down Italian cruise ship, with 6,000 people on board, are reported to have tested negative for coronavirus . One of the couple had fever and both were being kept in solitary confinement on board as the ship is docked in Civitavecchia, north of Rome. The World Health Organization is meeting once again on whether to declare coronavirus a global emergency. New cases have been reported in Tibet and India. British Airways has cancelled all flight to and from China for a month. It claims the move was made in consultation with the Foreign Office. Russia has closed its border with China and will stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said: \u201cWe have to do everything to protect our people.\u201d China has reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths. The death toll rose to 170 on Thursday \u2013 up from 132 the previous day, a rise of 29%. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,711, up from 5,974 a day earlier. Almost two-thirds of airport screening tests fail to detect people with coronavirus, according to new research. A team from the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine found that the current techniques are ineffective because of the incubation period and the poor sensitivity of thermal scanners. Angry South Koreans have volleyed eggs and expletives at a minister and officials trying over plans to quarantine hundreds of citizens in Asan. \u201cIf it\u2019s so safe why don\u2019t you bring them to your home?\u201d one protester shouted at the minister. China\u2019s football association has cancelled all domestic games at all levels. Meanwhile, Ikea temporarily closed its stores in China. State-run Chinese media said officials who mishandled the crisis would be punished Only 16 people have been tested for coronavirus north of the border, and all have been negative, but Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, says it is \u201chighly likely\u201d that there will be a positive case in the coming days. Calderwood said: \u201cIt is highly likely we\u2019ll have a positive case of coronavirus in Scotland in the coming days. The public can be assured that Scotland has well established plans and is well prepared for these types of outbreak. We have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and have established public health and infectious disease experts working round the clock. We have also activated our emergency resilience operation.\u201d This reflects similar warnings from public health professionals in England. Professor Yvonne Doyle, medical director and director of health protection for Public Health England, has said the first UK case is likely to come from someone already in the country. The panic could soon be over on the locked down Italian cruise ship. The Italian news agency Agenzia Ansa has reported that the Chinese couple suspected of catching Coronavirus have been tested negative. The Ita Lisa Nandy won\u2019t thank George Osborne for the Evening Standard\u2019s front page. Passengers from the UK evacuation flight from Wuhan, will be quarantined at an NHS facility in north west England, health reporters have been told. The BBC\u2019s health editor, Hugh Pym said: \u201cI gather this could well be former accommodation for NHS staff, nurses and doctors and others, but it is not clear where it is at this stage.\u201d The flight is due to leave Wuhan city at 5am local time on Friday morning, which is 9pm on Thursday evening UK time. As a precaution all those the evacuees will come into contact with will be wearing protective clothing, Pym said. This includes the bus drivers who will take the evacuees from Brize Norton to the north west. Officials have been working to secure a flight out of Wuhan for British nationals after one planned for Thursday failed to get clearance from Chinese authorities. The government anticipates flying out around 200 UK citizens who have been in Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei province. The number of people tested for the virus in the UK has now reached 161, with all coming back negative. The figure came in the latest daily 2pm update from the Department of Health and Social Care. Ireland is hoping to securing seats on a French evacuation flight for a small number of Irish citizens living in China who are concerned about the coronavirus, the government said. The foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, added efforts were being made to help those who wanted to leave. He said: \u201cWe have spoken to our French colleagues and we are hopeful and confident that we can secure a seat on planes that would take Irish citizens who want to leave out. \u201cThen, when they arrive back in Europe they will have to go through the appropriate health measures to ensure that they are not carrying infection and their healthcare needs are being looked after as they should be.\u201d He said there was no evidence any Irish citizen had contracted the virus. \u201cWe are working on that process and I am confident that we can support any Irish citizen anywhere in China, but particularly in the region concerned, we can support them if they want to leave we can find a way of getting them out, working with other EU countries who are more than happy to help.\u201d Here\u2019s a chart that tracks the rise in deaths from the virus. More than 6,000 people have been prevented from disembarking from a cruise ship in the Italian port city of Civitavecchia after the liner was placed on lockdown over two suspected cases of the deadly coronavirus. Samples from a couple onboard were sent for testing after three doctors and a nurse boarded the Costa Crociere ship Costa Smeralda to tend to a woman with a fever. The 54-year-old woman from Macau was put into isolation overnight in a hospital ward on the ship. Her husband, who did not have any symptoms, has also been tested by doctors from Rome\u2019s Spallanzani hospital and quarantined. The demand for face masks in the UK appears to be on the rise, PA Media reports. On the Boots website, a six-pack of \u201csafe &amp; sound\u201d surgical face masks is sold out, with a note saying they will not be receiving any further stock. Another product on the Boots website, a box of 50 masks, is also sold out and carries the same message about not being restocked. Boots said surgical face masks are available to order in stores as a special line from the pharmacy counter, adding that they are \u201cworking to make additional stock available for customers to purchase in store and on boots.com which we hope will land over the next week\u201d. A branch of B&amp;Q in London appeared to be low on stocks of face masks, with racks empty on Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, on amazon.co.uk, a pack of 12 \u201canti virus\u201d flu surgical face masks is sold out, with the online retailer saying they do not know when, or if, the item will be back in stock, although there are other masks available on the site. In China the shortage of masks has led to some improvising solutions. The World Health Organization is meeting once again on whether to declare coronavirus a global emergency. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: \u201cWe are pleased to have confirmation from the Chinese authorities that the evacuation flight from Wuhan airport to the UK can depart at 0500 local time on Friday 31 January.\u201d \u201cThe safety and security of British nationals is our top priority. Our embassy in Beijing and consular teams remain in close contact with British nationals in the region to ensure they have the latest information they need.\u201d The foreign secretary Dominic Raab has said he hopes an emergency flight to bring back British nationals from Wuhan could take off later this evening. Those on board will be flown in to a military base and then taken to an NHS facility in the north west for a 14-day quarantine period, sources told the Press Association. The flight was originally supposed to leave from Wuhan on Thursday morning but was delayed as Chinese authorities had yet to grant permission for takeoff. It is understood the flight will be taking off early Friday morning in the local timezone. PA reports the plane could fly in to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. A woman who witnessed an ambulance arriving at a locked down hotel in York has been describing the scene. Speaking to the York Free Press, she said: \u201cI was just driving past the Staycity hotel and I saw I was coming up to flashing blue lights. \u201cWhen I got closer I saw a guy with a mask on and then two figures - I guess paramedics - in the back of the ambulance with him. \u201cThey were in white quarantine suits with a box on the back. \u201cI was just taken aback. I\u2019ve never seen anything like that. When it comes so close to home, that\u2019s when it gets a bit scary. \u201cIt is scary when you think about it.\u201d Here are the main developments so far today: An Italian cruise ship, with 6,000 people on board, is on lockdown after two Chinese passengers on board are suspected of catching coronavirus. One of the couple has a fever and both are being kept in solitary confinement on board as the ship is docked in Civitavecchia, north of Rome. British Airways has cancelled all flight to and from China for a month. It claims the move was made in consultation with the Foreign Office. The UK government is \u201cworking urgently\u201d with the Chinese authorities to allow a delayed evacuation flight to leave Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. Dual national families in Wuhan have been told that UK citizens can leave, but Chinese nationals must stay behind. Russia has closed its border with China and will stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said: \u201cWe have to do everything to protect our people.\u201d China has reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths. The death toll rose to 170 on Thursday \u2013 up from 132 the previous day, a rise of 29%. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,711, up from 5,974 a day earlier. Almost two-thirds of airport screening tests fail to detect people with coronavirus, according to new research. A team from the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine found that the current techniques are ineffective because of the incubation period and the poor sensitivity of thermal scanners. Angry South Koreans have volleyed eggs and expletives at a minister and officials trying over plans to quarantine hundreds of citizens in Asan. \u201cIf it\u2019s so safe why don\u2019t you bring them to your home?\u201d one protester shouted at the minister. China\u2019s football association has cancelled all domestic games at all levels. Meanwhile, Ikea temporarily closed its stores in China. State-run Chinese media said officials who mishandled the crisis would be punished These before and after satellite images of Wuhan give a flavour of what a city of 11 million people looks like on lockdown: A hotel in Yorkshire has been put on lockdown after a man, believed to be a Chinese national, was taken to hospital after falling ill. The man, who was a guest at the Staycity Hotel in the centre of York, was taken to hospital by medics on Wednesday night. Paramedics wearing special protective clothing entered the hotel, near the city\u2019s Barbican theatre, after reports that a guest had fallen ill at around 7.50pm yesterday on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the hotel group said: \u201cStaycity Group have confirmed that a man, believed to be a Chinese national, staying at the group\u2019s property in York was taken ill yesterday and is understood to be undergoing tests at a local hospital. \u201cParamedics accompanied the man, along with his two travelling companions, out of the property at around 7.50pm last night. \u201cStaycity is unable to confirm which hospital the three people were taken to or what the outcome of the tests are at this point. \u201cUntil more is known the apartment containing the group\u2019s belongings will be cordoned off, along with surrounding rooms, after which the area will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection, as is company policy.\u201d Shares in Carnival, the international cruise operator, have slumped by 7% this morning following that report that a couple from Hong Kong are in solitary confinement on one of its ships docked off the Italian coast. ANSA, the Italian news service, reports that one of the pair has a fever and is being tested by the authorities for coronavirus. The 6,000 passengers on board the Costa Smeralda (one of the world\u2019s biggest cruise ships) are currently unable to get off. According to ANSA, the couple had arrived from Hong Kong at Milan Malpensa airport on Saturday 25 January and then headed to Savona (in Northern Italy) where they boarded the ship for the cruise. The mayor of Civitavecchia Ernesto Tedesco has said the situation is under \u201ccareful control\u201d, and that all the necessary protocols are being followed. More on BA\u2019s decision to ground China flights for a month. PA Media Reports: BA normally operates daily flights from Heathrow to the two cities but these have been suspended since the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) updated its advice on Tuesday to warn against \u201call but essential travel\u201d to mainland China. Flights to and from Hong Kong are unaffected. A spokesman for the carrier said: \u201cWe are contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss their travel options, including re-booking on to other carriers where possible, full refunds, or booking with BA for a later date of travel. \u201cCustomers can also find the latest information and options on BA.com. \u201cSafety is at the heart of everything we do and we will keep the situation under review.\u201d Virgin Atlantic is operating its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai as normal, saying it will \u201ccontinue to monitor the situation\u201d. Several Chinese carriers are also running their usual schedule of UK flights. An airline industry source told the PA news agency that the FCO\u2019s travel advice is a recommendation rather than a ban, and carriers are making individual assessments on whether to continue flights. Downing Street has said that the UK is still negotiating with China over the delayed evacuation flight from Wuhan. A spokesman said: \u201cThe UK government is working urgently with China to ensure an evacuation flight from Wuhan can take off as soon as possible.\u201d He added: \u201cA number of countries\u2019 flights have been unable to take off as planned including the British repatriation from Wuhan. The flight is planned to touch down at a military base in the UK before passengers are taken to an NHS facility to be quarantined. But the plane has been prevented from leaving China because \u201cwe haven\u2019t got the necessary clearances and we are working with the Chinese authorities on securing those\u201d, the spokesman said. British Airways has cancelled flights to China for a month. Earlier it said it was only planning to stop China flights until Monday, but after advice from the Foreign Office no BA flights to and from China will happen until 29 February, according to a statement sent to the BBC\u2019s Robin Brant. Thousands of people are being kept on board an Italian cruise ship as tests are carried out on two Chinese passengers suspected of having caught coronavirus, a spokesman for the Costa Crociere cruise company has said. Reuters reports: The couple arrived in Italy on 25 January and boarded the ship, the Costa Smeralda, in the port of Savona that same day. They subsequently came down with a fever and are suffering breathing difficulties. The liner has visited Marseilles in France, and the Spanish ports of Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca this week before docking on Thursday at Civitavecchia, north of Rome. None of the 6,000 passengers and crew are being allowed off the ship while medical checks were carried out to see if the pair had the potentially deadly coronavirus, the company spokesman said. He said it might take \u201ca few hours\u201d before the situation became clearer. Kharn Lambert, a British citizen stranded in Wuhan with his 81-year-old grandmother, has welcomed the UK government\u2019s decision to quarantine those returning from China. On Wednesday the government initially said that those returning would be asked to \u201cself-isolate\u201d for two weeks. At the time Lambert criticised the idea as \u201cludicrous and stupid\u201d. But today he said he was \u201chappy\u201d the government had changed its approach to containing the virus by forcing those who return to be placed in a NHS facility for a fortnight. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show, Lambert said: \u201cIt was what we were all discussing in our WeChat groups yesterday about how this was not acceptable. And then once we heard the news that this quarantine was happening, I think everybody felt a lot more pleased because we don\u2019t want to put the health of the British public at risk. \u201cIf that means going into quarantine for 14 days, then that\u2019s what is necessary.\u201d Hundreds of Britons hoping to flee the Chinese region at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak have been left stranded after an emergency government-chartered flight to take them home was delayed. A plane was due to leave locked-down Wuhan on Thursday morning, evacuating about 200 Britons to the UK, where they would be quarantined for two weeks at a secure NHS facility. But the plans were scuppered late on Wednesday as Chinese authorities had yet to grant the plane permission for takeoff, leaving British officials scrambling to negotiate. Russia is closing its border with China to prevent the spread of coronavirus and will stop issuing electronic visas to Chinese nationals, AFP reports. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin told a government meeting that the order had been signed \u201cto take measures to close the border (with China) in the Far East\u201d. \u201cWe have to do everything to protect our people,\u201d he said. The Russian foreign ministry said that as of Thursday it would stop issuing Chinese citizens with electronic visas, which can be used to cross into parts of the Far East and western Russia. The foreign ministry also advised Russians to refrain from travelling to China and for those in China to get in touch with the Russian embassy. Russia does not have any confirmed cases of the new virus but the Russian government has set up a task force to prevent its possible spread. UK citizen Matt Raw, who is stranded in Wuhan says he decided to stay in the city because his wife Chinese wife has been told she will not be allowed to take the evacuation flight to the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where my wife can\u2019t come, so there\u2019s no point in us even even trying anymore,\u201d he told BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show. The couple are also worried about being infected with the virus on the evacuation flight. Raw said: \u201cI think there\u2019s actually a danger now of even taking the flight, particularly with the news that we received this morning that three Japanese people were actually infected whilst on their evacuation flight. \u201cSo there\u2019s a risk of staying here versus the risks of taking the flight.\u201d Human rights campaigners are concerned that Chinese authorities are trying to stifle criticism of their approach to the virus under the pretext of countering false rumours. Human Rights Watch (HRW) criticised the over zealous way Beijing is trying to control the flow of information about coronavirus. In a statement it said: \u201crather than rebutting false information and disseminating reliable facts, the authorities in some instances have appeared more concerned with silencing criticism.\u201d It cited the case of a Wuhan doctor who in December alerted friends on WeChat group to what was then an unknown illness. He was initially warned by hospital officials not \u201cspread rumours\u201d and is now being treated for the condition. HRW also pointed out that the authorities have censored social media posts by families of people seeking help. Here\u2019s our latest news report on the crisis: China has reported its biggest single-day jump in coronavirus deaths as countries struggled to evacuate citizens still trapped in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the outbreak began. The death toll rose to 170 on Thursday \u2013 up from 132 the previous day, a rise of 29%. The number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 7,711, up from 5,974 a day earlier. It is understood that 162 of the deaths \u2013 or 95% \u2013 are in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. Of the new deaths, 37 were in Hubei province and one in the south-western province of Sichuan. The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed the severity of the virus, has warned all governments to be \u201con alert\u201d, and its emergency committee is to meet later on Thursday to decide whether to declare a global health emergency. The WHO\u2019s emergencies chief, Dr Michael Ryan, said the few cases of human-to-human spread of the virus outside China \u2013 in Japan, Germany, Canada and Vietnam \u2013 were of \u201cgreat concern\u201d. The US and Japan have started evacuating citizens, and other countries are poised to send chartered flights to Wuhan, amid reports that some evacuations had been held up by delays in obtaining permission from the Chinese authorities. A British flight to bring about 200 nationals back to the UK was unable to take off as planned on Thursday. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking urgently\u201d to organise a flight to the UK. 63% of infected patients undetected by airport screening Almost two-thirds of airport screening tests fail to detect people with coronavirus, according to new research. Researchers at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have modelled the effectiveness of screening based on estimates of the incubation period and sensitivity of detection techniques. They found are using \u201cgenerally conservative assumptions\u201d more than 63% of infected patients do not get detected. A paper on the research warned that such screening \u201cis only achievable if the rate of asymptomatic infections that are transmissible is negligible, screening sensitivity is almost perfect, and the incubation period is short.\u201d It concluded: \u201cWe find that airport screening for initial symptoms, via thermal scanners or similar, on either exit or entry is unlikely to detect a sufficient proportion of 2019-nCoV infected travellers in order to avoid entry of infected travellers and therefore the potential for seeding of local transmission. Angry South Koreans have volleyed eggs and expletives at a minister and officials trying over plans to quarantine hundreds of citizens set to be flown home from Wuhan, Reuters reports. The first of up to four flights planned to evacuate South Koreans from Wuhan had been expected to depart on Thursday morning, but China had only approved one flight, causing a delay until later in the day, South Korea\u2019s foreign minister said. South Korea also reported its fifth and sixth confirmed cases of the virus on Thursday, including the first case of a person infected in South Korea. Previous cases only involved people who had travelled to Wuhan. About 700 South Koreans in Wuhan have registered to be flown out, but protesters in Asan and Jincheon, cities about 80 km (50 miles) south of Seoul, the capital, used tractors on Wednesday to block access to facilities earmarked for quarantine centres. In Asan, demonstrators threw eggs and swore when Chin Young, the minister of interior and safety, arrived to talk to them on Thursday, prompting police to hold up black umbrellas as a shield. \u201cIf it\u2019s so safe why don\u2019t you bring them to your home?\u201d one protester shouted at Chin. The minister said he sympathised with the concerns and sought their understanding, saying the facilities were chosen as the only ones large enough to accommodate the evacuees. \u201cSouth Korean citizens in Wuhan are suffering... So we need to bring them in as soon as possible, right?\u201d he said. The government wants to isolate evacuees for at least two weeks at the facilities, usually used as training centres for government officials, to rule out any symptoms. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s flights, President Moon Jae-in called for calm and decried \u201cfake news\u201d for having stirred up excessive anxiety. British Airways said it has suspended its flights to and from mainland China until Monday \u201cas we continually review our schedule according to advice from the authorities\u201d. The UK government still has \u201cdifficult issues\u201d to negotiate with the Chinese authorities over a flight to evacuate British nationals from Wuhan, the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, a minister has said. The Foreign Office has said the flight will not now take place on Thursday as the government had hoped. Nick Gibb, the School Standards Minister, told Sky News: \u201cThere are some difficult issues that are being negotiated at very senior levels between the British Government and the Chinese government. \u201cOur priority is to ensure the safety and welfare of British nationals in Wuhan and ensure they do return to the UK as soon as possible.\u201d Gibb said the plan was for them to be taken to an \u201cNHS facility\u201d on their return, where they would be kept for 14 days to make sure that they do not have symptoms of the virus. \u201cIt (the flight) is certainly coming to a military base in the UK and then the British nationals will go to the NHS facility for 14 days of quarantine,\u201d he said. A British-Chinese couple who are trying to flee Wuhan with their baby son face being split up because the Chinese government are refusing to give their citizens permission to leave. Adam Bridgeman, 33, from London has been told he can board an evacuation flight to the UK, but if he did he would have to leave his Chinese wife, and possibly their month-old-son, Austin, behind. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cWe have been in touch with the Foreign Office, and they have confirmed that I would be able to board a flight out of Wuhan, but they have told me categorically that my wife can\u2019t go. \u201cMy wife is a Chinese citizen. She has a valid visa, it is just that the Chinese side have forbidden Chinese nationals to board the flight. Bridgeman said it was unclear if he would be allowed to take his son, who was born at the start of outbreak. It is very tough decision because if I could take my son I would consider going to take him to safety. But if I can\u2019t take my son or my wife I\u2019ll definitely stay here. He\u2019s one month old. He is being considered a Chinese citizen. We stay at home most of the time. I\u2019m fairly confident that we\u2019re safe here, but with a new born baby there are lots of times when you are worried about their health. We\u2019d have to go to the hospital to get treatment, and we\u2019re not really willing to take the risk at the moment. So it is a very tough situation. Speaking later to ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, Bridgeman said the family were getting food and supplies, including nappies, delivered to avoid leaving their home. His son was due for a hepatitis B jab this week but he has been kept indoors to avoid the risk of infection at the hospital. Bridgeman said: \u201cI\u2019m not that frightened at the moment. I\u2019m trying to stay positive and hope it blows over. I\u2019m most concerned about my baby. He needs medical attention at some point, but I don\u2019t want to take him out.\u201d Bridgeman has been told that the delayed evacuation flight to the UK could leave on Friday. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to break our family apart, the baby is too young. So we\u2019ll probably stay here if we can\u2019t all go.\u201d It\u2019s been another very busy day of news on the coronavirus outbreak. Here are the main points: The death toll in China stands at 170, with 7,711 confirmed cases of infections The US and Japan have already flown out some of their citizens out of Wuhan, but UK citizens were told they would not be airlifted on Thursday. The UK evacuation flight has been delayed the planned evacuation flight because it has not got permission from the Chinese authorities to leave. Japan confirmed another three cases, taking its infection toll to 11. More airlines, including Air Canada, have suspended flights to Shanghai and Beijing China\u2019s football association cancelled all domestic games at all levels Ikea temporarily closed its stores in China State-run Chinese media said officials who mishandled the crisis would be punished Standby for our business live blog with Graeme Wearden, which is sure to focus on the impact of virus fears on the markets. In the meantime, an interesting chart tweeted out here about economies most vulnerable to the issue: UK nationals in Wuhan were hoping to be evacuated on Thursday, but their flight was delayed because permission had not been granted by the Chinese authorities. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to get British people in Wuhan safely back to the UK. A number of countries\u2019 flights have been unable to take off as planned. \u201cWe continue working urgently to organise a flight to the UK as soon as possible.\u201d Those who are brought home to the UK are expected to be quarantined at a secure NHS facility. You can read our full story on it here. The state-run tabloid Global Times has also picked up the story about officials being punished if they mishandle rescue funds or falsify materials during the the virus outbreak. With flights into and out of Wuhan suspended, many residents of the city who left over the lunar new year have been unable to return home. China\u2019s aviation authority has now approved chartered flights to do just that, state television said on Thursday. Domestic and international airlines have cancelled flights between Wuhan and overseas cities since 23 January. The aviation authority has also asked the airlines not to stop healthy Wuhan residents from boarding flights. Taiwan\u2019s stock market has closed down 5.75% on its first of trading after reopening following the lunar new year holiday. There are also reports that the government is planning to intervene to prop up the market. That begs the question of what will happen to China\u2019s mainland stocks when trading recommences next week. The Reuters news agency is reporting that China\u2019s anti-corruption watchdog said on Thursday it will severely punish officials who slack off on the job in fighting a new virus that is spreading across the country. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said on its website that anyone who doesn\u2019t effectively carry out President Xi Jinping\u2019s instructions in the fight against the virus would be punished. CCDI also said it would punish those who are derelict in their duty and misappropriate rescue funds and materials. The state-run People\u2019s Daily says China is expected to resume the production of face masks on 3 February, and produce 180m masks per day by the end of February. The first working day after the lunar new year holiday is 3 February. As I reported a little while ago, supplies of many things in Hong Kong are running out in the face of the escalating coronavirus. The impact of the outbreak on the financial markets is a rapidly developing part of the story. Today has seen another broad selloff on Asian stock markets with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong down 1.7% in the second successive day of losses. The Nikkei in Tokyo has fallen nearly 2% and the Kospi in Seoul is down 1.8%. The ASX200 in Sydney has closed down 0.3%. Chinese mainland markets arestill closed for the new year holiday. Although these falls come from high values \u2013 in Australia\u2019s case record highs \u2013 there is mounting alarm about how the continuing shutdown of economic activity in China might crimp growth around the world. The world\u2019s most important policymaker, US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, said on Wednesday that he was watching the situation in China closely. \u201cThere is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and globally,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very uncertain how far it will spread and what the (economic) effects will be in China, for its trading partners, and around the world.... We are very carefully monitoring the situation.\u201d The concerns were betrayed in the bond markets where the three-month-10-year US treasury yield curve inverted, a classic indicator of recession. For the uninitiated, that means that the interest rate (or yield) payable on 10-year American government debt has fallen below the yield on the three-month equivalent. Normally you\u2019d expect longer-term investments like the 10-year bond to yield more. So an upside down correlation means that investors are worried about future grwoth prospects. This inversion is typically followed by a recession. But having said that, it happened back in August and the US economy has powered on since then. So mit might just prove that the world of monetary policy itself has been turned upside down. A short update from Queensland in Australia, where their first person has been diagnosed with coronavirus. Another 41 people are currently being tested for the virus. \u201cThese are people who have been in China within the last 14 days and have developed symptoms and they\u2019re now being tested,\u201d Queensland\u2019s chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said. The state run Chinese tabloid, the Global Times, is reporting that Beijing\u2019s Xiaotangshan hospital that was built for the Sars crisis is being renovated and will be reopened \u201cwhen needed\u201d to help with the coronavirus. Hubei province\u2019s governor, Wang Xiaodong, has said that the whole province has a \u201csevere shortage\u201d of medical supplies, not just Wuhan, according to the broadcaster CGTN. It also reports some medical staff are wearing raincoats and using disposable garbage bags as shoe covers to protect themselves in the city of Huanggang, 75km east of Wuhan. Wang stressed at the press conference the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in Huanggang City, and vowed to prevent it from becoming the second Wuhan, CGTN reported. It\u2019s being reported that Australians wanting to leave Wuhan will need to pay $1,000 to board the Qantas flight that is being chartered to get them out. The Sydney Morning Herald reports evacuees will have to pay the fee and sign a waiver allowing them to be quarantined at the Christmas Island detention centre for up to 14 days. After their stay on Christmas Island, they will be dropped off in Perth and have to pay their own way to their city of residence, the outlet reports. The Australian Medical Association has said it feels the repatriation of Australians from Wuhan to Christmas Island is \u201cnot really appropriate\u201d. The island was previously used as a detention centre for asylum seekers and refugees arriving by boat. New Zealanders wanting to leave Wuhan on an Air New Zealand flight have also been told they will need to contribute to their fare, though no details of the cost have been released. Papua New Guinea\u2019s immigration minister has said no visitors from \u201cAsian ports\u2019\u2019 will be admitted into the country because of fears of coronavirus, but this advice has been directly contradicted by the country\u2019s national airline. In a public notice issued on 28 January, the minister for immigration and border protection, Westly Nukundj, said \u201call citizens originating from the Asian ports will be refused entry into the country effective today. This is a preventative measure taken to ensure the spread of the coronavirus that is rapidly spreading in the world is minimised.\u201d The statement was issued to \u201call operating airlines, shipping lines, and overseas missions\u201d. But it does not specify which ports, in which countries, are regarded as Asian. PNG overland border with Indonesia in Vanimo, West Sepik, has also been closed. \u201cAll entry and departures from PNG must be through Jacksons International Airport.\u201d But Air Niugini, PNG\u2019s national carrier, said it would not uplift any passengers who had been to Wuhan city or Hubei province during the last three weeks. Passengers flying to Port Moresby from Singapore, Hong Kong, or Manila are being screened for the virus before being allowed to board. \u201cHowever, there are no other restrictions on travel to PNG from an Asian port. Air Niugini does not operate direct flights to or from mainland China.\u201d Returning to Australia, the state of Queensland declared its first case of coronavirus today. A 44-year-old Chinese national from Wuhan in Hubei province, arrived in Melbourne via Singapore as part of a two group in 22 January, five days before feeling unwell. He developed symptoms on a flight from Melbourne to the Gold Coast in Queensland on Tiger Airways flight #TT566 on 27 January, arriving at 8.45pm. Authorities are attempting to contact other passengers on that flight. He was travelling with eight other people, all of who are in isolation in Gold Coast University hospital. Four of them are unwell and are being tested for the virus. \u201cThere is a low risk to the people on the flight so we will be contacting each one of them,\u201d Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said. Just a bit more information on the Chinese Football Association\u2019s decision to cancel all domestic matches. It follows their announcement yesterday that the first three rounds in the 2020 AFC Champions League would be played as away matches. This affects 6 games in 4 Chinese Super Clubs. The adjusted schedule is as follows: February 11th Group E Seoul FC Korea VS Beijing Guoan February 12 Group G Korea Suwon Samsung VS Guangzhou Evergrande February 18 Group F Ulsan Hyundai VS Shanghai Shenhua February 19 Group H Jeonbuk Hyundai VS Shanghai SIPG March 3 Group E Australia Melbourne victory VS Beijing Guoan March 4th Group H Yokohama Mariners Japan vs Shanghai SIPG In Hong Kong people are bulk buying in supermarkets, and one resident, Rae Strachan, says there is growing concern over the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s total panic here. I keep telling people that more people die each year from the common cold! People are buying up in bulk from supermarkets and all children\u2019s playrooms and activities are closed. It\u2019s like a ghost town.\u201d She says schools have been cancelled and many children\u2019s activities have been cancelled, including Disney and Ocean Park. Singapore said a plane carrying 92 of its citizens would leave Wuhan on Thursday as the city-state joined several other countries in airlifting people out of the epicentre. Indonesia also said it would exfiltrate citizens from Wuhan and that they would be quarantined for 14 days to avoid contagion. We\u2019ll bring you more details about these evacuations shortly. We\u2019ve just had an update from the chief health officer in the Australian state of New South Wales, where there are currently four confirmed cases of the virus. Kerry Chant said that two of the four were now well and were discharged from hospital yesterday. They have no symptoms. Two others remain in a stable condition, she said. \u201cThe close contacts of the cases are being monitored by public health units and no cases have been identified amongst those close contacts,\u201d Chant said. There are 20 cases currently under investigation in the state she said (11 men, 9 woman aged 5-74 years). All are in isolation at the moment, she said. China\u2019s top court has launched a rare rebuke of the police force, saying its unreasonably harsh crackdown on online rumours during the country\u2019s deadly coronavirus outbreak had undermined public trust. China has been battling the spread of infection that has surpassed the global reach of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-03. Authorities suspect the disease originated in a wild animal market in the central city of Wuhan, and told the World Health Organization about the new virus on the last day of 2019. A day later, eight people were detained by police after claiming online that Wuhan was in the grip of a fresh Sars outbreak. The group were punished for \u201cpublishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification\u201d, a police statement at the time said. In a highly unusual criticism of the police, supreme court judge Tang Xinghua wrote on Wednesday that officers should have been more lenient with those who published the rumours. \u201cIf the public had believed these \u2018rumours\u2019 at the time, and carried out measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets ... it might have been a good thing,\u201d he said. Tang said the indiscriminate crackdown on online rumours could have \u201cbecome negative textbook material for weakening public trust in the government\u201d or a \u201cvicious event\u201d eroding support for the Communist party. In a response posted on Weibo, Wuhan police argued they had only given \u201ceducation and criticism\u201d to the eight and had not meted out harsher punishment such as \u201cwarnings, fines, or detention\u201d. South Korea police are investigating allegations that false information is being circulated about the spread of the coronavirus. Our correspondent in Tokyo, Justin McCurry, reports that one allegation involves a text message scam where people are asked to provide personal data in exchange for confidential health details about the outbreak. False rumours have also been spread about certain schools having children infected by the virus, causing alarm in the hyper-connected country. \u201cWe are promptly asking the telecommunications regulator and site operators to delete or block false information that can lead to social confusion,\u201d Yonhap new agency quoted a police spokesperson as saying. Here\u2019s Justin\u2019s full report: Our correspondent in Sichuan, Michael Standaert, writes that today would have been the last official day of the lunar new year holiday in China, and though that has been extended by Beijing until 2 February, many people are wondering when they should start back for the cities they live in and how long it will take to get there. There are going to be major travel challenges in the next week or so, he says. Even with no crisis, the travel congestion is considerable at this time of year. But with villages blocked off, checkpoints for temperature scans, and many places being unreachable, it is likely to be much much worse when people do start to travel. All football games at all levels and involving all types in China will be postponed, in order to help control the virus spread, the association said in a statement on its website, according to Reuters. The Swedish furniture giant, Ikea, has announced it is temporarily closing all its stores in China because of the outbreak of the new coronavirus, the Reuters news agency reports. The decision to close all of its 30 stores follows an announcement from world\u2019s biggest furniture retailer on Wednesday that it was closing around half of its stores and shortening the opening hours. Just a bit more information on that Air New Zealand flight out of Wuhan ... I understand there are just under 60 New Zealanders currently registered as being in Wuhan, so that will leave additional seats on the flight. The New Zealand government has said it will charter an Air New Zealand plane to get its citizens out of Wuhan. The plane has a capacity of 300 passengers. The government says additional seats will be offered to Australian and Pacific Islands citizens \u201cas a matter of priority\u201d. Those who take a seat on the plane will be required to pay a \u201cnominal fee\u201d, but the bulk of the cost will be carried by the NZ government. The statement from the foreign affairs department, which you can read in full below, says officials are \u201ccurrently developing procedures for: pre-departure health screening of passengers, infection control inflight, and isolation of all passengers arriving in New Zealand for up to two weeks.\u201d Government charters Air NZ flight to assist Wuhan departure The Government has agreed with Air New Zealand to charter an aircraft to assist New Zealanders leaving Wuhan, Foreign Minister Winston Peters has announced. The aircraft will have capacity for around 300 passengers and will fly from Wuhan to New Zealand. Officials will be working through operational requirements with Air New Zealand and Chinese authorities. New Zealanders in the Hubei region who are registered on Safetravel have been emailed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to register interest in the flight, which is subject to Chinese Government approval. \u201cWe are pleased to be have been able to offer this assistance to New Zealanders in a challenging situation,\u201d Mr Peters said. \u201cWe encourage all New Zealanders in the Hubei region to register on Safetravel and ensure all their details are accurate and up to date. This will give us a better understanding of the level of demand for this flight.\u201d \u201cNew Zealand will be offering any additional seats to Pacific Island and Australian citizens as a matter of priority.\u201d \u201cThis is a complex operation as we work through all the necessary requirements but we are working to have the aircraft depart as soon as possible.\u201d Consular teams will be working with health officials to ensure that the risks of transmission of the Coronavirus to New Zealand are carefully managed throughout the evacuation process. Officials are currently developing procedures for: pre-departure health screening of passengers, infection control inflight, and isolation of all passengers arriving in New Zealand for up to two weeks. Those who do take a seat on the plane will be required to pay a nominal fee, however the government will absorb most of the cost of the charter flight. \u201cThe New Zealand Government would like to thank Air New Zealand for its support in assisting to bring New Zealanders home,\u201d Mr Peters said. Asian stocks have slipped today as anxieties about the coronavirus outbreak again preyed on the minds of investors. Major airlines have suspended travel to China and Oreo maker Mondelez has shut down two factories in China for 10 days, highlighting corporate concerns about the spread of the virus. Jerome Powell, chair of the US federal reserve, said the outbreak was adding to global economic uncertainty as he announced rates were staying on hold for now. \u201cIn a matter of days, the coronavirus has shuffled the cards, and Fed policy is not sitting quite as comfortably,\u201d said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank told Reuters. \u201cThe Fed, like everybody else, is going to have a tough time quantifying the scale of the potentially large shock emanating out of China.\u201d New Zealand has not currently had any cases of the virus, nor any suspected cases, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, director general of health for New Zealand has said. \u201cWe are expecting a case but we know what to do when we do,\u201d he said. His main advice to New Zealanders was that if they have been in Hubei or Wuhan in the past 14 days, they should self-isolate (as per the advice in neighbouring Australia). \u201cIt means largely staying at home - exercise or a walk is fine,\u201d he said. He said that with no precautionary measures taken by someone with the virus, they could be expected to infect two or three other people, which is a \u201crelatively low\u201d number. He didn\u2019t give any update on potential plans for New Zealanders to join Australia\u2019s intended evacuation of its citizens to Christmas Island. Our correspondent in Sichuan province, Michael Standaert, writes that work has continued under bright lights overnight on Leishenshan Hospital, the second of two that workers are rushing to build in around two weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Beijing News reports that workers have split into two shifts, with the night crew working from 8pm to 7.30am. Once completed the hospital will have 1,600 beds for patients and enough room for 2,000 medical staff, with most of the facility devoted to isolation wards. Live views of the progress can be seen here. I\u2019m also seeing reports that Delta Airlines have announced that they are cutting in half the number of flights between China and the US. I mentioned earlier that some airlines, including British Airways, have suspended direct flights to China. Air Canada has announced it is suspending all flights to Beijing and Shanghai from 30 January to 29 February. The last flights from the two cities back to Canada will take off on 30 January. It follows the government\u2019s advice to avoid non-essential travel to mainland China. Canada\u2019s public health authorities have reported three confirmed cases of coronavirus. Donald Trump has recently tweeted that he\u2019s been updated on the virus outbreak. American citizens were airlifted out of Wuhan on Wednesday. Australian authorities are reporting the first case of the virus in the state of Queensland. The 44-year-old Chinese national from Wuhan in Hubei province, flew into Melbourne, spent some time there and then flew to QLD on January 27, where he became unwell. He has been confirmed to have coronavirus and is in isolation in Gold Coast University hospital in a stable condition. The other eight people who were travelling with him are also in isolation in the same hospital. Four of them are unwell and are being tested for coronavirus. Queensland health authorities are contacting passengers on the flight the group took. They also confirmed that the Chinese women\u2019s national football team is currently in isolation in a Brisbane hotel. I\u2019m just catching up on the remainder of that Australian press conference a short time ago. The health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that two Australians in Guangdong province have contracted the coronavirus. \u201cThey have been treated and the advice that I have \u2013 and I would want to be cautious on this \u2013 is that they have been released and are not seeking consular assistance at this stage.\u201d We know that the US and Japan have carried out airlifts of hundreds of their nationals from China. A Japanese government-chartered plane took 206 people to Tokyo on Wednesday. A US-chartered plane took around 240 of its citizens home, including staff from Wuhan. The roughly 200 UK citizens in Wuhan have been told they will not be airlifted out of the city on Thursday. Press Association is reporting that it\u2019s understood Chinese officials have not yet granted permission for the chartered flight to depart. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \u201cWe are doing everything we can to get British people in Wuhan safely back to the UK. A number of countries\u2019 flights have been unable to take off as planned.\u201d Mondelez International, the American company that makes Oreos and Chips Ahoy cookies, said it expects first-quarter revenue will be hit by the coronavirus spreading across China, and it has temporarily closed two factories, Reuters reports. However, Mondezlez\u2019s chief executive, Dirk Van de Put, said the coronavirus is expected to have only a short-term impact. China accounts for nearly 4.5% of the company\u2019s sales. He said the Chinese government had asked the company to close two factories for 10 days to minimise the risk of infection. The company had also placed restrictions on travel by staff in China and ordered other staff to travel less to China. Three Japanese nationals who returned home from Wuhan have tested positive for the coronavirus, Japan\u2019s public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday, citing the health ministry. Two of the three had not shown any symptoms, the ministry said, according to NHK. The three infected people were among 206 Japanese who were repatriated on a government-chartered plane on Wednesday. A second plane carrying another 210 people landed in Tokyo on Thursday morning. The Japanese government is considering sending a third flight to collect a further 200 Japanese citizens who wish to return from Wuhan, the central Chinese city at the epicentre of the outbreak. Japan has 11 confirmed cases of the virus, including two that are believed to have resulted from human-to-human transmission \u2013 a bus driver in his 60s who drove tourists from Wuhan on two occasions earlier this month, and a female tour guide in her 40s who worked alongside the driver and the tourists. Neither of them have travelled abroad in the past month, NHK said. With regards to Australians who may be airlifted from China, only people who are well and are showing no symptoms will be evacuated, authorities say. People who are sick will not be able to travel to Christmas Island. Australian authorities are now confirming what they know about how people can catch the virus: \u201cIn terms of walking past people in the street who may or may not be infected. That is also totally virtually safe. We\u2019re talking about really close contact over a period of time. That\u2019s an important message that people should take.\u201d Australian authorities are holding a press conference on the country\u2019s response to the virus outbreak, including quarantining any citizens airlifted out of China on Christmas Island for 14 day. The island is where Australia has previously detained refugees and asylum arriving in the country by boat. Let\u2019s have a look at those new figures that have been announced. The total number of deaths is confirmed to be 170. This is up from 132 reported on Wednesday, and is a rise of of 29%. Confirmed cases now stand at 7,711, up from 5,974. It\u2019s understood that 162 of the deaths \u2013 or 95% \u2013 are in Hubei province, where the outbreak started. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, I\u2019m Alison Rourke. The daily jumps in the death toll inside China have continued, with authorities announcing a new figures of 170 fatalities. All but eight of those are in Hubei province, where the outbreak began. Confirmed cases of infections stand at 7, 711. I\u2019ll bring you some analysis on those figures shortly and how they fit into what seems to be a trend of increases over the past few days. In the mean time, here\u2019s a summary of the other key points so far: The World Health Organization says all countries must be on alert for the virus. The WHO\u2019s emergency committee will meet again on Thursday. The US and Japan have already flown out some of their citizens out of Wuhan. UK citizens have been told they will not be airlifted on Thursday. When they return, they may be kept in quarantine for 14 days. Some major airlines, including British Airways, have suspended all direct flights to and from mainland China.

      "bodyText": "The US government has warned Americans not to travel to China as the death toll from the new coronavirus reached 213 on Friday, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency. A new state department travel advisory raised the warning for China to the same level as Iraq and Afghanistan. In a notice posted on its website, the department said: \u201cDo not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China.\u201d The death toll in Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the epidemic, had risen to 204 and there were 9,692 cases of infection nationally as of Thursday, Chinese health authorities said. A total of 129 cases have been reported in 22 other countries and regions, with no deaths outside China. International alarm over the new coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, is driven by its rapid spread and the fact that infectious disease experts cannot yet know how deadly or contagious it is. An increasing number of airlines have stopped flying to mainland China, including Air France KLM, British Airways, Germany\u2019s Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, while others have reduced flights. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said all air traffic between Italy and China would stop, a more drastic measure than most countries have undertaken, after Italy announced its first confirmed cases in two Chinese tourists. The US government\u2019s warning on Thursday came as pilots for American Airlines filed a lawsuit seeking an immediate halt to China flights. The Allied Pilots Association (APA), which represents American Airlines pilots, cited \u201cserious, and in many ways still unknown, health threats posed by the coronavirus\u201d in a lawsuit filed in Texas, where the airline is based. A US flight attendant who recently landed from one major Chinese city said a big concern was spreading the virus to families, or being quarantined while on a layover. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand the gravity of the situation until I went there,\u201d said the attendant, describing general paranoia on the return flight, with every passenger wearing a mask. \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019m on a 14-day countdown,\u201d said the attendant, referring to the 14-day incubation period for the virus, during which time Chinese health authorities say a person can be infectious. \ufeff Foreign governments continued evacuating their citizens from Hubei and holding them in quarantine. \ufeff Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, said the organization \u201cdoesn\u2019t recommend \u2013 and actually opposes\u201d restrictions on travel or trade with China. In a news conference in Geneva on Thursday evening, Tedros said the WHO was declaring a global health emergency because it was concerned about the virus spreading to countries that did not have the resources to deal with it. \u201cThe main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,\u201d he said. \ufeff Lockdown in Wuhan The virus is believed to have originated late last year in a food market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife. About 60 million people in Hubei province are now living under virtual lockdown. There had been a further 1,220 cases detected in Hubei by end of 30 January, taking the total for the province to close to 6,000, Hubei\u2019s health commission said. New cases are being reported every day around the world, spurring cuts to travel, outbreaks of anti-China sentiment and a surge in demand for protective face masks. Medical experts say the rising number of human-to-human transmissions outside China suggests a greater potential for the virus to spread further. Statistics from China indicate that just over 2% of people infected have died, suggesting that the virus may be less deadly than the coronaviruses behind the 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), as well as Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers). In China, thousands of factory workers on lunar new year holidays may struggle to get back to work next week due to travel restrictions.

      "body": "<p>Fake news and conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus have swiftly followed the outbreak around the world.</p> <p>The quick spread of the virus from its origins in China\u2019s Hubei province, and the lack of early detail about where it comes from or how to treat it, has provided ample room for speculation. One week after the city of Wuhan was placed under effective lockdown, the tide of misinformation is so high that Twitter, Facebook, and Google are struggling to cope.</p> <p>On Friday, after the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency, <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/01/coronavirus/\">Facebook said it would</a> \u201cremove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organisations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them\u201d.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1222581255574827008?s=20\">Twitter announced</a> it would \u201cadjust search prompt in key countries across the globe to feature authoritative health sources when you search for terms related to novel #coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Here are some of the examples of misinformation spreading around the world.</p> <h2>1. People eating bats in Wuhan</h2> <p>The biggest piece of misinformation about the cause of the virus is the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAQqE5jmV1I\">widely circulated video</a> of a woman eating a bat. It has been spread by the Daily Mail, RT and far-right YouTuber Paul Joseph Watson among others.</p> <p>The Chinese celebrity Wang Mengyun said <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/food-warnings/chinese-influencer-wang-mengyun-aka-bat-soup-girl-breaks-silence/news-story/63ef0cec5b6d448d1843e2e1bcadb14d\">she has received death threats</a> since the video went viral this month.</p> <p>The origins of the coronavirus are believed to have been from illegally sold wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, and bats could potentially have been the source, but the video was not filmed in a Wuhan restaurant as some had claimed, but in Palau, Micronesia, for a travel video in 2016.</p> <h2>2. It\u2019s a deliberate plot</h2> <p>Proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jordan_Sather_/status/1219795721286586368\">such as Jordan Sather</a>, have been spreading the idea that the outbreak of the coronavirus was timed to coincide with the start of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial.</p> <p>Sather claimed in a thread posted to his 100,000 followers that the disease was planned and manufactured. He pointed to a coronavirus patent granted to a firm with ties to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation. The firm, Pirbright, had to issue a statement correcting misinformation.

      "bodyText": "Fake news and conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus have swiftly followed the outbreak around the world. The quick spread of the virus from its origins in China\u2019s Hubei province, and the lack of early detail about where it comes from or how to treat it, has provided ample room for speculation. One week after the city of Wuhan was placed under effective lockdown, the tide of misinformation is so high that Twitter, Facebook, and Google are struggling to cope. On Friday, after the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency, Facebook said it would \u201cremove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organisations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them\u201d. On Thursday, Twitter announced it would \u201cadjust search prompt in key countries across the globe to feature authoritative health sources when you search for terms related to novel #coronavirus.\u201d Here are some of the examples of misinformation spreading around the world. 1. People eating bats in Wuhan The biggest piece of misinformation about the cause of the virus is the widely circulated video of a woman eating a bat. It has been spread by the Daily Mail, RT and far-right YouTuber Paul Joseph Watson among others. The Chinese celebrity Wang Mengyun said she has received death threats since the video went viral this month. The origins of the coronavirus are believed to have been from illegally sold wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, and bats could potentially have been the source, but the video was not filmed in a Wuhan restaurant as some had claimed, but in Palau, Micronesia, for a travel video in 2016. 2. It\u2019s a deliberate plot Proponents of the QAnon conspiracy theory, such as Jordan Sather, have been spreading the idea that the outbreak of the coronavirus was timed to coincide with the start of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. Sather claimed in a thread posted to his 100,000 followers that the disease was planned and manufactured. He pointed to a coronavirus patent granted to a firm with ties to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation. The firm, Pirbright, had to issue a statement correcting misinformation. The firm said it researches infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus that infects poultry and pigs \u2013 not humans. 3. It\u2019s a bioweapon The Washington Times claimed in a story that the coronavirus outbreak could be linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, quoting a former Israeli military intelligence officer who claimed a bioweapon was one possible option. Other conspiracy theories have suggested the virus was smuggled out of Canada into China. The Washington Post, however, spoke to a number of experts who said based on the virus genome there is no indication it was engineered. The MIT professor Vipin Narang said in a tweet that there is no evidence it is a bioweapon, and if it were, it would be a bad one, because a good bioweapon should be more deadly but not as easily spread. 4. 5G caused the spread of coronavirus These days 5G is blamed for everything, from cancer to bushfires, so it is not surprising that conspiracy theories that 5G caused, or helped spread coronavirus have been shared into the anti-5G groups on Facebook. One post debunked on Facebook claimed Wuhan was where 5G was first rolled out, and 5G \u201cwrecked immune systems and thereby boosted the virulency of the normal cold\u201d. Wuhan was one of a few places where 5G was rolled out in China in 2020, along with other parts of the world. There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans. 5. Just take oregano oil, vitamin C or salt water Prominent anti-vaxxers and natural medicine groups have been sharing posts suggesting oregano oil, vitamin C, and salt water are either good ways to prevent coronavirus or cure it. They will not. 6. Just drink bleach One of the more dangerous remedies again comes from prominent QAnon conspiracy followers, with Daily Beast reporting the pro-Trump conspiracy theorists have told people to buy their \u201cmiracle mineral solution\u201d that is supposed to cure everything, including autism or HIV/AIDS. The Food and Drug Administration has said the solution is \u201ca dangerous bleach\u201d. 7. Chinese Red Bull and fortune cookies are virus carriers There have been various viral posts on social media all trying to appear to be an official health-related update about what people should do to try to prevent them from getting in contact with the coronavirus. One of the most prominent spread in Australia, via childcare centres, is an apparent \u201curgent notice\u201d from the \u201cDepartment of Diseasology Parramatta\u201d. This non-existent department warned of food that could be contaminated including wuxhang rice, fortune cookies, migoreng noodles, Yakult, and Chinese Red Bull. The New South Wales health department was forced to issue a statement stating there was no such entity as the Department of Diseasology Parramatta. \u201cNSW Health would like to assure the community that the locations mentioned in this post pose no risk to visitors, and there have been no \u2018positive readings\u2019 at train stations.\u201d 8. The no-go suburbs Another warning spread on social media claims to come from Queensland Health and warns people to stay away from certain suburbs in Brisbane and any populated areas that have a certain proportion of Chinese residents. The Brisbane MP Duncan Pegg tweeted that the warning was fake and designed to malign the community.",

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Friday\u2019s blog: The Q&amp;A portion of the Senate impeachment trial concluded, with House Democrats making the case to hear witness testimony and Trump\u2019s legal team arguing for a swift acquittal. Senator Lamar Alexander \u2014 who was considered a swing Republican \u2014 announced he intends to vote \u2018no\u2019 on witnesses. Republicans Mitt Romney and Susan Collins said they\u2019ll vote in favor of considering additional witnesses, and Lisa Murkowski is undecided. Despite a couple of defectors, it seems the Republicans have lined up the votes to block additional testimony and evidence, and are headed for acquittal. As Senators considered his fate, Donald Trump raged against what he characterized as a \u201cderanged witch hunt hoax\u201d at a campaign rally in Iowa. The trial will reconvene at 1pm ET tomorrow. Even if he\u2019s not called to testify before the senate John Bolton could take matters into his own hands, and present his account in a public interview. He\u2019s unlikely to do so \u2014 but at an event earlier today, the former national security adviser praised officials who did testify, even as he hesitated. Speaking at a private event in Texas, Bolton reportedly praised officials who testified in the House impeachment investigation. Fiona Hill, Tim Morrison, Alex Vindman, Bill Taylor, and Marie Yovanovitch \u201cacted in the best interest of the country as they saw it and consistent to what they thought our policies were,\u201d Bolton said, according to KXAN Austin. \u201cThere is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the U.S. Constitution\u2019s high bar for an impeachable offense,\u201d Alexander said in a statement. The Tennessee Republican added: \u201cIt was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation.\u201d \u201cBut the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year\u2019s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.\u201d Alexander\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 vote means it\u2019s highly unlikely that the Senate would hear additional testimony. Donald Trump could be acquitted as soon as tomorrow. Republican senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine have indicated that they\u2019d like to hear from witnesses. But even if Lisa Murkowski, the remaining undecided Republican senator from Alaska, joins them, the senators will likely end up with a tie. Although there is precedent for the Chief Justice to break such a time, John Roberts, who has taken a hands-off approach in the trial so far, is unlikely to interfere. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican of Maine has issued a statement saying she will \u201cvote in support of the motion to allow witnesses and documents to be subpoenaed\u201d Lisa Murkowski, the Republican senator from Alaska who could be a swing vote on the question of witnesses, has said she\u2019s going to \u201creflect\u201d and decide whether she needs to \u201chear more\u201d. Senator Susan Collins, a Republican of Maine, said she\u2019s decided to vote for witnesses. And Lamar Alexander, a Republican senator from Tennessee, is expected to announce his position on witnesses shortly. The Senate trial has adjourned for the day. Responding to a last question, walked up to the Chief Justice personally by Senator Amy Klobuchar, House manager Jerrold Nadler made one last plea to Senators to call witnesses. The president\u2019s lawyers know that witness testimony \u201cwill only strengthen the case\u201d against the president, Nadler said. \u201cThe truth can be bolstered,\u201d Nadler said. Republican Senators Graham, Cruz, Portman, Alexander, Toomey, Sullivan and Murkowski (who is still undecided on witnesses) asked the Trump legal team: \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that the allegations would still not rise to the level of an impeachable offense and would add nothing to this case\u201d even if Bolton were to testify. Although Trump\u2019s lawyers have been distancing themselves from Alan Dershowitz\u2019s earlier argument that nothing short of a criminal act is impeachable, White House counsel Patrick Philbin more or less agreed \u2014 regardless of what Bolton says, Trump shouldn\u2019t be impeached. \u201cEven if Ambassador Bolton would testify to that, even if you assumed it were true, there is no impeachable offense stated in the articles of impeachment,\u201d he said. House manager Adam Schiff, responding at the request of Democratic senators, said \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much question\u201d about what Bolton would say. There\u2019s also little question over what Donald Trump has done wrong, Schiff added. What the president\u2019s defense is saying, Schiff said, is that \u201cthe president of the United States can withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid that we appropriated, can do so in violation of the law, can do so to coerce an ally in order to help him cheat in an election\u201d but \u201ctoo bad, there\u2019s nothing you can do\u201d. Senator Lisa Murkowski\u2019s cosign on the leading question from Republican senators may be a sign that despite some vacillation, she\u2019ll ultimately vote against hearing witness testimony. The state department has advised against all travel to China due to coronavirus outbreak \u201cThose currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has requested that all non-essential U.S. government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus,\u201d the state department advised. Follow the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, which the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency. With the trial back in session, House manager Adam Schiff said that the Trump team\u2019s justification for not calling witnesses makes no sense. The argument that \u201c\u2018if their case is so good, let them try it without witnesses,\u2019 is not a valid argument,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t fly before any judge in America and it shouldn\u2019t fly here either.\u201d The Trump administration made clear that it wouldn\u2019t cooperate with Congress\u2019 impeachment investigation, Schiff said \u2014 making a case for the Senate to get the evidence the House wasn\u2019t able to. The Senate has taken a super-quick break. Impeachment was one of the things on the president\u2019s mind as he addressed the crowd at his campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa. Democrats are \u201cobsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re having probably the best years we\u2019ve ever had in the history of our country. And I just got impeached!\u201d Trump derided \u201cCrazy Schiff\u201d and \u201cShifty Schiff\u201d before reassuring the crowd that his poll numbers were up and Republicans would retake the House in November. He shared a number of his other grievances against the Democrats, including their environmental policies which he said would \u201ckill our cows\u201d. \u201cThat means you\u2019re next,\u201d he told his Iowan supporters. He also said that \u201cthrough a remittance, illegal aliens from Mexico are going to pay for the wall,\u201d without offering any other information about what that means or how it would work. \u201cYou\u2019d better let me win!\u201d he yelled out to the crowd. If you had \u201cBenghazi\u201d on your impeachment bingo card, rejoice. GOP senators Hawley, Sasse and Barrasso raised the Benghazi final report and asked Trump\u2019s defense: \u201cDoes President Trump owe more compliance than other presidents did?\u201d White House counsel Jay Sekulow upheld Trump\u2019s claim to \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d. The idea that \u201cabsolute immunity can\u2019t possibly exist\u201d is ridiculous, Sekulow said, making the puzzling argument that scores of past presidents have had immunity. Cutting a deal on witnesses may make \u201ceveryone happy\u201d, he continued, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t make the constitution happy\u201d. It\u2019s worth noting that the past dozen Senate impeachment trials have called witnesses. Senator Lisa Murkowski, a potential Republican swing vote on the question of witnesses, just posed an pointed question. Noting the reporting on former national security advisor John Bolton\u2019s unpublished book, she asked: \u201cWhy should this body not call Ambassador Bolton?\u201d \u201cThe reporting on Ambassador Bolton\u2019s book suggests the President told Bolton directly that the aid would not be released until Ukraine announced the investigations the President desired,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis dispute about material facts weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses with direct knowledge.\u201d The president\u2019s counsel responded that calling witnesses in this case would set a bad precedent for future impeachment trials. \u201cI think that\u2019s very damaging for the future of this institution,\u201d said Patrick Philbin. Philbin reiterated an assertion that if the House wanted to hear from Bolton, they should have worked harder to get his testimony. \u201cIt will do grave damage to this body as an institution to say that the proceedings in the House don\u2019t have to really be complete,\u201d he said. Murkowski, a senator of Alaska, has maintained that she\u2019s undecided on witnesses. During the dinner break, she was seen huddling with Lamar Alexander, another Republican who may vote in favor of witnesses. The House of Representatives adjourned earlier today. Their next vote is scheduled for Tuesday, before Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address. Trump may be acquitted by then, or his trial could be ongoing as he addresses Congress in a televised address. In other House news, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019 dog, Deco, has made his Congressional debut. Senator Lamar Alexander, a potential Republican swing vote on witnesses, was seen passing a note to Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, launching even more speculation on what Alexander will decide. Earlier, Lamar was spotted reading the book\u201cImpeachment: An American History\u201d in the Senate chamber. The book details the impeachment cases against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. The Senate is back in session, and House managers and Trump lawyers are back to fielding questions. GOP Senators found a new way to raise the topic of the Bidens and Burisma: \u201cDo you agree with John Kerry\u2019s stepson that Hunter Biden working with Burisma was unacceptable?\u201d House manager Adam Schiff dismissed the \u201ccooky\u201d conspiracy theory. If you missed where John Kerry\u2019s stepson comes in, the Washington Post wrote a good explainer: When then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son joined the board of an obscure Ukrainian gas company half a decade ago, it was a stunning coup for its owner, a former Ukrainian minister working to remake the company\u2019s image as he faced a money-laundering investigation. For Hunter Biden, the job came with risks: Ukraine was in the throes of political upheaval, and there was building scrutiny of former government officials profiting in the lucrative gas industry. His father was the face of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to get Ukraine to crack down on corruption. The region was so unsettled that one of Hunter Biden\u2019s investment firm partners at the time \u2014 former secretary of state John F. Kerry\u2019s stepson \u2014 believed that joining the board of Burisma Holdings was a bad idea and ended his business relationship with Biden and another partner, his spokesman told The Washington Post. Before the break, House manager Adam Schiff even more directly reassured senators concerned about \u201cendless delays\u201d, once again suggesting a one-week period for deposition and \u201climited\u201d time for witnesses. Chief Justice John Roberts could quickly resolve disputes, he said. Lawmakers and journalists have been speculating all day about how the upcoming votes on witnesses could fall. Republican Senators Lamar Alexander and Lisa Murkowski were spotted together during the dinner break. Both are potential swing votes, and have told reporters they remain undecided. Alexander is expected to announce his position tonight. The trial has adjourned for a 45-minute dinner break. When the senators return, they have about 2 hours and 45 minutes remaining to pose questions. So far, senators have asked nearly 150 questions. As the Senate mulls whether to call witnesses in the impeachment trial or swiftly acquit the president, crowds in Iowa are awaiting Donald Trump, who will soon speak at a campaign rally in Des Moines. Responding to a question from Republican senators on whether the Steele dossier would be considered foreign interference in US elections, House manager Hakeem Jeffries said that Trump\u2019s defense team had raised \u201cconspiracy theory after conspiracy theory after conspiracy theory\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard about the deep state conspiracy theory. We\u2019ve heard about the \u2018Adam Schiff is the root of all evil\u2019 conspiracy theory. We\u2019ve heard about the Burisma conspiracy theory. We\u2019ve head about the Crowdstike conspiracy theory. We\u2019ve heard about the whistleblower conspiracy theory,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep track.\u201d Virginia\u2019s Democrat-led House today approved several gun control measures, despite the backlash of gun-rights activists who flooded the state Capitol last week to protest the measures. Though the state\u2019s Senate is also controlled by Democrats and has already passed some similar measures, it is more conservative than the House and may vote down some of the gun control policy. The Guardian\u2019s Lois Beckett reported on the protests in Virginia last week: The presence of thousands of armed citizens outside the elegant state capitol building was meant as a warning: Democrats, not just in Virginia but nationwide, should back off attempts to pass sweeping gun control laws. Early in the morning, two men pushed through the packed crowd in bright red T-shirts that read \u201cMake Politicians Afraid Again\u201d, with the image of a military-style rifle underneath. Conservative pundits were touting the non-violent gathering as evidence that law-abiding gun owners are not a threat to the public despite high numbers of daily shooting deaths. Shannon Watts, the founder of gun control group Moms Demand Action, condemned the rally. \u201cArmed insurrectionists who threaten violence and lawlessness if they don\u2019t get their way don\u2019t represent the majority of Virginians,\u201d she said. Responding to White House counsel Pat Cipollone\u2019s assertion that \u2018puritanical rage\u2019 is driving the impeachment, House manager Adam Schiff responded that his characterization as a \u201cPuritan who speaks in dulcet tones\u201d is the nicest thing Trump defenders have said about him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t describe myself as a Puritan, but I do believe in right and wrong,\u201d Schiff said. Denying witnesses and evidence in the trial \u201cwill just further a cynicism\u201d about government \u201cthat\u2019s corrosive\u201d. As the question-and-answer session continues, it seems that some senators are trying to multi-task. Senator James Risch, a Republican of Idaho, is sorting out his finances. Donald Trump\u2019s budget proposal will advocate for maintaining the current levels of foreign assistance to Ukraine, Politico reports, breaking from previous budget blueprints, in which he proposed cutting tens of millions of dollars in assistance. As the Senate considers whether his handling of Ukraine aid last year is an impeachable offense, it seems the president is playing things safe by maintaining stable levels of aid. Trump and his supporters have maintained that he held back Congressionally-allocated aid to Ukraine because he wanted other allies to pay a higher share. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff proposed limiting witness depositions in the Senate trial to one week, mirroring Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial. Senate Republicans appear increasingly confident they will be able to block witness testimony in the trial, which will come up for a vote tomorrow. Some Democratic senators are calling on Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts to break a tie on witness testimony if the final vote is 50-50, but it seems unlikely Roberts would take such a step. Roberts declined to read a question from Rand Paul that named the alleged whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry. But a group of Republican senators later submitted a similar question with the alleged whistleblower\u2019s name removed, which Roberts did read. House speaker Nancy Pelosi said an acquittal would not vindicate Trump if the trial did not include witness testimony, an argument that will likely be repeated by many Democrats in the days to come. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Ron Johnson submitted a question that was clearly based off Rand Paul\u2019s earlier question, with the name of the alleged whistleblower deleted. With the alleged whistleblower\u2019s name removed, Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts read the question, which focused on a claim circulating in right-wing circles that the alleged whistleblower conspired with Democratic staffers of the House intelligence committee to take down Trump. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff, who also chairs the intelligence committee, responded by angrily denouncing attacks on the panel\u2019s staffers. \u201cI will not dignify those smears on my staff by giving them any credence whatsoever,\u201d Schiff said, calling the attacks \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d Schiff also emphasized the importance of protecting the whistleblower\u2019s identity. \u201cWhistleblowers are a unique and vital resource for the intelligence community,\u201d Schiff said. Republican senator Lisa Murkowski and Democratic senator Brian Schatz posed the second bipartisan question of the day, asking where to draw the line between acceptable political actions and impeachable political actions. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff has proposed limiting depositions of witnesses in the Senate trial to one week, mirroring Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial. The proposal appears meant to quell concerns about the trial stretching on for months and to win over enough Republican senators to have the Democratic proposal for witness testimony approved. Schiff said the Senate could return to its normal business during the week, ensuring the trial did not distract from the needs of the country. The manager concluded by arguing that such due dilligence was possible and necessary. \u201cI think we can; I think we should; I think we must,\u201d Schiff said. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin argued that Rudy Giulaini was not carrying out US foreign policy in Ukraine but was rather considered a mere source of \u201cinformation\u201d about the president\u2019s thinking. However, the White House\u2019s own memo on Trump\u2019s July phone call with Volodymyr Zelenskiy clearly shows the US president asking his Ukrainian counterpart to confer with Giuliani about potential investigations of corruption. A bipartisan group of senators -- Democrats Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin and Republicans Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski -- have asked a question that appears to center on Rudy Giuliani. The four senators asked Trump\u2019s lawyers if the president could assure the American people that he would not deploy private citizens to carry out foreign policy unless sanctioned by the State Department. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin responded by pushing back against the notion that Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, was carrying out US foreign policy, insisting he was only a source of \u201cinformation\u201d about Trump\u2019s thinking. Philbin went on to argue the president was acting \u201cwithin his authority\u201d under Article II of the Constitution in regards to Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine. The Senate impeachment trial has resumed, and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin is currently taking a question from Republican senators about how many witnesses and documents have been presented to the Senate. Trump\u2019s Senate allies have taken to arguing in recent days that the impeachment trial does not need to include witness testimony because the public hearings of the House impeachment inquiry included a number of witnesses. In some non-impeachment news as the Senate trial is in recess, former president Jimmy Carter has released a statement criticizing the Israeli-Palestinian peace plan released by the Trump administration earlier this week. Carter, who helped to broker the Camp David Accords in 1978, said in a statement, \u201cThe new U.S. plan undercuts prospects for a just peace between Israelis and Palestinians. If implemented, the plan will doom the only viable solution to this long-running conflict, the two-state solution.\u201d In a White House ceremony on Tuesday, Trump unveiled the administration\u2019s proposal, which he called a \u201crealistic two-state solution.\u201d But Palestinian officials quickly made clear that they had no intention of agreeing to the terms of the proposal. \u201cWe say a thousand times: No, no and no to the \u2018deal of the century,\u2019\u201d said Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has called for a recess, and the impeachment trial will resume in about 20 minutes. Susan Collins, one of the Republican senators considered most likely to support witness testimony, has posed another question. The question -- which came from Collins, Mike Crapo, Roy Blunt and Marco Rubio -- focused on whether there were any legitimate circumstances under which a president can ask a foreign country to investigate a US citizen, including a political rival. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff took the question first, and he said it was hard for him to imagine such circumstances, but Schiff emphasized that Trump\u2019s approach to requesting the investigations was undeniably inappropirate. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin then took the podium and chose to push back against the notion that Trump requested an investigation of Joe Biden. Philbin pointed senators to the White House memo on Trump\u2019s July phone call with the Ukrainian president, which included Trump asking for a \u201cfavor\u201d and going on to discuss possible corruption investigations. As the question-and-answer session of the impeachment trial continues, Trump is tweeting out birthday wishes to two Republican congressmen who fiercely defended him during the House impeachment inquiry. Johnson and Zeldin are both members of the White House impeachment defense team, which has been advising the president\u2019s legal team during the Senate trial. It\u2019s looking like the final vote on witness testimony could be 50-50, if only three Republicans -- most likely Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski -- support the Democratic proposal. Some Democrats are urging Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts to split the tie if the final vote is 50-50, but the likeliness of such an extraordinary move seems low. However, there is precedent -- dating back to the 1868 impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson -- of a Supreme Court chief justice splitting a tie vote. Similar to yesterday, many questions from Democratic and Republican senators are clearly designed as opportunities for their allies to criticize the opposing team. As another example, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff is currently taking a question from Democratic senator Ron Wyden asking how Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine could possibly be considered anything other than an abuse of power. It is Donald Trump\u2019s habitual practice to accuse political opponents of misconduct he excels at, from self-dealing to the use of nasty language to telling lies. At the impeachment trial Trump\u2019s legal team has invented a twist on the projection tactic, taking the charges against the president and seeking to turn them back on the impeachment managers, using the precise language of the prosecution. Thus Trump\u2019s lawyers have accused the House of Representatives of abusing its power by pursuing impeachment and of obstructing justice by running the impeachment process in a way the White House objects to. In one provocative example, lawyers for Trump have taken on the Senate floor to accusing House managers of engaging in \u201celection interference\u201d by advancing a process that could take Trump\u2019s name off the ballot in 2020. The first article of impeachment charges Trump with abuse of power for soliciting foreign interference in a US election. The House team has responded simply that the impeachment clause in the Constitution gives no berth to the political calendar and that by nature impeachments involving charges relating to the conduct of political activity fall close to elections because that\u2019s when political activity happens. \u201cThis is why the founders did not put a requirement that a president can only be impeached in the first term\u201d in the Constitution, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said Thursday. \u201cIf it were the intention of the framers to say that a president cannot be impeached in an election year, they would have said so. They did not, for a very good reason: there were concerned about presidents who might try to cheat in an election.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff pointed out that a Justice Department lawyer said in court earlier today that the House can impeach a president for defying congressional subpoenas, sharply contradicting Trump\u2019s lawyers in the impeachment trial. Schiff\u2019s answer elicited laughter from the senators sitting in the chamber where the trial is being held. CNN has more on the case that Schiff referenced: Asked by a federal judge what the House can do to enforce its subpoenas, Justice Department lawyer James Burnham said without hesitation that the House can use its impeachment powers, among other options, like withholding appropriations. Trump is fighting charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress for ordering his aides to defy subpoenas. They\u2019ve argued in the Senate that the obstruction charge is preposterous, because Trump was lawfully protecting the executive branch in a dispute with Congress over documents and testimony. ... The topic came up in a court hearing about the 2020 census. The House Oversight Committee sued the Justice Department and Commerce Department in November, asking a judge to enforce its subpoenas for documents. The case revolves around the controversial and ultimately unsuccessful attempt by the Trump administration to add a citizenship question to the census. Senate Democrats posed a question to both the impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s lawyers about who was paying for Rudy Giuliani\u2019s travel and expenses as the president\u2019s personal lawyer pressured Ukraine to launch investigations of Joe Biden and the 2016 election. Neither the managers nor Trump\u2019s lawyers answered the question, but lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff used the question to rail against Giuliani\u2019s efforts. Schiff said Giuliani was focused on a \u201cdomestic, corrupt\u201d task while speaking to Ukrainian officials, and he warned that the entire country was \u201cpaying the freight for it.\u201d Impeachment manager Hakeem Jeffries warned the president\u2019s lawyers are presenting arguments that could invite future foreign interference in US elections. \u201cThis is not a banana republic,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cIt\u2019s the democratic republic of the United States of America.\u201d One of Trump\u2019s lawyers, deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin, said yesterday that it is acceptable to receive information from foreign governments about a political rival if that information is \u201ccredible.\u201d \u201cMere information is not something that would violate the campaign finance laws,\u201d Philbin said. \u201cIf there is credible information \u2015 credible information of wrongdoing by someone who is running for a public office \u2015 it\u2019s not campaign interference for credible information about wrongdoing to be brought to light.\u201d The Washington Post has obtained a 2018 recording showing Trump meeting with a small group of Republican donors, including Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the former associates of Rudy Giuliani who have been indicted on campaign-finance charges. The recording further contradicts Trump\u2019s claims that he did not know Parnas, who has turned over documents to House investigators regarding his work in Ukraine with Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer. The Post reports: While it was known that Fruman and Parnas had attended an event at Mar-a-Lago, the focus of the event, the timing and who else was in attendance had not been made public. The April 2018 meeting came days before the two men took part in a donor dinner with with the president at his Washington hotel, an encounter captured on a video released last week by Parnas\u2019s attorney. During that dinner, Parnas told the president that the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was agitating against him, prompting Trump to abruptly call for her firing. Ohio senator Rob Portman joined some of his fellow Republican colleagues to ask a question to Trump\u2019s lawyers that was clearly meant as an opportunity to criticize the impeachment managers. Portman\u2019s decision to join in the question does not bode well for Senate Democrats, who are trying to find a fourth Republican to support calling witnesses in the trial. Responding to a question from Jon Tester, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff criticized Alan Dershowitz\u2019s \u201castonishing\u201d argument yesterday about quid pro quos. Dershowitz said Trump was acting in the public interest by requesting Ukrainian investigations of Democrats because the president considers his reelection to be in the public interest, a widely criticized argument that Dershowitz tried to walk back today. \u201cWhat we have seen over the last couple days is a descent into constitutional madness,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe only reason you make that argument is because you know your client is guilty and dead to rights.\u201d While holding a press conference about his question that named the alleged whistleblower, Rand Paul was asked why he had left the Senate chamber where the impeachment trial is taking place. Each day of the impeachment trial begins with the sergeant-at-arms instructing senators, \u201cAll persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment.\u201d After Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts refused to read a qeustion from Rand Paul, the Republican senator immediately held a press conference to justify his question. Paul read the question to reporters, confirming that the query did indeed name the alleged whistleblower. Roberts has previously said he will not say the alleged whistleblower\u2019s name aloud during the impeachment trial. \u201cI can tell you my question made no reference to any whistleblower,\u201d Paul said. But the question included the names of two people who worked at the national security council, one of whom is the alleged whistleblower. Some Republicans have been speculating that the alleged whistleblower conspired with Democratic staffers on the House intelligence committee, an allegation that intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff has repeatedly denied. Rand Paul has submitted his question, which appears to have included the name of the alleged whistleblower, as the Republican senator threatened to do. But Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts, who previously said he would not say the name of the alleged whistleblower aloud, refused to read the question. \u201cThe presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted,\u201d said Roberts, who then turned to take the next question from Senate Democrats. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell thanked senators for being \u201crespectful\u201d with their questions, which are read by Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts, and expressed hope that today would follow that pattern. The comment was clearly directed at Rand Paul, the Republican senator who has tried to include the name of the alleged whistleblower in a question, even though Roberts has said he will not read the whistleblower\u2019s name aloud. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has assumed his post, and the impeachment trial has now officially resumed. Today will be the second of two days of questioning, with senators expected to spend eight hours grilling the impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s lawyers. Not much of a surprise here: Joni Ernst has confirmed she will vote against calling witnesses in the impeachment trial. The Republican senator, who faces a difficult reelection race in Iowa later this year, pointed to the witnesses called during the House impeachment inquiry to justify her decision. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: we\u2019ve heard from witnesses and seen documents: 17 witnesses and 28,000+ documents during this entire process,\u201d Ernst told the Omaha World-Herald in a statement. \u201cThe House managers had one job: make the case for impeachment, and they\u2019ve failed to do so.\u201d Senate Democrats have to convince four Republicans to cross party lines to hear from witnesses, but a fourth Republican vote has not yet emerged. Impeachment manager Jerry Nadler said it \u201cmight be\u201d a good idea for the House to subpoena John Bolton if the Senate rejects the Democratic proposal to call witnesses in the impeachment trial. \u201cIf tomorrow\u2019s vote fails, they will not permit him or anyone else to testify,\u201d Nadler said of the former national security adviser, who has reportedly alleged Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military aid to investigations of Democrats. Nadler predicted Bolton would talk \u201cpublicly,\u201d but he added, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do to force his testimony if we lose that vote tomorrow in this trial.\u201d The impeachment trial will resume in about 30 minutes with another eight hours of questions from the senators. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Top Democrats, including House speaker Nancy Pelosi and lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff, are saying that an acquittal in the Senate trial will not vindicate Trump if no witnesses are called. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell expressed confidence that Republicans would be able to defeat the Democratic proposal for witness testimony. Alan Dershowitz, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, tried to backtrack on his controversial argument that Trump was acting in the public interest by requesting investigations of Democrats because he considers his reelection to be in the public interest. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff criticized the answers presented by the president\u2019s lawyers yesterday, saying Trump\u2019s legal team was pushing \u201cthe most incredible arguments born of desperation.\u201d Schiff warned the logic deployed by president\u2019s lawyers would lead the country down the \u201cmost destructive path.\u201d Schiff specifically called out Alan Dershowitz\u2019s argument that Trump\u2019s request for investigations of Democrats was in the public interest because the president considers his election to be in the public interest. The manager called this point \u201cthe most absurdly dangerous argument that could have been made.\u201d Schiff also echoed House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who said this morning that Trump would not be able to claim vindication from an acquittal if there was not a fair trial. \u201cNo trial, no vindication,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe Constitution requires a fair trial, and that\u2019s all we\u2019re asking.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer got in this dig against Alan Dershowitz, one of the president\u2019s lawyers for the impeachment trial. Dershowitz taught at Harvard Law School for more than 40 years, between 1967 and 2013, and has since become an outspoken defender of Trump. Republican senator Josh Hawley suggested John Bolton should publish the \u201crelevant portions\u201d of his forthcoming book to make them available before the impeachment trial ends. \u201cListen, it doesn\u2019t make a difference at the end of the day to what is before us,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cI just think ... I\u2019m ready to vote.\u201d A spokesperson for Rand Paul said the Republican senator will \u201cinsist\u201d on asking his question, which reportedly includes the name of the whistleblower, during today\u2019s proceedings. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts, who reviews and reads aloud each qustion from the senators, has made clear that he will not say the name of the alleged whistleblower or accept questions that clearly seek to identify the person. During yesterday\u2019s question-and-answer session, Republicans used some of their questions to try to depict the alleged whistleblower, whose complaint sparked the impeachment inquiry, as a partisan operative who was acting out of anti-Trump bias. Speaking at her weekly press conference, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump\u2019s likely acquittal would not be legitimate because of how the impeachment trial has been conducted. \u201cHe will not be acquitted,\u201d Pelosi told reporters. \u201cYou cannot be acquitted if you don\u2019t have a trial. You don\u2019t have a trial if you don\u2019t have witnesses and documentation and all of that.\u201d The Democratic speaker warned an acquittal would set a dangerous precedent for future presidents. \u201cThe fate of our nation is riding on how this is resolved. It isn\u2019t about just one person,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the precedent that it sets for the future.\u201d Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway also dodged a question about former chief of staff John Kelly, who said he believes John Bolton\u2019s reported claims in his forthcoming book. At a Monday event in Florida, Kelly was asked about the Bolton\u2019s book, which reportedly includes an allegation that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. \u201cIf John Bolton says that in the book, I believe John Bolton,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cJohn\u2019s an honest guy. He\u2019s a man of integrity and great character, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Addressing reporters in the White House briefing room, senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway ignored a question about Alan Dershowitz\u2019s controversial \u201cpublic interest\u201d argument, saying she would not discuss \u201cpolitics.\u201d Dershowitz said during the impeachment trial yesterday, \u201cIf a president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.\u201d Dershowitz tried to walk back that argument today, claiming the media had misinterpreted his comments. Trump is once again lashing out against Adam Schiff, describing the lead impeachment manager as \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cmentally deranged.\u201d This actually isn\u2019t the first time the president has called the Democratic congressman \u201cderanged.\u201d At the Nato summit in London last month, Trump used the same insult, raising concerns about a president leveling political attacks while traveling abroad. \u201cI think he\u2019s a maniac,\u201d Trump said at the time. \u201cI think Adam Schiff is a deranged human being. I think he grew up with a complex for lots of reasons that are obvious. I think he\u2019s a very sick man.\u201d Today is day two of the question-and-answer sessions in the impeachment trial, and it is expected to be another eight hours of queries from senators to the impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s lawyers. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was just asked on Capitol Hill if he felt confident about tomorrow\u2019s vote on witness testimony in the impeachment trial. \u201cI always do,\u201d the Kentucky Republican replied. Asked whether he expects a vote on acquittal tomorrow night, McConnell replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll see what tomorrow brings.\u201d Some Democratic senators are pushing for Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts to break a tie on witness testimony if the final vote is 50-50. Democrats may only manage to pick off three Republican senators -- most likely Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski -- for the witness proposal. In that case, the final vote on calling witnesses would be 50-50. Usually, 50-50 votes in the Senate are broken by the vice president, but that\u2019s not possible in this case because of Mike Pence\u2019s conflict of interest in the impeachment trial. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has indicated that he will consider a tie vote to be a failed vote, so witnesses will theoretically not be called if the vote is 50-50. That\u2019s why some Democratic senators are calling on Roberts, who was nominated by George W Bush, to break the tie. But that would be a pretty extraordinary step for Roberts, so the odds of it happening seem low. Alan Dershowitz, one of the president\u2019s lawyers, is trying to backtrack on an argument he made yesterday during the impeachment trial. Many commentators reacted with confusion and outrage when Dershowitz said Trump was acting in \u201cthe public interest\u201d by pushing for Ukrainian investigations of Democrats because the president considers his reelection to be in the public interest. \u201cIf a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,\u201d Dershowitz told senators as part of the question-and-answer session. The president\u2019s lawyer is now trying to walk back that argument, blaming the media for distorting his point. (But the video above clearly shows otherwise.) This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Paul Owen. Even Democratic senators are sounding skeptical they will be able to pass their proposal to call witnesses in the impeachment trial. When asked about the likelihood of calling witnesses, senator Sheldon Whitehouse said this morning, \u201cI doubt it.\u201d Meanwhile, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is planning for a quick acquittal tomorrow night if the witness proposal fails, according to majority whip John Thune. \u201cIn the end it\u2019s going to be up to the leader, but my view would be at that point you would want to start bringing this thing to a conclusion,\u201d Thune said yesterday. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there would be any value or any point in keeping it going.\u201d Here Lauren Gambino explains more about how the Democratic primary race works: The US economy missed the Trump administration\u2019s 3% growth target for a second straight year, Reuters reports, posting its slowest annual growth in three years in 2019 as the slump in business investment deepened amid damaging trade tensions. The economy grew 2.3% last year, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was the slowest since 2016 and followed the 2.9% notched in 2018. The 3% growth target has remained elusive despite the White House and Republicans\u2019 $1.5 trillion tax cut package, which President Donald Trump had predicted would lift growth persistently above that target. Away from the impeachment, the Democratic presidential race begins in earnest on Monday with the Iowa caucuses. Leftwinger Bernie Sanders is in a strong position there, according to polling averages, although caucuses \u2013 in which voters gather for local meetings to demonstrate their support for a candidate and win over anyone else they can \u2013 can be hard to poll. New Hampshire will follow on 11 February, and Sanders is polling even better there (his home state of Vermont is next door). After that attention turns to Nevada, where centrist Joe Biden is ahead, and South Carolina (ditto), before the shape of the race really starts to become apparent when over a dozen states and territories, including California and Texas, vote on Super Tuesday, 3 March. Biden is some distance in the lead in Texas, but Sanders has a slight lead in California. The Democrats have no winner-takes-all primaries, so winning large states will not give any of the candidates a knock-out blow at this stage. Nationally Biden is leading in the Democratic race, but Sanders has now cut his lead to a pretty narrow margin. General election polls show both beating Trump in the popular vote, but not by much, and of course in 2016 Trump lost the popular vote but won in the electoral college. While the focus at the impeachment at the moment is on whether the Democrats can persuade four Republicans to join them in calling for more witnesses, the GOP is also hoping it can peel off a few Democrats to vote to acquit Donald Trump at the conclusion of the proceedings. As the Washington Post reports: Under the spotlight are two centrist mavericks who won election last year \u2014 Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) \u2014 as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017. Republican senator Tim Scott notes that any defections \u201cwould be a huge win because any bipartisan acquittal is big deal\u201d. The Republican leadership in the Senate is increasingly confident that they have enough votes to block witnesses being called in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, according to Axios. The news site notes the wily tactics of Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell: Sources familiar with the meeting tell Axios that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told his conference that they did not yet have the votes to block witnesses, knowing that the news would likely leak to the media and alarm some senators who dread both a prolonged impeachment trial and Trump\u2019s Twitter wrath. No 1 on the witness list for Democrats would be former national security adviser John Bolton, who has been issued with a \u201cformal threat\u201d by the White House to stop him publishing his forthcoming book, in which he claims Trump directly linked a delay in military aid to Ukraine to a condition that the Ukrainian government investigate one of his Democratic rivals, Joe Biden. The White House is claiming the book \u201cappears to contain significant amounts of classified information\u201d, CNN reports. \u201cWe do not believe that any of that information could reasonably be considered classified,\u201d Bolton\u2019s attorney responded. The exchange apparently took place last week, before the New York Times revealed what Bolton\u2019s book said and plunged his account into the centre of the impeachment debate. Here\u2019s a poster for an upcoming New Hampshire gig by a live act who exhumed styles and ideas thought to be long-dead and suddenly made them seem fresh and exciting again\u2026 and Bernie Sanders. My colleague David Smith has interviewed Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s formidable and controversial election campaign manager. He says the Republicans have \u201can advantage in time\u201d over their Democratic opponents going into November\u2019s election. The president was extremely smart the day after the election to say why take our foot off the gas? Election day 2016 wasn\u2019t the end of the fight. It was the start of the fight. And let\u2019s just keep going. Let\u2019s keep fundraising. Let\u2019s keep building. This is a fight for eight years. This isn\u2019t a fight just for a few months. David has also profiled Parscale here. Kurt Bardella, a former spokesman and senior adviser on the House of Representatives\u2019 oversight committee, tells him: Obviously the formula that they used in 2016 is something they\u2019re going to try to duplicate in 2020, which is really the tactic of using social media to try to distort the truth and mislead the American people and con themselves back into the White House. That\u2019s part of the reason why he was made the campaign manager. It shows how much of a priority their misinformation digital strategy is to the re-election campaign. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, and all today\u2019s other developments in US politics. On Wednesday, House prosecutors and the president\u2019s defence team both faced questions from senators for the first time, bringing some drama and edge to the trial as the allegations against Trump were debated directly \u2013 albeit through the mouthpiece of chief justice John Roberts, who read each one aloud in accordance with the trial\u2019s arcane rules. The biggest issue Democrats and Republicans were fighting over was whether to call witnesses \u2013 a proposal that has gathered steam since the revelation earlier this week that former national security adviser John Bolton\u2019s forthcoming book claims Trump directly linked a delay in military aid to Ukraine to a condition that the Ukrainian government investigate one of his Democratic rivals, Joe Biden. This is the claim at the heart of the impeachment trial \u2013 and something Trump\u2019s defence team has denied. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for the book,\u201d leading Democrat Adam Schiff told the Senate, arguing that Bolton should be called. \u201cWhen you have a witness who is as plainly relevant as John Bolton \u2014 who goes to the heart of the most serious and egregious of the president\u2019s misconduct, who has volunteered to come and testify \u2014 to turn him away, to look the other way, I think is deeply at odds with being an impartial juror.\u201d For their part, Trump\u2019s team argued that calling witnesses would change \u201cthe nature and scope of the proceedings\u201d and could lead to court challenges that would draw the trial out. And attorney Alan Dershowitz \u2013 whose arguments have frequently strayed away from legal consensus \u2013 surprised many when he claimed that a president could not be impeached for asking a foreign leader for a quid pro quo that would help him get re-elected, if he believed his re-election was in the public interest. Schiff called this theory \u201cvery odd\u201d. Trump himself yesterday attacked Bolton\u2019s credibility and warned his party: \u201cWitnesses are up to the House, not up to the Senate. Don\u2019t let the Dems play you!\u201d The Q&amp;A phase is due to continue today, with the vote on witnesses expected on Friday. Three Republican senators \u2013 Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney \u2013 have shown interest in calling Bolton or other witnesses. One more would have to switch sides for Democrats to win that vote. Trump is still extremely unlikely to be removed from office, and hopes to have the trial wrapped up before he delivers the State of the Union address on Tuesday. It\u2019s possible he\u2019ll get his wish tomorrow. Also today: Trump is heading to Warren, Michigan, to celebrate his rewritten trade deal with Mexico and Canada, and he is holding a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa, at 7pm local time. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates are fanning out across Iowa and New Hampshire ahead of the primaries in those states. Iowa is on Monday, kicking off the race. The four senators running, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet, will be in the Senate for the impeachment. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in London, where he is expected to discuss the disputes over the British decision to use Chinese company Huawei in its telecoms network against the wishes of the US, and the attempted extradition of an American diplomat\u2019s wife charged with causing the death of a 19-year-old British man.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018We have not done trade talks for 40 years\u2019</h2> \n<p>Hello, it\u2019s Friday morning \u2013 a sombre morning for those unhappy to see the UK officially leaving the European Union at 11 o\u2019clock tonight. Warren Murray here with your guide to this, that and the other news of the day.</p> \n<p>As we enter the last hours before the split from the EU, is Britain effectively declaring open season on itself? Donald Trump is poised to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/trump-will-put-us-interests-first-in-trade-talks-says-kim-darroch-ambassador\">demand the NHS pay higher prices for US drugs</a> in a free-trade deal with the UK, warns Kim Darroch, the esteemed peer and ex-diplomat. Britain\u2019s outgoing ambassador to Washington \u2013 who had to resign after dispatches critical of the Trump administration were leaked \u2013 has predicted to the Guardian that the president will reward backers in drug firms and agriculture by forcing trade concessions from No 10. The UK, he argues, will struggle to come out a winner when \u201cwe have not done trade negotiations for 40 years\u201d. \u201cPeople talk about chlorinated chicken \u2013 it is a lot more than that,\u201d Darroch said. \u201cHe believes in America first. And he believes, particularly, in rewarding people who vote for him and that is American farmers and big American corporations.\u201d</p> \n<p>There will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/brexit-day-events-what-is-happening-in-the-uk-on-31-january\">no \u201cBig Ben bongs\u201d, no church bells and no fireworks</a> \u2013 they are illegal after 11pm \u2013 to mark the moment of Britain\u2019s departure. The government says a countdown will be projected on to Downing Street buildings, though. When the moment of severance arrives, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/30/no-10-plans-low-key-brexit-celebration-at-dawn-of-new-era\">Boris Johnson will launch into a speech</a> about the future of the UK. Demonstrators against Brexit will meet at Southbank in London with torches to \u201cshine a light through the darkness\u201d, with similar gatherings due to take place in Brighton and Bournemouth. Leave Means Leave will hold a rally. Sajid Javid will hand over one of the first of the 50p Brexit coins to the PM.</p> \n<p>During 47 years of membership, the UK\u2019s permanent representatives to the EU have been at the coalface of British diplomacy and negotiation in Europe. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, the surviving nine \u201cperm reps\u201d \u2013 past and present \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/the-irony-is-we-got-things-right-by-2015-uks-brussels-envoys-on-brexit\">reflect on Britain\u2019s European story</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Britons fly out of Wuhan \u2013 </strong>Among updates we are bringing you in our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jan/31/coronavirus-live-updates-china-wuhan-death-toll-who-global-health-emergency-latest-news\">coronavirus live blog</a> this morning: a flight carrying 83 UK citizens has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/coronavirus-outbreak-britons-fly-out-of-wuhan-as-death-toll-passes-200\">taken off from Wuhan</a>, the epicentre of the emergency, bound for Britain. The US government has warned Americans not to travel to China, where the death toll has reached at least 213. The World Health Organization (WHO) has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/who-declares-coronavirus-a-global-health-emergency\">declared a global health emergency</a>. An increasing number of airlines have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/coronavirus-us-do-not-travel-china-state-department-advisory\">stopped flying to mainland China</a>, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany\u2019s Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, while others have reduced flights. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said all air traffic between Italy and China will stop. His country has, meanwhile, experienced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/spate-of-anti-chinese-incidents-in-italy-amid-coronavirus-panic\">spate of anti-Chinese incidents</a>. Conspiracy theories and dangerous preventative \u201cadvice\u201d have been circulating on the internet \u2013 we have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/bat-soup-dodgy-cures-and-diseasology-the-spread-of-coronavirus-bunkum\">rounded some of it up for debunking</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump on brink of acquittal \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump may be acquitted as early as today in his Senate impeachment trial. Key Republican swing votes that could have allowed witnesses to be called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/impeachment-trial-witnesses-key-takeaways-day-nine-thursday\">appeared to be falling away in overnight proceedings</a>. Democrats have decried the situation as paving the way for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/trump-impeachment-trial-witnesses-block-vote-mitch-mcconnell\">a \u201clawless presidency\u201d</a> unable to be reined in by checks and balances. The Democrats have pushed for the president\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton to testify with what could be a damaging account of Trump\u2019s \u201cquid pro quo\u201d strategy with Ukraine.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Lung cancer found too late \u2013 </strong>People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&amp;E because their GP missed signs of the disease, often despite repeated visits, according to findings by experts. The proportion diagnosed in A&amp;E \u2013 as many as 56% of people in some parts of England \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/31/late-diagnosis-of-lung-cancer-hitting-survival-rate-study-says\">five times more likely to die within a year</a>. Patients\u2019 reluctance to have symptoms such as a persistent cough checked out can also delay diagnosis, especially among older people and those from poorer households. Prof Mick Peake, of the UK\u2019s Lung Cancer Coalition, said: \u201cWe strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Warning of oil crash risk \u2013 </strong>The oil industry could face a global market shock if governments delay tackling the climate crisis, according to the thinktank Carbon Tracker. Its analysis warns that the longer governments wait, the tougher limits on the use of fossil fuels will need to be. Carbon Tracker says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/31/change-climate-policy-now-to-avert-oil-market-crisis-warns-thinktank\">such a sudden \u201chandbrake turn\u201d</a> could have a \u201cforceful, abrupt and disorderly\u201d impact on the global industry, wiping out billions of dollars worth of investments. The thinktank warned investors against oil market scenarios published by the International Energy Agency which predict a steady decline in demand rather than a sudden collapse. Existing forecasts are for oil demand to grow 0.6% a year over the next five years, but Carbon Tracker found a crackdown on emissions could shrink demand by 2.6% a year from 2025 onwards. Europe\u2019s most vulnerable oil company is BP, according to the report, followed by Norway\u2019s Equinor, Paris-headquartered Total, Italy\u2019s Eni and Anglo-Dutch Shell.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Sex and the CofE \u2013 </strong>The archbishops of Canterbury and York have apologised over a statement issued by Church of England bishops that declared only married heterosexuals should have sex.

Warren Murray here with your guide to this, that and the other news of the day. As we enter the last hours before the split from the EU, is Britain effectively declaring open season on itself? Donald Trump is poised to demand the NHS pay higher prices for US drugs in a free-trade deal with the UK, warns Kim Darroch, the esteemed peer and ex-diplomat. Britain\u2019s outgoing ambassador to Washington \u2013 who had to resign after dispatches critical of the Trump administration were leaked \u2013 has predicted to the Guardian that the president will reward backers in drug firms and agriculture by forcing trade concessions from No 10. The UK, he argues, will struggle to come out a winner when \u201cwe have not done trade negotiations for 40 years\u201d. \u201cPeople talk about chlorinated chicken \u2013 it is a lot more than that,\u201d Darroch said. \u201cHe believes in America first. And he believes, particularly, in rewarding people who vote for him and that is American farmers and big American corporations.\u201d There will be no \u201cBig Ben bongs\u201d, no church bells and no fireworks \u2013 they are illegal after 11pm \u2013 to mark the moment of Britain\u2019s departure. The government says a countdown will be projected on to Downing Street buildings, though. When the moment of severance arrives, Boris Johnson will launch into a speech about the future of the UK. Demonstrators against Brexit will meet at Southbank in London with torches to \u201cshine a light through the darkness\u201d, with similar gatherings due to take place in Brighton and Bournemouth. Leave Means Leave will hold a rally. Sajid Javid will hand over one of the first of the 50p Brexit coins to the PM. During 47 years of membership, the UK\u2019s permanent representatives to the EU have been at the coalface of British diplomacy and negotiation in Europe. Speaking exclusively to the Guardian, the surviving nine \u201cperm reps\u201d \u2013 past and present \u2013 reflect on Britain\u2019s European story. * * * Britons fly out of Wuhan \u2013 Among updates we are bringing you in our coronavirus live blog this morning: a flight carrying 83 UK citizens has taken off from Wuhan, the epicentre of the emergency, bound for Britain. The US government has warned Americans not to travel to China, where the death toll has reached at least 213. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a global health emergency. An increasing number of airlines have stopped flying to mainland China, including Air France KLM SA, British Airways, Germany\u2019s Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic, while others have reduced flights. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said all air traffic between Italy and China will stop. His country has, meanwhile, experienced a spate of anti-Chinese incidents. Conspiracy theories and dangerous preventative \u201cadvice\u201d have been circulating on the internet \u2013 we have rounded some of it up for debunking. * * * Trump on brink of acquittal \u2013 Donald Trump may be acquitted as early as today in his Senate impeachment trial. Key Republican swing votes that could have allowed witnesses to be called appeared to be falling away in overnight proceedings. Democrats have decried the situation as paving the way for a \u201clawless presidency\u201d unable to be reined in by checks and balances. The Democrats have pushed for the president\u2019s former national security adviser John Bolton to testify with what could be a damaging account of Trump\u2019s \u201cquid pro quo\u201d strategy with Ukraine. * * * Lung cancer found too late \u2013 People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&amp;E because their GP missed signs of the disease, often despite repeated visits, according to findings by experts. The proportion diagnosed in A&amp;E \u2013 as many as 56% of people in some parts of England \u2013 are five times more likely to die within a year. Patients\u2019 reluctance to have symptoms such as a persistent cough checked out can also delay diagnosis, especially among older people and those from poorer households. Prof Mick Peake, of the UK\u2019s Lung Cancer Coalition, said: \u201cWe strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.\u201d * * * Warning of oil crash risk \u2013 The oil industry could face a global market shock if governments delay tackling the climate crisis, according to the thinktank Carbon Tracker. Its analysis warns that the longer governments wait, the tougher limits on the use of fossil fuels will need to be. Carbon Tracker says such a sudden \u201chandbrake turn\u201d could have a \u201cforceful, abrupt and disorderly\u201d impact on the global industry, wiping out billions of dollars worth of investments. The thinktank warned investors against oil market scenarios published by the International Energy Agency which predict a steady decline in demand rather than a sudden collapse. Existing forecasts are for oil demand to grow 0.6% a year over the next five years, but Carbon Tracker found a crackdown on emissions could shrink demand by 2.6% a year from 2025 onwards. Europe\u2019s most vulnerable oil company is BP, according to the report, followed by Norway\u2019s Equinor, Paris-headquartered Total, Italy\u2019s Eni and Anglo-Dutch Shell. * * * Sex and the CofE \u2013 The archbishops of Canterbury and York have apologised over a statement issued by Church of England bishops that declared only married heterosexuals should have sex. Justin Welby and John Sentamu said they took responsibility for releasing the statement: \u201cWe are very sorry and recognise the division and hurt this has caused.\u201d They did not retract the substance of the \u201cpastoral guidance\u201d but implied it should not have been issued while the CofE is in the midst of a review of its teaching on sexuality and marriage. The guidance said \u201csexual relationships outside heterosexual marriage are regarded as falling short of God\u2019s purpose for human beings\u201d, and that people in gay or straight civil partnerships should be sexually abstinent. Today in Focus podcast: The Brexit gamble Anushka Asthana looks back on an extraordinary period of chaos in politics since David Cameron called the EU referendum. Plus: on the day the UK leaves, Faiza Shaheen argues that remainers must now put their energy into ideas to take Britain forward. Lunchtime read: \u2018The young are in despair\u2019 After an indifferent sojourn in Hollywood, the film-maker Bong Joon-ho went back to South Korea to do his next film \u2013 and, in Parasite, produced an undisputed masterpiece. Why is his stunning critique of the class system striking chords all over the world? Sport England have been handed a major blow before the start of their Six Nations campaign after Anthony Watson was ruled out of Sunday\u2019s match against France, with Eddie Jones leaning towards handing a debut to George Furbank in his place. More than 150 football-related racist incidents were reported to police last season, Home Office figures show, a rise of more than 50% on the year before and more than double the number from three seasons ago. USA Gymnastics has filed a bankruptcy plan that includes an offer of $215m for sexual abuse survivors to settle their claims against the embattled organisation.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Australians trapped in the city of Wuhan could miss out on the government\u2019s proposed evacuation to Christmas Island as transport is shut down in Hubei province. Elderly Australians and pregnant women also have health concerns about being held for 14 days in the isolated island\u2019s former detention centre, due to its rudimentary health facilities. Christmas Island is located 2,600km from the Australian mainland in the Indian Ocean. And Australian families with a mix of citizens and permanent residents could be split up. Roughly 600 Australians in Wuhan and the Hubei province, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, have registered with the Australian government: about 150 of those have expressed an interest in being evacuated to Christmas Island, the Guardian understands. Moko Yong, a photographer from Melbourne, said he was in contact with about 140 Australians in Wuhan and Hubei discussing the proposed plan. Yong has not yet decided if he will evacuate, and told Guardian Australia he was not personally worried about the new coronavirus. But he said many others had growing concerns. \u201cThere are elderly people, children and also pregnant women who are facing more practical problems than us,\u201d he said, speaking through a translator. \u201cThey are probably facing the problem of running out of medication, formula, milk powder because they probably did not plan to stay this long [in Wuhan]. \u201cIn terms of getting onto Christmas Island, people have different views and it\u2019s a difficult decision for many people. But because there are elderly people and pregnant women, they are concerned about medical conditions on the island.\u201d Christmas Island\u2019s medical facilities have been upgraded over the past year but they still lack an intensive care unit to treat critically ill people. Nor is there a maternity ward. Women on the island usually fly to Perth to give birth. Guardian Australia spoke to two other Australians in Wuhan who were unsure if they would be able to get to the airport. Yong said he knew of multiple Australians further out in Hubei, who were now effectively stranded. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult, even for people in the city of Wuhan to travel to the airport \u2026 public transport has been stopped at the moment. There are people who have concerns about how to reach the airport by themselves. \u201cIf people live outside of Wuhan, in other areas of Hubei province, it would be even more difficult. Those stranded in their own village can\u2019t get out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe current situation is they are not allowed to get out of their village and no one can get into the village. We are waiting for the official announcement. \u201cFor those rural areas of Hubei, they can\u2019t even reach Wuhan, because the roads have all been closed.\u201d Yong said there were \u201cdefinitely\u201d cases of families that could be split up in the evacuation. \u201cThere is someone who is currently in the rural area of Hubei, the parents are permanent residents, but their children were born in Australia so are Australian citizens. Under the arrangement only the child can be evacuated, but not the parents.\u201d On Wednesday, the Australian prime minister announced plans to evacuate Australians and New Zealanders from Wuhan to Christmas Island on a chartered Qantas Boeing 747. The plane proposed for the airlift has a capacity of 371 passengers: the evacuation would prioritise the \u201cisolated and vulnerable\u201d \u2013 including infants and the elderly \u2013 Scott Morrison said. Japan, the US, and the UK have already brought planeloads of citizens out of the locked down province in central China, while other countries including France, India, and Indonesia have committed to extricating their citizens. Australian evacuees will be quarantined on Christmas Island for 14 days before being transported to Perth. People who have been confirmed as having coronavirus, or who are symptomatic and suspected of having the virus, will not be able to fly. Those who are evacuated will have to pay $1,000 for the cost of their transport and accommodation. This, the government says, is consistent with previous government-run airlifts such as out of Lebanon in 2006, and Egypt in 2011. But this is being fiercely contested. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd, foreign minister at the time of the Arab Spring and the Egyptian evacuation, said online: \u201cMorrison\u2019s claim that Labor charged Australians for tickets on charter flights out of Egypt during the 2011 uprising is an outright falsehood\u201d. \u201cThe cost (about $3400 per person) was borne by the Government. Why is \u2018Scotty from Marketing\u2019 slugging Aussies to get them out of Wuhan?\u201d The prime minister Julia Gillard said in a media release \u201cthe charter will be provided free of charge\u201d, and the then head of the department of foreign affairs and trade, Dennis Richardson, confirmed at Senate estimates the costs of the charter were all borne by the government. Negotiations between Australian and Chinese officials are continuing \u2013 with particular focus on the issues of dual citizens and split families \u2013 but the Australian government\u2019s proposed airlift does not yet have permission from the Chinese government. There are acute political sensitivities in China around foreign nationals being evacuated from the virus epicentre while its own citizens are kept quarantined. This would be amplified if some Chinese citizens \u2013 Australian permanent resident parents of an Australian citizen child for instance \u2013 were allowed to leave. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the airline had asked for volunteers to work on the Wuhan airlift and had been overwhelmed by staff willing to assist. \u201cWe have actually had 50 cabin crew vol which is enough to man it five times over. We are really proud of our people putting their hand up to help. \u201cWe have an aircraft ready to go and the government is working through getting the permits from the Chinese \u2026 You need a permit from the Chinese and that is [negotiated] government to government. \u201cThe government is also working through seeing what passengers want to take this service, making sure that there is enough interest.\u201d Joyce said there would be additional precautions taken on board the flight, for passengers and crew. \u201cThere will a lot of precautions, there will be face masks. There will be for example meals and drinks laid out on the seats before the flight departs and there will be a lot of government officials on the aircraft to help manage the passengers.\u201d The designation of Christmas Island as a quarantine centre has not been welcomed by all on the island. Shire president Gordon Thomson said the island was being treated like \u201ca leper colony\u201d. \u201cChristmas Island remains a colony and is yet again getting the old regressive colonialist treatment from the great colonial power.

      "body": "<p>With deadline day upon us, the future whereabouts of <strong>Olivier Giroud</strong> remain a source of intrigue, the dashing Frenchman having been linked with no end of clubs including Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and Inter among others. Lazio are the latest outfit to express interest in the Chelsea striker, while Sky Italia have suggested he may stay away from training today in the hope of forcing a move away from Stamford Bridge. With Tammy Abraham injured, Frank Lampard is reluctant to let Giroud leave without signing another veteran centre-forward in his place and as the clock ticks down to 11pm, he will ramp up his efforts to bring in Napoli\u2019s <strong>Dries Mertens</strong> or Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s <strong>Edinson Cavani </strong>before<strong> </strong>releasing<strong> </strong>Giroud back into the wild. In bad news for both Frank and Olivier, the French sports daily L\u2019Equipe say Cavani will not be leaving PSG today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jan/31/transfer-deadline-day-the-latest-on-mertens-giroud-rondon-and-more-live\">Transfer deadline day: the latest on Mertens, Giroud, King and more \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other news pertaining to Chelsea, Lampard is reported to have been shocked by the decision of 19-year-old defender <strong>Tariq Lamptey</strong> to turn down the offer of a new contract in order to sign for Brighton. Meanwhile in Germany, starved of game time at RB Leipzig, Chelsea\u2019s Welsh defender <strong>Ethan Ampadu</strong> could be on the verge of a return to English football after Bristol City expressed an interest in taking him on loan.</p> <p>Sheffield United midfielder <strong>John Fleck </strong>has reassured Blades fans that there is \u201cno chance\u201d of him leaving the club in this window, dampening speculation linking him with a starring role in the Mikel Arteta revolution at Arsenal. In stark contrast, Southampton full-back <strong>Cedric Soares</strong> is on the verge of completing a loan deal that would take him to the Emirates and enable him to see out the remaining five months of his contract, at which point the Portuguese 28-year-old will become a free agent. Also in the market for a full-back, West Ham are hopeful of signing <strong>Rasmus Kristensen</strong> from Red Bull Salzburg.</p> <p>Just six months after his move to Shanghai SIPG, petulant striker <strong>Marko Arnautovic</strong> has been angling for a return to West Ham, but the grounding of planes out of China due to the coronavirus have put paid to his fiendish plan. Also in China, former West Brom and Newcastle striker <strong>Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n </strong>is the subject of interest from Manchester United and West Ham, but is also likely to have any potential moves scuppered for similar reasons.</p> <p>With Marcus Rashford sidelined, Manchester United also tried to sign their former youth team player <strong>Josh King</strong> from Bournemouth but are reported to have had their overtures rejected by the relegation-threatened club. At nearby Wigan Athletic, American defender <strong>Antonee Robinson</strong> has turned heads at Milan and is on the verge of a \u00a310m move.</p> <p>Without a minute of Premier League action to his name this season, Aston Villa defender <strong>James Chester</strong> is about to sign a deadline day deal with Stoke City, while Bristol City skipper <strong>Josh Brownhill </strong>has gone to Burnley in a move reported to be worth \u00a39m. Meanwhile in Scotland, Celtic are mulling over an \u00a38m move for Tottenham midfielder <strong>Victor Wanyama</strong>, who left the Scottish champions for Southampton back in 2013.</p> <p>And finally, Newcastle striker <strong>Dwight Gayle</strong> is wanted by Nottingham Forest, to help in their push for promotion from the Championship. In surprise news, his team-mate <strong>Matty Longstaff </strong>could find himself the subject of an unlikely tug-of-love between Inter and Milan.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With deadline day upon us, the future whereabouts of Olivier Giroud remain a source of intrigue, the dashing Frenchman having been linked with no end of clubs including Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace and Inter among others. Lazio are the latest outfit to express interest in the Chelsea striker, while Sky Italia have suggested he may stay away from training today in the hope of forcing a move away from Stamford Bridge. With Tammy Abraham injured, Frank Lampard is reluctant to let Giroud leave without signing another veteran centre-forward in his place and as the clock ticks down to 11pm, he will ramp up his efforts to bring in Napoli\u2019s Dries Mertens or Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Edinson Cavani before releasing Giroud back into the wild. In bad news for both Frank and Olivier, the French sports daily L\u2019Equipe say Cavani will not be leaving PSG today. In other news pertaining to Chelsea, Lampard is reported to have been shocked by the decision of 19-year-old defender Tariq Lamptey to turn down the offer of a new contract in order to sign for Brighton. Meanwhile in Germany, starved of game time at RB Leipzig, Chelsea\u2019s Welsh defender Ethan Ampadu could be on the verge of a return to English football after Bristol City expressed an interest in taking him on loan. Sheffield United midfielder John Fleck has reassured Blades fans that there is \u201cno chance\u201d of him leaving the club in this window, dampening speculation linking him with a starring role in the Mikel Arteta revolution at Arsenal. In stark contrast, Southampton full-back Cedric Soares is on the verge of completing a loan deal that would take him to the Emirates and enable him to see out the remaining five months of his contract, at which point the Portuguese 28-year-old will become a free agent. Also in the market for a full-back, West Ham are hopeful of signing Rasmus Kristensen from Red Bull Salzburg. Just six months after his move to Shanghai SIPG, petulant striker Marko Arnautovic has been angling for a return to West Ham, but the grounding of planes out of China due to the coronavirus have put paid to his fiendish plan. Also in China, former West Brom and Newcastle striker Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n is the subject of interest from Manchester United and West Ham, but is also likely to have any potential moves scuppered for similar reasons. With Marcus Rashford sidelined, Manchester United also tried to sign their former youth team player Josh King from Bournemouth but are reported to have had their overtures rejected by the relegation-threatened club. At nearby Wigan Athletic, American defender Antonee Robinson has turned heads at Milan and is on the verge of a \u00a310m move. Without a minute of Premier League action to his name this season, Aston Villa defender James Chester is about to sign a deadline day deal with Stoke City, while Bristol City skipper Josh Brownhill has gone to Burnley in a move reported to be worth \u00a39m. Meanwhile in Scotland, Celtic are mulling over an \u00a38m move for Tottenham midfielder Victor Wanyama, who left the Scottish champions for Southampton back in 2013. And finally, Newcastle striker Dwight Gayle is wanted by Nottingham Forest, to help in their push for promotion from the Championship. In surprise news, his team-mate Matty Longstaff could find himself the subject of an unlikely tug-of-love between Inter and Milan.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There has been particular criticism of a front-page headline on the Courrier Picard, a local newspaper: \u201cAlerte Jaune\u201d (Yellow alert).</p> \n<p>One man told France TV he had been approached while buying vegetables in a supermarket in Strasbourg by a woman who demanded what nationality he was and \u201cif I had the virus\u201d.

      "body": "<p><strong>Thursday 23 January (first day of lockdown) </strong>At 2am the government says my home town, Wuhan, is soon to be placed under lockdown. All the trains, flights and public transport will be cancelled. People have talked about the virus for a while. The spread of the outbreak is getting worse. I suppose it is the right decision.</p> <p>When I go outdoors I am cautious and mostly stay in the car. There are 11 million people in my city but the streets are empty. We have never seen it like this before. It\u2019s normal for a lot of the stores to be shut during Chinese new year but this is different. I\u2019m lucky to find masks on my second run to a pharmacy. I go to the supermarket but vegetables are sold out.</p> <p><strong>Friday 24 January </strong>Today is Chinese new year\u2019s eve. I wake up and a doctor friend tells me that because public transport has been suspended, health workers can\u2019t get to work. Volunteers have begun driving them, and I decide to help.</p> <p>I\u2019m not afraid of being infected: the health workers are professionals and we do not have direct face-to-face contact during the ride. They sit in the back seat. I pick up my first health worker and he tells me he will be very busy with work that evening. He has only brought one pack of instant noodles with him: that is his New Year\u2019s Eve dinner.</p> <p>Afterwards, I go to a friend\u2019s house. He is alone too because the lockdown prevented his family from visiting. We have a simple but nice meal. It is very different from past celebrations. Normally, I go travelling or spend time with my mother. Although there are only two of us, she always prepares a lavish meal for a proper celebration, with fried lotus root, Chinese kale and fish meatballs (we call these <em>yuanzi</em> in Chinese, <em>yuan</em> meaning \u201cround\u201d and symbolising reunion).</p> <p>We don\u2019t talk about the outbreak at the dinner table. It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve, after all. We should at least cheer up for tonight.</p> <p><strong>Saturday 25 January </strong>I wake up early and drive health workers to their shift. Because of the outbreak and lockdown, I have barely slept. The health worker tells me they do not know how long the city will be closed, and the situation is still worsening. The number of deaths and cases is increasing every day. I\u2019m given a special mask for protection.</p> <p>The health workers can\u2019t share much information because what they say is easily misunderstood and spread and there may be repercussions for them. The health workers I help transport seem calm. I suppose the online videos [showing hospital staff breaking down] are the extreme. I try to focus on volunteering rather than being affected by everything I read online. Later, I hear that another volunteer has been infected.</p> <p>The biggest problem with this outbreak is that information was not shared with the public quickly enough. This is a failing that cannot be undone. If the news was released earlier, the outbreak would not be as serious now. I don\u2019t know enough about the situation with medical supplies, but I hope the government can mobilise to ensure hospitals are well stocked. I feel ordinary people like us are the main force protecting Wuhan at the moment. </p> <p><strong>Sunday 26 January </strong>People who receive text messages [from local authorities] are not allowed to drive on the streets today. I haven\u2019t received a message. [Still,] it is better to stay indoors.</p> <p><strong>Monday 27 January</strong><strong> </strong>It\u2019s another rainy day. I visit a hotel manager who is offering free accommodation for health workers who have no way of travelling. Many hotels have begun to do the same thing. Some people are responsible for transferring health workers, and some people buy supplies for the hospital at their own expense.</p> <p>The streets are still deserted. No one dares to go out for dinner. The supermarket has already closed before 7.30pm. I see more ambulances today than usual. At night I see videos online of people in several buildings chanting \u201ckeep going Wuhan\u201d at each other. I guess the city is somewhat suffocating.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday 28 January</strong><strong> </strong>It is the sixth day of closing the city. I do not go out today, because it has been exhausting.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday 29 January</strong><strong> </strong>The government has allocated car services, posted information notices and arranged for employees to disinfect the corridors of residential buildings. It hits me that cleaners in this city still work every day. They have no rest and are disinfecting and cleaning the streets.</p> <p>In the past, when there were major festivals in Wuhan, buildings would display light shows to celebrate. Tonight, along the bank of Yangtze River, buildings are lit up with the words \u201cKeep up Wuhan\u201d.</p> <p>I think everyone\u2019s emotions are staying stable. As the weather is better, we can gradually see a small number of people exercise outdoors. The work of volunteers has cheered people. Of course, not everyone is coping well. People whose family members or friends are infected are suffering. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Growth in the eurozone has almost fizzled out in the last quarter, hit by weak internal demand and a slowing global economy. Eurozone GDP only expanded by 0.1% in October-December, down from 0.3% in July-September. It\u2019s the weakest performance since 2013, and raises the prospect that some countries will fall into recession this year. France disappointed, with GDP falling by 0.1% in Q4. Finance minister Bruno Le Maire blamed the protests that have hurt its economy in recent months. Italy was another laggard, shrinking by 0.3%. But Spain outperformed its neighbours, growing by 0.5%. Economists have warned that the eurozone could struggle this year, having been wounded by trade conflicts in recent quarters. But there are brighter signs in the UK, with mortgage approvals rising sharply in December. Global stock markets are falling again today, as the coronavirus crisis continues to alarm investors. Goldman Sachs has predicted that the efforts to contain the virus will knock China\u2019s growth down to 5.5% this year, from 5.9%, with a small impact on the US economy too. Britain\u2019s friends over the channel are threatening to block the rescue of British Steel. The French government aren\u2019t happy about China\u2019s Jingy Group buying British Steel - which owns a factory making steel tracks for France\u2019s railways. Not a great advert for entante cordials after Brexit (due in 8 hours...) Brexit uncertainty may has hurt UK productivity and investment, and held back growth, but it hasn\u2019t harmed David Cameron\u2019s bank balance.... Coronavirus fears have hit Wall Street again. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen by 264 points, or 0.9%, to 28,595 points. Energy firms Exxon Mobile and Chevron are leading the fallers. The oil price has been hit by forecasts of lower growth due to the epidemic which reached the UK today . The S&amp;P 500 has lost 0.5%, and the tech-focused Nasdaq is 0.4% lower. Brad Bechtel of Jefferies reckons the market reaction is overdone: The steady drumbeat of negative headlines combined with government reactions to the spread of the virus is still roiling markets a bit and it\u2019s hard for markets to find that stability. It still feels like there is a lot of cash on the sidelines looking to buy the dip it\u2019sjust a matter of timing it appropriately. The idea that this virus is nowhere near as deadly as the common flu in the US was sort of helping calm the situation and yet we still are seeing reactions in the market on every new person infected or passing away. Understand the fear around the spread of the virus but the market reaction is a bit strange to me still. The reactions of governments has been extreme and will be costly, that is important for markets, but to shake the mighty S&amp;P in the face of such powerful earnings from US companies is a bit of a head scratcher. Newsflash: Airline manufacturer Airbus has ben hit with fines totalling \u20ac3.592 to cover a series of bribery cases. France\u2019s financial prosecutor has just announced the penalties, which include more than \u20ac2bn to settle corruption charges in France. The planemaker has been investigated by French and British authorities for suspected corruption over jet sales dating back over a decade. It has also faced U.S. investigations over suspected violations of export controls. Back in the City, investment services platform Hargeaves Lansdown are the biggest FTSE 100 faller, down almost 7%. HL reported that its net new business declined 9% year-on-year in the last quarter. That\u2019s partly due to the scandal around Neil Woodford\u2019s funds, which HL had promoted as \u201cbest buy\u201d options. \u201cBest avoid\u201d would have been better advice, given the huge losses which investors face. HL\u2019s CEO, Chris Hill, says it has been a tough few months: The external market was challenging in the second half of 2019, with political uncertainty, a General Election in the UK, Brexit and world trade tariffs all raising concerns. As we have seen in previous unpredictable periods, client confidence and retail investment flows were affected. The Investment Association reported weak retail fund flows throughout and the suspension of the two Woodford funds also contributed to the general unease. Paul Mumford, fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management, suggests 2020 will also be bumpy for Hargeaves Lansdown: What price Neil Woodword? Well so far the problems haven\u2019t revealed themselves. The loss of new business must be a worry, especially if it\u2019s linked to a loss of trust as a result of the company\u2019s role in the Woodford scandal. Unfortunately the post-mortem of that debacle has only just begun. With the Woodford fund distribution guidelines announced recently, they\u2019re back under the microscope. \u201cFor Hargreaves you\u2019d expect to see at least a fine from the FCA, and perhaps even a class action lawsuit from shareholders. How that will affect their business remains to be seen. It could be a very long year ahead for the company.\u201d France\u2019s finance minister has blamed the industrial action and protests against the French government for the slump in growth in the last quarter. Insisting that the underlying economy is strong, Le Maire says: \u201cThis temporary slowdown does not call into question the fundamentals of French growth, which are solid. We are nonetheless particularly vigilant of international uncertainties.\u201d Le Maire has a point - as explained earlier, consumer spending and investment was still positive. The 0.1% drop in growth was due to businesses running down inventories. But, if those firms remain nervous, they could move onto cutting orders and axing staff.... Capital Economics are also gloomy -- predicting that 2020 will be a weaker year than hoped. \u201cThe fourth-quarter GDP and January consumer prices data published today support our view that Eurozone growth and inflation will be weaker this year than most expect. This underlies our forecast that the European Central Bank will eventually be forced to loosen policy further, perhaps in the second half of the year.\u201d Christoph Weil, economist at Commerzbank, reckons the European Central Bank will be very concerned by the eurozone slowdown - which could spur it into more stimulus measures. Weil says (via the FT): \u201cThe spectre of recession is back. \u201cEconomic growth in the eurozone came to a virtual standstill at the end of the year . . . The ECB is likely to view this with concern.\u201d The eurozone growth slump is partly due to Donald Trump trade wars, says Barret Kupelian, senior economist at PwC. This disappointing performance was not entirely unexpected, given that the Eurozone has been one of the economies most impacted by international trade disputes. While we don\u2019t have a full national breakdown of the headline growth rate, some statistical agencies released estimates of the national GDP growth rate. In France, the economy shrunk by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter. However, without the inventory effect French GDP would have grown by 0.3% quarter on quarter. The Italian economy contracted in the last quarter of 2019, meaning that it didn\u2019t grow at all last year. But in contrast, Spain continued to grow in the fourth quarter, translating to an annual GDP growth figure of 2%. We don\u2019t yet know how the UK fared in the last quarter; the most recent figures show 0.1% growth in September-November. But Kupelian points out that the eurozone has actually outperformed the UK since the Brexit vote -- as Britain \u201cmissed out on the synchronised upswing in economic activity in 2016/17.\u201d European stock markets are sliding again today, hit by the unexpectedly weak growth figures and the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Every index is down, led by Italy (down 1.4%) and Spain (-1%). In London, the FTSE 100 is also suffering, down 60 points or 0.8% to a six-week low. The news that Britain now has two coronavirus cases is also worrying traders (and the rest of the public too, I suspect). Josie Dent, Senior Economist at the CEBR, points out that France and Italy are now half-way into recession following their contractions last quarter. The eurozone economy scraped through with positive growth of just 0.1% at the end of 2019. Major economies, including France and Italy recorded contractions in Q4, and politicians in these countries will be anxious for GDP growth to return, as further contractions in Q1 would put the countries in a technical recession. However, a glimmer of home comes from the pick-up in inflation, which suggests that demand for goods and services could have risen at the start of 2020.\u201d Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on today\u2019s growth reports: Euro zone economic growth was slower than expected in the last three months of 2019, a first estimate showed on Friday, while inflation in January picked up in line with expectations thanks to a jump in prices of food, alcohol and tobacco and energy. The European Union\u2019s statistics office Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19 countries sharing the euro rose 0.1% quarter-on-quarter for a 1.0% year-on-year gain. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.2% quarterly and a 1.1% annual increase. Separately, Eurostat said consumer prices fell 1.0% month-on-month in January for a 1.4% year-on-year rise, accelerating from a 1.3% rate in December and 1.0% in November. However, the pick-up in headline price growth was mainly due to a jump in the volatile prices of food, alcohol and tobacco which rose 2.2% year-on-year. Energy prices were also up 1.8%. Without unprocessed food and energy, what the European Central Bank calls core inflation, prices grew 1.3% year-on-year, decelerating from 1.4% in December. An even narrower inflation measure watched by many market economists also excluding alcohol and tobacco prices which can move due to excise tax changes, decelerated even more to 1.1% from 1.3% in December in year-on-year terms. The ECB wants to keep inflation below but close to 2% over the medium term but has been struggling for years to spur faster price growth despite its programme of government bond buying on the market to inject more cash into the economy. In another blow to households, inflation across the eurozone has picked up. Consumer prices rose by 1.4% year-on-year in December, up from 1.3%, due to rising food, alcohol and tobacco prices. Some snap reaction to the eurozone slowdown: Newsflash: Growth across the eurozone, and the European Union, slowed sharply in the last quarter. Eurozone and EU GDP both only rose by 0.1% in October-December, down from 0.3% in July-September, dragged down by Italy (-0.3%) and France (-0.1%). Economists had expected the eurozone to grow by 0.2% in the last quarter, in the face of weak global growth and trade tensions. On an annual basis, the eurozone economy is only 1% larger than a year ago -- a weak performance. We don\u2019t yet know how Germany, the region\u2019s biggest economy, performed - that data comes out next month, as does UK GDP. Eurostat, which compiles the survey, adds: According to a first estimation of annual growth for 2019, based on quarterly data, GDP grew by 1.2% in the euro area and 1.4% in the EU28. In a fresh sign of a Boris Bounce, UK mortgage approvals have hit their highest level since mid-2017. Some 67,241 mortgages were signed off in December, up from 65,514 in November, and higher than expected. That may show the housing market is heating up, after being dragged back by Brexit uncertainty and political deadlock. City news: Aston Martin has been rescued in a \u00a3500m deal, partly funded by billionaire Lawrence Stroll. As part of the deal, the luxury carmaker will enter Formula One (where Stroll\u2019s son Lance currently wizzes about). Aston Martin is also tapping up its long-suffering shareholders through a rights issue, letting them buy new stock at \u00a34 -- compared to the \u00a319 they paid when it floated in 2018. Hopefully Aston Martin\u2019s new F1 cars will do a little better. While Europe\u2019s economies stumble, the British pound is enjoying a little rally as the Brexit hour approaches. Sterling is up around 0.3% this morning, hitting \u20ac1.192 against the euro for the first time since mid-December. The pound is benefitting from yesterday\u2019s Bank of England decision to leave interest rates on hold, dashing expectations of a cut. Traders are also looking ahead to the UK\u2019s trade negotiations. Prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to indicate on Monday that he will push for a basic trade deal based on that between the EU and Canada. Such a deal could be easier to agree by the end of the transition period in December. But Downing Street has been warned that another crucial deal, with America, will be tricky.Kim Darroch, the outgoing British ambassador to Washington, has told the Guardian that Donald Trump will demand higher NHS drugs prices -- and questioned whether the UK can really negotiate with the US and EU at the same time.... https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/trump-will-put-us-interests-first-in-trade-talks-says-kim-darroch-ambassador Newsflash: Italy\u2019s economy has also contracted, raising further concerns over the health of the eurozone. Italian GDP shrank by 0.3% in the final three months of 2019, new figures show. That\u2019s the worst quarterly performance since early 2013. ISTAT, Italy\u2019s statistics body, blamed weak domestic demand, with industry and agriculture shrinking and services broadly flat. Economists had expected the economy to stagnate, but not actually shrink, so this is a blow to Rome. On a year-on-year basis, GDP was unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 - further highlighting Italy\u2019s weak economy. With France also shrinking, this is turning into a bad morning for the eurozone.... Asia-Pacific stock markets have suffered fresh losses today, as traders continue to be gripped by coronavirus fears. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI index continued to bear the brunt, down another 1.3% -- having lost around 2.8% on both Wednesday and Thursday following the Lunar new year. With China\u2019s markets still shut, Hong Kong lost another 0.5%. Japan, though, rallied 0.5% - but still posted its worst weak in six months. It may not be all bad news for France. Derek Halpenny of MUFG suggests growth could pick up this quarter, if firms restock after running down their inventories at the end of 2019: France confirmed this morning that the economy contracted in Q4 \u2013 real GDP fell 0.1% Q/Q, well below the consensus +0.2%. The good news however is that the downside surprise reflected an inventory liquidation \u2013 excluding inventories real GDP would have expanded by 0.3% Q/Q. So we may see that growth come back in Q1. Better news: Spain\u2019s economy has grown by 0.5% in the last quarter of 2019 That\u2019s up from 0.4% in Q3, partly making up for France\u2019s decline. Today\u2019s weak French GDP report is a blow to Emmanuel Macron, says Bloomberg: Gross domestic product in the region\u2019s second-largest economy fell 0.1% in the fourth quarter amid a decline in exports and a huge drag from inventories. All of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg had predicted growth. Without the inventory effect, growth would have been about 0.3%, according to Bloomberg Economics. Still, the contraction is a sting for Macron, who\u2019s already facing mass protests and strikes against his pension reforms, and which have disrupted household spending. His government has repeatedly pointed to France\u2019s relative strength in Europe as a sign his reforms of taxes and labor laws are working. European economists are disappointed to see that France\u2019s economy has contracted. UBS\u2019s Filip Lipev says the GDP data is worst than expected, due to weak domestic demand....and a bad start to the day. Ludovic Subran, chief economist at Allianz, blames the anti-government strikes that have gripped Paris for many months: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. France\u2019s economy has suffered a shock contraction, raising fresh concerns about the heart of the Eurozone \u2014 on the day Britain leaves the EU. French GDP contracted by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019, new figures from statistics body INSEE show. That\u2019s down from 0.3% growth in July-September, and much worse than the 0.2% forecast. The decline was driven by a slowdown in consumer spending, and a sharp drop in business investment growth.. Companies also ran down their inventory stocks, suggesting nervousness about the future. Imports and exports both declined -- a worrying sign for the health of the economy. President Macron will surely be concerned -- this is the first time France\u2019s economy has contacted since he took office. INSES says: Household consumption expenditures slowed down slightly (+0.2% after +0.4%), and total gross fixed capital formation decelerated in a more pronounced manner (GFCF: +0.3% after +1.3%). Overall, final domestic demand excluding inventory changes slowed down compared with the previous quarter: it contributed to +0.3 points to GDP growth, after +0.7 points. Imports fell back this quarter (\u20130.2% after +0.6%) as well as exports (\u20130.2% after \u20130.3%). All in all, the contribution of foreign trade balance to GDP growth was zero, after a negative contribution (\u20130.3 points) in the previous quarter. Changes in inventories contributed negatively to GDP growth (\u20130.4 points after \u20130.1 points). France is the first major European country to post GDP figures for the last quarter, so this is a worrying sign - especially as Germany only narrowly avoided recession last year. It means France\u2019s economy only grew by 1.2% in 2019, down from 1.7% in 2018. We\u2019ll find out later this morning how Italy fared, and then how the overall eurozone performed during the last quarter. Reaction to follow....

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>None of the people in quarantine have tested positive for coronavirus, but any who display symptoms will be taken to the nearby Royal Liverpool University hospital, which has a high-level infectious diseases unit.</p> \n<p>However, some residents expressed concern about the proximity of the quarantine site to their homes and questioned whether the busy hospital would be able to cope with the additional pressure.</p> \n<p>Del Willden, 53, said he had nothing but praise for hospital staff and was pleased the evacuees had returned safely from China.

      "bodyText": "Families living near the Merseyside hospital being used to quarantine potential coronavirus cases have said they are concerned and confused as dozens of evacuated Britons were taken to the NHS facility. The 83 British passengers on the chartered flight from Wuhan to RAF Brize Norton were expected to arrive on Friday evening at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, where they will stay in staff accommodation and be monitored around the clock for 14 days. Public Health England said there was no risk to wider members of the public, including to other patients at the hospital. None of the people in quarantine have tested positive for coronavirus, but any who display symptoms will be taken to the nearby Royal Liverpool University hospital, which has a high-level infectious diseases unit. However, some residents expressed concern about the proximity of the quarantine site to their homes and questioned whether the busy hospital would be able to cope with the additional pressure. Del Willden, 53, said he had nothing but praise for hospital staff and was pleased the evacuees had returned safely from China. But he added: \u201cMy concern is for the hospital. This is my local hospital and I know and have experienced the struggles they suffer on a daily basis. \u201cAlthough we have been told there will be no disruption to the medical staff at the hospital, how can they guarantee that should there be an outbreak? It could prove catastrophic for the staff and patients.\u201d Willden questioned why the patients were not accommodated nearer to RAF Brize Norton, 170 miles away in Oxfordshire, where their Foreign Office-chartered flight landed on Friday lunchtime. One family in Archers Court, one of the closest residential streets to Arrowe Park, said they were leaving home for two weeks due to their concerns about the quarantine facility. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to move to London because of this,\u201d said one resident, carrying his eight-month-old baby while packing belongings into a car. \u201cThe main concern is we don\u2019t know how the quarantine will work,\u201d said the man, who did not wish to be named. \u201cWe are concerned because we\u2019ve got families here.

But this is based on data from the 1940s. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like believing the Earth is flat.\u201d More recent studies, she adds, \u201csuggest that the distance the large droplets can travel is further than two metres. One study showed up to six metres.\u201d</p> <p>The second way that viruses spread through the respiratory route is via tiny airborne particles, also referred to as aerosols. \u201cThey come from deep in the lungs, not from the throat and the nose,\u201d says MacIntyre, \u201cand those particles for some viruses can even come out with normal breathing.\u201d</p> <p>They tend to stay hovering in the air for longer, you can\u2019t see or feel them and they travel further than the large droplets. \u201cThere have been studies of influenza in emergency departments,\u201d says MacIntyre, \u201cand three hours after a patient with flu has left, the virus is still in the air.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA lot of viruses are shed in the faecal material,\u201d she adds, recalling a <a href=\"https://www.pmmag.com/articles/87031-who-finds-plumbing-link-in-sars-transmission\" title=\"\">case in a Hong Kong apartment building</a> during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak in 2003. \u201cBecause of malfunctions in the plumbing when the toilet was flushed, the virus aerosolised through the air-conditioning and an open window, and into other floors in the building as well as the building next door.\u201d</p> <p>Even a larger droplet, she says, \u201cin its trajectory from the mouth starts decreasing in size because of evaporation, and it could end up an airborne particle\u201d. Surgical masks are only expected to help protect against larger droplets, and are designed not to protect the wearers themselves from germs but the open wounds of patients on operating tables. But even studies looking at whether they sufficiently protect patients in this way have not been able to prove their efficacy.</p> <p>Furthermore, says MacIntyre, \u201csurgical masks are not regulated. Anyone can sell anything and call it a surgical mask. The filtration level of the material is not regulated.\u201d</p> <p>There is some speculation over whether wearing basic fabric masks over a warm, wet mouth may breed infection rather than deter it, but Catherine Makison Booth, a microbiologist at the UK\u2019s Health and Safety Laboratory, says she wouldn\u2019t have thought so. The main issue, she says, is that \u201cthey\u2019re not tightly fitting, and they\u2019re not necessarily filtering out aerosol [airborne particles]\u201d.</p> <p>Makison Booth is best known for creating a dummy called \u201cVomiting Larry\u201d during the norovirus outbreak of 2013.

A standard test involves wearing the respirator, placing a plastic hood around your head and spraying saccharin solution inside it. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a leak, then you will be able to taste the sweetness,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Basic surgical-style masks are more popular than ever, and what was once a symbol of pandemic panic has become an <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/28826/1/how-surgical-masks-became-a-fashion-statement\" title=\"\">everyday accessory</a>.

There\u2019s no evidence yet as to how much they help. It\u2019s unlikely that consumers are fit testing them before using them, and, even if the masks are catching some particulates, they can\u2019t stop noxious gases such as nitrogen dioxide, whereas there is good evidence for the benefits of sticking to quieter, less polluted side roads. Horii says that a major motivating factor for mask use in Japan is being courteous towards other people. \u201cIf you have a cold, you have to take care not to infect others, therefore you cover your mouth,\u201d he says. Masks have also become what he calls a \u201crisk ritual\u201d, providing a sense of control over an uncontrollable situation. Just as we can\u2019t avoid being exposed to pollution in cities, he says, \u201cflu is a force of nature. You get it when you get it, but by doing something at least you feel you are taking control.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He told the BBC he found out only at the last minute that she would be allowed on the flight after a U-turn by Chinese authorities, who had initially said their citizens and dual nationals would not be allowed on.

She was the only person wearing a face mask. At the time, the official line was that everything was under control and the spread of the virus would be prevented. \u201cThe Huanan seafood market is only two blocks away,\u201d I teased, a reference to the epicentre of the outbreak. In an all-night restaurant, the glass tanks were swimming with life. We ate noodles with crab legs. The streets were packed, drunk revellers hailing cabs after their end-of-year company parties. A man doubled over to vomit and a young woman patted him on the back: \u201cReady for another round?\u201d</p> <p>A week ago, the panic was still confined to health-conscious retirees, always prone to worrying about seasonal illnesses. News of a virus just gave older people another reason to instruct the young: don\u2019t go out, drink plenty of water. There were also the conspiracy theorists who doubted official news but couldn\u2019t provide more reliable information. To most of us, not wearing a mask seemed reasonable and logical. Who wanted to be associated with paranoid pensioners or ill-informed cranks?</p> <p>Wuhan is not a city of fear. I can\u2019t think of a time when my hometown has ever been gripped by panic. Perhaps this has something to do with its revolutionary past \u2013 the city is the site of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuchang_Uprising\" title=\"\">Wuchang uprising</a> in 1911 that overthrew the Qing dynasty. If a revolution didn\u2019t faze us, a virus won\u2019t either.</p> <p>In 1998, when I was a child growing up in Wuhan, a flood burst the dams on the Yangtze River. Neighbourhoods were head-deep in water and public transport came to a standstill. The ground levels of houses and apartment blocks were submerged, so kids would play together on the second floors of buildings, firing BB guns at dead animals floating in the water. While we had a watery vacation, our parents kept going to work. Wuhan residents have a perversely resilient streak: the more extreme a challenge, the more we rise to it.</p> <p>When the time came for my friend to leave on 19 January, official reports from other provinces informed us the virus wasn\u2019t confined to Wuhan and that it could be transmitted between human carriers. Though supermarkets were still crowded with local people stocking up for the lunar new year celebrations, the atmosphere had become more tense. I was only back in town for the holidays, and wrote to my university in Australia about extending my leave.</p> <p>The following day, I came down with cold-like symptoms. At the local community clinic, the doctor, the only person wearing a face mask, prescribed antibiotics, drugs to fight fever and traditional honeysuckle medicine. I didn\u2019t have a fever, so he wrote down my name and age, before informing a crowd of patients that the clinic had run out of face masks. Go take a look in the pharmacy next door, he suggested. \u201cWhat can we do to prevent getting sick,\u201d someone asked. The doctor lowered his mask and replied: \u201cTry positive thinking.\u201d Everyone laughed.</p> <p>The shelves in the pharmacy stocked all types of face masks. I hesitated before selecting a handful at random. Another customer arrived shortly afterwards with a bulky bag to buy the rest of the stock. In Shanghai and Beijing, masks were already selling out \u2013 in Wuhan, they\u2019re now almost impossible to find. As new year approached, they became ubiquitous, like pear blossoms budding out of season.</p> <p>A lot of people were coming down with colds \u2013 some real, some imaginary. I was due to meet friends for lunch in the city centre. Come over and drink down the virus, they said. None of us suggested cancelling. The restaurants were emptier than usual, and by the time we had finished drinking we were the only people left. Outside, as we walked across Liberation Park, we took off our masks. I\u2019d never seen the park so quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s raining today,\u201d my friend said, flipping up his collar.</p> <p>At 2am on 23 January, Wuhan\u2019s residents learned that in eight hours\u2019 time, buses, trains, flights and ferries would be suspended to and from the city. The airport, the train station and the metro were closed. The World Health Organization called the quarantine \u201cunprecedented in public health history\u201d. Concerned messages flooded my phone. I tossed a few effervescent vitamin tablets into a glass of water. My parents went shopping to stock up; goods were grabbed as soon as they made it on to the supermarket shelves. The supermarket closed in the morning, to reopen at an undetermined date. At the door a security guard touched everyone\u2019s head with a thermometer, as if giving them a blessing.</p> <p>It\u2019s a fortnight since I met my friend at the Hankou station.

Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Kushner talked dramatically about this week as a time for leaders to step up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/03/think-fake-news-isnt-a-real-problem-look-at-senator-john-kennedy\">The only antidote to a campaign of lies is a campaign of truth | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is create an opportunity for their leadership to either seize or not,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf they screw up this opportunity \u2013 which again, they have a perfect track record of missing opportunities \u2013 if they screw this up, I think they will have a very hard time looking the international community in the face, saying they are the victims, saying they have rights.\u201d</p> <p>Kushner thought he was talking about the Palestinians, in a gloriously brazen blend of racism and gold-leafed ignorance.</p> <p>But he was in fact describing perfectly the entire caucus of Senate Republicans as they screwed up their last golden opportunity for personal redemption and liberal democracy in the impeachment trial of Donald J Trump.</p> <p>How will the nation\u2019s Republican senators look anyone in the face and say they have any rights to keep in check a corrupt and criminal president? How can they pretend to be Trump\u2019s victims when they marched themselves off a constitutional cliff?</p> <p>And how on earth can they pretend to the world that their vision of America \u2013 where a president can happily use military aid to coerce a foreign government to smear his political rival in an election \u2013 is the model for democracy?</p> <p>Let\u2019s be honest. There was little drama or suspense in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, save for the bat-excrement quality of crazy that tumbled out of Alan Dershowitz\u2019s mouth. According to Harvard\u2019s emeritus law professor, presidents are <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/29/politics/dershowitz-quid-pro-quo/index.html\">unimpeachable</a> as long as they think they are acting in the national interest when they use their power to corrupt their own election.</p> <p>This could have been valuable analysis for Richard Nixon, but it also serves to question the value of a Harvard law professor. Perhaps it\u2019s only the detritus who become emeritus.</p> <p>Dershowitz claimed he said no such thing, but our eyes and ears suggested otherwise. He also said he supported Nixon\u2019s almost-impeachment, naturally. Which is to say: the Harvard man is the perfect specimen of what Trump has propagated through the body politic: a contagious coronavirus of chronic lying, cowardly ambition and plain old corruption.</p> <p>For all the fake angst about calling witnesses \u2013 did Mitch McConnell wobble on the votes to stop them or is he actually manipulating the media every day? \u2013 the searing testimony of John Bolton would have done nothing, zippo, nada, to change the final vote.</p> <p>The facts of Trump\u2019s corruption were never in dispute. The notion that this doesn\u2019t rise to impeachable crimes has always been a joke.</p> <p>We could play the age-old parlor game of asking how our esteemed Republican senators would have responded to Barack Obama asking the French government to investigate Mitt Romney\u2019s missionary exploits ahead of the 2012 election. But what\u2019s the point?</p> <p>Today\u2019s Republican party elected to remove their spinal cords three years ago, along with much of their frontal lobe and their self-respect. They wring their hands in private and lament their lampoon-worthy leader whose shoes they must lick on a daily basis.</p> <p>But they should know they are following in a fine tradition of the world\u2019s puppet legislators, like the People\u2019s Council of Syria and the Russian Duma under the expert guidance of one Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>We should in some ways be grateful for the honesty of our pseudo-senators. \u201cThere is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.alexander.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&amp;id=AA7E4960-6788-43A9-AF03-5DC456A0D448\">said</a> Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee senator who was supposedly considering Bolton as a witness.</p> <p>Having decided the facts against Trump, Alexander then decided to trivialize his criminal acts of withholding congressionally mandated foreign aid and demanding foreign interference in his own election. According to Alexander, such stuff was simply \u201cinappropriate\u201d \u2013 much like wearing brogues to the Grand Ole Opry or asking for the fish at Top\u2019s Bar-B-Q.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Faced with so many profiles in courage, our reality TV star of a commander-in-chief will carry on regardless, seeking out fellow grifters, foreign strongmen and domestic weaklings</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did,\u201d said the senator, elected to make decisions for the American people in one of three co-equal branches of government.</p> <p>Faced with so many profiles in courage, our reality TV star of a commander-in-chief will carry on regardless, seeking out fellow grifters, foreign strongmen and domestic weaklings. Will he feel liberated by the failure of the Senate trial to seek out more foreign interference in this year\u2019s election? The answer may be similar to the one about bears dumping in forests.</p> <p>Short of removal from office or federal indictment, there are no constraints on Trump\u2019s conduct. He can hire another goon like Rudy Giuliani to work with sketchy foreigners running businesses <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/23/771849041/how-a-complicated-web-connects-2-soviet-born-businessmen-with-the-impeachment-in\">called</a> something like Fraud Guarantee. Then he can shovel any amount of sketchy cash on to Facebook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-reports-25-revenue-growth-in-latest-quarter-11580333926\">mountain</a> of money to beguile the gullible about the guaranteed fraud. Because a president can\u2019t be impeached for inappropriate crimes. And because political free speech is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/zuckerberg-facebook-free-speech.html\">untouchable</a> in the fantasy world where Mark Zuckerberg thinks he\u2019s helping humanity.</p> <p>This has been a historic week for self-destructive politics. Like turkeys voting for Christmas, the British government celebrated its withdrawal from its biggest trading relationships just as Republican senators celebrated their own castration.</p> <p>Both sets of magnificent morons claimed they were acting for their imaginary friends in the future: a future where Britain will once again bestride the ocean, and presidents will once again lead the free world feeling free from the fear of partisan impeachment.</p> <p>\u201cThe Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting \u2018fairness\u2019, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1223351951963967488\">tweeted</a> the victim-in-chief sitting in the Oval Office, probably watching Fox News. \u201cThey had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn\u2019t do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!\u201d</p> <p>Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know much about history, foreign policy or politics. He can\u2019t tell the difference between his own lawyers and no lawyers; between lots of witnesses and no witnesses at all. But he does know a lot about scams, and he can\u2019t wait to share them with you.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jared Kushner is a genius. It\u2019s all too easy to overlook the sheer brilliance of Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, not least when he rolls out a Middle East peace plan that destroys the concepts of both the Israeli and Palestinian states. But for his rapier-like ability to capture the zeitgeist, there\u2019s no one quite like the young slumlord to tell it like it really is. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Kushner talked dramatically about this week as a time for leaders to step up. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is create an opportunity for their leadership to either seize or not,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf they screw up this opportunity \u2013 which again, they have a perfect track record of missing opportunities \u2013 if they screw this up, I think they will have a very hard time looking the international community in the face, saying they are the victims, saying they have rights.\u201d Kushner thought he was talking about the Palestinians, in a gloriously brazen blend of racism and gold-leafed ignorance. But he was in fact describing perfectly the entire caucus of Senate Republicans as they screwed up their last golden opportunity for personal redemption and liberal democracy in the impeachment trial of Donald J Trump. How will the nation\u2019s Republican senators look anyone in the face and say they have any rights to keep in check a corrupt and criminal president? How can they pretend to be Trump\u2019s victims when they marched themselves off a constitutional cliff? And how on earth can they pretend to the world that their vision of America \u2013 where a president can happily use military aid to coerce a foreign government to smear his political rival in an election \u2013 is the model for democracy? Let\u2019s be honest. There was little drama or suspense in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, save for the bat-excrement quality of crazy that tumbled out of Alan Dershowitz\u2019s mouth. According to Harvard\u2019s emeritus law professor, presidents are unimpeachable as long as they think they are acting in the national interest when they use their power to corrupt their own election. This could have been valuable analysis for Richard Nixon, but it also serves to question the value of a Harvard law professor. Perhaps it\u2019s only the detritus who become emeritus. Dershowitz claimed he said no such thing, but our eyes and ears suggested otherwise. He also said he supported Nixon\u2019s almost-impeachment, naturally. Which is to say: the Harvard man is the perfect specimen of what Trump has propagated through the body politic: a contagious coronavirus of chronic lying, cowardly ambition and plain old corruption. For all the fake angst about calling witnesses \u2013 did Mitch McConnell wobble on the votes to stop them or is he actually manipulating the media every day? \u2013 the searing testimony of John Bolton would have done nothing, zippo, nada, to change the final vote. The facts of Trump\u2019s corruption were never in dispute. The notion that this doesn\u2019t rise to impeachable crimes has always been a joke. We could play the age-old parlor game of asking how our esteemed Republican senators would have responded to Barack Obama asking the French government to investigate Mitt Romney\u2019s missionary exploits ahead of the 2012 election. But what\u2019s the point? Today\u2019s Republican party elected to remove their spinal cords three years ago, along with much of their frontal lobe and their self-respect. They wring their hands in private and lament their lampoon-worthy leader whose shoes they must lick on a daily basis. But they should know they are following in a fine tradition of the world\u2019s puppet legislators, like the People\u2019s Council of Syria and the Russian Duma under the expert guidance of one Vladimir Putin. We should in some ways be grateful for the honesty of our pseudo-senators. \u201cThere is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven,\u201d said Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee senator who was supposedly considering Bolton as a witness. Having decided the facts against Trump, Alexander then decided to trivialize his criminal acts of withholding congressionally mandated foreign aid and demanding foreign interference in his own election. According to Alexander, such stuff was simply \u201cinappropriate\u201d \u2013 much like wearing brogues to the Grand Ole Opry or asking for the fish at Top\u2019s Bar-B-Q. \u201cThe question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did,\u201d said the senator, elected to make decisions for the American people in one of three co-equal branches of government. Faced with so many profiles in courage, our reality TV star of a commander-in-chief will carry on regardless, seeking out fellow grifters, foreign strongmen and domestic weaklings. Will he feel liberated by the failure of the Senate trial to seek out more foreign interference in this year\u2019s election? The answer may be similar to the one about bears dumping in forests. Short of removal from office or federal indictment, there are no constraints on Trump\u2019s conduct. He can hire another goon like Rudy Giuliani to work with sketchy foreigners running businesses called something like Fraud Guarantee. Then he can shovel any amount of sketchy cash on to Facebook\u2019s mountain of money to beguile the gullible about the guaranteed fraud. Because a president can\u2019t be impeached for inappropriate crimes. And because political free speech is untouchable in the fantasy world where Mark Zuckerberg thinks he\u2019s helping humanity. This has been a historic week for self-destructive politics. Like turkeys voting for Christmas, the British government celebrated its withdrawal from its biggest trading relationships just as Republican senators celebrated their own castration. Both sets of magnificent morons claimed they were acting for their imaginary friends in the future: a future where Britain will once again bestride the ocean, and presidents will once again lead the free world feeling free from the fear of partisan impeachment. \u201cThe Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting \u2018fairness\u2019, when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress,\u201d tweeted the victim-in-chief sitting in the Oval Office, probably watching Fox News. \u201cThey had 17 Witnesses, we were allowed ZERO, and no lawyers. They didn\u2019t do their job, had no case. The Dems are scamming America!\u201d Donald Trump doesn\u2019t know much about history, foreign policy or politics. He can\u2019t tell the difference between his own lawyers and no lawyers; between lots of witnesses and no witnesses at all. But he does know a lot about scams, and he can\u2019t wait to share them with you.",

He was our number one target.\u201d </p> \n  <p>While it is possible that Christian Atsu and Ki Sung-yueng could leave St James\u2019 Park this afternoon Bruce was not expecting any further additions after failing to prise Olivier Giroud on loan from Chelsea. It is understood he did not bid for Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen. He is though happy to have signed three loanees in Tottenham\u2019s Danny Rose \u201carguably as good a left back as any in England\u201d - Schalke\u2019s Nabil Bentaleb and Internazionale\u2019s Valentino Lazaro. Meanwhile, rumours that a \u00a3340m takeover funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Sovereign Wealth fund is imminent have receded and, currently at least, constitute another non story on Tyneside. </p> \n  <p>Or at least that is what Bruce has discerned from his conversations with Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director.\u201dIf there was something to talk about and something to tell me, he\u2019ll tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a relationship with him that I think he would. At the moment all he\u2019s said is, \u2018there\u2019s nothing in it\u2019.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-31T12:03:03.390Z\">at 12.03pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e34125d8f0811db2faeebd4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-31T11:46:28.879Z\">11.46am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Barcelona</strong> have signed <strong>Francisco Trinc\u00e3o</strong> from Braga.

Who knows what\u2019s going to happen? Josh is much valued and loved by us and another club has obviously seen how good he is. Speaking as the manager, with a day to go, I would be very reluctant to lose a player of that quality [but] a lot of these things are out of my control. I love him as a player and person. I know what Manchester United means to him with his history with the club. He\u2019s a massive part of out team. He brings that unique pace and strength that he has.

Manchester United sign Odion Ighalo on loan Arsenal sign Cedric Soares on loan West Ham sign Jarrod Bowen from Hull Aston Villa sign Borja Baston from Swansea Brighton sign Tariq Lamptey from Chelsea Emre Can joins Borussia Dortmund from Juventus RB Leipzig sign Angelino on loan from Manchester City Here\u2019s our roundup of the earlier deals! Have fantastic weekends, all, and see you around here soon! It\u2019s not all bad news, Hull fans \u2013 you\u2019ve just signed Motherwell striker James Scott. Thank goodness for LNER! The exciting forward signs from the Tigers at last! Last bit of Brexit I promise, but earlier today \u2013 a lot earlier today \u2013 I asked Mikel Arteta about the importance of being able to live, work and cooperate freely in Europe on his own career, and on how important it should be for future footballers too. He replied: There is a lot of talk about the future restrictions that players and clubs will find. I don\u2019t know. I prefer to wait for the resolution. I have experience both ways as you say. I have a very clear idea of what I would like but to say it, I don\u2019t think it is the right time to do it. It\u2019s not only the right to be given the opportunity to live the experience I was able to live in this country, but how I was treated in this country. And that\u2019s something that has to be related. We can open spaces for people, but only so they are welcome after that; they can be treated [well] and contribute to something they have done. If not there is not really a point.\" If you want a bit of politics \u2013 although I have plenty of other words for it \u2013 in your evening, here is our news section\u2019s leaving-the-EU blog: Jacob is doing the lord\u2019s work tonight. Oh and also, the UK has just left the European Union. What an absolute disgrace. The transfer window has slammed shut! Except it hasn\u2019t quite because deals can still go through until 1am, in two hours\u2019 time, as explained earlier. Chelsea were offered the chance to sign Salomon Rondon on loan. They almost did it, but didn\u2019t. They\u2019ve added to their fairly thin striking ranks with a player who cost the Swans big money but never quite worked out there. Can he live up to his potential at Villa Park? Ed Aarons tells me, with a \u201csad face\u201d emoji, that Nathan Ferguson\u2019s move from West Brom to Crystal Palace is off due to concerns over his fitness. Hope nobody\u2019s planning to doze off for a while! Done deal \u2013 Connor Wickham, who I once tipped to enjoy and long and glorious England career, signs for Sheffield Wednesday on loan from Crystal Palace. I regret literally nothing. West Brom have snapped up the veteran ex-Cardiff right-back Lee Peltier on a free. And Huddersfield have enlisted their old keeper Jonas Lossl on loan from Everton. One more! Motherwell have prised Rolando Aarons from Newcastle on loan. Bit of extra info here from Fabrizio. When do we think Ighalo will be ready to play? It\u2019s such an odd one, this. We\u2019ve just had confirmation from our man Jamie Jackson \u2013 one of the window\u2019s strangest deals is very much over the line, and he arrives from Shanghai Shenhua! Another done deal in Scotland: Rangers sign the very handy Hibs striker Florian Kamberi on loan. Earlier on they made the extremely interesting addition of Ianis Hagi \u2013 whose dad is exactly who you think. Amiens allegedly not happy with Tottenham on Victor Wanyama ... Arsenal were open to loaning one or two of their youngsters out today, I gathered, but at this point nothing seems to be doing. Their incoming business is done, I can tell you that much. \u201cRemember when that cleaner tried to repaint that ancient fresco she accidentally wiped off? That\u2019s Man Utd signing Ighalo,\u201d writes Stephen Carr (presumably not *that* one). Handy cover for the Foxes, I\u2019d say. It\u2019s just occurred to me that, in their current climate, the idea of United signing Ighalo has been pretty much normalised. Zoom out and it\u2019s nuts, no? Promising signing for Macc. John Brewin, sitting opposite me, is quietly impressed. Bristol City have signed Markus Henriksen on loan from Hull City until the end of the season and Leicester defender Filip Benkovic is set to follow the Norway midfielder through the door at Ashton Gate. Benkovic was given the green light to depart after obtaining defensive cover in Wolves\u2019 Ryan Bennett earlier. Jarrod Bowen is in London! And hot-footing it straight to the London Stadium! That news comes from your own Jarrod Bowen tracker, Jacob Steinberg. This deal looks as if it\u2019s getting done. Done deal in the Championship: Bristol City have signed Hull\u2019s midfielder Markus Henriksen on loan for the rest of the season. And in Scotland \u2013 Dundee have signed the weirdly out-of-favour Hearts captain Christophe Berra on loan. Excellent pub. This is quite making me want to nip down there but I\u2019ll settle for swift Tyskie from the off licence along Hornsey High Street instead. Bournemouth are closed for business and, on the face of it, have survived a challenging window unscathed. Eddie Howe has managed to retain prized assets Nathan Ake and Joshua King amid serious interest from Chelsea and Manchester United respectively, and they have a clutch of players set to return from injury in February, most notably David Brooks, which will aid their fight against relegation. They may not have bolstered but Bournemouth are feeling positive at the close of play. Oh hello ... This is excellent. The Bowen move to West Ham \u201cshould go through\u201d, Jacob Steinberg tells me. The railways have done their job. If you can\u2019t be bothered to scroll through all the wit, wisdom, pith and punnery that this blog has whipped up over the last 12 hours or so, here\u2019s our roundup of deadline day so far: Sounds as if Ibrahim Amadou, who you might remember hopped eagerly aboard a Eurostar from Lille in the forlorn hope that he might secure a move to Palace or West Ham two years ago, has quietly returned to Sevilla from his loan at Norwich. Hey, though, at least none of us are in Parliament Square! Bowen is still on the train, apparently. This is not going through by 11. They might need to do it over a few craft beers in the Star of Kings. Don\u2019t forget to keep up with everything going on around Europe with our Transfer Interactive! John Brewin is lovingly putting all the latest moves together as we speak: Clubs actually have until 1am to complete transfers as long as they get their \u201cdeal sheet\u201d to the Premier League by 11pm. The deadline as you and I know it is merely a false peak! I won\u2019t be with you til 1am. Sorry. Beauty sleep required before reporting from West Ham tomorrow and ... maybe ... seeing Jarrod Bowen paraded to his cheerful new public. Not aware of any delays on the Kings Cross line at the moment. Jarrod Bowen has a clear run down to London! We\u2019re only five minutes round the corner if West Ham\u2019s contract gurus need to hotdesk this. Done deals in League One: Lincoln have signed midfielder Liam Bridcutt on loan from Nottingham Forest, who perhaps felt guilty at recalling the prolific striker Tyler Walker from his own temporary spell there. Also Sunderland have signed the forward Antoine Semenyo on loan from Bristol City. Just under two hours til the deadline. Just under two hours til Brexit. Both, in their different and thoroughly abject ways, parables of our times. Must be questions over Ighalo\u2019s match-fitness given Shanghai\u2019s season is nowhere near starting. It\u2019s a very strange deal to put it mildly! As Nick Miller, once of this parish, points out succinctly: Sounds like the Ighalo deal is done unless something unforeseen at the last moment scuppers it ... Not been a big window so far for Premier League clubs to get top targets over the line, has it? Are deals at the top end just much more difficult to do now than ever? Manchester United believe a loan deal for Odion Ighalo, the 30-year-old Shanghai Shenhua striker, can be done before 11pm. Complications may be his reported \u00a3300,000-a-week wage and China\u2019s current crisis regarding the Coronavirus. When the Nigerian can travel from the country to Manchester is unclear. What a career he has had ... The obvious question: wouldn\u2019t you send Bowen down by, errrm, car? But who are we to reason why ... just think it\u2019d be a bit harsh if one of those snazzy new Azumas copped the blame for this all going to pot. Further news from Jacob: Jarrod Bowen is on a train down to London from Leeds. The jokes if this one doesn\u2019t go through on time will write themselves. Should get a few more through the door at tomorrow\u2019s relegation six-pointer! Manchester United are in contact with Odion Ighalo\u2019s agents right now. It\u2019s a difficult deal to complete, both because of his salary and due to the obvious time constraints ... but they are trying to do it. Sensible boy!! Could Ighalo be United\u2019s new Henrik Larsson? What do we reckon? It\u2019s a cracking surname and a cracking loan move \u2013 with option to buy \u2013 for the Anderlecht youngster, which perhaps explains their earlier Pjaca signing. More on that Matheson deal \u2013 Wolves have loaned him back to Rochdale for the rest of the season. If the name rings a faint bell, this might be why: And that\u2019s the hat-trick! The 21-year-old centre-back joins on loan, I think with an option to buy. You wait an hour and a half for one, and then ... the young right-back signs permanently for Brighton and that\u2019s a really good addition for them. I saw Lamptey make a really good impression when he came on at the Emirates on 29 December. The 17-year old prodigy is a Premier League player with the Molineux club! The big banner-sized Sky yellow ticker hasn\u2019t had too much of a workout today, but it now says ... that Manchester United are in for Odion Ighalo. Brighton have had a bid turned down for Ipswich youngster Armando Dobra, according to this reliable Ipswich news site. A breakthrough in the Bowen negotiations? Watford have released Sebastian Prodl, their fairly long-serving centre-back. He\u2019d only played three times this season but, at 32, could surely do a job for someone. Now this is an interesting idea! Won\u2019t happen but could Liverpool have improved up top, really? Just under four hours til the deadline, although realistically a lot of deals don\u2019t get rubber-stamped til some time after. A few years ago I was here doing this til nearly 2am while I waited for Arsenal to sign Danny Welbeck! I won\u2019t be doing that again ... Welbeck\u2019s going nowhere tonight. Maya Yoshida\u2019s loan move from Southampton to Sampdoria is now A DONE DEAL. He can extend it for another year beyond this season too. That\u2019s two senior defenders loaned out by the Saints today. Been quite temperate in London today. A far cry from this time in 2009, when London was cloaked in snow and everyone was will-he-won\u2019t-heing about Andrey Arshavin\u2019s move to Arsenal. I remember watching him tuck into a poached egg in north London at around the same time he was reported to be flying back to Russia in a huff. Those were the days! A handy signing for Vincent Kompany\u2019s boys. Pjaca arrives on loan having not really cut it at Juventus, but he\u2019s a decent and powerful winger. This one\u2019s going to the wire! There we go \u2013 that explained it! Wigan Athletic defender Antonee Robinson will remain at the DW Stadium after his move to AC Milan could not be completed. Robinson, 22, travelled to Milan this morning after the two clubs agreed a fee for the permanent transfer on Thursday evening. The USA international underwent a medical examination with AC Milan, though further medical tests with the Italian authorities were required, which were subject to a 72-hour deadline. As such, the deal could not be formally ratified before the 8pm Italian Transfer Deadline on Friday. Wonder what exactly went wrong for Antonee Robinson \u2013 very odd if that\u2019s a contractual issue. Wigan might seem a bit of a comedown when he gets back ... Steve Bruce has revealed that Newcastle had a private plane booked and practically warming its engines up before Boubakary Soumare decided he wanted to stay at Lille rather than become a \u00a335m Newcastle signing. The plan was for Bruce to fly to Northern France and collect the 20-year-old France Under-21 midfielder last Sunday. \u201cWe thought we had a chance to bring him in but the boy changed his mind,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cWe had a plane booked but he\u2019s only young and he\u2019s been linked with a lot of top clubs.\u201d One player seemingly happy to be on Tyneside is Christian Atsu \u2013 the Ghana winger appears to have rejected a mooted loan move to Celtic in order to fight for his place at St James\u2019 Park. Atsu, incidentally, is one of the nicest footballers I\u2019ve interviewed. The fact that the Soumare move was sanctioned by Newcastle\u2019s owner Mike Ashley as recently as last weekend casts doubts on the idea that the club is about to pass into Saudi hands. Why would you spend \u00a335m if you were on the brink of selling up? Steve Bruce was careful what he said about a majority Saudi \u201ctakeover\u201d fronted by the British financier Amanda Staveley this morning but he did not appear convinced it will actually happen. Swansea forward Borja Baston is travelling to Aston Villa for a medical. The Spanish striker, a once \u00a315.5m record signing and one of the club\u2019s highest earners, had travelled up to Preston on Friday ahead of Swansea\u2019s game on Saturday but Baston is heading south now, ahead of Friday\u2019s 11pm deadline. Baston started the season like a train, scoring six goals in nine matches, but has not scored since September. Swansea could also listen to offers for Tom Carroll and Nathan Dyer before the window closes. Ohhhhhh ... that must be absolutely *heartbreaking* for Robinson. The Bundesliga run-in is going to be fantastic, isn\u2019t it? Do send your emails and tweets in to the addresses above \u2013 what else would you be doing on your Friday night? Jonathan Woodgate should know a decent centre half when he sees one so Middlesbrough fans will be gratified to hear their manger hail Harold Moukoudi\u2019s arrival on loan from Saint-Etienne as \u201ca coup\u201d. The former England defender also describes the 22-year-old Cameroon stopper \u2013 who represented France at junior levels \u2013 as \u201ca unit\u201d. Football compliments do not come more glowing than that ... Handy signing for Rennes. Anyone remember when Nzonzi was, for a seemingly interminable number of windows, tipped as possible Answer To Arsenal\u2019s Midfield Problems? The latest sorry episode in the Bury saga comes to you here, courtesy of David Conn: James Dart, he of eagle eye and terrifyingly good recall, points out that Van Aanholt was talking in ... wait for it ... his own \u201cPVA\u201d-customised minivan. Another one from \u201cthe continent\u201d. Sky are interviewing Patrick van Aanholt inside what looks like the back of a taxi or chauffeur car. He\u2019s really focused on getting fit and is happy to still be at Palace, which he says is a great club with great fans, despite interest from PSV. As long as he is there he will give 100% for the club. I think you get the idea by now. Any lower-league deals caught your eye so far today? We aren\u2019t all about the moneyed elite here! Done deal! RB Leipzig have signed left-back Angelino on loan from Man City with, it appears, a \u00a325m option to buy. The Bundesliga leaders are strengthening and, at 23, Angelino does fit their profile of polishing up younger players. He\u2019s never quite looked cut out for life at the Etihad though, if we are honest. Ashley-Seal is a very promising player and a stalwart of our own Next Generation series. Are you looking forward to West Ham v Brighton tomorrow? I am; I\u2019ll be covering it. Jacob Steinberg is too; he\u2019s previewed it: The Danish winger has never quite done it for Dortmund but, at 21, still has time to make an excellent career. The fee is apparently \u20ac9m. I was at Mikel Arteta\u2019s press conference earlier, because deadline day never sleeps, and he said \u201cI will say no, but you never know\u201d when it came to any last-last-last-gasp additions to go with Cedric Soares and Pablo Mari. I think that actually did mean \u201cno\u201d if I\u2019m honest ... but is there anything else you\u2019d like before 11pm, Arsenal fans? More things to show you! Here is Suzanne Wrack on Nick Cushing\u2019s long goodbye at Manchester City Women: Manchester United\u2019s hopes of signing Josh King may be fading. Can they snaffle up a loanee instead? Jamie Jackson has more: It\u2019s difficult for Liverpool to improve on their squad, says Jurgen Klopp. Here is Andy Hunter\u2019s piece: That last one is a sensational deal for Brentford. Baptiste, in particular, has been on another level for Oxford in League One at times. It\u2019s a bargain from one of the country\u2019s best recruitment teams. Brentford have enhanced their Premier League promotion push with a double deal for Oxford pair Shandon Baptiste and Tarique Fosu-Henry. Baptiste, 21, joined from Reading five years ago and has captained Karl Robinson\u2019s side, while Fosu, 24, joined Oxford from Charlton last year having also started his career at Reading. West Ham will not be signing Barcelona right-back Moussa Wague. They\u2019ve walked away from the deal \u2013 it was going to be a loan with an option for a permanent 18m euros transfer \u2013 as he wouldn\u2019t have qualified for a work permit. Hello. I am Nick Ames. I will be with you until the bitter end. But let\u2019s hope it is nothing but sweetness! And that, believe it or not, is it from me. A cameo, at best. I wish I could do more but here is Nick Ames to take you through until 11 or 11.30pm or whenever he has had enough. I\u2019ll go back to updating the transfer interactive. Have a lovely evening everyone. This should be a cracking game tomorrow, the lunchtime kick-off between Leicester v Chelsea. Jarrod Bowen update! He has completed his medical with West Ham. The Hull forward is now travelling to London to continue discussions over personal terms with the club. It\u2019s going to drag on but the expectation remains the transfer will go through before the deadline. Now to France then ... where it looks as if Nicol\u00e1s Gait\u00e1n is on his way to Lille. France Football reports. He seemed to be linked with every top six Premier League club for a number of years before moving to China and then the United States. He is now on his way back to Europe. Also must say that I like the layout of France Football\u2019s transfer blog with the crests and the stories you can click into. OK, I know neither Hull nor Peterborough are in France but someone in the office shouted \u201cMaddison has gone\u201d and sent me a gchat so I felt compelled to put it up. Done deal! Marcus Maddison has joined Hull on loan until the end of the season. And this is too good not to share with you. Apologies if you\u2019ve already seen it. Next we\u2019ll check in what\u2019s happening in France ... More Crystal Palace news! Sheffield Wednesday have agreed a deal for Connor Wickham, with the striker set join on loan until the end of the season having rejected moves to Cardiff City and Reading. Time for The Fiver, the best and funniest tea-time football email in the world (I am pretty sure it is also the only one). Sign up to get it in your email inbox every weekday! \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen him for days,\u201d says the Parma coach, Roberto D\u2019Aversa, when asked about Gervinho, who apparently has gone missing. La Gazzetta dello Sport are reporting that the former Arsenal and Roma player has agreed a deal to join Al Sadd. Crystal Palace have endured a frustrating window so far, having only managed to add Cenk Tosun from Everton on loan despite Roy Hodgson\u2019s desire for several additions to his squad. A move for Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen looks to have been thwarted by West Ham \u2013 although the 23-year-old is yet to agree personal terms in east London \u2013 while there has been more bad news today with Nathan Ferguson\u2019s move from West Brom now in doubt due to a question mark over his fitness. It remains to be seen whether Palace go ahead with the deal to sign the highly-rated teenager in the coming hours having lost out to Southampton for Kyle Walker-Peters earlier this week. Kicker are reporting that RB Leipzig are in talks with Manchester City over a possible loan deal for Angeli\u00f1o. RB Leipzig were initially hoping to sign Robin Koch from Freiburg but after that attempt failed they approached City for Angeli\u00f1o, who only arrived from PSV Eindhoven last summer. The problem with me doing the transfer blog is that I can\u2019t update the transfer interactive. My colleague Jon Brodkin has promised to step in but he is so unbelievably incompetent when it comes to spreadsheets that I fear the worst. Let me know if something strange appears on it \u2026 Didn\u2019t see this one coming I must admit ... Not transfer news but Unai Emery has been speaking to Marca about his departure from Arsenal There were several problems: four captains, the Ozil-Kolasinac case, Pepe\u2019s signing, who needs time since he came from France. We didn\u2019t play well, that\u2019s for sure. We had bad results, there was no improvement, the fans focused on me and they threw me out. With my departure, the hostile atmosphere was relaxed. Leroy San\u00e9 is on his way \u2026 back to full fitness, but his future is unclear. As we take a moment to reflect on what has/hasn\u2019t happened so far today I wanted to ask a wider audience whether Alassane Pl\u00e9a meant this or not. The consensus seems to be that he did but I am not 100% sure. Here is Jos\u00e9 being both the media and the manager \u2026 Meanwhile an hour\u2019s drive up the A19 at Newcastle, the South Korea midfielder Ki Sung-yueng is packing his bags after his contract was cancelled by mutual consent. Ki is a very nice passer of the ball but Steve Bruce felt he lacked the mobility required in today\u2019s Premier League. Ravel Morrison has, as predicted, joined Middlesbrough on loan from Sheffield United after barely getting a kick at Bramall Lane. Given Morrison\u2019s chequered past, it represents a risk for Jonathan Woodgate\u2019s side where team spirit is prized above all else but Woodgate is a bit of a purist and he evidently couldn\u2019t resist the challenge of attempting to unlock this talent\u2019s latterly latent potential. Boro have been good to watch in recent weeks; now they could be even more entertaining. Well, what a moment for me to take over. We have a done deal! Stefan Ilsanker has joined Eintracht Frankfurt from RB Leipzig. The Austrian had been at his previous club for four-and-a-half years but was his influence has waned in recent years. And on that non-bombshell, my stint on today\u2019s merry go round is over, and I must stagger, dazed and confused, into the light. I\u2019ll leave you in the steady and capable hands of Marcus Christenson. Thanks for your company and emails. Today\u2019s all about the deals that aren\u2019t happening, so far. Here\u2019s some more stasis: It seems Manchester United may have given up in their pursuit of Joshua King ... they have told Bournemouth they are looking elsewhere, presumably after learning of the kind of sum they would have to stump up to prise the striker back to where it all started. The only bid Bournemouth have received came late last night, an offer just north of \u00a320m. There could be an incoming at Southampton after all ... in the Under-23s, at least. The Chelsea midfielder Jacob Maddox could join on loan. The 21-year-old spent the first half of the season on loan in League One at Tranmere. Maddox started his career at Bristol City. James Chester is trading a club battling relegation from the Premier League for one fighting the drop from the Championship, joining Stoke from Aston Villa on loan. The 31-year-old defender wants regular football, with Wales\u2019s Euro 2020 campaign on the horizon Newcastle have rejected a loan bid from Blackburn for their Ghana winger Christian Atsu. Even so Steve Bruce will let Atsu leave today if the right offer comes in. Dwight Gayle might also have been expected to depart for the Championship but the striker is currently hamstrung and, in the wake of Bruce\u2019s Olivier Giroud move failing, will be needed as back up at St James\u2019 Park once he regains fitness. Another match preview, for a meeting of two sides of very contrasting transfer window experiences: Edinson Cavani is staying at PSG! Joining Willian Jos\u00e9 and Olivier Giroud among today\u2019s big non-movers is the Uruguay forward, dashing the hopes of any number of suitors, most prominent among them Atl\u00e9tico Madrid who seem to have spent the whole month chasing him around the playground. But the big yellow ticker of doom/delight tells us Cavani is staying at Parc des Princes. There\u2019s been plenty of focus on Rangers\u2019 new arrival today, understandably. Across to Glasgow\u2019s east end, Celtic have dismissed reports that Victor Wanyama is coming back to Parkhead from Spurs. Neil Lennon saying he\u2019s quite happy with his squad but may try one or two additions before midnight but nothing major is expected. Tranmere\u2019s Paul Mullin made the headlines with his FA Cup heroics against Watford, but now he\u2019s moving a division lower, to join Cambridge in the middle of League Two on loan until the end of the season. \u201cRe Billy the Fish,\u201d says Stephen Colton, returning to weightier topics, \u201cthis is an educated guess, can\u2019t remember for sure, but wasn\u2019t the mystery signing none other than Shakin\u2019 Stevens?\u201d Down a rabbit hole I go, and look what I found: It\u2019s been a frustrating day for Crystal Palace, what with the Eagles set to miss out on Jarrod Bowen to West Ham. Now their move for Nathan Ferguson is in doubt, a \u201cnew issue\u201d having come up in a medical, according to Sky. Though it\u2019s not confirmed at this stage. A couple of other deals to tell you about: Fiorentina have completed the signing of Christian Kouame from Genoa on an initial loan deal with an option to buy. And the Huddersfield defender Florent Hadergjonaj has moved to the Turkish club Kas\u0131mpasa SK on loan for the remainder of the season. Newcastle\u2019s mystery target, for whom a deal was reportedly agreed earlier only for the player to have second thoughts, brings to mind an old Viz Billy the Fish strip featuring a Mystery Signing who played the whole game with his head covered. Who was it? We may never know. But here\u2019s a preview of their game with Norwich with a team line-up of non-mystery players: We\u2019ve not talked Everton for a while. Luckily, here\u2019s Andy Hunter to fill us in: Carlo Ancelotti says deadline day deals \u201cunlikely\u201d. On Niasse: \u201cWe didn\u2019t receive any official offers so he\u2019s here with us. Same with Martina.\u201d And on Richarlison: \u201cHe was here yesterday, not in Barcelona. There were rumours but we didn\u2019t receive an official offer for him. The player is happy here and signed a new contract only one month ago. Richarlison is really important for us.\u201d But the boss is looking the part: \u201cHi Tom,\u201d honks Peter Oh. \u201cRe: players with chess piece names. In a way they\u2019re all pawns, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Danny Rose has revealed that he initiated his loan move to St James\u2019 Park and proactively made it happen. The sometime England left-back said: \u201cI was watching Newcastle play Chelsea and I saw the [season ending] ACL injury that Jetro [Willems] had. \u201cStraight away I got on the phone to my agent and said \u2018I want to go there\u2019. It took probably a week to 10 days to get there but I\u2019m happy that I\u2019m here. It\u2019s unfortunate that somebody\u2019s had to get injured, but I\u2019m grateful that here and I\u2019m looking forward to playing games now.\u201d Reports from the South Coast suggest Bournemouth are working those phones and enquiries about additional striking options, encouraging Manchester United\u2019s hopes of landing Joshua King as today\u2019s big saga rumbles on and on with reports that a deal has been agreed provided the Cherries have a replacement sorted out. Solskj\u00e6r had said earlier that he expected no activity today but deadline day Kremlinologists are giving it the old \u201cah yeah, but \u2026\u201d routine. Rangers new famous-name signing Hagi has arrived at Ibrox and here he is with Stevie G meeting the press in Glasgow. And now for something completely different, on AFC Wimbledon\u2019s long-term project \u2026 Not a bad deal Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has made it clear that he does not expect to make any further signings before tonight\u2019s deadline. Before anybody had the chance to ask him a question at his press conference this afternoon, the Tottenham manager said: \u201cAre you expecting anyone in? No. Are you happy with your market? Yes. Did you want a striker \u2026?\u201d The answer to that final question was yes. Mourinho said that he could not lie \u2013 it would have been infinitely preferable to have signed a striker. But, to paraphrase him, the market has not allowed it, despite the best efforts of everybody at the club. At the moment, it seems that the only action at Spurs before 11pm could involve whether Victor Wanyama stays or goes. Undone deal Klaxon: the former Villarreal forward Cedric Bakambu\u2019s move to Barcelona has broken down at the last minute \u2013 while he was on his way to Catalonia. The Democratic Republic of the Congo striker was informed his move from Chinese side Beijing Sinobo Guoan had fallen through during a layover in Hong Kong. And he tweeted thus: Manchester United have signed a player whose surname is a chess piece, but it\u2019s not a King, it\u2019s a Bishop: they have completed the signing of goalkeeper Nathan Bishop from Southend United. According to the Manchester Evening News, Bishop, 20, has passed is medical and is now under a two-and-a-half-year contract. Antonee Robinson has arrived in northern England from northern Italy for his Mee-lan medical. And as one door opens, another is creaking shut, at Chelsea \u2026 West Ham still want a right-back and are trying to sign Barcelona\u2019s Moussa Wague. The Cameroonian is 21. He\u2019s made three appearances this season. Bruno Fernandes has made our predicted starting XI squadsheet for Manchester United\u2019s set-to with Wolves, for whom new boy Daniel Podence is likely to be on the bench, while our man on the ground Jamie Jackson adds that United retain an interest in the 16-year-old Birmingham City midfielder Jude Bellingham but it is thought to be unlikely any deal will happen before the summer. Get yer squadsheets and preview here: More from Brighton, who certainly seem to have been working those carrier pigeons hard: Sky reports that they\u2019ve put in an offer for the Amiens striker Serhou Guirassy. The 23-year-old former France U20 international moved to Amiens from Cologne last summer, and it is understood the Seagulls have lodged a loan-with-option-to-buy bid. Busy week for Luke Matheson. Now for some practice on the M6 \u2026 Manchester United\u2019s first bid for Joshua King is understood to have been just north of the \u00a320m mark, an offer which Bournemouth felt was way off in terms of the kind of fee the striker would command. King, who is expected to return from a hamstring injury at the end of February, has 18 months to run on his contract and Bournemouth are understandably keen to hold on to a player that can play in a variety of roles, most notably on the left wing. Insert obligatory \u201cno-way Jos\u00e9\u201d headline here: Real Sociedad have confirmed \u201cthere will be no movement out of the squad\u201d today, and Spurs and Chelsea target Willian Jos\u00e9 will be staying put. A Molineux outgoing: Shrewsbury have used some of their FA Cup money to bring in the goalkeeper Harry Burgoyne from Wolves on a short-term contract until the end of the season. And staying in the lower divisions, with James Wilson\u2019s move to League Two, wonder how Aberdeen fans feel about becoming something of a nursery for Salford City (what with Adam Rooney last season), not that he\u2019s been on target much for the Dons. Just to confirm, there is now absolutely no chance Olivier Giroud leaves Chelsea today. Chelsea will keep him until the summer, even though he\u2019s barely played this season. Pretty much shows they won\u2019t be bringing in a forward before the window shuts. No Mertens or Cavani. Giroud latest: Busy and exciting times at Bramall Lane, as Chris Wilder lands the Dutch striker Richairo Zivkovic on a loan deal until the end of the season from the Chinese club Changchun Yatai. The Blades have an option to make the deal permanent in the summer. The 23-year-old has also played for Oostende, Ajax and Groningen. More from our Football League guru Ben Fisher: \u201cRochdale teenager Luke Matheson is completing a medical at Wolves, ahead of a \u00a31m move to the Premier League club. He will spend the rest of the season on loan at the League One club and return to Wolves in the summer, where he is likely to be given the opportunity to impress Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo. The 17-year-old right-back, who scored against Manchester United in September, became Rochdale\u2019s youngest ever player at 15 years and 336 days. Matheson, who has been at Dale since the age of eight, signed his first professional contract in October.\u201d Handy cash for the League One club, and they get to keep him as they battle the drop this term. Meanwhile, the mercurial/maddening/entertaining Aidan McGeady has joined Charlton on loan from Sunderland until the end of the season Thanks Gregg. And I greet you with reports that Brighton are on the verge of completing a signing of the attacking full-back Tariq Lamptey from Chelsea on a permanent deal. Meanwhile, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho speaks to Sky from a windy and bracing looking Spurs training ground, playing down suggestions of major activity in the closing hours. \u201cWe signed enough anyway,\u201d he says, adding of this week\u2019s arrival Steven Bergwijn, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a kid with amazing potential and one who the fans will learn how to love, but this is not a signing for the problems of today, but for the long-term, and for the way we want to play. He\u2019s ready to play [against Manchester City on Sunday] but we don\u2019t know whether to start or on the bench yet.\u201d Right, I\u2019m going to grab some lunch now, so I\u2019ll hand over to Tom Davies. He\u2019ll guide you through the afternoon. Thanks for your emails and tweets. Bye. Do you remember when James Wilson looked like he could be the next big thing at Manchester United? Well, he\u2019s just left Aberdeen and signed for Salford City on an 18-month deal. And they\u2019ve introduced him with some Balearic beats. It\u2019s all gone quiet out there. So I may as well fill this gap by telling you that only players signed before midday GMT can play this weekend, so any teams who do get deals over the line this afternoon or this evening will not have their new signing immediately available. Hello from Cobham. Olivier Giroud is here training with the main group. It doesn\u2019t seem he\u2019ll be going anywhere. Tottenham, Lazio and Inter were all interested in the striker, who is worried about his France place ahead of euro 2020, but Chelsea won\u2019t let him go without a replacement and they appear to have hit a dead end with Napoli\u2019s Dries Mertens. Will anyone beat Liverpool in the Premier League this season? The latest team to try are Southampton and their manager Ralph Hassenhutl doesn\u2019t seem too confident about his side\u2019s chances as they visit Anfield. He reckons the Saints have an element of the unexpected about them, though, and that is potentially one of their biggest strengths. Normal is that everybody expects us to lose there. Several teams have tried to win there in the last year, but all the games were lost by the away teams. It would be normal that we lose, but this season is everything is not normal for us. We are in a good shape, we have a few problems with injuries, but the squad is concentrating and working. We know about the difficulty of this challenge, but we need this challenge if you want to go to the next level in your development. We played against Chelsea, Leicester, all the teams away, and did a good job - so I want to see how far we are and how good we can compete against such a top team. The Belgian winger has returned to Atl\u00e9tico on loan until the end of the season with a view to a permanent move from Dalian Yifang \u2013 and he\u2019s already training with them. How about some lunchtime listening? Here\u2019s our latest Football Weekly Extra podcast, in which Max Rushden and the pod squad talk a lot about Liverpool doing what Liverpool do and discuss all things Canada. Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo has confirmed that Ryan Bennett is on his way to Leicester on loan. He\u2019ll have a medical at the Foxes\u2019 training ground this afternoon, where he has just arrived in his 4x4. We have enough players who can play in that position appreciate and thank Ryan Bennett for what he has done. If he goes on loan it\u2019s a situation he wants and we wish him all the best. We are working, it\u2019s a tough window to work but it\u2019s about rebalancing the squad. Here\u2019s a cracking photo. Was he trying to convince him to sign for City? Unless you\u2019ve been sleeping under a rock for the past four years, you may have noticed, there\u2019s another deadline looming today. With Brexit Day upon us Scott Murray remembers Wembley\u2019s Common Market Match in 1973, part of a festival celebrating the UK\u2019s entry into Europe in which not all went to plan: The biggest transfer story in Newcastle today is an, erm, non transfer. Steve Bruce has revealed his club had an offer accepted for a \u00a335m mystery player - almost certainly Lille\u2019s 20-year-old attacking midfielder Boubakary Soumare only for Mr X to reject the move. \u201cWe had a bid accepted that would have nearly got us to our record transfer eight days ago but, unfortunately, the player wanted to stay where he was,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cWe were active - we were really, really active and it didn\u2019t quite happen. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what we can do in the summer. \u201cWe were close to it (the club\u2019s record transfer) again, but couldn\u2019t get it over the line, which is a big disappointment to us. He was our number one target.\u201d While it is possible that Christian Atsu and Ki Sung-yueng could leave St James\u2019 Park this afternoon Bruce was not expecting any further additions after failing to prise Olivier Giroud on loan from Chelsea. It is understood he did not bid for Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen. He is though happy to have signed three loanees in Tottenham\u2019s Danny Rose \u201carguably as good a left back as any in England\u201d - Schalke\u2019s Nabil Bentaleb and Internazionale\u2019s Valentino Lazaro. Meanwhile, rumours that a \u00a3340m takeover funded by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Sovereign Wealth fund is imminent have receded and, currently at least, constitute another non story on Tyneside. Or at least that is what Bruce has discerned from his conversations with Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director.\u201dIf there was something to talk about and something to tell me, he\u2019ll tell me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a relationship with him that I think he would. At the moment all he\u2019s said is, \u2018there\u2019s nothing in it\u2019.\u201d Barcelona have signed Francisco Trinc\u00e3o from Braga. The 20-year-old has had to deal with the pressure of being called the \u201cnew Cristiano Ronaldo\u201d since bursting on to the scene in Portugal. He will head to the Camp Nou in the summer. when the pressure on him will no doubt increase. There\u2019s a done deal for a Hull City forward \u2026 but it\u2019s not Jarrod Bowen. The Poland winger Kamil Grosicki has joined West Brom from Hull for an undisclosed fee. The 31-year-old has been a lightning rod for criticism by Hull fans but he\u2019s scored six goals and made five assists this season and that\u2019s been sufficient to convince the promotion-chasing Baggies to make their move. Another Championship player on the move is Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Luke Steele, who has rejoined Millwall on loan. Here\u2019s our story on C\u00e9dric\u2019s move to Arsenal. He\u2019s got to be the most famous C\u00e9dric in England since Cedric Sneer was beamed on to British TV in the Raccoons in the 1980s. Aston Villa\u2019s new \u00a310m signing Mbwana Samatta will make history by becoming the first Tanzanian to play in the Premier League if, as expected, he starts for Aston Villa at Bournemouth. Emre Can is inching ever closer to a \u00a325m move to Dortmund. It\u2019s a good move for him isn\u2019t it? He\u2019ll earn significantly less but he needs to play. \u201cWould he have been a good fit for United\u2019s threadbare midfield?\u201d emails Jason Wilshaw. I think his Liverpool connections scuppered any hope of that one, Jason. For the avoidance of doubt there is absolutely nothing in rumours linking Gareth Bale with a MEGA SENSATIONAL return to Spurs. Sorry to disappoint, Spurs fans. And it still seems unlikely that they will be allowed to sign Olivier Giroud from Chelsea. January 2019 transfer window\u2019s Yannick Carrasco looks like he is on his way back to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, who he left in 2018 to trouser Chinese Super League cash at Dalian Yifang. Marca and AS are reporting that Carrasco, a versatile forward who scored for Atl\u00e9tico in the 2016 Champions League final against Real Madrid, has been drafted in by Diego Simeone\u2019s side after their bid to land Edinson Cavani from PSG fell through. Carrasco, 26, has not played a competitive game since CSL finished on 1 December and the outbreak of Coronavirus is causing concern for many imported players. Reports suggest Manchester United had expressed an interest but Carrasco would prefer to return to his former club. Sky are reporting that Ryan Bennett is on his way to Leicester to complete a loan move from Wolves. The Foxes have been a little light at centre-back since Harry Maguire left for Manchester United and the 29-year-old has been out of favour at Wolves this month. Start tracking flights from Bournemouth International to Manchester folks, because The Joshua King story is probably going to run and run today: Neil has just tweeted to ask what the latest loan news out of AFC Wimbledon is. Well, I do have some transfer news from Wimbledon, Neil, and it involves my colleague Andy Brassell. Cedric Soares, whose Saints contract ends this summer, has joined Arsenal. He\u2019ll offer competition at right-back for Hector Bellerin, whose injury record means it\u2019s wise to have experienced cover. Kyle Walker-Peters\u2019 move to the Saints on loan from Spurs, made the loan move possible. So, thank your Tottenham friends for that one, Gooners. Consider Benjamin Yeo underwhelmed: \u201cI think Josh King would be a vanilla signing. Few would be thrilled but he fits into Ole\u2019s fast counter so he makes sense. He would sort of fill a Rashford sized hole but what does he have other than pace and a United past? I\u2019d like to see Jovic but won\u2019t hold my breath.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been speaking to Sky Sports News about Manchester United\u2019s new \u00a346.5m midfield tempo man Bruno Fernandes. He\u2019s beaming: He\u2019s a guy who we have followed for a long time now and finally we struck a deal with Sporting. They were reluctant to let their best player go but now he\u2019s in through the door. We\u2019ve got him, he\u2019s happy. We\u2019re happy. Sporting are happy. It was an emotional farewell but we\u2019ve had a good few players from Sporting before. We have got first of all a fantastic human being and a genuine lad. He works hard, he\u2019s professional and hates losing. As a player he can do more or less everything. He\u2019s a box-to-box player with loads of energy. He scores goals, gets assists and you just look at his demeanour, his confidence, some of his skills will help us as a team. We can\u2019t put too much pressure on Bruno. He\u2019s coming into a new league, new country, new teammates. I\u2019m 100% sure we\u2019ll see loads of good football from him. Joshua King is the huge elephant in the room as Solskj\u00e6r says he\u2019s reluctant to talk about any more potential signings: There\u2019s so much speculation. I try to be polite and respectful. I\u2019m very happy with the club and how we\u2019ve conducted things. We stick to our beliefs and values. There\u2019s been a hold-up in Nathan Ferguson\u2019s \u00a34m move from West Brom to Crystal Palace. The highly rated right-back is out of contract at the end of the season and has told West Brom he will not sign a new deal but it remains to be seen if he joins Palace today. Right, time to catch up on the latest ins and outs across Europe with our transfer interactive. Sam Mcallum has signed for Norwich from Coventry for \u00a33.5m. The good news for Coventry fans is that he has been loaned straight back so you still have him at left-back. And in Italy, Fiorentina have signed Alfred Duncan from Sassuolo. The 26-year-old Ghana midfielder has joined on loan but he will join permanently in the summer for \u20ac15m. \u201cArsenal enquired about signing Olympiakos and Norway captain Omar Elabdellaoui but were put off by the price quoted,\u201d writes my colleague, Will Unwin. \u201cSo the Gunners went for the cheaper right-back option of Cedric Soares. Olympiakos were not keen to sell to the team they are playing in the Europa League, either.\u201d Steve Bruce has been talking ahead of Newcastle\u2019s match against Norwich. He confirmed that they have missed out on Olivier Giroud and one other unnamed player and it sounds like there will be no more business for Newcastle after Danny Rose\u2019s loan signing from Spurs. We had a bid eight days ago accepted by a club [for a midfielder] that would have been a near-club record but the player wanted to stay where he was. So, we\u2019ll have to wait until the summer. On Danny Rose, he said northern chip shops were a deciding factor in him leaving Tottenham, where perhaps the mushy peas were of inferior quality. Moving up north suited him, which makes a rare change. He\u2019s a northern lad, he\u2019s from Leeds, little things like [the chippies up north] make a big difference to him. Manchester United fans, what are your views on Josh King\u2019s potential move to Old Trafford? He has three goals in 18 Premier League games this season. He\u2019s also 28 so his sell-on value will decrease dramatically in the next couple of seasons. He is versatile, though, and Solskj\u00e6r knows him well and could potentially get the best out of him. Frank Lampard is desperate for a forward but Olivier Giroud is desperate to leave Chelsea. The word now is that Chelsea are willing to let Giroud go to Spurs if they can bring in Dries Mertens from Napoli. Lots of ifs - Napoli aren\u2019t keen on selling Mertens. Cedric Soares has passed medical at Arsenal and his loan move until the end of the season will be confirmed imminently. The Portuguese full-back is out of contract in the summer, but Arsenal have paid a loan fee. Southampton are not expecting to bring anyone in today, while youngsters Callum Slattery and Kayne Ramsay are heading on loan to De Graafschap and Shrewsbury respectively. Leicester hold an interest in Jannik Vestergaard but Saints value the defender at around \u00a318m. Leicester\u2019s pursuit of defensive cover is set to have an impact on Filip Benkovic, who is wanted on loan until the end of the season by Championship clubs Bristol City and Derby. A bit of news from Sheffield United, who broke their transfer record for midfielder Sander Berge last night. They are willing to let Ravel Morrison leave, with Middlesbrough favourites to sign him on a short-term deal. Morrison joined the blades in the summer having tried to get his career back on track at Ostersund. He has played in the Championship before, with QPR, Cardiff and Birmingham. He\u2019s 26 and has only just played over 100 professional games \u2013 he really needs some gametime. Edinson Cavani will stay at PSG for the remainder of the season after Atl\u00e9tico Madrid failed to reach a deal with the French club for a transfer in this window. The Uruguayan had been desperate to join up with Diego Simeone\u2019s team but will now join the La Liga side on a free in the summer instead. This is from our man in Manchester, Jamie Jackson, on Josh King. Bournemouth: \u201cJoshua King remains on Manchester United\u2019s radar. Unless Bournemouth can bring in another forward they may be reluctant to sell King given he is one of only three senior strikers there, along with Callum Wilson and Dominic Solanke. As always on transfer deadline day there could be developments.\u201d However, Eddie Howe sounded resigned to losing King in his press conference to preview their match with Aston Villa this weekend. Here\u2019s what he had to say: I\u2019m not going to deny anything you\u2019ve read [about Bournemouth rejecting a bid for King]. Who knows what\u2019s going to happen? Josh is much valued and loved by us and another club has obviously seen how good he is. Speaking as the manager, with a day to go, I would be very reluctant to lose a player of that quality [but] a lot of these things are out of my control. I love him as a player and person. I know what Manchester United means to him with his history with the club. He\u2019s a massive part of out team. He brings that unique pace and strength that he has. He can play an number of positions for us too. It sounds like it\u2019s just a matter of Manchester United increasing their bid for him. \u201cMorning Gregg,\u201d writes Matthew Turland. \u201cNottingham Forest are sitting relatively pretty in third at the moment. Obviously they\u2019ll have a complete meltdown in the coming weeks but what are the chances of Freeman/Atsu/Gayle/A.N.Other turning up at the City Ground to wear the Garibaldi red? Nuno Costa, Bong and Diakhaby (loan) have already arrived but I still reckon we need another striker to take the load off of Grabban. And I need something to take my mind off the impending collapse.\u201d Atsu looks the more likely of those I\u2019d say Matthew. And here\u2019s Darrien Bold bringing the deadline day honks: \u201cI might be late to the party on this one but I\u2019ve just spotted tenacious midfielder Vinny Samways tucking into a sandwich in a trendy Liverpool cafe as rumours of him bolstering Everton\u2019s flimsy midfield for a cool \u00a32m do the rounds. Keep up the good work!\u201d Erm, I\u2019ll keep an eye on that one Darrien. As Hull prepare to say farewell to Jarrod Bowen, they are primed to welcome Marcus Maddison from Peterborough United as his replacement. The former Gateshead winger, who has a \u00a32.5m buyout clause, is out of contract at the end of the season. Posh had accepted a bid this month from Charlton but the player failed to agree personal terms with Lee Bowyer\u2019s side. Milan fans are probably furiously Googling Wigan this morning to find out just where the hell it is. The reason being that the Latics full-back Antonee Robinson is reportedly on his way to Italy\u2019s fashion capital from the northern Mill town to complete a medical before making a \u00a310m move. Robinson joined Everton as an 11-year-old academy player and left for Wigan last summer. He\u2019s a USA inernational. It would certainly be one of the more intriguing deals this January. Bournemouth have turned down an approach from Manchester United for striker Joshua King, who previously worked with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r with United\u2019s reserves. Bournemouth paid Blackburn \u00a31m for the forward in 2015. Here\u2019s an interview with him from earlier this season: Couple of things happening in London early on. Firstly it looks like West Ham have agreed a fee - around \u00a322m - with Hull for Jarrod Bowen. The forward is set to have a medical today before a move to the Premier League. Secondly Chelsea are poised to lose Tariq Lamptey to Brighton. The right-back is out of contract at the end of the season and has rejected Chelsea\u2019s latest offer. Brighton still need to agree a fee with Chelsea, though. Good morning! It\u2019s here folks. Yes, it\u2019s that day they\u2019ve all been talking about. The deadline is finally upon us. At 11pm GMT the shutters will come down on \u2026 the January transfer window! Yes, transfer comings and goings in England, Spain and France will have to be completed by 11pm, in Germany by 5pm, in Italy by 7pm and in Scotland by midnight GMT. Curiously, in Portugal the deadline is 2 February and in Russia it\u2019s 22 February. We will be bringing you transfer news as we get it throughout the day and keep you updated on any team news before the weekend\u2019s matches as managers speak at their usual pre-match press conferences. The window\u2019s biggest headline-grabbing signing so far came at Manchester United on Thursday, where Bruno Fernandes finally checked in for \u00a346m. Andy Brassell has the lowdown on what United fans can expect from the midfield metronome. Sheffield United have just broken their transfer record with the signing of Sander Berge from Genk for a fee in excess of \u00a320m. The 21-year-old Norway midfielder has joined on a four-and-a-half-year deal. There are plenty of clubs who are still in the hunt for players as the deadline nears. Here are a few things to look out for: Chelsea will scramble for a forward \u2013 and Mertens and Cavani are targets Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n is a potential target for Manchester United Tottenham are leading race to sign Willian Jos\u00e9 from Sociedad Antonee Robinson may join Milan from Wigan Athletic Olivier Giroud could join Lazio after turning down Newcastle Newcastle are chasing Davie Selke from Schalke instead West Ham look to have pipped Crystal Palace to Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen Dortmund are the favourites to sign Juve\u2019s Emre Can for \u00a325m Spurs\u2019 Victor Wanyama is inching towards a move back to Celtic Here are the latest comings and goings in Europe: And for all of the latest ins and outs across the top five leagues in Europe, bookmark our snazzy transfer interactive. Clubs have spent \u00a3727.6m on players so far this January. Will there be more cash thrown around in a dramatic finale this evening?

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A new analysis, published in <a href=\"http://www.thelancet-press.com/embargo/coronavirusmodelling.pdf\">The Lancet</a> on Friday, estimated that as many as 75,800 people in Wuhan may have been infected as of 25 January and that several major Chinese cities might already have enough people infected to initiate local epidemics. \u201cIt is possible that epidemics could be already growing in multiple major Chinese cities, with a time lag of one to two weeks behind the Wuhan outbreak,\u201d said the lead author, Prof Joseph Wu of the University of Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>Evacuations of foreign nationals from Wuhan have been stepped up: a plane carrying more than 100 British and other EU nationals trapped in Wuhan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/britons-evacuation-flight-wuhan-coronavirus-tell-of-relief-confusion\">travelled to the UK</a> after Chinese spouses and partners were given permission to travel.

In other developments on Friday: The death toll increased to 258, with more than 11,000 cases confirmed in mainland China. The UK, Russia and Spain recorded their first cases. The US declared a public health emergency and announced it will temporarily bar entry for people traveling from China unless they are Americans or immediately related to US citizens.
